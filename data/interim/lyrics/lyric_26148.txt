Okay
Me and Wheezy, we met some hoes from Argentina and California
We was in a Bentley B, flowin' up the street, playin' one of our songs, yeah 
Said if I gave her a beep, now they fuckin' up VIP, tryna see if we goin' 
Been smokin' shit, loud, this noise 
Swervin' around in these toys 
Stack a lot of funds, diamonds on my thumb, make her pussy cum , yeah
Two hundred in a month, know she gettin' some, she suck it 'til it's numb , uh
We spend this shit for fun, Isabel Marant, Yves Saint Laurent , yeah
We smoke a lot of Runtz, high up to the sun, I could touch the sun 
We don't take lightly to niggas who chasin' the clout for a buzz 
These pussies don't talk to my niggas 'cause they know we get the business done 
We like some students, white chalkin' you niggas, and trust me, we gonna keep a grudge 
Swear to God that I'm goin' all out for my family, might pay a visit to your mom 
I got a hundred thousand in my pocket, lil' nigga, I got it out the swamp 
I just hope that you watchin', quit rockin' these watches, somebody'll plot and get you slumped 
Got my check up like Nike, my boxers Versace, and now my whole engine in the trunk 
I can make her my wifey and have her all icy and hire security like Trump 
I only trust you as far as I can spit, FN on my hip, can't nobody size me
Heard the young boy got clipped, should've watched his lip, I'm on that slime shit
She give me her pussy and lips, don't give me lip, so I gave her a diamond
I saw when she had a nip slip and it remind me
