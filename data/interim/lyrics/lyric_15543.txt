Hey, Donna
Yeah!
Listen up
First time I saw you
You were different than the rest
The way you walked into the room
The way you wore that dress
I did everything to impress you
Trying all my favorite lines
But you looked into my eyes and
Cut me down to size
Said you dont play for keeps
Then don't waste my time
Hey, Donna
Why you wanna do me like that
Why do me like that
Stole my heart and you won't give it back
Give it back
Donna
Donna
Donna
I can't take it no more
Took you out to dinn...
