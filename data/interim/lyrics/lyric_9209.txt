Soft and warm a quiet storm
Quiet as when flowers talk at break of dawn
Break of dawn
A power source of tender force generating
Radiating
Turn me on, turn them on
You short-circuit all my nerves
Promising electric things
You touch me and suddenly there's rainbow rings
Quiet storm
Blowin' through my life
Oh, quiet storm
Blowin' through my life
Oh, blow baby
Windy sigh
Weaken my
Butterfly caught up in a hurricane, hurricane
Lucky me, I'm better free
Suddenly I'm caught up in your somber rain
Shower me with your sweet love
I will bathe in every drop
Through all the seasons
Let it pour and never stop
Quiet storm
Blowin' through my life
Through my life
You're just like a quiet storm
Blowin' through my life
Shower me with your sweet love
I will bathe in every drop
Through all the seasons
Let it pour and never stop
Quiet storm
Blowin' through my life, through my life
You're just like a quiet storm
Blowin' through my life
Blow baby, blow, baby
