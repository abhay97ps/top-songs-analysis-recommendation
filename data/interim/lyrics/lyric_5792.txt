If you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose, my brothers?
If there was no day or night
Which would you prefer to be right?
How long have you hated your white teacher?
Who told you, you love your black preacher?
Do you respect your brother's woman friend?
And share with black folks not of kin
People must prove to the people
A better day is coming for you and for me
With just a little bit more education
And love for our nation
Would make a better society
Now some of us would rather cuss and make a fuss
Than to bring about a little trust
But we shall overcome, I believe, someday
If you'll only listen to what I have to say
And how long have you hated your white teacher?
Who told you, you love your black preacher?
Can you respect your brother's woman friend
And share with black folks not of kin?
I say now people must prove to the people
A better day is coming for you and for me
With just a little bit more education
And love for our nation
Would make a better society
And if you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose, my brothers?
If there was no day or night
Which would you prefer to be right?
And If you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose, my brothers?
If there was no day or night
Which would you prefer to be right?
If you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose, my brothers?
