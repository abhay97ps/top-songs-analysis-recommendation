Seems so strange
You're putting me through changes
Baby, I can't believe that you're the same
Sweet girl, that I once knew
Baby, the change has come about
And it don't look too good on you
It seems so strange
You're putting me through changes
Baby, you've started doin'
Things you should not be doin'
Livin' above your head, girl
You're comin' on way too strong
You're livin' above your head, girl
And something has got to go wrong
Baby, don't think that I don't know
You're runnin' out with other guys
Baby, though it hurts me so
You know that I'm still hypnotized
Don't let my pride
Kill all the love inside of me
Baby, you've started doin'
Things you should not be doin'
Well, livin' above your head, girl
You're comin' on way too strong
Yeah, you're livin' above your head, girl
And something has got to go wrong
Livin' above your head, girl
You're comin' on way too strong
You're livin' above your head, girl
And something has got to go wrong
With our love, with our love
Livin' above your head
Oh, livin' above your head
Oh, livin' above your head
Oh, livin' above your head
Oh, livin' above your head
Oh, livin' above your head
Oh, livin' above your head
