Just like a child
Got to set your heart to believing
But you don't even try
To let yourself believe
What you're feeling
So I'll hold out my hand
And I'll be your friend
You don't have to be mine
And I'll try and I'll try
And try it again
To get you to open your eyes
So little we see
Can show us where
We should be going
And with what we can feel
Is the only thing
Really worth knowing
Won't you breath the sunshine
Only let it be
Well, just turn around, see yourself
Know you're just like me
We gotta leave it all behind us
We got to live by different ways
We can't wait until tomorrow
I got to get it done today
So I'll hold out my hand
I'll be your friend
You don't have to be mine
Well, I'll try, try, try
Try, try it again
To get you to open your eyes
