I told you when I met you
I just couldn't give you
The love you needed
I told you I still loved him
And you couldn't thrill me
The way that he did
I said that he would always be
The only man in the world for me
But baby
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
The love you've shown me
Has made it so easy to forget about him
You made me see
I could live without him
When my heart was filled with sadness
How soothing it was having you to go to
The tender love you offered
Was something that I just couldn't say no to
From just a spark my love has grown
Now it burns for you alone
And I know
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
The love you've shown
Has made it so easy to forget about him
You came and led me
Out of darkness and into light
And I know baby
It's gonna be all right
