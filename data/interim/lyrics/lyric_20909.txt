I found a way to be everything I've dreamed of
And I know it's in me that I will become who I wanna be
And I finally found it
And I'm taking the long way out
'Cause it's gonna be 
Somethin' special to me
Somethin' special to me, yeah, yeah
Days go by 
And I grow stronger 
It takes time, but I'll never let go 
Days go by 
And I'll try harder 
To make it mine 
It's somethin' special to me
Somethin' special to me
Somethin' special to me, yeah
I've found  so many things I've dreamed of
And I know it's in me that I will become who I wanna be

'Cause it's gonna be 
Somethin' special to me
Somethin' special to me, yeah, yeah
Days go by 
And I grow stronger 
It takes time, but I'll never let go 
Days go by 
And I'll try harder 
To make it mine

More than I hoped for
More than I dreamed of
This is how it should be
More than I hoped for
