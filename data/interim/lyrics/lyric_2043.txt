He went away and you hung around
And bothered me, every night
And when I wouldn't go out with you
You said things that weren't very nice
My boyfriend's back and you're gonna be in trouble
You see him comin' better cut out on the double
You been spreading lies that I was untrue
So look out now cause he's comin' after you
He's been gone for such a long time
Now he's back and things'll be fine
You're gonna be sorry you were ever born
Cause he's kinda big and he's awful strong
(You're a big man now but he'll cut you down to size
My boyfriend's back he's gonna save my reputation
If I were you I'd take a permanent vacation
Yeah, my boyfriend's back
Look out now, yeah, my boyfriend's back
I could see him comin'
So you better get a runnin'
Alright now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My boyfriend's back now
Know he's comin' after you
Because he knows I've been true now...
