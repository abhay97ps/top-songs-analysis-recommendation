Every day I get in the queue 
To get on the bus that takes me to you 
I'm so nervous, I just sit and smile 
Your house is only another mile 
Thank you, driver, for getting me here 
You'll be an inspector, have no fear 
I don't want to cause no fuss 
But can I buy your Magic Bus? 
Nooooooooo!
I don't care how much I pay 
I want to drive my bus to my baby each day 
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it ... 
Thruppence and sixpence every day
Just to drive to my baby
Thruppence and sixpence each day
Because I drive my baby every way
Magic Bus, Magic Bus, Magic Bus
I said, now I've got my Magic Bus 
I said, now I've got my Magic Bus 
I drive my baby every way 
Each time I go a different way 
Magic Bus, Magic Bus, Magic Bus
Every day you'll see the dust 
As I drive my baby in my Magic Bus 
Magic Bus, Magic Bus, Magic Bus...
