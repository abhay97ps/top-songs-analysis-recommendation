Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary just you wait for me
The battle will soon be over
Oh Mary don't you weep
Jimmy sent a letter to his bride back home
For three long years now he's been gone
He left her cryin' on her wedding day
And went to fight the battle of the Blue and Gray
Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary just you wait for me
The war's gonna soon be over
Oh Mary don't you weep
Mary's young heart was filled with joy
When she got the letter from her soldier boy
His words of love made her heart beat fast
But little did she know it would be the last
Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary just you wait for me
The battle will soon be over
Oh Mary don't you weep
On that same day Atlanta burned down
Her soldier boy he fell to the ground
Now Mary sits alone by the candle light
And reads his letter over every night
Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary just you wait for me
The war's gonna soon be over
Oh Mary don't you weep
Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary just you wait for me
The battle's gonna soon be over
Oh Mary don't you weep
Oh Mary don't you weep
Oh Mary don't you weep
