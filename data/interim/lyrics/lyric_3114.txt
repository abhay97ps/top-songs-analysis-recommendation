Stuart-Clyde
What do you want with me?
Oh baby, can't you see
My love and I were happy
Before you came along
And it'll stay that way
'Cause I won't let her down
I love her, can't you see?
What do you want with me?
What do you want with me?
Oh baby, I can see
You only want to break us up
And use me for a while
Then you'll leave me cryin'
I've heard it all before
Your other boys have told me
What do you want with me?
The love I've got
Is something else again
She's loving, she's true
Let me tell you, she's not a bit like you
And I'm asking you a question
What do you want with me?
Why don't you let me be?
I know it would be easy
To fool around with you
But you should know by now
I've promised to be true
I love her can't you see
What do you want with me?
