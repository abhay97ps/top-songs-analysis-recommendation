Minus just a bit
Our love will never fit
You said, too bad
Our love won't reach it's peak
If there is the slightest break
You took the best that I had
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
Gotta have all of your love
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
A part of you just ain't enough
No, babe
Without one half percent
Our love is incomplete
That's how I knew
The last drop of your love
Should belong to only me
But your eyes is for real
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
Gotta have all of your love
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
A part of you just ain't enough
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
Gotta have all of your love
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
A part of you just ain't enough
Won't do, do, do....
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
Gotta have all of your love
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
A part of you just ain't enough
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
All of your love
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
A part of you just ain't enough
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
All of your love
Ninety-nine and a half won't do
A part of you just ain't enough
