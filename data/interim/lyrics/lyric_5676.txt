I can't hold it on the road
When you're sitting right beside me
And I'm drunk out of my mind
Merely from the fact
That you are here
And I have not been known
As the Saint of San Joaquin
And I'd just as soon right now
Pull on over to the
Side of the road to
Prove I'm not so mean
La da da da da...
July, you're a woman
More than anyone
I've ever known
And I can't hold my eyes on
The white line out before me
When your hand is on my collar
And you're talking in my ear
Why, I once ran around with
A gypsy girl named Shannon
A daughter of the devil
It is strange that I
Should mention that to you
I haven't thought of her for years
I can't hold it on the road
When you're sitting right beside me
And I'm drunk out of my mind
Merely from the fact
That you are here
And I have not been known
As the Saint of San Joaquin
But I'd just as soon right now
Pull on over to the
Side of the road to
Prove I'm not so mean
La da da da da...
