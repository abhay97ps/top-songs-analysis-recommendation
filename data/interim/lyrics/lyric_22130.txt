Oh my man, I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright
All right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away
When I know I'll come back
On my knees someday
For whatever my man is
I am his, forevermore
Oh my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright
All right!
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away
When I know I'll come back
On my knees someday
For whatever my man is
I am his forevermore!
