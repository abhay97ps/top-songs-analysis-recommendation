It seem like the realest niggas go through the worst shit
So they gotta, they gotta appreciate us when we try
'Cause most niggas don't even do that
Yeah, ayy, twenty
I done seen so much shit that I ain't supposed to say
I been winnin' so much, I been stackin' for the rain
Been around the block before, I done felt the worst pain
Extended clip 'cause I be high, I ain't gotta have aim
I ain't sittin' in no trap, you just waitin' to get raided
I had a dream I was rich and told my mama that we made it
From the age four to six, my mama cried every day
Moved to Memphis wit' my grandma 'cause her head wasn't straight
It's some shit that I can't tell you, but you see it in my face
Keep shit too a hundred, feel like everybody fake
I ain't loose like these niggas, you don't see me every day
I don't fuck wit' broke hoes, I swear most these bitches lame
Heard you made some lil' money and went broke on a chain
You gotta learn you alone, it's only you that feel the pain
My son get whatever, I'll be damned if I ain't able
Had choices as a kid, either new shoes or cable
We was nothin' from the jump, how the fuck I'm tryna' play you?
If I told you that I really cared about you, I'd be fakin'
Holdin' the wheel wit' two hands 'cause the juice tryna take me
I just blocked another bitch number, nigga, she was basic
This lean keep me cool, but when i stop it I be achin'
These bitches chase me, I be chasin' Ben Franklin
I'm the hardest nigga out, they tried to keep me in the basement
I'ma still have heavy sticks around when I make it
You won't catch me wit' a nigga if his name on a statement
I just bought an ounce of Sherbet just to roll up and face it
It's a tab on them features, lil' boy, you gotta pay me
Yeah
I'ma name this "Free Game", man
Hope you tap in and listen
It's a motherfuckin' vision
Hmm, yeah
