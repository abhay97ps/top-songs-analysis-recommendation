She's got everything she needs
She's an artist she don't look back
She's got everything she needs
She's an artist she don't look back
She can take the dark out of the nighttime
Paint the daytime black
You may start out standing
Probably steal her anything she sees
You can start out standing
Probably steal her anything she sees
But you'll wind up peaking through a keyhole
On your knees
She never stumbles
Got no place to fall
She never stumbles
Got no place to fall
She's nobody's child
The law can't touch her at all
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
For Halloween buy her a trumpet
For Christmas give her a drum
