Ladies and gentlemen 
The most beautiful girl in the world pagan 
Brought to you by  
Frankie J  
F-f-f-f-fresh
My swagger's like a dagger
I want it, I can have her
I pop up and I grab her like abracadabra
Body picture perfect like she's shaking it for my camera
She introduce Frankie while he moving forward and catch her
Everybody knows when I step in the club 
Girls see me and they wanna show me love 
I got my chain on, with my shades on
Rocking designer shoes and I sold a million
So many girls, but there's one that caught my eye 
Pretty lady so fine, she blew my mind
Oh why
'Cause she's the one for me
I've been around the world
And seen so many girls
But none can compare
'Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
She got a bill and a face like a supermodel
And a body built just like a Coke bottle
But none can compare
'Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, snap
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, bring it back
But none can compare
'Cause I can't keep my eyes off that girl
I think she knows that I'm tryna get at her 
I'mma go ahead and try to put in words
What's your name, what's your number, can I hit you up?
If you digging what I'm saying
Let me know what's up
So baby, let me know if I can take you home 
I just wanna be somewhere where we're alone, alone
Cause you're the one for me
I've been around the world 
And seen so many girls 
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
She got a bill and a face like a supermodel
And a body built just like a Coke bottle
But none can compare
'Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, snap
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, bring it back
But none can compare
'Cause I can't keep my eyes off that girl
Welcome to Miami
I've seen so many mammies
Over seas, the girls I've seen
But none compare to you baby
I've been around the world and back
And never seen a girl like that
Now it's clear to me that you're that girl for me
And then she looks at me
And then she says "if I ever had breakfast in bed"
Then I say "I'd rather have breakfast in Brazil instead"
Then she says "Stop playing, why you're messing with my head?"
Then I say "I'm not playing, I got a jet and we can check it"
Yes, I had you try find an energizer battery
Keep gone, she know she'll be sweating, loosing calories
You can be the best "B", I bet you couldn't handle me
With money on the bed and I can prove it on my salary
She got a bill and a face like a supermodel
And a body built just like a coke bottle
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
Shake it  Snap
Come on, come on, come on, come on baby
Shake it  bring it back
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, snap
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, bring it back
But none can compare
'Cause I can't keep my eyes off that girl
That girl
That girl
That girl
That, that, that, girl
Shawty, you're some exiting to look at
