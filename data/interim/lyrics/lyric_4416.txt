Spring in the air 
There's magic ev'rywhere
When you're young and in love
Life seems to be 
A world of fantasy
When you're young and in love
Each night seems just like the Fourth of July
When stars spangle the sky
The moon at night 
Seems to shine twice as bright
When you're young and in love
Ooh, dreams can come true 
If you believe they do
When you're young and in love
Though many teardrops are bound to fall
True love can conquer all
When you're, when you're young and in love
Ooh, ooh yeah
When you're young and in love
Though many teardrops are bound to fall
True love can conquer all
When you're, when you're young and in love
So in love
Oh, yeah
I feel so good
