Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
And brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know you've got to find a way
To bring back love here today
Father, father
There's no need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring back lovin' here today
Picket lines 
And picket signs 
Don't punish me 
With brutality 
Just talk to me 
So you can see
Ah, what's going on
What's going on
What's going on, yeah
What's going on
Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Who are they to judge us
Just because our hair is long?
You know we've got to find a way
To bring back understanding today
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ha
Ah-ah, ah-ah
You know we've got to find a way
To bring back some lovin' here today
Picket lines 
And picket signs 
Don't punish me 
With brutality 
Now just talk to me 
So you can see
What's going on
What's going on
Oh, what's going on
Tell me, what's going on?
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
Yeah, yeah
What's going on, yeah
You tell me, I'll tell you
You tell me, I'll tell you
What's going on, ah
Mother, mother
Father, father, yeah
What's going on
What's going on
I'll tell you what's going on
You tell me what's going on, ah
Father, father
There's too many of you dying...
