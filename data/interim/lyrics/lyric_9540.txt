This one will never sell
They'll never understand
I don't even sing it well
I try
But I just can't
But I sing it every night
And I fight to keep it in cause
This one's for you
This one's for you
I've done a hundred songs
From fantasies to lies
This one's so real for me
That I'm the one who cries
And I
Sing it every night
And I fight to hide the tears cause
This one's for you
This one's for you
This one's for you wherever you are
To say that nothing's been the same
Since we've been apart
This one's for all the love we once knew
Like everything else I have
This one's for you
Ohhhhh
I've got it all it seems
For all it means to me
But I sing of things I miss
And things that used to be
And I wonder ever night
If you might just miss me too
And I sing for you
I sing for you
This one's for you
Wherever I go
To say the things I should have said
Things that you should know
This one's to say that all I can do
Is hope that you will hear me sing
Cause this one's for you
This one's for you wherever you are
To say that nothing's been the same
Since we've been apart
This one's for all the love we once knew
Like everything else I have
This one's for you
