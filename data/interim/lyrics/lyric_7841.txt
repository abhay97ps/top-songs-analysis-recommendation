I’m sorry it’s been so long I apologize for the wait
Listen to this song till the very end trust me
Yuh
Aye
All they do is talk but they never back it up
They say you got no money and that you are broke as fuck
They say Gustie is a bitch they say gustie is a fake till I pull up to their house and I smack them with the rake
And I just     I Take their fucking body and I dump it in a lake
All these people out here really like to throw the hate
But I don’t care cause Ive been feeling like a great
Cause now that I’ve got money cause it’s served right on my plate
Yuh
Turn it up
Turn it up
Yuh
Aye
Yuh
Aye
Yuh
Aye
Yuh
Aye Aye
They can’t stop me now cause I’ve been cooking like a furnace and. They’re laying on the ground in my apartments getting furnished
These bitches think they clown me like I’m rapping at a circus
But I don’t fuck with money cause that shit it makes me nervous
I am at the top cause my numbers like my bank and I’m a rappin ass white boy with a super bowl ring and all they do is hate cause I’ve been doing all these things and I just snorted up some reaper I can really feel the zing
These people try and play me like im some sort of a game but I don’t fuck with you I don’t care bout the fame
And I’m helping all my fans becuz I put em right before me you if you fucking with my music I’m just hoping you support me
And When it come down to the end of my time I’m just hoping I will be the one to change all there minds
I do shit this for me and I do this shit for you and if you hate me you can go and spend a day in my shoes
And you can try and stop but it’s never gonna work cuz I’m the best fucking rapper who has stepped On your turf
Even if you do I’m gonna stand really tall cuz I’m the one who fucking balling like my last name is Paul
All you think is shit because your mind has plagued and then you try and go diss me while your holding a flag
Because you hardly seem to know but your quick to decide that I’m the best fucking rapper from the city of 5
They all just wanna use me for the money or the fame so we took a fucking picture and I cropped her out the frame
I was drowning in my sorrows till you pulled me right out and I don’t fuck with them bitches cuz they only want my clout
This is the end of the song but it’s the first one from the album if you really like this shit you can go and change the outcome
Go follow me on insta you just go and search Gustie I dont fuck with that bitch of her knees are looking disty
Sike
This the very last verse so I gotta make it count and my song plays our up i am finally getting clout
Im finally making moves and I am finally getting honeys and then people start to hate because I’m getting all this money
I’m happy with my life and with the point that I’m at and if you hate me you can go and take a swing with a bat
You can try and knock me out but it doesn’t really work cuz I’ve been rapping bout some shit that doesn’t seem to make em perk
I don’t want a record deal if we’re talking 50/50 i want money and enough to go and buy Palama christi
And I fucking hate this game because the people cannot cope with all the power and the money and the bitches and the dope
