Yeah, yeah
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
Lost a few friends chasin' hand money 
Had the same friends when I was bummy 
They should've went and did stand-up
'Cause when the money come, niggas act funny 
Crocodile wristband, 21 Dundee
Yo' bitch skate so fast to the dick
That she'd even go and get a job at Sonic 
Made it from the bottom, I'm a star 
Playin' with the stick like a guitar 
Why you got a 12 car garage? 
'Cause I bought six new cars 
I remember times was dark 
Now I'm backstage with a bar 
Couldn't pay the light bill, it was dark 
Now I can shine in the dark 
Lost a couple friends, I ain't even really mad though 
I ain't even really mad though 
Hard to tell the real from fake
'Cause nowadays, they got masks on
Who gon' be around when the fame and the cash gone?
I lost all my friends countin' bands in a Lambo truck
VVSs on me, fightin' icy like a hockey puck
If she wanna dance, let her dance, watch her pick it up
I don't need no friends, what's a friend if it ain't no trust?
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands and I copped a Benz
Pulled up with no army, just the guap and I'm spendin' it
No, no, never lendin' it, that's all for me
I stay greedy with the dollar, givin' no 'pologies
All these mans with they fuckin' hands out, tryna spare some
I don't never stress, no, I got plenty peso
I been all alone, on my own in my new mansion
Everybody says I went ghost, jump in my Phantom
Paparazzi always tryna press up on me
Ever since I blew up, I don't know nobody 
Yeah, I blew 80 bands only for you to leave
Hey, I know somewhere that my mama prayin' for me 
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe 
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth 
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my, I lost all my
Hey
