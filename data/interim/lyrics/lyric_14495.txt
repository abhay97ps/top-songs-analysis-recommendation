We went runnin'
Out where the stars are born
We came crashin' down in flames
I could be right
You could be wrong
We could be anything at all
But tonight at least I'm sure
I know this rain will pass
We need a reason to try again
I know this pain won't last
We can find those dreams again
I know
We went screamin'
Into the dead of night
We were kicking down the door
Now we can go back
We can go on
We can do anything we want
Anything we want and more
I know this rain will pass
We need a reason to try again
I know this pain won't last
We can find those dreams again
I know
We need a reason to smile again
I know
We need a reason to try again
I could be right
You could be wrong
We could be anything at all
But tonight at least I'm sure
I know this rain will pass
We need a reason to try again
I know this pain won't last
We can find those dreams again
I know
We need a reason to smile again
I know
We need a reason to try
I know
I know this rain will pass
We need a reason to try again
I know this pain won't last
We can find those dreams again
I know this rain will pass
We need a reason to try again
I know this pain won't last
We can find those dreams again
