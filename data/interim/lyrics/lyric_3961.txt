Doo doo doo doo doo
It's a world of fantasy
It's a world where I'm never alone
It's a world of sheer make-believe
Where all young lovers have gone
To set their hearts
Doo doo doo doo doo
It's a world of fantasy
I go there whenever I feel the need
To make life have a new face
No-one intrudes upon my privacy
To me it's the most wonderful place
Doo doo doo doo doo
It's a world of fantasy
Here is where no problems lie
And lovers we all become
We live with love and never cry
'Cause in love the sum is one plus one
So come on love and follow me
To my world 
Come my love 
Come to my world of fantasy, mm mm yeah 
Eee-ee
