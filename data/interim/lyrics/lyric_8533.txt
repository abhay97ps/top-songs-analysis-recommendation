You are a bad, bad missus
In them skin tight britches
Runnin' folks into ditches
Baby you're about to bust the stitches, yeah
Skin tight
Wow, skin tight
Go on, go on, go on
You are a real fine lady
Though your walk's a little shady
Step on the strip on time
There's money you're bound to find, yeah
Skin tight
Skin tight
Well, well
Foxy foxy lady
Skin tight
Go on, go on, go on with your bad self
Go on, girl
Walk that walk, talk that talk mama
Move that belly back, girl
Keep on steppin', baby
Lord, Lord
Doo doo doo doo doo
Well well well well well
Skin tight
Skin tight
Doo doo doo doo doo
Skin tight

Doo doo doo doo doo
Skin tight

Doo doo doo doo doo
