Yeah
It's hard for me to stop my heart
Love never knows
When the time is right
I don't want to hurt anybody
But can't help loving you 
I never felt like this before
I know this is passion worth waiting for
Let love take it's course
That's the only thing
For us to do, oh
We got time
Oh, baby, there's no rush
Gonna be a better day for us
Hang on
And I will wait for you
Our love will always
Stay as good as new
Time and tide
Nothing and no one
Can stop us now
For better for worse
This time I'm sure it's gonna last yeah yeah yeah
How can I stop my heart
Love never knows
When the time is right
Don't want to hurt anybody
Don't want to make them cry
Don't want to make them cry
We got time
Oh, baby, there's no rush 
Gonna be a better day for us 
Hang on 
And I will wait for you
Our love will always
Stay as good as new
Yeah, it's a matter of time
Only a matter of time
It's a matter of
Time and tide
Nothing and no one can stop us now
For better for worse
This time I'm sure
It's gonna last, gonna last forever
We got time
