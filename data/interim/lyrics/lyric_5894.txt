You
Are the color blue
As I'm looking through
At the magic mood
I
Don't know what to do
When I look at you
Are you looking too?
You
You don't want me to
Fall in love with you
What else can I do
I
When I think of you
Every time I do
All I see is blue
You
All I need is you
All I want is you
Don't you want me too?
You
If you want me to
Let me know it's true
I'm in love with you
You
Are the color blue
And I'm looking through
At the magic mood
