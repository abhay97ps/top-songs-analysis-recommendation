Got a little bit of Heaven
In this lonely world
Got a little bit of Heaven on Earth
When I'm with my girl
When shadows fall
She's waiting just for me
To kiss her lips
And love her tenderly
I'm such a lucky guy
I found a little angel
Such a lucky guy 'cause I
Got a little bit of Heaven
In this lonely world
Got a little bit of Heaven on Earth
When I'm with my girl
I got the stars
Oh, they're all in her eyes
She speaks my name
And I'm in paradise
I'm such a lucky guy
I found a little angel
Such a lucky guy 'cause I
Got a little bit of Heaven
In this lonely world
Got a little bit of Heaven on Earth
When I'm with my girl
Got a little bit of Heaven
In this lonely world
Got a little bit of Heaven on Earth
