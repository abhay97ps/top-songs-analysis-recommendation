They're tearing down the street
Where I grew up
Like pouring brandy
In a Dixie cup
They're paving concrete
On a part of me
No trial for killing off
A memory
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Can you find the Milky Way
Long Tall Sally and Tin Pan Alley
Have seen their dying day
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It'll never be the same
But we're all forgiven
We're only livin'
To leave the way we came
No sidewalk playground now
To meet my friends
They put a roadblock
At the rainbow's end
We're driving faster now
Than Orville flew
We leave our mark on
Every single thing we do
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It's the way the West was won
Amos and Andy and nickel candy
Have fallen to the gun
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It'll never be the same
But we're all forgiven
We're only livin'
To leave the way we came
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Can you find the Milky Way
Long Tall Sally and Tin Pan Alley
Have seen their dying day
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It'll never be the same
But we're all forgiven
We're only livin'
To leave the way we came
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It's the way the West was won
Amos and Andy and nickel candy
Have fallen to the gun
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It'll never be the same
But we're all forgiven
We're only livin'
To leave the way we came
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Can you find the Milky Way
Long Tall Sally and Tin Pan Alley
Have seen their dying day
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It'll never be the same
