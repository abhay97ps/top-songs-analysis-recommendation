Chorus:
 When the morning comes and you gotta get up
How you going to find your shoes
In an empty bed with an achin' head
You know its got to give you the blues
I don't know what's going on here
I know things are not all right
If you want me to I'll go dear
If you want I'll stay all night
I came here with my broken heart
Wrapped away with care
And all you do is sit and drink
And stare ---- at your T V
Chorus
You ask me why I came here
But you're the one who phoned
I wasn't very happy
But I did alright a lone
I thought you learned to love me
I guess you never will
The key's lost to the kingdom
And I don't have time to kill
Chorus
Instrumental: Verse
Chorus
So it's goodbye Carolina
So long Tennessee
California's callin'
And Chicago's good to me
My feet are in the stirrups
My pony wants run
Think I'll hit the highway
I guess your not the one
Chorus 2x
