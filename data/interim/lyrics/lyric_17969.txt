You don't touch me anymore
You never say the words I love you
You just sit behind your paper
Your silence cuts me like a razor
I'm gonna leave you...maybe someday soon
When I can give up this fight
But maybe not tonight
We don't talk much anymore
Not the same way we used to
Whenever I reach out to hold you
You turn away...what am I supposed to do
I'm gonna say goodbye
When the moment's right
Like an eagle I will fly
But maybe not tonight
Chorus: Can you just hold me
In your arms so deep
Wanna feel you breathing on my skin
We fell out of love
We can fall back in
You never look at me that way
You used to brush the hair back from my face
You used to make me feel like someone
You were my best friend, my one and only love
Just as I'm leaving you
You walk in the room
I see the flicker in your eyes
We say maybe not tonight
Repeat Chorus
Tag: You don't touch me anymore
You never say the words I love you
I love you
