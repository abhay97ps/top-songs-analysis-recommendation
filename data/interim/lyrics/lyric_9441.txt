Ooh, baby
Move closer to me
I've had all that I can stand
Take hold of me with your hands
Oh, baby
You give me the chills
Whisper low in my ear
Let me know how it feels
Just to know you are near
Your body gives me a thrill
As it leans against mine
I love how it feels
With your jeans against mine
B:  The smell of burning leather 
B: As we hold each other tight 
B: As our rivets rub together 
B: Flashing sparks into the night 
Re: At this moment of surrender, darling
Re: If you really care

Unzip that jacket
That leather smells so sweet
Put your chest against mine
Feel my heart beat
I love the way your belt fits
The way it hangs so low
So low on your hips, my darling
I want you so
Re: I love your sweet, sweet lips
F: I love your salty taste
Re: I love your finger tips
F: When I reach for your waist
Re: Uh-huh...

I will give my love forever
If you promise me you'll
Never never never touch me there
Don't touch me there
Please, don't
Oh no, not there
Anywhere but there
Never, don't ever!
Do you care?
Then, don't touch me there
