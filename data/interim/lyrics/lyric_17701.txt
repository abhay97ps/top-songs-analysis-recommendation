Yo Mya
I know you got a man and all
But uhh, I been watchin' y'all
And if he ain't treatin' you right
It's about time you move on
Now I'm not tryna get in between y'all two
But if you gon' move, move this way
I'm so confused
I don't know what to do 
But I gotta be a woman
I gotta get over you 
I think I saw your baby motha'
Creepin' at yo back door, hey, hey-ay
And yo lying ass been cheatin'
And I can't take it no more, oh oh
I'm movin' on
On 
On 
Oh-on 
I'll be movin' on 
On 
On 
Oh-on 
I'll be movin' on 
Whose drawers are these?
You know I wear a size 4 
And if you say that you've been faithful 
Who was at your back door?
You ain't got no money 
I should've left you long ago
And you stroke ain't strokin' no more 
So I've been sleepin all alone 
If ya know what I mean 
I'm movin' on
On 
On 
Oh-on 
I'll be movin' on 
I'm movin' on
On 
On 
Oh-on 
I'll be movin' on 
Well now I'm a No Limit Soldier
Known to keep it rowdy 
You know one's that make you say uhh
And "'bout it 'bout it"
Now one to the two
Two to the three
I ain't sayin' leave him
But you need to like roll wit me
Cause I can see you ain't happy here
When I look in your eyes
You a virgin, you gotta spread your wings
So now it's time to fly
You ain't ever gotta trip
Or remind me
I'm trying to live ghetto fab
Like takin' baths in bottles of Dom P
But I ain't perfect
Could you imagine me with no flaws?
It's like a parking lot with no cars
Cell block with no bars
World with no wars, L.A. with no stars 
Check this out, I can heal your broken heart
So don't be so fast to react so quick
Or get all mad and try to scratch up my 6
Now you know I get paid
For bustin' all kind of tight verses
But see, I need a girl that I can see on top
Like Silkk and Mya
Or vice versa
I'm movin' on
On 
On 
Oh-on 
I'll be movin' on 
On 
On
Oh-on 
I'll be movin' on 
On 
On
Movin' on
On 
On 
On 
On 
Movin' on
Let's go do somethin'
Get away from this ghetto
You know what I'm sayin'?
Get away from the spot
Take you away from all this
Just gimme a chance
Come on, come on, come on
Let's move on
