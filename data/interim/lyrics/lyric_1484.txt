Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how
Come on on safari with me
Early in the morning we'll be starting out
Some honeys will be coming along
We're loading up our Woody
With our boards inside
And heading out singing our song
Come on  baby wait and see 
Yes, I'm going to  take you surfing  with me
Come along  baby wait and see 
Yes, I'm going to  take you surfing  with me
Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how
Come on on safari with me
At Huntington and Malibu
They're shooting the pier
At Rincon they're walking the nose
We're going on safari to the islands this year
So if you're coming get ready to go
Come on  baby wait and see 
Yes, I'm going to  take you surfing  with me
Come along  baby wait and see 
Yes, I'm going to  take you surfing  with me
Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how
Come on on safari with me
They're angling in Laguna in Cerro Azul
They're kicking out in Doheny too
I tell you surfing's mighty wild
It's getting bigger every day
From Hawaii to the shores of Peru
Come on  baby wait and see 
Yes, I'm going to  take you surfing  with me
Come along  baby wait and see 
Yes, I'm going to  take you surfing  with me
Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how
Come on on safari with me
With me
Surfing Safari
