Our love, our love is like a triangle
Which one will have a broken heart
The memories, the memories we shared together
I can't believe you want us to part
When you said you loved me
I believed the words you said to me
Now the tears are fallin, who comes to comfort me
Who is it you love
Make up your mind
Don't torture me with kisses
When I know your love is blind
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
When you said you loved me
I believed the words you said to me
Now the tears are fallin, who comes to comfort me
Who is it you love
Make up your mind
Don't torture me with kisses
When I know your love is blind
