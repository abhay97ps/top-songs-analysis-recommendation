When I'm alone
And you're away
I just close my eyes
And I drift away
Your warm body
Is what I'm without
I just close my eyes
And I dream about
Pretty boys and pretty girls
Pretty boys and pretty girls
Pretty boys
Pretty girls
Strangers in the night
Exchanging glances
But sex is dangerous
I don't take my chances
The boys I meet
Say I look lonely
But I just walk on by
Because they're only
Pretty boys and pretty girls
Pretty boys and pretty girls
Pretty boys
Pretty girls
In this day and age
In a city full of fear
With you by my side
Together we can show we care
Spreading joy to the world
To every boy and every girl
Pretty boys and pretty girls
Pretty boys and pretty girls
Spreading joy
To the world
