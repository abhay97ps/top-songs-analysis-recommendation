Turn the music way down low
Let me see you in the glow
In the fire light you are shining....
Though it's much too soon to know
If this love I feel will grow
Let's take tonight to start out finding...
'Cause the way I feel tonight
Everything will be alright
I will keep your candle burning
Oh, yes, the way I feel tonight
Everything will be alright
And the way I feel tonight
I love you
Close the door and turn the key
Open up your heart to me
I can see your love light glowing
Let your body melt in mine
Let us taste each other's wine
'Til the cup is overflowing...
'Cause the way I feel tonight
Everything will be alright
I will keep your candle burning
Oh, yes, the way I feel tonight
Everything will be alright
And the way I feel tonight
I love you
Baby, I love you...
Baby, I love you...
