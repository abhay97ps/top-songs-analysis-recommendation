Ro-ro-ro-rock, then bend my knees
Every time the beat drop
Uh, uh, haha
Ro-ro-ro-rock, then bend my knees
Every time the beat drop
So-So Def!
You know pimpin' make the beat drop, fuckin' with a laptop
I make 'em do it do it, as soon as the beat drop
Might throw my towels out, like Nick, I like to wild out
I'ma stay in the game until I fall out
First, I lean grab a ball and then I pop wit it 
When they bring the mics, the crowd I rock wit it 
I never hittin' licks, tryna get it quick
When the songs come on they, like that's my shit
I can't help who I'm is, when they play my shh 
I just love to dance, every time the beat drop 
I love to wild out damn right, shake it all night
Hey, that's my jam, every time the beat drop
I said, ooh, all the ladies in the club grab a dude
And you work it real slow, you can do it
Move it, 'til you make him lose it
Ro-ro-ro-rock, then bend my knees
Every time the beat drop
He gon' be a fan, every time the beat drop
I know you used to seein' Mo laid back
So for the most part, you think I'm like that 
You about to get a glimpse of the fit
I'm givin' niggas on the floor, man
When I hit the door, man
'Cause I ain't one of these too boogie broads
Always in the club holding up the wall 
You about to get a taste of the way

I'm talking bout some that'll make you sweat
And when I talk well I'm through talking
I'm about to do some move some let you see somethin'
When I say get gutta, it's enough said
Do the bounce like you over on Bank head
And if anybody got a problem with the way you doin' you

I trick stats like candles and I blow that money 
I'm drunk off the goose so I throw that money 
I spendin' white T cash, yeah, that throwback money 
When I step off in this spot like I know that's money 
And my chain so styling, how colors diamonds you need, man?
