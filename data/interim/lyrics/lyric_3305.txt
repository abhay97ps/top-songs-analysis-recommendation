You asked me, do I love you?
That's a silly question...
Listen
If I didn't love you
Would I call every day?
If I didn't love you
Would I act this way?
So why do you ask:
Do I really love you?
When it's really so clear
Even strangers can see that I do...
If I didn't love you
Would I worry so?
Each and every moon
When you come and you go?
So just ask yourself:
Would I waste my time?
If I didn't love you
Would I hope and pray
You'd be mine..?
Oh baby, mmm honey
Oh, mmm, ooo baby
I've got to have you, honey
If I didn't love you
Would I miss you this much?
Put heart and soul to rot
Just for your touch?
Would I be a sling
And a fool for your charm?
If I didn't love you
Would I be right here in your arms?
Baby, if I didn't love you 
Sweety, if I didn't love you
