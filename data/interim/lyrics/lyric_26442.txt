Mama don't pray for my success anymore, yeah
But mama still prays for me
Seein' the world ain't really seein' the world
Through a window from A to B
Between alcohol and women and Adderall and adrenaline
I don't ever get no rest
Signed my life away to be the life of the party
Yeah, to everybody else
I look like a rockstar, in and out of cop cars
Livin' out a suitcase, trashin' hotel bars
If I see the sunrise, it's 'cause I stayed up all night
Drinkin' 'cause I need to, damn it, what a good life
Judgin' by my long hair, you might think I don't care
Sittin' here, sippin' and bitchin' about a spot where
Peoplе would kill to be, kill to be, kill to be
But y'all, it ain't as good as it seems, this livin' thе dream is
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
Another day, another venue
There's trouble to get into
And love ain't on the menu again
Lonely as an eagle
I meet a thousand people
Who think I got a thousand friends
Ooh
There's a stranger in the mirror
Ooh
But accordin' to the pictures
I'm a rockstar, in and out of cop cars
Livin' out a suitcase, trashin' hotel bars
If I see the sunrise, it's 'cause I stayed up all night
Drinkin' 'cause I need to, damn it, what a good life
Judgin' by my long hair, you might think I don't care
Sittin' here, sippin' and bitchin' about a spot where
People would kill to be, kill to be, kill to be
But y'all, it ain't as good as it seems, this livin' the dream is
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
Ooh
There's a stranger in the mirror
Ooh
But accordin' to the pictures
I'm a rockstar, in and out of cop cars
Livin' out a suitcase, trashin' hotel bars
If I see the sunrise, it's 'cause I stayed up all night
Drinkin' 'cause I need to, damn it, what a good life
Judgin' by my long hair, you might think I don't care
Sittin' here, sippin' and bitchin' about a spot where
People would kill to be, kill to be, kill to be
But y'all, it ain't as good as it seems, this livin' the dream is
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
