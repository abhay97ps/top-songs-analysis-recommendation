This is the remix 
Carly
I wanna smash your fears
And get drunken off your tears
Don't you share your smile with anyone else but me
I wanna touch your heart
I wanna crush it in my hands
Make you plead and cry as you give up all the lies
We're not lovers, but more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more cryin' to get me through
I'll keep dancin' 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you, over you,  over you
Stuck in a real bad dream
And, man, it feels so new to me
Should be in your arms, but I'm beggin' at your feet
It's been a real hard night
And I just hold my pillow tight
It won't love me back, no, it's not you and I
We're not lovers, but more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more cryin' 
To get me through 
I'll keep dancin' 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm gettin' over
Meditate and do my yog-er
Then I pull up to the club in a Rover
A CELINE bag on my shoulder
I said, rrrr, cock that revolver
Rrrr-rrrr, that's that nostal-ger
I said, I'm number one, I'm a son of a gun
And runner-up is what they called ya 
Ain't tryna be mean, but
I am the queen, yeah
Ain't fuckin' with no fuck boys
Get me, get me, shoulda got me then 
'Cause I would wear for real and you would rock pretend
Yo, can I get another dose of my oxygen? 
'Cause I been breathin' all this motherfuckin' toxin in
 Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you 
Tonight, I'm getting over you , over you
We're not lovers 
But more than friends 
Put a flame to every  single word you ever said 
No more cryin' 
To get me through 
I'll keep dancin'  'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight , I'm getting over you
