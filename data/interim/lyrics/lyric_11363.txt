Well I can't stop the music
I could stop it before
Now I don't want to hear it
Don't wanna hear it no more
No more
I can't stop the music
I could stop it before
Now I don't wanna hear it
Don't wanna hear it no more
All I wanna do is stop this game
It's gonna really end
Stop this game
It's such a touchy, touchy thing
Hey, livin' with you
Is all I wanted before
I've changed, you didn't
Don't wanna see you no more
All I wanna do is stop this game
It's gonna really end
Oh, stop this game
It's such a touchy, touchy thing
Well we were walkin' before we could crawl
And you were lovin' just emotion just all
It's just emotion wasn't music at all
Now I can't stop the music
Now I don't wanna hear it no more
No more, no more, no more
Stop this game
It's gonna really end
Stop this game
It's such a touchy, touchy thing
I can't stop the music 
I could stop it before 
Now I don't wanna hear it 
Don't wanna hear it no more
