Thank you, baby
For the years you've given me
For each beat of my heart
For every breath I breathe
Thank you, sweetie
For the best times of my life
Through the good, through the bad
You were always by my side
I never thought I'd meet someone
Who loves unselfishly
But I appreciate the way you loved
And sacrificed for me
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
Thank you, lady
For the joy you bring to life
When I thought all was lost and gone
You brought hope back in sight
Thank you, honey
For being my best friend
When I thought no one understood
You would always understand
I used to think that I knew love
And what true love would mean
Now I know that I didn't know much
'Cause you taught me everything
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
Oh, God so loved the world
That He blessed us all with you
And then he gave me a heart
Now I'm giving it to you, baby
And these tears I cry are tears of joy
My happiness, I do rejoice
In the love you give unselfishly
Your constant sacrifice for me
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
I can't hold back these tears
