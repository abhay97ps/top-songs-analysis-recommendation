You keep saying
I’m creeping
And I keep explaining for no reason
Cause I’m not cheating
But I’m thinking
Since I go through
What’s the difference if I do, babe?
What can I say?
You don’t believe me anyway
I should just cheat on you
What 
Can I do? 
Girl, you keep accusing me
I should just cheat on you
You keep saying you love me
But save it, baby
You don’t trust me
Caught you checking my pager
If I was cheating
I would have erased it
Must everywhere you go be on the down low?
If you wasn't creeping
Tell me why
If I told you
You’d say it was untrue
I keep denying
Sick of trying
Maybe I should lie to you
I should just
I should just cheat on you
I should just
I should just cheat on you
I should just
I should just cheat on you
What you gon’, gon’, gon’ do?
Please, please, please
How you gonna play me?
Now you gonna make me cheat, cheat, cheat
Got me going crazy
I thought I was your baby
Please, please, please
Cheat, cheat, cheat
Got me going crazy
I thought I was your baby
What can I say?
