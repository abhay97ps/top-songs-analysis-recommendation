Got somethin' for you darlin'
That you never never had
Well somethin' for you darlin'
That you've never never had
I got a lotta
Good lovin', good lovin'
Make me feel so bad
Give somethin' to me baby
When you know you're fine
Give somethin' to me baby
Just a little bit of time
Some of your
Good lovin, good lovin'
Make me feel so fine
Oh

A whole lotta huggin'
You're nothin' but a lover
Baby I need
Your good lovin'
Got somethin' for you baby

Got somethin' for you baby
Come on treat me right
Some of your
Good lovin', good lovin'

True fine lovin'
A whole lotta huggin'
You're nothin' but a lover
Oh baby I need
Your good lovin'
Got somethin' for you baby

Got somethin' for you baby

I gotta lotta
Good lovin', good lovin'
Make me feel so bad

A whole lotta lovin'
