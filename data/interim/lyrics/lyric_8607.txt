Saturday night at the corner caf√©
Had me some drinks and I'm feelin' my way
Moon's on the rise and it looks like a night for romance
Shufflin' down past the local hotel
Doin' the rounds like I'm under a spell
Must be the place, yes, I knew when she asked me to dance
I'm on easy, Easy Street
I'm on easy, Easy Street
Seein' as how I'm a regular guy
Watchin' the girls of the evening go by
Got me a chance so I'm takin' it, makin' it last
I'm on easy, Easy Street
I'm on easy, Easy Street
So if you're feelin' like you're a lonely man
And whenever you are down and need a gentle hand
There's always Easy Street, you know you got it planned
But just remember boy, it's only a one night stand
That's all
Think I'll make it anyway
That's where it's at
Easy Street, USA
