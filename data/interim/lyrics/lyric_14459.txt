Mmm la la, yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh
Hey, hey
That young boy without a name
Anywhere I'd know his face
In this city, the kid's my favorite
I've seen him, seen him
I see him every day
I've seen him run outside
Looking for a place to hide
From his father, the kid half-naked
And I said to myself
"Oh, what's the matter here?"
I'm tired of the excuses everybody uses
He's their kid, I stay out of it
But who gave you the right to do this?
We live on Morgan Street
Just ten feet between and his mother
I never see her, but her screams and cussing
I hear them every day
Threats like, "If you don't mind
I will beat on your behind
Slap you
Slap you silly," made me say, "Hey, hey, hey
Oh, what's the matter here?"
I'm tired of the excuses everybody uses
He's your kid, do as you see as you see fit
But get this through that I don't approve
Of what you did  to your own flesh and blood
I have heard the excuses everybody uses
He's your kid, do as you see fit
But get this through that I don't approve
Of what you did to your own flesh and blood
"If you don't sit in your chair straight
I'll take this belt from around my waist
And don't you think that I won't use it!"
Answer me and take your time
What could be the awful crime
He could do at so young an age?
If I'm the only witness to your madness
Offer me some words to balance out
What I see and what I hear
All these cold and rude things that you do
I suppose you do because he belongs to you
And instead of love and the feel of warmth
You've given him these cuts and sores
That don't heal with time or with age
And I want
To say yeah
Want to say hey, hey, hey, yeah
"What's the matter here?"
But I don't dare say hey, hey, yeah
"What's the matter here?"
But I don't dare say hey, hey
