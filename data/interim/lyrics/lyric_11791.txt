We had the right love
At the wrong time
Guess I always knew inside
I wouldn't have you for a long time
Those dreams of yours
Are shining on distant shores
And if they're calling you away
I have no right to make you stay
But somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter when
But somewhere down the road
I know the heart of yours
Will come to see
That you belong to me
Sometimes goodbyes are not forever
It doesn't matter if you're gone
I still believe in us together
I understand more than you think I can
You have to go out on your own
So you can find your way back home
And somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter where
But somewhere down the road
I know that heart of yours
Will come to see
That you belong with me
Letting go is just another way to say
I'll always love you so
We had the right love at the wrong time
Maybe we've only just begun
Maybe the best is yet to come
Cause somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter where
But somewhere down the road
I know that heart of yours
Will come to see
That you belong with me
