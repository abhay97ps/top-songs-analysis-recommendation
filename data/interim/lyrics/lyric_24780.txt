Huncho, woo
What time it is? Eleven o'clock?
Let's roll
Flyin' autopilot , don't need no stylist 
Trappin' while I'm drivin' , park it on the island 
Stiff arm, Heisman , singin' birds, Isleys 
I didn't graduate, but I know chemistry and science 
Park it, park it, park it 
Heard that everybody know we workin' 
Young nigga still murk it 
Young nigga whip the birdie 
Ooh watch 'em movin' 
Ooh, shake 'em out the shoes 
Ooh, VVS jewels, GI Jew, nigga what it do? yeah
Probably think it's outlandish 
But my business too fancy 
Ooh, sweet like candy 
Yeah, jumpin' off Banshees 
TEC with the coolant, can't handle it 
TEC with the coolant, can't handle it 
TEC with the coolant, can't handle it 
Young nigga trap dismantlin' 
That's that secret sauce 
Huncho be's the boss 
Huncho pissed 'em off 
Huncho freezed 'em all 
I bought a bitch that bag 
Told her pull up with no drawers 
Young nigga from the Nawf 
Put in her goddamn mouth, yeah 
Run in the goddamn house 
Sticks on the motherfuckin' couch 
Bricks in the wall and the aisle 
Clean it up, clean it up now 
Chopper ring, drumline, Nick Cannon 
Hundred racks in the Gucci fanny 
12 behind me in a Pontiac, damn it 
Skrrt skrrt skrrt, ram it
Bro sayin', bust 'em, nigga, don't jam it 
Nigga pull up lookin' just like mechanics 
Plug lingo, he talkin' in Spanish 
Wrap 'em and put 'em through traffic 
Nigga won't catch me lackin' 
Pull up and catch him in traffic 
Pull up and park it at Magic 
Hitman, paid the assassin
Flyin' autopilot , don't need no stylist 
Trappin' while I'm drivin' , park it on the island 
Stiffarm, Heisman , singin' birds, Isleys 
I didn't graduate, but I know chemistry and science 
Park it, park it, park it 
Heard that everybody know we workin' 
Young nigga still murk it 
Young nigga whip the birdie 
Ooh watch 'em movin' 
Ooh, shake 'em out the shoes 
Ooh, VVS jewels, GI Jew, nigga what it do? yeah
Ooh, shake him out his shoes
When it come to the gang, gang we can't lose 
If it is not 'bout them benjamins then I refuse 
To ever have a conversation 
Hotboxin', there's no ventilation 
Sippin' on drank and I snooze 
Prescription is my medication 
Forget all your fears and face it 
Pick up that cup and taste it 
I break the heart on a bitch like I'm breakin' a brick
But later in life she'll thank me 
Cookin' 'em over the stovetop
Grabbin' that pot, I was anxious 
I left my sack for them old knots 
We call 'em old, they ancient 
They put a warning sign up at my shows
'Cause we the group that's dangerous 
I'm a big dog, Bingo
Them niggas my niggas still walkin' 'round stainless 
Don't think just 'cause niggas movin' silent that my niggas won't get violent
Need no stylist for my styling, on the private, autopilot 
Flyin' autopilot , don't need no stylist 
Trappin' while I'm drivin' , park it on the island 
Stiffarm, Heisman , singin' birds, Isleys 
I didn't graduate, but I know chemistry and science 
Park it, park it, park it 
Heard that everybody know we workin' 
Young nigga still murk it 
Young nigga whip the birdie 
Ooh watch 'em movin' 
Ooh, shake 'em out the shoes 
Ooh, VVS jewels, GI Jew, nigga what it do? yeah
Two-tone Patek , yeah, two-tone baddies 
Five hundred racks in the attic 
Two-two-three, the fifty made of plastic 
Eating up the drip like cabbage 
Lost his brain when I put him on acid 
You niggas lame, tryna copy my habits 
The whole gang havin' stains, havin' karats 
Birds singin' like Barry 
Skeletons singin' like Mary 
Say what I say, you a parrot 
I got riches and don't even wear it 
Take a nigga bitch like a hostage here 
The bitch got excited by the lobster suit 
We pop the Glock like a rasta do 
Old niggas call me big dawg and salute 
I sneeze, the racks achoo 
When I peep, I'm quick to buy you 
Got you sick when I sleep with your boo 
I could pool to make mils out the booth 
I got water, let's take us a cruise 
Get the pot then I give 'em the blues 
Your neck is not wet, it is fu 
Bitch catch a play in the Uber 
Flyin' autopilot , don't need no stylist 
Trappin' while I'm drivin' , park it on the island 
Stiffarm, Heisman , singin' birds, Isleys 
I didn't graduate, but I know chemistry and science 
Park it, park it, park it 
Heard that everybody know we workin' 
Young nigga still murk it 
Young nigga whip the birdie 
Ooh watch 'em movin' 
Ooh, shake 'em out the shoes 
Ooh, VVS jewels, GI Jew, nigga what it do? yeah
