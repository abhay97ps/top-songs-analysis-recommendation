I have looked all over the place
But you have got my favorite face
Your eyelashes sparkle like gilded grass
And your lips are sweet and slippery
Like a cherub's bare wet ass
'Cause you're a human supernova
A solar superman
You're an angel with wings of fire
A flying, giant friction blast
You walk in clouds of glitter
And the sun reflects your eyes
And every time the wind blows
I can smell you in the sky
Your kisses are as wicked as an M-16
And you fuck like a volcano
And you're everything to me
'Cause you're a human supernova
A solar superman
You're an angel with wings of fire
A flying, giant friction blast
'Cause you're a human supernova
A solar superman
You're an angel with wings of fire
A flying, giant friction blast
