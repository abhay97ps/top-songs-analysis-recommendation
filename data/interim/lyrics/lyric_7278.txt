I've told you almost ev'ry bedtime story
And you've heard almost ev'ry nursery rhyme
So, tonight before you go to sleep
And pray the Lord your soul to keep
Here's mommy's favorite story one more time
Once upon a time there was a castle
And in this castle lived a King and Queen
And it came to pass, they were both were blessed
By one little blue-eyed princess
With the softest golden curls you've ever seen
But then one day, he met this pretty lady
And she had lots of pretty words to say
And this part makes your mommy sad
'Cause,oh, what big eyes she had
And she took his hand and led him far away
Still, it's just another bedtime story
But tellin' it brings teardrops to my eyes
Just another pretty bedtime story
So, please forgive mommy if she cries
Then it came to pass, the King grew lonely
And the pretty lady wasn't all she seemed
He realized that he was wrong
And started his long journey home
For he misses little Princess and his Queen
Then he was back and safe inside his castle
And tears of joy came pourin' down like rain
Then the castle rang with laughter
They lived happy ever after
Knowin' he would never leave again
Still, it's just another bedtime story
But tellin' it brings teardrops to my eyes
Just another pretty bedtime story
So, please forgive mommy if she cries
Won't you please forgive your mommy
If she cries
