Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah 
And stack my change up and go see the jeweler 
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
All I ever had was the cocaine 
My cousin Leeroy was the dope man
And GT switchin' four lanes 
On the stove whip the coke up like propane 
On the block where the shots go "bang!" 
Only real niggas really gon' hang 
All my life, you was saved by the bell
I was saved by the cocaine, ayy!
Young boys with choppers, young boys with lawyers 
We stand in the kitchen and whip out that work 
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah 
And stack my change up and go see the jeweler 
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah 
And stack my change up and go see the jeweler 
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
Got the trap house bumpin' 
First in the month where the kids run 
Got the whole block jumping on fire
Name on ring when I come through 
Addicted to moolah, no favors 
This feel like a hell of a day bro 
I'm falling in love with that coco 
This shit is runnin' my veins and my whole soul 
Got the whole block in a choke hold 
Middle finger to the po-po 
Cool is so coola, addicted to moolah 
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah 
And stack my change up and go see the jeweler 
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah 
And stack my change up and go see the jeweler 
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
We been standin' on the corner, ayy
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah 
Just to get that moolah
Just to see that moolah
Standin' on the corner
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
Just to get that moolah
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
We been standin' on the corner, ayy
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah 
Just to get that moolah
And stack my change up and go see the jeweler 
Standin' on the corner
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
Just to get that moolah
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah 
And stack my change up and go see the jeweler 
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
All my life I hustled just to get that moolah 
And stack my change up and go see the jeweler 
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
Standin' in the kitchen 'n whip up that work 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
