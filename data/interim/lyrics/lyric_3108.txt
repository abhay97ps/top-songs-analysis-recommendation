It's got the whole world shaking
Something must be going on
It's got the whole world shaking
Something must be going on
That's what I say
It's got that soul in it baby
You can't meet that beat alone
It's got the whole world shaking
And I'm talking 'bout that beat, alright
It's got the whole world shaking
And I'm talking 'bout that beat, that's what I say
It's got that soul in it baby
You can't help but pat your feet
Makes you wiggle
Makes you move
Puts your body
In the groove
You want to holler
You want to shout
Makes you wanna
Work it all out
It's got the whole shaking
From New York to old Hong Kong
It's got the whole shaking
From New York to old Hong Kong
It's got that soul in it baby
You can't meet that beat alone
