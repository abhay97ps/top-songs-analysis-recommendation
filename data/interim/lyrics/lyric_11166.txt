Love and loneliness
You used to think that love was worth the time
When love was all we had
We didn't need distraction all the time
Or being made to laugh
And then you said we had to build a home
And love alone could not provide
Oh-oh-oh, you said that money would never get us down
You didn't know you lied
Now loneliness is there despite the love we make
Oh, and loneliness knows where to find the friends we make
And the place we live is just a new street number
On an old address called love and loneliness
I sometimes wonder how you see us now
I'd read your mind if I had the chance
Oh-oh-oh, I don't know if I'd ever find our love in there
Or just old photographs
And now loneliness is there despite the love we make
Oh,  and loneliness knows where to find the friends we make
And your friends call 'round and they act amazed
You show them 'round and they stand and praise
The life we live that's just a new street number
On an old address called love and loneliness
Love and loneliness
Love and loneliness
Love and loneliness
Love and loneliness
Love and loneliness
Love and loneliness
Love and loneliness
Love and loneliness
Love and loneliness
