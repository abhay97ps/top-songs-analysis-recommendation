I don't wanna cause
Any trouble in town
I don't want it
I just want you to know
That I'm around if you need me
If you've been left all alone
You can just pick up the phone
And dial up L-O-V-E
Baby, you can call on me
I know there's things that I might say
That might get in the way
But that's not what I wanted to do
I just wanna get next to you
I don't wanna bring you down
I just wanna be around
Nobody will know wherever we go
Whatever we do or see
Your secret's safe with me
I won't talk about it
I won't talk about it
I won't talk about it
I won't talk about it
I won't talk about it
I won't talk about it...
