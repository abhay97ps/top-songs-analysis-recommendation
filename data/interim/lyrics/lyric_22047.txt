Mama said, "get your ass out of bed", I said, "hell to the no"
Said wash your grandma's nasty hair, I said "hell to the no"
They tried to take away my tots, I said, "hell to the no"
Yeah, 'cause I'm the one that calls the shots and I say, "hell to the no"
Oh oh, try  to make me change my weave 
 Well, I got something up my sleeve
It's a whole lotta
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
I said
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
I'm not trying to diva out
But this shows gotta stop so shout
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
Tell me I should eat my Wheaties, you know what
Hell to the no 
Tell me I'll come down with diabetes
Hell to the no 
Try  to make me change my eats 
But baby that just isn't me
I'm a whole lot of
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
I said
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
I'm not trying to diva out
But this shows gotta stop so shout
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
No, no, no, no
 Take me you can leave me but  I won't ever change
 If you don't like the rules  don't play my game!
 Time for me to get  R-E-S-P-E-C-T,  but if I don't, it's all in me 
Heeeeyyeeeeyeeeeaah!
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
I said
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
I'm not trying to diva out
But this shows gotta stop so shout
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
I'm not trying to diva out
But this shows gotta stop so shout
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
Aw, hell to the no...
