Well, Saturday night at eight o'clock
I know where I'm gonna go
I'm a-gonna pick my baby up
And take her to the picture show
Everybody in the neighborhood
Is dressing up to be there, too
And we're gonna have a ball
Just like we always do
Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're hugging with your baby
Last row in the balcony?
Well, there's Technicolor and Cinemascope
A cast out of Hollywood
And the popcorn from the candy stand
Makes it all seem twice as good
There's always lots of pretty girls
With figures they don't try to hide
But they never can compare
To the girl sitting by my side
Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're hugging with your baby
Last row in the balcony?
Oh, Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're hugging with your baby
Last row in the balcony?
Whoa, Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're hugging with your baby
Last row in the balcony?
Yeah, Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what...
