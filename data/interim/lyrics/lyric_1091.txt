I never knew what love could do
I've changed so much since I kissed you
The crazy things I say and do
It’s all because of my love for you
I never know if it's rain or shine
I never even know the time
My friends all think I've lost my mind
It’s all because you are just my kind
I never miss a sunset's glow
I check the time at the drive-in show
So we can go where the lovers go
It's all because you love me so

I lost my well-known appetite
I lost my heart and it feels so right
I'd lose my head if it weren't on tight
It's all because you kissed me last night
It's all because, It's all because, it’s all because
