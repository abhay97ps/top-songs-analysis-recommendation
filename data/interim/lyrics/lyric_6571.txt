I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
I'm so used to doing everything with you
Planning everything for two
And now that we're through
I just don't know what to do with my time
I'm so lonesome for you
It's a crime
Going to a movie only makes me sad 
Parties make me feel as bad 
When I'm not with you
I just don't know what to do
Like a summer rose
Needs the sun and the rain
I need your sweet love  to beat  all the pain
I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
Baby, if your new love ever turns you down 
Come on back
I will be around 
Just waiting for you
I don't know what else to do
I don't know what else to do
I just don't know what to do with myself
No, no, I just don't know what to do
Hey, I just don't know what to do with myself
No, no, no, I just don't know what to do
Hey, I just don't know what to do with myself
No, No
