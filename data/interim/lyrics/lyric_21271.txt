Got a call last night from an old friend's wife
Said I hate to bother you
Johnny Ray fell off the wagon
He's been gone all afternoon
I know my buddy so I drove to Skully's
And found him at the bar
I say hey man, what's going on
He said I don't know where to start
Sarah's old car's about to fall apart
And the washer quit last week
We had to put momma in the nursing home
And the baby's cutting teeth
I didn't get much work this week
And I got bills to pay
I said I know this ain't what you wanna hear
But it's what I'm gonna say
Sounds like life to me it ain't no fantasy
It's just a common case of everyday reality
Man I know it's tough but you gotta suck it up
To hear you talk you're caught up in some tragedy
It sounds like life to me
Well his face turned red and he shook his head
He said you don't understand
Three kids and a wife depend on me
And I'm just one man
To top it off I just found out
That Sarah's 2 months late
I said hey bartender set us up a round
We need to celebrate
Sounds like life to me plain old destiny
Yeah the only thing for certain is uncertainty
You gotta hold on tight just enjoy the ride
Get used to all this unpredictability
Sounds like life
Man I know its tough but you gotta suck it up
To hear you talk you're caught up in some tragedy
Sounds like life to me
Sounds like life
