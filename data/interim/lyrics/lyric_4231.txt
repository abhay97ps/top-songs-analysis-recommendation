Walk with faith in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
For with faith in your heart
The world is your own
You never will grieve
If in him, you believe and
Walk with faith in your heart
When the dreams that you dream
Seem to disappear from view
That's the time to fight on
And soon they'll all come true
He'll lighten your load
As you travel life's road
So walk with faith in your heart
Whenever you have troubles
Just reach out for his hand
He's by your side
Your constant guide
And quick to understand
You will find happiness
If you let him be your friend
And you'll find that success
Is just around the bend
He won't let you down
Wear a smile, not a frown
And walk with faith in your heart
You will find happiness
If you let him be your friend
And you'll find that success
Is just around the bend
He won't let you down
Wear a smile, not a frown
And walk with faith in your heart
In your heart
