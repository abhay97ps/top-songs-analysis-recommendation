As she drives through the town
Where she once played around
In these streets
Oh, memories are what's left here
Little note on her bed
Just some words that leave it all unsaid
Oh, Mama, don't you cry
Hey, Papa, don't ask why
Love cries, love burns
Love drives you to the point of no return
Love lies, love burns
Love drives you to the point of no return
Restless boy took her heart
Like a toy, he tore it all apart
In her mind, well, she'll never love again
With the wind in her hair
She stops and says a little prayer
Oh, Mama, don't you cry
Hey, Papa, don't ask why
Love cries, love burns
Love drives you to the point of no return
Love lies, love burns
Love drives you to the point of no return
Under a purple sky
She turns her head
And says goodbye
Ooh, love cries, love burns
Love drives you to the point of no return
Love lies
Love burns
Love drives you to the point of no return
Oh, yeah
Love cries
Love burns
Love drives you to the point of no return
Hey, hey, hey, hey, love lies
Love burns
Love drives you to the point of no return
