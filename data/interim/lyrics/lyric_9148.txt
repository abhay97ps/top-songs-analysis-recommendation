We went out to dinner
Boy, what an appetite
We just couldn't stop eating
We stayed up most of the night
And after three or four hours
Our stomachs began to hurt
But everything tasted so good
We didn't stop until after dessert
Ooh la la, breakfast for two
Ooh la la, you got me and I got you
I've eaten in Italy
Yes, I've eaten in Spain
I must admit I'd be licking my lips
If I ever was to eat there again
But last night at dinner
You really, really blew my mind
The way we supped just filled mе up
I think about food all of the time
Peoplе always come up to me
They say, hey, man
How about a little smile
Don't take life so seriously
Lighten up for a little while
I say that a man's a fool
If he don't know how to cry
When I get down, I sure get down
But when I'm up, I know how to fly
