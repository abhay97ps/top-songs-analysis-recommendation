You treated me like a schoolgirl lover
Never did follow any rules
And into your arms I'm runnin' for cover
All of my strings are tied to you
Can you hear the gypsy turnpike, ah, it's callin'?
So take our things out to the car
And banded shades of night fallin'
You're my bright and guiding star
Vanilla O'Lay, la-lay, la-lay, lay-la, lay-la
Vanilla O'Lay, la-lay, la-lay, lay-la
Vanilla O'Lay, la-lay, la-lay, lay-la, lay-la
Vanilla O'Lay, la-lay, la-lay, lay-la
Ah, but my, my, my, you're lookin' better
It seems like you were never ill
The doctor's gonna send us a letter
We will let the sky up pay the bill
John-John the cat, he's gettin' older
And he don't jump around like you know that he should
Come, put our baby over my shoulder
We're goin' out to get some wood
Vanilla O'Lay, la-lay, la-lay, lay-la, lay-la
Vanilla O'Lay, la-lay, la-lay, lay-la
Vanilla O'Lay, la-lay, la-lay, lay-la, lay-la
Vanilla O'Lay, la-lay, la-lay, lay-la
Vanilla O'Lay, la-lay, la-lay, lay-la, lay-la
Vanilla O'Lay, la-lay, la-lay, lay-la
