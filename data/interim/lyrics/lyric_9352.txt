Well, another day has come
After all is said and done
You are here as you were before
'Cause it feels as if we've been
Through it all and back again
Now I know there'll be something more
No more tears left to hide
We have made it through a long and lonely night
Better days on our side
Oh, it looks as though we're doing something right
And in perfect time we'll flow
Sometimes up and down we'll go
Like the ring in a carousel
No more tears left to hide
We have made it through a long and lonely night
Better days on our side
Say, it looks as though we're doing something right
Oh, it looks as though we're doing something right
No more tears left to hide
We have made it through a long and lonely night
Better days on our side
Oh, it looks as though we're doing something right
No more tears left to hide
