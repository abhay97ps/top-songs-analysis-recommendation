The mood is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
The party's on
The feeling's here
That only comes
This time of year
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
The choir of children sing their song
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
We're simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
The word is out
About the town
To lift a glass
And don't look down
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
We're simply having a wonderful Christmas time
The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
The party's on
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
We're simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough
We're simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
We're simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh Christmas time
