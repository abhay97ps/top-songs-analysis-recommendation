Wheezy outta here 
Yeah
Gunna spittin' words like a mothafuckin' poet 
Told 'em, "Press start, I'ma go ahead and record" 
Push one button, I could close up the doors 
Made a few millions, give a fuck about the Forbes 
Drippin' all the children, nigga, used to couldn't afford 
I was in the trenches rockin' Gucci and Dior
BET was trippin', how I didn't get an award? 
You got me a annoyed
Double park the Urus, I'll pull up, 'Ventador 
Travel like a tourist, had to fly to Bora Bora
Show's around one-fifty, but they paid a lil' more 
Me and Wheezy wave, fuckin' bitches on the shore 
We ain't come to play, is you with it, are you sure? 
Smokin' like a train, you can smell it in my pores 
Cup full of codeine, you can smell it when I pour 
All I drink is oil
I'm spendin' on designer when I'm shoppin' in New York 
Goin' shoppin' one stop 'fore I stop at the resort 
You gon' never get it if your feature money short 
Wake up to a threesome in the penthouse on the Nawf 
Rick Owens denims, show my sneakers like they shorts 
Gunna spit venom, you can hear it in his voice 
Tried me and I killed him, I didn't really have no choice
I'm showin' no remorse
Can't see nothin' but the money like a blindfold
Two watches 'cause I'm in two different time zones
She like the way I fuck her, have her mind blown
She stalkin', had to let her hear the dial tone
I'm crissin' with these crosses yeah, it's all chrome
We cookin' with that chopper, send your dawg home
Been livin', I'ma paint the Bentley rose gold
Beginnin' and we headed up a long road
Yeah 
You can hear the money in my voice
'Ventador, 2020, I ain't have a choice
And I got a Urus, we the Lamborghini Boys
I been gettin' millions, I ain't trippin' 'bout awards, yeah
Watchin' what I do, I got endorsements
Certified dripper, me and Gunna walk on water, yeah
Middle finger ring cost a quarter
Prolly one the flyest young niggas out of Georgia
I been goin' in, all you gotta do is record me
Niggas actin' like bitches, always keepin' shit corny
Get a nigga whacked for a new pair of Jordans
Hoppin' on the plane, I'm landin' in the mornin'
Niggas ain't gang, nah, I'll never let 'em join us
How you go from Section 8 to ridin' in a foreign?
I'm only gon' hit it and forget it if it's borin'
I been sippin' syrup all day, just pourin'
Sold out dates, back to back like I'm tourin'
I just left a Hawks game, me and bae floorin'
I ain't miss the Jordans for this pair of Diors
Youngin' on fire, I ain't passin' the torch
I was hood rich, now I passed 'em on Forbes
Yeah, nigga tried to play me like a toy, damn
Now I feel bad for your boy, yeah
Can't see nothin' but the money like a blindfold
Two watches 'cause I'm in two different time zones
She like the way I fuck her, have her mind blown
She stalkin', had to let her hear the dial tone
I'm crissin' with these crosses yeah, it's all chrome
We cookin' with that chopper, send your dawg home
Been livin', I'ma paint the Bentley rose gold
Beginnin' and we headed up a long road
