Imagine if I said I sometimes need you
I need you to this day
Imagine if I said I sometimes hear you call my name
Imagine if I said I still could love you
Imagine what you’d say
Imagine if I said I sometimes still can see your face
Think about all the things we shared
Think about all the times we cared
When all of your hopes have come and gone
Think about me and I’ll be there
There’s something in the air that feels like winter
The kind we used to know
Yesterday can seem like such a long, long time ago
Who could ever count the miles between us?
But now I know it’s true
Imagine if I said that all my dreams are dreams of you
Think about all the things we shared
Think about all the times we cared
When all of your dreams have come and gone
Think about me and I’ll be there
Think about images we’ve drawn
Think about all those empty songs
Whenever you’re sure that I won’t dare
Think about me and I’ll be gone
It took me a long, long time to learn
That love is a thing you have to earn
I finally realized it’s true
I just can’t make it without you
Think about all the things we shared
Think about all the times we cared
When all of your dreams have come and gone
Think about me and I’ll be there
Think about images we’ve drawn
Think about all those empty songs
Whenever you’re sure that I won’t dare
Think about me and I’ll be gone
