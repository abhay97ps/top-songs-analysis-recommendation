Hey pretty baby! 
A don't you hear the drummer thumpin' 
You gotta shake it like a crazy 
Because the band is sayin' something 
And everybody is a jumpin'
You gotta slop, bop, flip flop, hip hop
Never stop
You gotta move, move, move, a round and round
You gotta fly, fly, fly, way off the ground
You're puttin down, a crazy, shout
No, no, you can't sit down, no, no, you can't sit down
When you're on South Street 
And the band is really bootin' 
You hear the hip beat with the back beat 
And you see the gang a groovin' 
You gotta get your bottom movin' 
You gotta make it, break it, shake it all around
You can't sit down, you can't sit down
You gotta move, move, move, a round and round
You gotta fly, fly, fly, way off the ground
You're puttin down, a crazy, shout
No, no, you can't sit down, no, no, you can't sit down
Get in there honey!
You can't sit down, you can't sit down, you can't sit down
You can't sit down, you can't sit down, you can't sit down
You can't sit down, you can't sit down, you movin' em down
A crazy shout, you can't sit down
A, yea, yea, yea, hey pretty baby
You know you really dance so fine now
You're really shakin' like a crazy
A don't you down lead the line now
We're gonna do it one more time now
You got to make it, break it, shake it,all around
You gotta move, move, move, a round and round
You gotta fly, fly, fly, way off the ground
You're puttin down, a crazy, shout
No, no, you can't sit down, no, no, you can't sit down
You gotta move, move, move, a round and round
You gotta fly, fly, fly, way off the ground............
