Busy little Missy yea she got no time for jokes
Spirits runnin' thru my veins, I got spirits in my coke
Telling me that she insane, I can see it in her look
Yeah its blood all of the stains, I got blood all in my throat
Busy little Missy yea she got no time for jokes
Spirits runnin' thru my veins, I got spirits in my coke
Telling me that she insane, I can see it in her look
Yeah its blood all of the stains, I got blood all in my throat
Busy little Missy got a bad attitude
Always leave me on read, and I find that kinda rude
Hands around my neck that girl act like a knoose
Yeah she made all of the dеmons in my brain run loose
She a product of me, so I got no еxcuse
Busy little Missy yea, she got no time for jokes
Spirits runnin' thru my veins, I got spirits in my coke

Telling me that she insane, I can see it in her look
Yeah its blood all of the stains, I got blood all in my throat
Bad little Missy, yeah she never said she miss me
Always hit her line whenever I'm in the city
Yeah I got some issues but at least she said I'm pretty
Yeah she takes my hand but that lady never kiss me
She never kiss me
She pull my soul so low that's where I wanna go
I love so cold and that's okay I love the snow
I'm her favorite game to play she in control
She pulled the curtain early on me
I'm the show
Baby I loved the show, but baby I got to go
I get the call, I leave in the morn, you want me to leave you alone
But I got blood in mouth, I wanted to try you out
Satisfy me; yeah you a diamond
Baby I'll give you a shout
Busy little Missy yea, she got no time for jokes
Spirits runnin' thru my veins, I got spirits in my coke
Telling me that she insane, I can see it in her look
Yeah it's blood all of the stains, I got blood all in my throat
Busy little Missy yea she got no time for jokes
Spirits runnin' thru my veins, I got spirits in my coke
Telling me that she insane, I can see it in her look
Yeah its blood all of the stains, I got blood all in my throat
Bad little Missy, yeah she never said she miss me
Always hit her line whenever I'm in the city
Yeah I got some issues but at least she said I'm pretty
Yeah she takes my hand but that lady never kiss me
[Verse 3: Charlie Lenehan
Blood in my throat, hope I don't choke
Lungs full of smoke, run out of hope
Live your horoscope
Regain my faith, hope I feel safe
I'd rather cry in a wraith, blowing my way thru an eighth
That's not okay
Stare at the stars and I pray that we find our way one day 
How did we get so fucked up, how did we make it here?
When your name hits the air, blood runs from my ear
I'm feeling nauseous, now I'm so cautious
But I can never say no cause to me you're flawless
Our love is illegal, we bandits your love is so lawless
Busy little Missy yea she got no time for jokes
Spirits runnin' thru my veins, I got spirits in my coke
Telling me that she insane, I can see it in her look
Yeah its blood all of the stains, I got blood all in my throat
Busy little Missy yea she got no time for jokes
Spirits runnin' thru my veins, I got spirits in my coke
Telling me that she insane, I can see it in her look
Yeah its blood all of the stains, I got blood all in my throat
