I'm not always right
It's up to you
Get down to the point
What can I do
I got to get going
Got to move out of here
No reason you knowing
No reason to fear
Keep your eyes on your money
Keep their hand out the till
You've got to run with it honey
And take what you will
Keep your eyes on the road
Keep your hands on the wheel
If it ain't for the takin'
Beg, borrow or steal
Beg, borrow or steal
Beg, borrow or steal
So look at me now
I'm causin' a scene
Don't figure out how
Where have I been
I can't wait 'til tomorrow
Gotta do it again
'Cause nothin's forsaken
I'm movin' ahead
Keep your eyes on your money
Keep their hand out the till
You've got to run with it honey
And take what you will
Keep your eyes on the road
Keep your hands on the wheel
If it ain't for the takin'
Beg, borrow or steal
Beg, borrow or steal
Beg, borrow or steal
This is right for me
Is it right for you
Do you know it
This is right for you
Do you know it
This is right for you
Is it right for me
Can you show me
Beg, borrow or steal
Beg, borrow or steal
Beg, borrow or steal
Beg, borrow or steal
