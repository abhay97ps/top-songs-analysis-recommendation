Well
Well they blew the horns
And the walls came down
They'd all been warned
And the walls came down
They stood there laughing
They're not laughing anymore
The walls came down
Sanctuary fades, congregation splits
Nightly military raids, the congregation splits
It's a song of assassins, ringin' in your ears
We got terrorists thinking, playing on fears
Oh
Well they blew the horns
And the walls came down
They'd all been warned
But the walls came down
I don't think there are any Russians
And there ain't no Yanks
Just corporate criminals
Playin' with tanks
Die, die, die, die
Yes, come on
Die, die
Come on, come on, come on
Die, die, wake up
Wake up
Die, die
Go, yeah
Die, die, die, die, die, die
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Die, die
