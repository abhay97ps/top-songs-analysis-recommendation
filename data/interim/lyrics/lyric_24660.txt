Backseat turn to a vault 
Security outside like a guard 
Securin' my spot, I'm a dog

Can't come to me, I'm the boss, hold on 
400 racks on my car, hold on 
Got a old mink on the floor 
King Tut gotta say it's old 
Spend a milli' at a store 
Tat my ribs like King Tut's 
Caught my first body, I was a man from there 
Nigga tried to take my mind, I left his ass in there 
Then hopped inside the Jag', I did the dash, you know that 
I ain't gon' stay on no scene, I'll let my lawyer handle that 
Everything high-end 
I see it, it's mine then 
I like it, I bought it 
I'm wet up like faucets 
Catch up to not get 
We don't let bygones be bygones
