Spanish boys'll greet you
With that old obscene refrain
The sadness of a thousand
Waiting window panes
Gypsy boys'll beat you
At your own familiar game
While the whore on the corner
Drags that same old ball and chain
They make better lovers
Or so I've been told
Under the covers
That's where you discover
If your man is whole
They don't come easy
But they're worth the time
And if you please me
Maybe I'll let you be mine
Latin boys are easy
They'll touch you with their eyes
Handle you the way they need
Without disguise
Gypsy boys'll fool you
Into global compromise
While occasional candy
Keeps your belly satisfied
They say they only hurt you
Because they're hurting themselves
And they don't mean to
Dry up all your wishing wells
They say you should be truthful
But you know sometimes they lie
And though it isn't meant to
It still tears me up inside
