Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah 
Celebrate with the ones we got here 
Middle fingers to the ones that's not here 
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah
Celebrate with the ones we got here
Middle fingers to the ones that's not here
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
People tend to lose it, they see you comin' up 
And you were talkin' stupid, you wish you bit your tongue 
Your blood is burning butane, I know it eats you up
And I just keep it moving, that envy got you stuck 
Now we printing money and you drive a Jetta
Ever since I cut you off, I swear that life is better 
And ain't nobody believe you, you could say whatever
Only party in Ibiza like we 
And we ain't never losing no sleep over you 
And that's why we gon' dedicate this toast to you, toast to you 
Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah 
Celebrate with the ones we got here 
Middle fingers to the ones that's not here 
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah
Celebrate with the ones we got here
Middle fingers to the ones that's not here
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
In a Lambo truck, it's not a Panorama
Even though I got the vision and it's panorama
Outgrew my faded tee, out base, we made it out Atlanta
When the closest thing to tropic was the Tropicana 
Yellin' "Free the guys," pour one for the guys
To my dawg 50 on the other side
Pop me one, pop me two, pop me three 
Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah 
Celebrate with the ones we got here 
Middle fingers to the ones that's not here 
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah
Celebrate with the ones we got here
Middle fingers to the ones that's not here
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost 
Ooh , ooh 
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
I'm a bad man, just with good things
I'm a world class, let the hood see
I been with it 
I been choosy with a big bag moving loosely
I been with it 
Let's go
Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah 
Celebrate with the ones we got here 
Middle fingers to the ones that's not here 
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah
Celebrate with the ones we got here
Middle fingers to the ones that's not here
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
As we continue to celebrate
Celebrate life
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost 
It's always love
