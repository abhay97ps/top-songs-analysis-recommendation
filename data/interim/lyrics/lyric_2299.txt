With her pretty smile, yeah yeah
She's 'bout to drive me crazy, yeah yeah
Makes my heart beat wild
So everybody say yeah, yeah yeah
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah

She does the walk real nice, yeah yeah
There's no questions about maybe
For her I'd make any sacrifice
So everybody say yeah, yeah yeah
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
And when she walks that walk
I can't help but feel that she's for real
And when she talks that talk

To me she's everything, yeah yeah
She might fuss and call yer lazy
But to her I'm still the king
