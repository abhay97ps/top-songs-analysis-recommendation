A smoky room, a small café
They come to hear you play
And drink and dance the night away
I sit out in the crowd and close my eyes
Dream you're mine
But you don't know
You don't even know that I am there
I wish that I was in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me through the night
Till the dawn 
I wish you'd hold me in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
All night long 
All night long 
I'd be your song
I'd be your song
Steal my heart with every note you play
I pray you'll look my way
And hold me to your heart someday, yeah
I long to be the one that
You caress with a tenderness
And you don't know
You don't even know that I exist
I wish that I was in your arms 
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me through the night
Till the dawn 
I wish you'd hold me in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
All night long 
All night long 
I'd be your song
I'd be your song
Te sientas entre la gente
Cierras tu ojos
Y sueñas que soy tuyo
Pero yo no sé ni siquiera que estas ahí
Me gustaría tenerte entre mis brazos amor
I sit out in the crowd and close my eyes
Dream you're mine
And you don't know
You don't even know that I exist
I wish that I was in your arms 
Like that Spanish guitar 
And you would play me through the night
Till the dawn 
I wish you'd hold me in your arms 
Like that Spanish guitar 
Like that Spanish guitar 
All night long 
All night long 
I'd be your song
I'd be your song
I'll be your song, your song, your song
I'll be your song, yeah 
I'll be your song, your song, your song
Play me all night long, yeah-yeah
I'll be your song, your song, your song 
I'll be your song, yeah 
I'll be your song, your song, your song 
I wanna be your song
I'll be your song, your song, your song 
I'll be your song, yeah
I'll be your song, your song, your song 
Hold me, baby, all night long
I'll be your song, your song, your song
I'll be your song, yeah
