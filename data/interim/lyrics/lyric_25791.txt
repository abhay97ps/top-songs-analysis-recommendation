Where's the guy in the steel toes covered in dirt?
Just a rock n' roll T-shirt, headed to work
With a pack of Red Man in his pocket
He's kind of red, man, but he's rockin'
Wears a beat up Tele' and a Marshall stack
Little Marshall Tucker and a six pack
Where's the good ol' boys and the good ol' days?
Straight up gettin' sideways
We back, we back, we back in the speakers
Back in black, getting blasted in the bleachers
It's probably true what my mama said
I do it just like my daddy did
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back
Where's the chick wearin' blue jeans a little too tight?
Got a grip on a koozie if it's what she likes
Getting picked up in a pickup
And kickin' it with guys like us
We back, we back, we back in the speakers
Back in black, getting blasted in the bleachers
It's probably true what my mama said
I do it just like my daddy did
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back
Sun comes up and sun goes down, yeah
Everything good comes back around
We back, we back
We back, we back, we back in the speakers
Back in black, getting blasted in the bleachers
It's probably true what my mama said
I do it just like my daddy did
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back 
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back (We back, we back
It's probably true what my mama said)
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back
