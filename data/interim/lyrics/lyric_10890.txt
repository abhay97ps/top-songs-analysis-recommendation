Been preparin'
All week long
To get it ready
To get it on
The only thing
That's on my mind
Is drivin' it home
In 4-4 time
1, 2, 3, 4...
You gotta get it up
Get down
Get it on
Or get on out
That's the only way
To make my baby shout
You gotta get it up
Get down
Get it on
Or get on out
You gotta get it up
Get down
Get it on
Or get on out
This is what she said to me
The only way you can set me free
Is show me every move you got
And move it till it hits the spot
5, 6, 7, 8...
Yeah...
Get it on, white boy
Get it up
Get down
Get it on
Or get on out
 3x
The second verse now...
This is what she said to me
The only way you can set me free
Is show me every move you got
And move it till it hits the spot
 4x
Let's give it to Warren...
Ah you're cookin' now...
You're cookin' Warren
Do it to me...
Do it to me...
Go on, do it to me...
 4x
Go on, give it to me ya'll
You know I can sit here
And do this thing all night long...
