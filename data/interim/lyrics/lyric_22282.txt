Woo!
Hear the sound of your body drip, drip, drip
As I kiss both sets of lip-lip-lips 
Hear the sound of your body drip, drip, drip
As I kiss both sets of lip-lip-lips 
I ain't afraid to drown
If that means I'm deep up in your ocean, yeah
Girl, I'll drink you down
Sipping on your body all night
I just wanna take your legs and wrap 'em 'round
Girl, you cumming right now
My head to your chest feeling your heartbeat, girl
Swimming all in your sea, and you sweating all over me
Bring it forward, don't you run, run

You don't know what you're in for
'Bout to get inside your mental, huh
Bend ya back like it's limbo
I'ma make you feel like a nympho
Tonight, oh whoa, you're mine, baby girl, oh
Any time you want it, I'm ready and willing, girl, to give it
I start to lick your body, you go to trembling
Flip it around, girl, lemme get it from the side
And can I visit all those spots you like?
Your neck, your back, your sexy lips, booty and thighs

When you're feelin' uptight, get it right, don't fight
Lighten up like Sammy Sosa 
Women call me the super soaker  and I'ma soak your bed to death 
 How long can you hold your breath? 
As-As-Ashma attackin', wakin' up wonderin' what happened
Makin' me high like Toni Braxton 
You can't deny you wanna break my back in, two 
What you wanna do?
Look at you with your birthday suit, suit, suit, suit, suit 
The forecast said it's cloudy tonight 
And I'ma have your body like bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop
