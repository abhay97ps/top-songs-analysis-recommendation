Mmm, ayy, what's up?
Everybody in my gang is drug addicts
Chyeah, ooh, ooh 
Chyeah, chyeah
 Ooh
Whole gang full of drug addicts 
Take a lot of shit, forgot what happened 
I ain't gon' lie, I got a habit 
Swear to God, you can't be on my status, ho 
Start the day off with a pint 
I'ma show you how to live life 
Take a lot of drugs, don't think twice 
I do this every day and all night 
Whole gang full of drug addicts 
Whole gang full of drug addicts 
Whole gang full of drug addicts 
Whole gang full of drug addicts 
I been smokin' since I was 11 
I been poppin' pills since I was seven 
Told my pastor I don't do confessions 
'Cause I pop a lot of molly for my breakfast 
I ain't never listen to nobody 
In the courthouse off of ecstasy 
And your baby mama layin' next to me 
After she just sucked me, I just told her ass to leave 
Everybody 'round me like them Oxy's 
I was too leaned out to drive the 'Rari 
Made her ass wait two hours in the lobby 
I can't go outside, 'cause I see paparazzi 
Take another pill, now I'm feelin' better 
Gucci Gang, Gucci Gang, yeah I'm a trend-setter 
Bustin' all on your bitch, wiped it off with my sweater 
I'm a drug addict, I'm richer than my professor 
Whole gang full of drug addicts 
Take a lot of shit, forgot what happened 
I ain't gon' lie, I got a habit 
I swear to God, you can't be on my status, ho 
Start the day off with a pint 
I'ma show you how to live life 
Take a lot of drugs, don't think twice 
I do this every day and all night 
Whole gang full of drug addicts 
Whole gang full of drug addicts 
Whole gang full of drug addicts 
Whole gang full of drug addicts 
Ooh
Whole gang full of drug addicts 
Whole gang full of drug addicts 
Whole gang full of drug addicts 
Whole gang full of drug addicts
