Every time you touch me
I get high
And every time you're near me
I can fly
High above the clouds and rain
Way above the hurt and pain
And when you're gone
I fall down from the sky
But every time you touch me
I get high
I've been touched by the angels
And I've been kissed by the very best
And I've been love hard by quite a few
But after you
I forget the rest
'Cause every time you touch me
I get high
And every time you're near me
I can fly
When your fingers touch my skin
That's when I start to live again
'Cause without your love
I'd lay right down and die
Every time you touch me
I get high
