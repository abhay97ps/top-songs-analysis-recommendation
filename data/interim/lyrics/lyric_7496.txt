I need your sweet inspiration
I need you here on my mind
Every hour of the day
Without your sweet inspiration
The lonely hours of the night
Just don't go my way
Wanting you the way I do
I only want to be with you
And I would go to the ends of the earth
'Cause darling, to me that's what you're worth
Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere you tell me to
If you need, need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead
If you're out on the road
Feelin' lonely and oh so cold
All you gotta do is call my name
And I'll be there on the next train
Where you lead I will follow
Anywhere you tell me to
If you need, need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead
I'd always wanted a real home
With flowers on the windowsill
But if you want to leave in New York City
Honey, you know I will
Yes I will
Yes I will
I never thought I could get satisfaction
From just one man
If anyone can keep me happy
Oh, you're the one who can
I'm gonna follow where you lead me
I'm gonna follow where you lead me
I need your sweet inspiration
I need you here on my mind
Every hour of the day
Without your sweet inspiration
The lonely hours of the night
Just don't go my way
Oh, a woman in love needs sweet inspiration
And honey that's all I ask, you know
That's all I ask from you
I gotta have your sweet inspiration
You know there just ain't no tellin'
What a satisfied woman might do
The way you call me baby, baby 
The way you call me darlin', darlin' 
And if I'm out in the rain, baby 
You know I just look back in my mind
And there I find your sweet, sweet inspiration
Inspiration, oh what a power
And a bucket of power every hour of the day
I need your sweet inspiration
To go on livin', to keep on givin' this way
Wanting you the way I do 
Only want to be with you 
Gonna follow where you lead 
Baby you're just what I need
Your sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet inspiration
And honey that's all I ask, you know
That's all I ask from you
I gotta have your sweet inspiration
You know there just ain't no telling
What a satisfied woman can do
You are my sweet inspiration
