You're always dancing down the street
With your suede blue eyes
And every new boy that you meet
He doesn't know the real surprise
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky, ooh
She'll make you flip
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
I kinda like the way she dips
Oh, she's my best friend's girl
Well, she's my best friend's girl, girl
But she used to be mine
You got your nuclear boots
And your drip dry glove
Ooh, when you bite your lip
It's some reaction to love, o-ove, o-ove
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky, yeah
I'll make you flip
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
I kinda like the way, I like the way she dips
'Cause she's my best friend's girl
Well, she's my best friend's girl, girl
And she used to be mine
She's so fine
Always da-dancing down the street
With your suede blue eye-eyes
And every new boy that you meet
He doesn't know the real surprise
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
Oh, she'll make you flip
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
I kinda like the way, I like the way she dips
'Cause she's my best friend's girl
She's my best friend's girl, irl, uh-irl
And she used to be mine
She's so fine
 Oh
 She used to be mine
 Yeah, yeah
 Said she used to be mine
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 She used to be mine
