We use to talk forever on a dime
Now we live together, never find the time
We use to walk as lovers on the sand
Now we're workin' full-time on our lifetime plan
We never stop to see the moon at night
We're just too busy leadin' complicated lives
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember love on a rooftop
Couldn't make the love stop
We were givin' all that we got
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember holdin' you so tight
Ooh, when kissin' lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, love on a rooftop
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Look at us now, we're all grown up
We got it all together, got it all sewn up
But is this all it all was leadin' to? 
Do we just run out of dreams when all our dreams come true?
Whatever happened to those endless nights
When we were happy livin' young and foolish lives?
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember love on a rooftop
Couldn't make the love stop
We were givin' all that we got
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember holdin' you so tight
Ooh, when kissin' lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, love on a rooftop
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa
We never stop to see the moon at night
We're just too busy leadin' complicated lives
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember love on a rooftop
Couldn't make the love stop
We were givin' all that we got
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember holdin' you so tight
Ooh, when kissin' lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, love on a rooftop
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember, I remember us, darlin'
We couldn't make the love stop
We were givin' it all, givin' it all we got
I remember slow dancin' 
Ooh, when kissin' lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, love on a rooftop
Whoo
Baby, leave me on the rooftop
I remember, I remember, I remember us, darlin'
We couldn't make the love stop
We were givin' it all, givin' it all we got
I remember, I remember
I remember like it was yesterday
Whoa, whoa, love on a rooftop
Whoa, whoa, whoa
