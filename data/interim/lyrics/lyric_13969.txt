Whoa oh oh...
In this situation
In which I have fallen
I can't see to lose you
You have it down down down yeah
Everywhere I go to run
You're just a step away, just a step away
And I know that in my heart
Your promises are just a kiss away
Whoa oh oh... weapons of love
Stop hurting me
Whoa oh oh... weapons of love
They're killing me yeah
Now I stand accused
Of the crime this time
I've been a fool for you
You turned me down down down yeah
Everywhere I go to hide
You're just a breath away, just a breath away
And I know that in my mind
Another heartache is just a kiss away
Whoa oh oh... weapons of love
Help me please
Whoa oh oh... weapons of love
They're killing me yeah
Everywhere I go to run
You're just a step away, just a step away
And I know that in my heart
Your promises are just a kiss away
Whoa oh oh... weapons of love
They're killing me yeah
Whoa oh oh... weapons of love
They're killing me yeah
Whoa oh oh... weapons of love
Help me please
Whoa oh oh... weapons of love
Whoa oh oh... weapons of love
Would somebody help me please
Whoa oh oh... weapons of love
