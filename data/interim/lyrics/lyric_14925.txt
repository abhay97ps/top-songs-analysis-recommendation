I used to travel in the shadows
And I never found the nerve to try to walk up to you
But now I am a man and I know that there's no time to waste
There's too much to lose
Girl you say anything at all, and you know that you can call
And I'll be right there for you
First love, heartbreak, tough luck, big mistake
What else can you do
I'll say anything you want to hear
I'll see everything through
I'll do anything I have to do
Just to win the love of a girl like you
A girl like you
People talk and people stare, tell them I don't really care
This is the place I should be
And if they think it's really strange for a girl like you
To be in love with someone like me
I wanna tell them all to go to hell
That we're doing very well without them you see
That's just the way it is and they will see
I am yours and you are mine the way it should be
A girl like you
A girl like you
Oh, yeah
Yeah!
Now if I seem a little wild, there's no holding back
I'm trying to get a message to you
I won't take anything from anyone
I won't walk and I won't run, I believe in you
London, Washington, anywhere you are I'll run
Together we'll be
Inside, outside, got my pride
I won't let him take you from me
A girl like you
A girl like you
A girl like you
A girl like you
Oh, yeah
I'll say anything 
I'll take anything 
I'll say anything
Almost anything except goodbye
