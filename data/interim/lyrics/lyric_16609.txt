Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Please, come take my hand
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Soon, you'll meet a man
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some phones
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone
Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryin' to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213
Lobotomy
Lobotomy
Lobotomy
And I'll remember
The strength that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you saved me
I'll remember
Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I wanna be sedated
Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I wanna  be sedated
Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I wanna be sedated
Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I wanna be sedated
Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I wanna be sedated
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today no conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today no conversation
Time to wait too long
To wait too long
To wait too long
Beat on the brat
Beat on the brat
Beat on the brat with a baseball bat
" from "The Lion King")
Can you feel the love tonight?
It's where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
