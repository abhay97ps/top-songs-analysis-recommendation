THE BIRTH OF A NATION
Screenplay by
Nate Parker
1 BLACK, THEN- 1
Indeed, I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is
just, that his justice cannot sleep forever.
Thomas Jefferson, 1785
CHILD’S VOICE 
My mama, she was runnin’. Runnin’
fast as she could...
FADE IN
2 EXT. DISMAL SWAMP - NIGHT 2
Moonlight sifts through the tall pines, illuminating the fogblanketed
marsh.
CHILD’S VOICE 
But the white man, he catched her.
Catched her an’ throwed her to the
ground...
Through the boscage, two shrouded figures emerge, pacing
stealthily through the brush.
CHILD’S VOICE 
But he ain’t know that another man,
big like my daddy was behind him...
CLOSER to reveal the shadowed features of an African WOMAN.
She pulls a YOUNG BOY alongside her- both of whom’s features
we cannot yet clearly see.
CHILD’S VOICE 
He took a big ol’ stick and hit
that white man all about his head
with it...
3 INT. SLAVE QUARTERS - NANA’S CABIN -  3
Three SLAVE CHILDREN sit together under candle light. They
wear long TOW SHIRTS that reach to their knees. The smallest,
YOUNG NAT TURNER  continues as the two others listen rapt.
YOUNG NAT
Then they dug a hole, roll him in
it and walked on back.
An UNKNOWN POV watches from outside the cracked cabin door.
One of the other slave children, YOUNG HARK  pipes up.
4/9/15 - WHITE 1
SLAVE CHILD
They got lynched?
YOUNG NAT
Naw. They went on back and didn't
never say nothing on it.
Say they ain’t seen master all day.
The cabin door opens to reveal NANCY TURNER . She
regards Nat, spooked.
NANCY
Who told you that?
No answer. She rushes to him, grabs him hard by the arm.
NANCY 
You tell me who told you that right
now, ‘fo I tan your hide!
YOUNG NAT
Nobody, mama. I just... rememberNat
winces against her grip, terrified. His eyes flood. Nancy
releases her grip, pulls him into a hug. Her eyes mist.
NANCY
I’m sorry...

5 EXT. DISMAL SWAMP - CLEARING - NIGHT 5
Nancy and Nat step into the clearing to find a group of
ELDERLY AFRICANS huddled around a humble fire in fervent
prayer. Among the elders, we find EZEKIEL . As if
sensing their arrival, his eyes open. He motions them
forward. Ezekiel speaks in his Native Ghanaian tongue. *
EZEKIEL
5/8/15 - PINK 2
3 CONTINUED: 3
Nat looks terrified as Nancy removes his shirt. Ezekiel
inspects Nat’s arms and back before arriving to his chest.
The Elders nudge in, the mouthing of passionate prayer never * ceasing. Ezekiel points a thin finger to the boy’s sternum.
ANGLE ON THREE SLIGHTLY RAISED KNOTS.
EZEKIEL 
(In the time of our ancestors, the
cycle of our people lay in the
hands of the children... A man’s
position was left to the signs of
the maker. Children bearing marks
were presented before counsel. It
was there they were given their
assignments in the tribeassignments
that would last a
lifetime...)
He points to the first bump on the Nat’s chest.
EZEKIEL 
(This boy holds the Holy marks of
our ancestors past... He was born
to be a prophet.)
At the word PROPHET, the surrounding Elders’ bodies arch and
rock, the intensity of their prayers growing to fever pitch.
We PUSH IN on Nat as he struggles to digest the magnitude of
his words. CLOSER. As divine exaltation fills the surrounding
blur, weCUT

6 INT. BARN/SLAVE CHURCH - DAY 6
Sunlight cuts through crooked slats, casting golden lines
across the dirt floor. Whispers lead toward a corner where we
find SEVERAL SHADOWED FIGURES crouched in the darkness. *
5/8/15 - PINK 3
5 CONTINUED: 5
Their whispers cease when SOMETHING crosses outside,
disrupting the light.
The broad barn door creeks open. An ugly shadow tracks across
the barn floor. We drift up to revealJOHN
CLARKE TURNER 
His eyes snap toward a movement in the dark. He smiles bigJOHN
CLARKE
I see you!
7 EXT. BARN/SLAVE CHURCH - DAY 7
Giggling children, burst from the barn door, as John Clark
gives chase. We lock in on Young Nat as he sprints ahead of
the group.
SUPER: SOUTHAMPTON COUNTY, VIRGINIA, 1809
8 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - BIG HOUSE - DAY 8
We follow him, as he passes the TURNER MANSION-
9 EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY 9
He cuts through the SLAVE QUARTERS, dodging a MALE BLACKSMITH * SLAVE who shapes a piece of metal with a hammer, passes a *
MALE SLAVE leading a trudging mule and races through a plume *
of steam rising from a FEMALE SLAVE COOK’s massive pot. *
10 OMITTED 10 *
11 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - BIG HOUSE - DAY 11
John Clarke stands in the courtyard resigned. He offers a
final scan of the plantation.
JOHN CLARKE

Several moments pass before Nat emerges. He and John Clarke
share a smile asWOMAN’S
VOICE 
John Clarke!
ELIZABETH TURNER  exits onto the ‘Big House’ porch.
ELIZABETH TURNER
Get in here for supper.
JOHN CLARKE
Yes’m! Bye Nat.
YOUNG NAT
Bye.
Nat watches as John Clarke bounds the porch stairs. He and
Elizabeth disappear inside.
Nat lingers a moment, his eyes fixing on a hardcover BOOK
draped on the back of a rocking chair.
12 OMITTED 12 *
13 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - BIG HOUSE - DAY 13
On the porch, the wooden rocking chair rocks lazily. The
hardcover book, gone.
14 EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - MEAL HOUSE - DAY 14
Nat arrives to a long table overcrowded with slave children,
each holding a SHELL. A SLAVE MAN approaches, drops a LARGE
BOWL of CORNMUSH at the table’s center. As the children surge
scooping at the mush, Nat struggles to push his way through.
Within seconds, the kids disperse, leaving Nat in front of an
empty bowl.

-a slave man across the courtyard. This is ISAAC TURNER. A
leather apron shields his chest and legs as he wields a
hammer over a hot scrap of iron. He watches as Nat meanders
away.
15 INT. SLAVE QUARTERS - NANA’S CABIN - NIGHT 15 *
Isaac enters, caked in dirt and sweat. Bridget, Nancy and Nat
lie asleep. Isaac hovers over a bucket of water in a near
corner. As he rinses his face a soft MOAN rises from Nat’s
direction.
Isaac studies Nat a beat before grabbing a small wooden box
from a shelf. Within, he finds a CRUMPLED SQUARE OF PAPER. He
smooths it against his leg, before slipping out the cabin.
A long beat until- Nat stirs awake, sits up.
16 EXT. WOODS - OLD ROAD - NIGHT 16
Isaac pushes through the woods, staying close to the main
road. A SOUND in the distances stops him in his tracks. He
grips a bulky stash under his shirt as he squints into the
dark. As his eyes focus on a shadowed figure aheadCLICK.
He turns to find three men, THE PATTY-ROLLERS, atop horses. * They’re dressed similarly in worn pea coats, each coat * bearing a dull BRASS STAR. RAYMOND COBB  *
holds a pistol leveled at Isaac’s head.
COBB
You so much as bat your eyes I’ll
blow you from here to hell.
Isaac stands frozen as he takes in the group of three men.
COBB 
What you doin’ out here, boy?
ISAAC
Runnin’ a errand for my massa, suh.
Massa Benjamin Turner.
He opens his shirt to reveal CANNED GOODS and SALT PORK.
COBB
Where yo’ pass at?
Isaac produces a piece of paper we recognize as the CRUMPLED
SQUARE from the cabin. He hands it to Cobb who studies it. *

5/8/15 - PINK 6

COBB  *
You think you’re smarter than me, * don’t you boy? *
Cobb calls to one of his men, JESSE . *
COBB  * Jesse, what we call a nigger, think
he can outsmart a white man?
JESSE
...a dead nigger.
COBB
Turn around. Get on your knees.
Isaac turns toward the woods. Cobb dismounts behind him.
Isaac squints toward the shadowed figure. Recognition sets in
his gaze. It’s NAT.
COBB 
On yo’ knees.
WITH ISAAC as he slowly lowers. Just as his knees touch the
ground, he-
-lunges for the gun. BANG! The gun goes off, catching the
third pattyroller in the chest. Isaac and Cobb wrestle for
the pistol as Jesse struggles for a clean shot. Isaac head- * butts Cobb, sending the gun flying. Before Cobb can recover,
Isaac grabs a nearby branch, CLUBS him across the face. A
gash opens, spilling blood. Isaac sprints into the woods. On
Cobb and Jesse firing wildly into the treeline.
17 EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 17
Young Nat runs for his life. As he crashes through the brush
a HAND scoops him up from behind. WIDER TO REVEAL Isaac
sprinting, Nat dangling in his grip.

18 INT. SLAVE QUARTERS - NANA’S CABIN - NIGHT 18
BRIDGET “NANA” TURNER, sits in a rocking chair, in front of a *
modest fire, asleep. Isaac and Nat burst in. Bridget and * Nancy jolt up to see Isaac, blood speckled clothes, Nat
terrified at his side.
BRIDGET
Oh, Jesus!
NANCY
What happened?!
Nat trembles as Isaac pulls rations from his pants. A few
SEALED TIN CANS tumble to the floor. *
NANCY 
Isaac!-
Isaac grabs Nancy gently by the arms.
ISAAC
I hurt some white men. Didn’t have
no choice... *
NANCY
What you gon’ do?
ISAAC
Only thing I can. I gotta go.
Nat breaks free, clings to his father’s leg. Isaac kneels to
Nat’s level.
ISAAC 
You take care of your mama and
Nana, hear?
NAT
When you comin’ back, papa?
ISAAC
I’ll be back, directly.
Isaac takes his son in.
ISAAC 
No matter what, you remember this:
You a child of God. You got
purpose.
5/8/15 - PINK 8
It’s in ya. The Lord put it there
and they ain’t nothing nobody can
do to take it away, ya hear?
NAT
Yessir...
A dog is heard BARKING in the BG. Isaac hugs Bridget, moves * to Nancy who chokes back tears.
ISAAC
I’ll get back soon as I can for
y’all.
I love you, woman.
And with that, Isaac slips from the cabin. A deafening beat,
until- The sound of GALLOPING HOOVES approach in the BG.
Bridget hurries Nat onto his cot, ushers Nancy, who stands
catatonic, to hers. She quickly pulls back a corner mat,
pulls a board loose to revealA
SMALL COMPARTMENT
She hides the stolen food, replaces the board just asBenjamin
Turner opens the cabin door. Cobb trails, holds a
blood-soaked handkerchief tight to his face.
BENJAMIN TURNER
Bridget, Nancy, get on up.
Isaac is in a lot of trouble. I
need y’all to tell me where he is.
BRIDGET
He ain't here massa. We ain’t seen
him all night.
BENJAMIN TURNER *
You sure- *
COBB
Ben, I’m gonna ask you to step * outside. *
Benjamin hesitates. *
COBB  * A white man lost his life tonight. *
You know like I do what that means. *
5/8/15 - PINK 9
18 CONTINUED: 18
ISAAC 
Now I can do my questioning now, or * I can come back after I get my * posse rounded up. Do a thorough *
search of the property. *
A beat, until. *
BENJAMIN TURNER
...any harm done’ll be taken up
with the sheriff.
As Ben exits. Cobb removes the cloth to reveal an ugly gash.
COBB
None of y’all seen him, huh?
5/8/15 - PINK 9A
18 CONTINUED:  18
COBB 
OLD BRIDGET
No, suh.
NANCY
No, suh.
COBB 
What about you, boy?
NANCY
He ain’t seen nothinSMACK!
Cobb backhands Nancy who lands across the room.
COBB
You seen yo’ daddy?
No response. Cobb squats down nose to nose with Nat. Nat
holds his gaze, seemingly unafraid. Shakes his head ‘no’.
COBB 
You that nigger’s boy, alright.
Cobb stands, still eyeing Nat. Bridget’s eyes flit just past
Cobb’s boots. We follow her gaze to see a small WAX-SEALED * GLASS JAR lies just several inches from his heel. Cobb *
uncurls a dirty index finger, points it to Nancy, then to
Nat. As he leans in, his weight shifts on the wooden plank,
the tin can slowly rolls towards his foot.
COBB 
If I find out y’alls is lying, I’m
gonna come back here...
Bridget watches as the can picks up speed, rolls closer.
COBB 
...and the things I’m gon’ do to *
y’all might not be so nice- *
Inches away untilBridget
dives at Cob’s feet.
BRIDGET
Oh’ massa please! Please! We don’t
know nothin’! Oh Lord!
COBB
Get off me!
Cobb struggles from her grip. Benjamin pushes in- *
BENJAMIN TURNER
That’s enough! *
5/8/15 - PINK 10
18 CONTINUED:  18
Cobb straightens before eyeing Nancy. *
COBB
(straightens to exit,
then)
Teach that boy some manners. Next
time he looks me in the eyes, he’s
gon’ to get the same thing that’s
waitin’ for his pa.
With that, he turns and they’re out the door. Bridget’s * hysteria switches to a chilling calm in an instant. She sits
up on the floor, opens her palms to reveal the FOOD JAR. *
ON NAT as his mind struggles to process the night’s events.
19 EXT. WOODS - DAY  19
Young Nat, his skin royal blue, fills the frame. He seems to * look directly at us. *
NAT’S POV *
A shadow moves. Demonic voices permeate the forest around *
him. A CLOAKED FIGURE hides in the distance. Nat senses * something behind him, turns. A MAN lies bowed in prayer, his
back to us. Nat turns back to see THE SHADOWED FIGURE IS ONLY * FEET AWAY. Off his demonic features- *
20 INT. SLAVE QUARTERS - NANA’S CABIN - NIGHT 20
Nat jerks awake, to find himself in Nancy’s arms. Nat bursts
into tears as she holds him, rocking him in her grip.
NANCY
Shh... you’re OK. It ain’t real.
It’s in your mind. It ain’t real.
I’m here, now.
NAT
I want Papa...
NANCY
I know, baby...
Me too.
21 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - BIG HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY 21
Nancy stretches wet cotton sheets across a long clothes line.
Nat can be seen in the BG tossing a ball mad of rags. *

As she reaches into the basket, she rises to find a smiling
Elizabeth Turner.
ELIZABETH TURNER
Mind if I help.

NANCY
No, ma’am.
Nancy and Elizabeth string the sheets in silence untilELIZABETH
TURNER
How’s Nat doin’?
NANCY
He doin’ fine I reckon... Somethin’
wrong, Missus?
ELIZABETH TURNER
No. Nothin’ wrong.
John Clarke told me something this
morning I thought I’d ask you
about.
He said Nat knows how to read.
NANCY
Read? Oh no. He don’t know how to
read. He don’t know nothin’. He
just pulling John Clarke’s leg.
ELIZABETH TURNER
John Clarke said he found him with
a book. Said he knew letters.
NANCY
Nat don’t know nothing ‘bout no
books. He just shiftless. Act like
he ain’t got no sense half the
time.
ELIZABETH TURNER
A part of me couldn't believe it
either... So, I tested him.
A sheet slips from Nancy’s grasp. She catches it before it
hits the grass.
NANCY
Ma’am?
ELIZABETH TURNER
Sure enough, there he was sounding
out letters.
An excruciating beat. The two continue hanging sheets in
tandem. Nancy’s hands tremble.
4/9/15 - WHITE 12
21 CONTINUED: 21
ELIZABETH TURNER 
Have him come by the house tomorrow * after lunchNANCY
Please, Missus. He didn’t mean no
harm. I’ll whip him good when I see
himELIZABETH
TURNER
Whip him? Nonsense. I’m going to
teach him. If the good Lord gave
that boy a gift to read, we’d be
remiss to let it go to waste. Now
have him at the house tomorrow * after lunch, hear?
And don’t expect him back for a few
days. Reading can be tricky.
Lessons best not be disturbed in
the beginning.
Nancy forces a smile.
NANCY
Yes’m.
And Elizabeth saunters away as cheery as when she came. On
Nancy, her face falling.
22 EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - NANA’S CABIN - DAY 22 *
Nancy pulls a burlap shirt over Nat’s head. WIDER to see Nat * wears a pair of sack cloth pants; the first time we’ve seen
him without his tow shirt. *
Nancy and Bridget regard Nat as he studies his new outfit * with pride. *
NANCY *
Hold on. *
Nancy disappears into the Cabin. *
BRIDGET * Now you listen to everything Miss * Elizabeth say. Keep ya head down *
and stay out the way, hear? *
YOUNG NAT *
Yes’m. *
5/8/15 - PINK 13
21 CONTINUED:  21
Nancy emerges from inside, produces a folded piece of cloth. * She and Bridget share a look before she kneels, hands it to
Nat.
NANCY
Yo’ daddy gave me this... And yo’
Nana gave it to him.
Nat unfolds the cloth to reveal-
5/8/15 - PINK 13A
22 CONTINUED: 22
A SMALL WOODEN RELIC. Tribal signs carved on its face.
NANCY 
Don’t you go losin’ it, ya’ hear?
YOUNG NAT
Yes’m.
She gently takes his face in her hands, kisses his cheek * before pulling him into a long hug. Bridget takes Nat’s hand, *
leading him out of the quarters as we hold on Nancy’s look of * despair. *
23 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - BIG HOUSE - DAY 23
Bridget and Nat stand on the Big House porch. She knocks and
a house servant JANICE  pulls open the door.
JANICE
Miss ElizabethElizabeth
arrives, regards Nat with a smile.
ELIZABETH TURNER
There you are.
You tell Nancy not to worry, he’ll
be fine.
BRIDGET
Yes’m.
Bridget watches as Elizabeth guides Nat inside.
ELIZABETH TURNER
First, we gotta get you outta those
rags...
Bridget and Nat share a fleeting look before he disappears
inside, Janice pushing the door shut. And we HOLD on Bridget.
24 INT. TURNER PLANTATION - BIG HOUSE - STUDY - DAY 24
Hundreds of books line the walls. Nat wanders, mouth agape.
5/8/15 - PINK 14
22 CONTINUED:  22
YOUNG NAT
This shol’ is a lot of books.
ELIZABETH TURNER
They come from all over.
Nat reaches out to touch one when ELIZABETH CATCHES HIS HAND.
ELIZABETH TURNER 
These books in here are for white
folks. They’re full of things your
kind wouldn’t understand.
But, I do have a special one, just
for you.
She produces a worn HOLY BIBLE, hands it to Nat.
ELIZABETH TURNER 
And guess what? It’s the best book
ever written.
YOUNG NAT
Can I look?
ELIZABETH TURNER
Of course. It’s yours.
YOUNG NAT
Thank you, Missus.
He flips delicately through the thin pages, his eyes scanning
the foreign words.
ELIZABETH TURNER
You’re a special boy, Nathaniel.
Study hard and heed my instruction,
hear? Your life, it’ll never be the
same. I’ll see to that.
YOUNG NAT
Yes, Missus.
ELIZABETH TURNER
Well come on. The good book won’t
read itself. Let’s start with the
beginning.
Nat, all smiles, as he joins Elizabeth on a nearby couch.
4/9/15 - WHITE 15
24 CONTINUED: 24
25 INT. TURNER FAMILY CHURCH - DAY 25
Nat stands stark still in his black servants suit, chin high.
His Bible rests in his White-gloved hands. Ben Turner stands
just at his flank.
NAT
Draw nigh to God, and he will draw
nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye
sinners; and purify your hearts, ye
double minded. Be afflicted, and
mourn, and weep: let your laughter
be turned to mourning, and your joy
to heaviness. James four, chapter
eight and nine.
A thin white congregation offers polite applause. Elizabeth,
beams. She gestures to Nat to take a bow. He obliges before
joining her, John Clark and her daughter CATHERINE , in
the FRONT PEW. Lead house servant, ISAIAH  and Janice
sit on a single BACK pew.
ON BENJAMIN who pours with sweat, wipes his neck, as he
regains the pulpit. He coughs into a handkerchief, it spots
with BLOOD. He quickly pockets it.
BENJAMIN TURNER
Bless His name. Might as well carry
on in James. Turn with me to James
one. ‘Holding on to the goodness of
the Lord.’
26 INT. BIG HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY 26
TIGHT on Nat. Wider to find Nancy and Bridget standing in
front of Benjamin who lies pale and dead in the bed.
Elizabeth weeps quietly by his side. An UNKNOWN MAN, SAMUEL
TURNER  is the only other person in the room. He leans
against the wall in a far corner. Elizabeth smiles at Nat.
ELIZABETH TURNER
He was most proud of the young man
you’re becoming, Nat.
Nat glances toward Samuel. Elizabeth catches it.
ELIZABETH TURNER 
That’s Samuel. You were a little
young when he left.
He won’t be returning to school...
but will be taking Ben’s place as
your earthly master.
4/9/15 - WHITE 16
Bridget and Nancy offer Samuel smiles of acceptance. Nat
looks to Samuel again, who stares back. ThenSAMUEL
TURNER
How old are you, boy?
YOUNG NAT
Ten, suh.
SAMUEL TURNER
Ima’ want him in the field come
mornin’, ya hear?
NANCY
Yes’suh.
Nat’s face falls. He looks to Elizabeth gut-punched. *
SAMUEL TURNER
That’s it, yall. Go on.
Bridget and Nancy start off, Nat lingers, bewildered. A final
glance to Elizabeth before Nancy ushers him out. *
ELIZABETH TURNER
That boy, Nat. I’ve spent quite a
bit of time with him. He reads,
quotes scripture.
John Clark’s taken a liking to him.
And so have I...
Samuel only looks forward. *
ELIZABETH TURNER 
Maybe the field isn’t a place for a
child of his ability.
The young man he’s becomingSAMUEL
TURNER
He ain’t no young man, mama. He’s a
a foal. And if we’re lucky, he’ll
grow to be a stud.
We owe. We need more of that swamp
drained so we can seed more crop.
Maybe have a season that’ll get us
outta’ this hole daddy left us
in... A reading slave doesn’t get
that done.

With that he strides out of the room. On Elizabeth, a
portrait of defeat.
27 EXT. COTTON FIELD - DAWN 27
Nancy and Nat stand in a row that seems to stretch to
eternity. Nat dons a cotton henley and burlap pants. She
regards him with sad eyes.
NANCY
You gon’ start here and work your
way down yonder.
I’ll be right over there, ya hear.
Nancy pulls him into a helpless hug before crossing into the
next row.

them as they stuff blood speckled cotton into the long sack.
--STILL TIGHT on Nat’s hands, SLIGHTLY BIGGER, as they move
faster, separating the cotton from the bulb, following them
down to a half filled sack.
--AND STILL TIGHT on Nat’s hands, now FULL GROWN as they
breeze expertly from bulb to bulb, stuffing the snow white
tufts into a COMPLETELY FULL sack.
--We follow his hands up bulging forearms and a sweaty
muscular torso to reveal- NAT IS NOW A TWENTY-SEVEN-YEAR-OLD
MAN. Matured African features frame piercing eyes. Nat pulls

thine heart: wait, I say on the

Let us bow our heads.
36 INT. TURNER FAMILY CHURCH - DAY 36
TIGHT on a flaring match as its pressed into a tobacco pipe.
Wider to reveal a fleshy preacher REVEREND WALTHALL 
inhaling smoke. He sits next to Samuel, their eyes fixed
toward something we don’t yet see. They speak in whispers.
REV. WALTHALL
She’ll make a fine wife, indeed.
It’s been a blessing seeing her
develop into the woman she has.
5/8/15 - PINK 19
SAMUEL TURNER
Will be an even better blessin’
seein’ her and mama puttin’ their
feet under his table ‘stead of
mine.
They share a stifled laugh.
REVERSE to reveal CATHERINE TURNER  in a white gown,
stands with her new husband GUILES REESE . They pose
next to a sunlit window. An ARTIST scribbles on a canvas,
capturing the moment.
Back to Samuel and Rev. Walthall.
REV. WALTHALL
She looks content enough.
SAMUEL TURNER
Content? If I had a nickel for
every time she asked me to buy her
a handmaid for mama, I’d have
enough to have bought one by now.
Samuel rises, heads for the exit. Rev. Walthall follows

Samuel and Rev. Walthall exit to find Janice holding a * pitcher of water. She offers Walthall a glass. *
REV. WALTHALL * Bless ya, honey. *
 *
How’s John Clarke?
SAMUEL TURNER
Still in Richmond. Should graduate * next year. Volunteering in the
local militia on his off days.
REV. WALTHALL
The Lord rejoices over that.
SAMUEL TURNER
Yeah, so does my mama- Not so much
the militia part.
“Those boys running around with
guns’ll find themselves a war.” *
As Walthall downs his water, Janice appears, fills his glass. *

it ‘round.
Old Ben would be proud.
SAMUEL TURNER
They God fearing. Simple as that.
Gotta colored preacher that keeps
‘em reminded.
REV. WALTHALL
A colored preacher? That the
remedy?
SAMUEL TURNER
That’s it.
REV. WALTHALL
Well, I don’t gotta tell ya’ times
are tough. With the drought, it’s
getting harder for whites all over
the county to feed and clothe they
niggers good. Talks of
insurrection’s got folks scared.
I’d think people’d pay good money
to have ‘em calmed down a bit.
Especially by one of they own.
SAMUEL TURNER
Calmed down?
REV. WALTHALL
No different from what you got him
doin’ here.
Just sayin’ you might have an
opportunity on your hands.
SAMUEL TURNER
Start askin’ around about that.
REV. WALTHALL
Will do.
Guess I should git. Got a few other
services in county.
SAMUEL TURNER
Busy man, Reverend.
REV. WALTHALL
Never too busy for the Lord’s work.

38 EXT. TURNER MAIN ROAD - DAY 38
Nat steers a colt, as he and Samuel ride in the front of a
covered wagon. Samuel leans back, asleep.
In the distance- SEVERAL GUN SHOTS. The horses fidget.
NAT
Whoa. Whoa, now...
Samuel stirs awake, and weANGLE
ON
The far end of the road where three men approach on horses.
PATTY-ROLLERS. Nat slows the wagon.
As the men arrive, we recognize the leader as Ray Cobb. A
scar stretches from his right eye to his chin, his sun-aged
skin looks more like tanned leather. Jesse and the other stop
at his flank, bloodthirsty.
COBB
You seen a nigger run by here?
SAMUEL TURNER
Naw. Then again I dozed off a
few...
COBB
What about you, boy? You best not
lie. I know when ya’ll is lying.
NAT
No, Suh.
Cobb studies Nat through a familiar squint.
COBB
Couple niggers went missing off

Say they raised up on a overseer
‘for they took off.
Cobb eyes the surrounding woods.
JESSE
Got one just back yonder. Swear I
put one in the ‘nother.
4/9/15 - WHITE 22
37 CONTINUED:  37
COBB
He’s close... I can smell him.
If y’all see somethin’, let us
know.
SAMUEL TURNER
Will do.
Cobb whistles, his horse snaps to. A moment before Sam lies
back, covers his face. Nat loosens the reins. Cobb eyes him
hard as they cross.
AS THE WAGON pushes forward Nat slows at something just off
the road. We RACK FOCUS to reveal the body of a dead slave,
his brains exposed from a head-shot. On Nat, eyes still fixed
forward as he snaps the reigns.
39 EXT. FARMER’S MARKET - WOOD AND SEED STORE - DAY 39
Nat and Samuel load the last wooden slats onto the wagon. Nat
rests on the back as Samuel exits frame.
WIDER to reveal a well-dressed family of three crossing in
the foreground. The MAN , holds a lacquered cane, walks
a pace ahead of the WOMAN  who ushers their SON 
along by the hand. CLOSER on the Son who carries a WOODEN
HAND PUPPET. As the Mother hurries him along, it drops,
unnoticed, in the dirt. A moment laterVOICE
Ma’am...
The woman turns to find Nat, holding the doll.
NAT
The younglin’ dropped it a step
back.
The woman offers a warm smile.
WOMAN
Thank you.
Nat maneuvers the puppets arms, pulling a smile from the boy. * Just as he reaches it back to him- WHAP! The husband’s CANE * comes down hard on Nat’s wrist. The doll hits the dirt as he *
steps between Nat and his wife and child.
MAN
What you think you’re doing?!
WOMAN
He was just-
5/8/15 - PINK 23
38 CONTINUED: 38
MAN
You spoke to my wife?! Where is
your owner, boy?
Nat offers no response. The man swings the cane down hard,
its length striking Nat’s arm. Nat eyes the dirt in rehearsed
passivity.
MAN 
Do you hear me, boy?
The Man swings the cane again, it connects with a CRACK on
Nat’s elbow. Nat grits his teeth. The Man raises it once
more. As he brings it down NAT CATCHES IT. His eyes just
slightly connecting with the Man’s. The man goes white with
fear.
SAMUEL TURNER 
You best go on and put that down.
Nat lets go. The Man stumbles backward, but keeps the cane
raised.
MAN
I want the sheriff. This boy
assaulted me! He assaulted my wife
and I’m bringin’ charges.
SAMUEL TURNER
Sheriff Floyd? You can fetch him if
you like. In the meantime, I’ma
give you the count of three to put
that stick down, else I’ma have to
make sure you have some real
charges to bring to him when he
gets here.
MAN
You threatening me?
SAMUEL TURNER
One.
The Man flinches, lowers the cane. He regards Nat and Samuel
with equal disdain before slinking away, pulling his wife
along with him. Samuel helps Nat to his feet. Nat and the
young boy catch eyes long enough to see the boy’s innocent
face curl into a scowl.
SAMUEL TURNER 
You alright?
4/9/15 - WHITE 24
39 CONTINUED: 39
Think they’re higher than the
Almighty himself... C’mon.
Samuel walks back toward the wagon. Nat eyes the PUPPET on * the ground, it’s painted brown eyes staring back.
40 EXT. FARMER’S MARKET - ROAD - DAY 40
Samuel sits next to Nat who guides the wagon away from the
wood store, passing fresh fruit stands, vegetables stacked on
wagons, and crafts booths. Business men shout toward Samuel,
begging for his business.
A FEW YARDS AHEAD
A YOUNG BOY  stands on the dirt road, bounces a wooden
sign which reads “SLAVE SALE!”.
ANGLE ON a seedy SLAVE DRIVER  who conducts an * impromptu slave sale off the back of an uncovered wagon. FOUR
EXHAUSTED AND RAGGED SLAVES stand naked on the wagon-back. A
few REDNECKS assemble. *
SAMUEL TURNER
Hold on.
Nat slows the wagon as he and Sam look on. The Slave Driver
slaps the backside of a THIN MALE SLAVE. A bony nub at his
right wrist, where a hand should be. The driver spins him.
SLAVE DRIVER
Strong as an ox! Nothing but good
seed flowing from this here buck!
And look at them teeth! I’ll start
this one at two-hundred?
No response. ON NAT who witnesses the spectacle.
SLAVE DRIVER 
One fifty?
I gotta make livin’ here gents.
Dammit, a hundred? Seventy-five?
A REDNECK 1 raises a hand.
SLAVE DRIVER 
Sold!
The Driver motions to his helper who ambles over, ushers the
newly sold slave to the Redneck. Nat watches as the Redneck
roughly inspects him before handing over cash.
5/8/15 - PINK 25
39 CONTINUED:  39
SAMUEL TURNER 
He then fits a shackle around the slave’s neck, climbs atop
his horse and trots off- the slave jogging behind him.
6/15/15 - YELLOW 25A
40 CONTINUED: 40
Nat and Samuel watch the Slave Driver arrive to a YOUNG
WOMAN. Matted hair. A thin worn dress hangs just below her
knees. Nat looks away.
SLAVE DRIVER 
Consider this comely wench! Not a
day over eighteen! We’ll start her
at one seventy-five.
A REDNECK #2 tips his hat.
SLAVE DRIVER 
Got one seventy-five, I hear two?
A REDNECK #3 raises his hand.
SLAVE DRIVER 
Now we talkin! Do I got two twentyfive?
ON NAT as he glances toward the bidding Rednecks. Studies
their body language. He glances to the woman, her eyes
deadened.
REDNECK #2, again tips his hat.
SLAVE DRIVER 
Two-twenty five! I hear two-fifty?!
Nat glances again to the mulling rednecks. ThenNAT
Massa... That wench there’d sho’
make a good weddin’ gift to Ms.
Catherine. You keep sayin’ she been
askin.
SLAVE DRIVER 
Gimmie Two-fifty! C’mon nah!
A long beat. UntilSAMUEL
TURNER
The whole lot of ‘em looks busted
from here. Sides, she look right
young if you ask me.
Angle on Redneck #3 who again raises his hand.
SLAVE DRIVER 
There it is! Two seventy-five?!
4/9/15 - WHITE 26
40 CONTINUED: 40
NAT
You right, suh. She young, but with
the right teachin’, a wench like
that could be working a long time.
Nat steals a look to Samuel who squints toward the stage. The
Slave Driver spins the Slave Woman in a circle, fondles her
brest. She tenses.
SLAVE DRIVER
Now is you fella’s seein’ what I’m
seeing?! Take this one home, clean
her up, won’t be long ‘fore you
find yourself happier than a dog
with three balls!
A few chuckles in response. He spins her back forward.
SLAVE DRIVER 
Smile bitch!
Now come on y’all, talk to me!
You got two seventy-five for me?
Redneck #2 mulls.
NAT
Massa, it’d shole’ be a shame to
watch her go to waste for such a
low price.
SAMUEL TURNER
What you know about what’s little
and what’s a lot?
Nat falls quiet.
SAMUEL TURNER 
Ain’t sure what’s got into you, but
whatever it is, you need to quit
it.
NAT
Yes, suh.
SLAVE DRIVER
Alright! That’s two-fifty goin’
once...
Nat glances back to the woman, when suddenly she GLANCES UP
TO CATCH HIS GAZE.
4/9/15 - WHITE 27
40 CONTINUED:  40
SLAVE DRIVER  
Goin’ twice!
Nat and the woman’s eyes remain locked. The Slave Driver
raises his hand highSAMUEL
TURNER 
Two seventy-five!
The auctioneer freezes. Nat’s eyes flit to Samuel in
disbelief. Redneck #3 eyes Samuel hard.
SLAVE DRIVER
We got two seventy-five! Do. I.
Hear. Three hundred?!
Redneck #2 ambles off. All eyes fix on Redneck #3.
SLAVE DRIVER  * Two seventy-five goin’ once!
ON NAT who holds his breath.
SLAVE DRIVER  *
Two seventy-five goin’ twice!
Redneck #3 finally spits in rebuke, turns and walks off.
SLAVE DRIVER  * And SOLD to the fine gentleman in
the back!
Nat breaths relief, as he and Samuel make their way forward.
41 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - BIG HOUSE - DAY 41
The wagon grinds to a stop. Samuel pulls back the cowhide
flap, peers into the back. He scrunches his face. Nat follows
his gaze.
NAT
She’ll be fine, Suh.
SAMUEL TURNER
Hope you right. Have your mama get
her cleaned up and fed; start
breaking her in.
NAT
Y’suh.

Samuel hops down, trudges toward the house.
41A EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY 41A *
Nat scrambles to the back of the wagon, pulls back the flap
to reveal the woman. He reaches for her and she recoils.
NAT
I ain’t gonna’ hurt you.
Cornered, she only stares. Her eyes weak, but wild.
NAT 
I’m gon’ climb up. Help you out.
That’s all.
Nat kneels on the back of the wagon. As he reaches out to
her, SHE LUNGES INTO AN ATTACK, biting and clawing as they
roll off the back of the wagon. Nat struggles to protect
himself as Hark arrives, pulls her away. She collapses to her
hands and knees sobbing and exhausted. As she heaves for air,
Nat and Hark help to her feet, hurrying her toward the slave
quarters.
42 INT. SLAVE QUARTERS - NANA’S CABIN - DUSK 42
Nancy hurries a pot of water onto the stove as Bridget
prepares a cot. Nat steadies the faint woman in his arms.
BRIDGET * Lay her on over here.
Nat complies.
NAT
She’s burning up.
Nancy pulls out a pouch of herbs, drops them into the boiling * water on the stove.
BRIDGET
Cut me three of those onions,

44 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - BIG HOUSE - DAY 44
Nat kneels, hidden in an inner corner of the front porch. He
applies a fresh coat of white paint to a peeling column.
VOICE 
Now you just smile ya’ hear. Let
them do all the talkin’.
VOICE 2 
Yes’m.
Nat stands to find Nancy and the SLAVE WOMAN climbing the
front porch stairs. She stands unrecognizable, considering
the time we last saw her. Her caramel skin covers full,
healthy features. Her hair is combed and pulled into a braid.
Nat stands just out of their sight. Nancy knocks. Within
seconds, Samuel emerges.
NANCY
Afternoon massa’.
This here Cherry Anne.
CHERRY
Massa’.
Samuel looks Cherry up and down.
4/21/15 - BLUE 30
42 CONTINUED: 42
SAMUEL TURNER
They sure cleaned you up.
Catherine! C’mon out here!
Samuel glances in Nat’s direction. Nat quickly returns to
work, watches from the corner of his eye. Catherine arrives.
SAMUEL TURNER 
This here is Cherry Anne.
CHERRY
Missus.
CATHERINE
Hello.
She launches into a Samuel with a mammoth hug.
CATHERINE 
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
She’s perfect!
Cherry... I bet they named you that
because you’re so sweet.
Cherry smiles politely, Catherine grabs her hand.
CATHERINE 
C’mon, I want you to meet mama.
Catherine and Cherry disappear inside, followed by Samuel.
Nancy stands on the porch for a beat. As she turnsNAT
Mama.
NANCY
Boy, you scared me.
NAT
Sorry.
Thank you.
NANCY
For what?
NAT
For getting her better... For
making her so beautiful.
4/9/15 - WHITE 31

I didn’t do nothin’. That child was
brought into this world already as
beautiful as she could be. But you
knew that already, huh?
Nat smiles.
NANCY 
Love you, Nat.
NAT
Love you, mama.
Nancy descends the stairs. A BEAT before Nat returns to work.
45 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - BIG HOUSE - DAY  45 *
Guiles preps a covered wagon. Catherine hugs Janice as Samuel
looks on. Isaiah loads an arm full of bags in the wagon-back.
JANICE
We shol’ is sad to see you and the
missus go.
CATHERINE
Oh, we’ll be just down the road.
After we get good and settled,
we’ll be back to visit. Sundays for
church and that.
SAMUEL TURNER
Won’t be a second too soon.
Catherine playfully jabs him in the arm.
SAMUEL TURNER 
I’m messin.
You need anything, or he ain’t
treatin’ ya right, you let me know.
CATHERINE
Yes, “big brother”.

You ready mama?
ELIZABETH TURNER
I’m worried about you, Sam. It’s a

They embrace. Guiles helps Elizabeth onto the wagon as Cherry
climbs into the back.
GUILES REESE
Well, guess we’ll be getting on.
SAMUEL TURNER
All right, then. They give you any
trouble... don’t bring 'em back
here.
A shared laugh. As Guiles climbs up, Nat arrives with two
pails of horse feed.
NAT
Massa Sam.
For their trip.
Samuel eyes the two buckets, then.
SAMUEL TURNER
Just one.
46 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - BACK OF WAGON - MOMENTS LATER 46
Nat pulls back the canvas flap, sees Cherry sitting on a
wooden box. Their eyes connect. He loads the bucket of feed.
NAT
Hi.

Nat pulls a small bouquet of flowers from beneath his shirt,
offers them. She accepts.

taken from man, made he a woman,

47 EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY 47
ANGLE ON a straw broom until TWO PAIR OF FEET hop over it and
into frame. WIDER to reveal Hark and a beautiful woman ESTER
.
A dozen slaves stand and clap as Hark and Ester kiss. A
fiddler strikes up a tune and the other slaves form two
parallel rows. NELSON , Ester’s brother claps, as she *
dances down the middle. Hark pulls Nat onto the dance path
and they dance down the path together.
48 EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - DUSK 48
Its dusk. Hark sits on a hollow log. Nat approaches.
HARK
Hey, Nat.
NAT
Hey, brother...
Nat takes a seat next to him.
NAT 
Shouldn't you be somewhere getting
to know your new wife?
HARK
I’ll be getting there directly...

It was beautiful today. Ester is a
good woman.
Hark studies the smoldering fire.

Naw... It’s just, I ain't never had
no needs to look after nothing or
nobody but massa’s horses and pigs.
Now I got a wife. And when she go
on and get the ‘big belly, I’ll
have that child too.
Nat pulls a measured breath, gathers his words.
NAT
The Bible says, “take therefore no
thought for the morrow: for the
morrow shall take thought for the
things of itself.”
Means worrying ain’t gon’ do you no
good. Trust in the Lord, and try to
live your best for him, right now.
And speaking of right now, you need
to go and see to your wife, ‘fore
she go and change her mind.
Hark stands, noticeably relieved. A strong embrace before he
heads off. On Nat, his confidence fading slightly, as he
studies the floating embers.
49 INT. BARN/SLAVE CHURCH - DAY 49
Nat stands before a dozen brown faces.
NAT
Just as the planted crop is
harvested in its own time, so too

The back door opens and several slaves walk in. The last of

NAT
So much time passed... I battled
thoughts that you might’ve been
sold off...
How is it there?
CHERRY
It’s fine. Nothing like what I come
from ‘for here. Most days I’m just
tending to Missus Elizabeth, or
fetchin’ this or that for Miss
Catherine.
NAT
You know if ya’ll are coming back

They study each other, spellbound. Nat extends his hand to
her. ANGLE ON A CLOTH WRAPPED OBJECT. Cherry eyes Nat before
unwrapping it to reveal NAT’S WOODEN TRIBAL RELIC.
NAT
My Nana got it from my granddaddy.
She brought it here when she was
taken from Africa.
CHERRY
Africa?
NAT
She kept it hid. Said it was the
one thing that kept her mind free.
CHERRY
It’s pretty.
She offers it back.
NAT
I want you to have it.
In case I don’t see you for a
while, you’ll have somethin’

CHERRY
I don’t know if it’s right I take
it. ‘Sides I don’t have nothin’ to

CHERRY’S POV as she gazes into a thicket of trees untilNAT
SLOWLY EMERGES FROM THE TREELINE ATOP THE COAL BLACK
HORSE, JUPITER.
Cherry nearly drops the plates. Nat climbs down.
CHERRY 
Nat? What you doing here?
No answer. Nat walks boldly to her, his eyes glued to hers.
He leans in, kisses her softly on her lips.
NAT
I shoulda’ done that earlier today.
CHERRY
You came here to kiss me?
Nat slowly sinks to one knee.
NAT
I ain’t got much. The Lord. My
faith. Mamma. Nana. Up until now, *
it was enough.
Cherry, I’d feel right honored if
you’d be my wife. I’d treat you
right. I’d protect you with my
life... if you’d have me.

Reverend Walthall climbs the porch steps. As he grabs the
railing, it comes off into his hand. He carefully replaces
it, continues to the door and knocks. Samuel arrives, pushes
open the screen door.
SAMUEL TURNER
Reverend. What brings you around
these parts during the week?
Wouldn’t expect to see you til
Sunday.
REV. WALTHALL
There’s never a wrong time to bring
a blessing to a brother in Christ.
SAMUEL TURNER
Oh, Lord. Is this blessin’ gonna
cost me money?
REV. WALTHALL
Ha! Not a penny. The contrary in
fact.
Sam joins him on the porch. They sit on adjacent rockers.

SAMUEL TURNER
That right?
Isaiah serves the drinks, before disappearing into the house.
SAMUEL TURNER 
How much they offering.
REV. WALTHALL
A bit. And these days every bit
counts.
If your boy does to these fellas’
liking, you could bounce back from
the drought, pay off some debt.
Soon enough, find yourself riding
the gravy train with biscuit
wheels.
Samuel stares off as he considers.
SAMUEL TURNER
Whereabouts are we talkin’.
REV. WALTHALL
All in Southampton to start.
SAMUEL TURNER
An all I gotta do is have Nat
preach?
REV. WALTHALL
That’s it.
Now, I’m not vouching for the
character of these fellas, what

REV. WALTHALL
Just the joy of knowing I’m helping
my fellow brother. And...
SAMUEL TURNER
Here it comes...
REV. WALTHALL
If I were to receive a “gift
offering” following the successful
completion of such trips, I
certainly would not object.
A shared smile.
SAMUEL TURNER
You are a caution Reverend. *
REV. WALTHALL
I am but a servant.
First trip’d be day after tomorrow,
if you can pony up by then.
SAMUEL TURNER
Shouldn't be a problem.

Randall sticks out his hand. Samuel shakes it.
ANGLE ON ABNER Who stares daggers into Nat.

Samuel and Nat follow Joseph, Jasper and Abner along a wooded *
path. Joseph walks and talks. *
JOSEPH RANDALL
It’s hard times for small farmers
like you and myself. Breaking even
is hard enough, gettin’ ahead is
impossible. To save some, I cut ‘em
down to a meal a day, per head. A
few of ‘em started gettin’ fidgety,
so I had Abner come down on ‘em. *
The group approaches a dilapidated barn, a PADLOCK secures
the door FROM THE OUTSIDE. Joseph stops short.
JOSEPH RANDALL 
Day or so back, had a few quit on *
work if ya’ can believe it. * Wouldn’t even come out the quarter. *
So I locked ‘em up, the lot of ‘em. *
Hoping the heat and hunger would * bring about their senses. All that *
said, Abner here’s provin’ my only *
real protection. *
Joseph turns to Nat. *
JOSEPH RANDALL 
Now, they needs to mind me, so you * speak on that. They treasure in
heaven from submittin’ and all.
If they gets to moaning and
carrying on, don’t pay ‘em no mind.
They lazy as all hell and’ll do
anything to get out of work.

He’s ready. *
With that Abner keys open the padlock; opens the barn door.

Joseph and Abner lead Nat and Samuel in. Abner lights a

Joseph rejoins Samuel and Abner, leaving Nat standing in the
center of the room. Nat looks to Samuel who looks away.
Through sad eyes, Nat studies the sea of skeletal faces and
festering whip wounds. He swallows, peels open his Bible.

Nat glances toward Randall who smiles and nods him on.
59 EXT. RANDALL PLANTATION - BIG HOUSE - DUSK 59 *
Nat pulls the wagon to the front, just as Samuel and Joseph
descend the porch stairs. Abner trails a few steps back.
JOSEPH RANDALL
You sure you don’t want to stay the * night? Got some fine brandy and a *
couple of choice wenches in the * cellar. We can get Abner to strike *
up the fiddle, sit around the fire
and tell old lies.
Just then, Randall’s daughter LILLY  emerges from inside.
She dons a white dress with a matching ribbon in her hair. As
she gleefully descends the stairs, we notice a tweed rope in
her grip. We follow its length to the opposite end to findIt’s
tied around the neck of a NINE YEAR OLD SLAVE GIRL.
The slave child giggles as she follows Lilly to the front
yard where they frolic through a game of follow the leader.

But I would take a bottle of

JOSEPH RANDALL
Sure can.
Abner disappears inside. Randall produces a wad of bills,
hands it to Samuel. He studies it a beat, before pocketing.
JOSEPH RANDALL 
You’re a smart man, Sam. Bound to
make a fortune off that boy.
Good doing business with ya.
SAMUEL TURNER
Sure.
As Samuel climbs onto the front of the wagon, Abner returns,
hands him a bottle of whiskey.
ANGLE ON ABNER
His eyes locked tight on Nat. Nat holds his gaze until he * spots Jasper further down the road waving goodbye. Nat snaps *
the reins and the wagon lurches forward. Samuel wastes no * time popping the cork on the whiskey, pulling a desperate *
swig.

applying it to Nat’s back. She rubs at his muscles as he * stares absently into the flame of the fireplace. *
CHERRY
You alright?
Nat nods, his eyes settle on Cherry’s dress draped across a
wooden table across the room.

NAT
Madison Hayne. Who’s that?
CHERRY
That’s me.
My momma put this dress on me the

NAT
I can call you Madison if you like?
CHERRY
You can call me whatever you want.
NAT
I’ll call you Queen.
Cherry smiles a beat before her look turns solemn.
NAT 
What’s wrong?
CHERRY

Cherry nods. Nat slowly swings his feet off the bedside,
closes his eyes.

Nat falls to the ground, scurries backwards. Just as the dog
lunges, canines peeledHe’s
yanked back. The dog fights against the weight of a
choke chain, inches from Nat who retreats, pinned against the
wagon wheel.
Nat glances up to find HANK FOWLER (early 30’s, a wad of chew
wedged between rotted teeth). A bullwhip rests on one side of
his hip, a pistol stowed against his other.
HANK FOWLER
Nigger, what you doing on my land?
Samuel arrives as Nat pulls himself to his feet.
SAMUEL TURNER
He’s with me.
HANK FOWLER
Who the hell are you?

Nat looks to Samuel who doesn’t budge.

and children as they pull leaves from the tobacco plants.
CRACK! CRACK!
EARL FOWLER
Come on!
CRACK!
EARL FOWLER
C’mon, nah!
CRACK! The whip cracks near the ear of a SLAVE TEEN MALE. The
teen picks faster. Earl dismounts, holsters his whip.
HANK FOWLER

REVERSE TO REVEAL
TWO MALE SLAVES chained to the wall. One wears an IRON
COLLAR, bells on the tips of its reaching horns. A scar bends
from his temple to his cheek. The other wears an IRON MASK,
saliva seeping from its sides. Earl squares up with the
latter, unlatches his mask. The broken slave can hardly
stand.
EARL FOWLER
You ain’t gon’ eat?
No response. Earl grabs the nearby bowl of cornmush, puts the
spoon to the slave’s mouth. He turns away.

EARL FOWLER 
You wonderin’ why we could use that
nigger of yours, you’re seeing it
first hand.
EARL FOWLER 
Open his mouth. Grab that cornmeal.
Nat and Samuel watch on horrified, as Earl hammers out the
male slave’s teeth.
EARL FOWLER 
If it ain’t the Yanks, it’s the
drought...
Hank holds the slave’s mouth open, as Earl forces the
cornmeal through the funnel and into the man’s throat. Blood,
teeth and cornmeal seep as he gags.
EARL FOWLER 
If it ain’t the drought, it’s
goddamn mutiny.
Earl wipes his hands, regards Nat without missing a beat.
EARL FOWLER 
Truth is, even the meanest nigger
fears the gospel. A good word from
your boy here... a disciplined word
might go a lot further than my
pistol would.
SAMUEL TURNER
Well, Nat... he’s a good preacher.
EARL FOWLER
Don’t right mind how good he is.
Long as he say what he s’pose to.

NAT
Mr. Fowler, suh. Regarding my
sermon, my plan is to foment in

EARL
Concup what?
Samuel, out of earshot, looks on with growing concern.
NAT
Massa I’m askin’ if you’s opposed
to me using singin’ to keep yo’
niggers down? As means to sing away
any ‘malignance.’
EARL FOWLER
That’s fine. Ain’t got no quarrel
with singin’. Long as it don’t
interfere with they workin’.
NAT
Yes, suh. Thank you, suh.
Nat turns to the slaves, his subservience thaws, his jaw
tightening slightly.
NAT 
Brethren... I pray you sing to the
Lord a new song. Sing praise in the
assembly of the righteous. Let the
saints be joyful in glory; Let them
sing aloud on their beds. Let the
high praises of God be in the
mouths of the saints, and a twoedged
sword in their hand, to
execute vengeance on the demonic
nations, and punishments on those
peoples!
Nat builds, as Samuel studies Earl, who watches on seemingly
oblivious to Nat’s innuendos.

nervous smile before clinking his fork against a crystal
glass. The room settles.
SAMUEL TURNER
As you know, this annual dinner was

For all he believed, he made sure
family, faith and tradition were at

Excuse me.
Nat turns to find a white man ETHELDRED “E.T.” BRANTLEY
, hat in hand.
E.T. BRANTLEY
I’m looking for a preacher called
Nat.
91 INT. TURNER PLANTATION - BIG HOUSE - FOYER - LATER 91
Nat stands before Elizabeth and Jethro. Just past Nat,
Brantley mulls on the other side of the screen door.
NAT
He’s been banned from every church
in the county for his sinsJETHRO
He’s lucky it’s all he got for what
he done.
NAT
The world has its way with dealing
with the immoral. Above all, those
who cast that immorality onto
children as he has. But, no one is
without sin, Miss Elizabeth.
This man wants to repent and be
delivered. As a shepherd of the
Lord, it’s my duty to serve... So,
I’d like to baptise him.
4/9/15 - WHITE 69
JETHRO
The hell you will!
ELIZABETH TURNER
Jethro, you will mind your mouth.
JETHRO
With respect, Ms. Elizabeth, a
nigger can’t baptise no white man.
I just think you should wait for
Mr. Samuel to get back.
Elizabeth studies Nat.
JETHRO 
Ms. Elizabeth, you can’t let this
go onELIZABETH
TURNER
Jethro, go wait in the front yard.
JETHRO
But ma’amELIZABETH
TURNER
I won’t ask you again.
Jethro seethes. A murderous glare as he passes NatJETHRO
Boy, you gon’ get it.
And he’s out the door, leaving Nat and Elizabeth alone.
ELIZABETH TURNER
You sure you want to do this, Nat?
Samuel may not like it, nor will a
lot of other folks around here.
NAT
Don’t think I have a choice,
Missus. This man still belongs to
God. And to stand between God and
his people is a dangerous place to
be.
A long beat, untilELIZABETH
TURNER
You have my blessing.
NAT
Thank you, Missus.

92 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - RIVER - DAY 92
Nat stands in waist deep water, Brantley before him. Nancy, *
Bridget, Hark and others watch from the river bank. Jethro * stands further back. If looks could kill. *
NAT
Do you confess your sins before
God?
E.T. BRANTLEY
Yes, I do.
NAT
Cross your arms.
Brantley complies. Nat bends Brantley backwards into the
water, covering his face before propping him back upright. A
few slaves clap as Brantley wipes his face, offering Nat a
misty-eyed smile.
E.T. BRANTLEY
Thank you, Sir.
NAT
Go and sin no more.
Brantley nods as he trudges back toward the riverbank. ON Nat
as he stands alone in the water, staring toward the bank.

I been good to you ain’t I?
93 EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - NAT’S CABIN - DAY 93
Nat is sat on a narrow chopping block, stares forward.
Samuel, Jethro and Reverend Walthall stand before him. A
SHOTGUN rests in the crux of Jethro’s arm. Angle on Hark
unnoticed in the BG feigning work.
SAMUEL TURNER
My whole family has. And you go and
do this to me?! A nigger, baptizing
a white man on my property. You
know how this makes me look?!
Nat only stares forward.

SAMUEL TURNER 
Boy, you had better say something
and quick.
NAT
“Take heed therefore unto
yourselves, and to all the flock,
over the which the Holy Ghost hath
made you overseers, to feed the
church of God, which he hath
purchased with his own blood.”
Silence. Samuel and Rev. Walthall share an incredulous look.
REV. WALTHALL
“Exhort servants to be obedient
unto their own masters, and to
please them well in all things; not
answering again-”
NAT
“You were bought with a price; do
not become slaves of men-”
REV. WALTHALL
“But he that shall blaspheme
against the Holy Ghost hath never
forgiveness, but is in danger-”
NAT
“Beware of false prophets who come
in sheep’s clothing but inwardly
are ravening wolves!”
REV. WALTHALL
YOU BLACK BASTARD!

Nat looks Samuel straight in the eye.

In a flash, Samuel snatches Jethro’s shotgun, smashing the
hilt into Nat’s mouth with a CRACK! Nat hits the ground
stunned, blood spilling.
SAMUEL TURNER
Get him on the post.
Jethro snatches him by the shirt. On Hark who takes a step
forward. Nat’s look waves him off.
94 EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - COURTYARD - POST - DAY 94
Nancy, Bridget and other slaves gather, as we reveal Nat
strapped to a wooden post, centered in the middle of the
courtyard. Hark and Nelson arrive, soon joined by another
slave, SIMON. Jethro paces behind Nat, dragging a ten-foot
long whip. He looks to Samuel who nods, then exits toward the
Big House. Bridget leads Nancy away as Jethro goes to Nat and
rips off his shirt.
JETHRO
Told ya’ you was gon’ get it.
95 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - BIG HOUSE - PORCH - DAY 95
Samuel bounds toward the Big House, spots Elizabeth. A sudden
CRACK in the distance. Samuel stops, locks eyes with her. The
cracking of the whip continues over their silence. She holds
his gaze.
CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!
He strides past her and into the house, slamming the door

Jethro straightens, staggers away.
We move in CLOSE on Nat’s near-lifeless eyes. His eyes slowly
drift closed, untilA
FAINT GLOW OF LIGHT ILLUMINATES HIS FACE.
REVERSE to revealA
CANDLE HAS BEEN PLACED IN FRONT OF NANCY’S CABIN.
Nat wills his eyes open. THE LIGHT ACROSS HIS FACE BRIGHTENS.
We again REVERSE to revealMore
candles have been placed in front of various slave
cabins. We see the door of another slave cabin open, an arm
produces a candle. Another cabin and another- until the
entire courtyard glows.

legs supporting his body’s weight. Off Nat’s determinationCUT

99 EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - COURTYARD - POST - DAY 99
Samuel and Jethro arrive to find Nat alive and fully alert.
Despite his gaunt features and the infected puss bubbles
protruding from his back, he supports his own weight.
SAMUEL TURNER
You learned your lesson, boy?
Nat, wild eyed, looks just close enough to Samuel to avoid
eye contact. Something unnerving about his subservience.
NAT
Oh, yes ‘suh. I’ve learned.
5/8/15 - PINK 74
SAMUEL TURNER
Let him off.
Jethro unlocks the stock. Nat stands up straight for the
first time in days, his entire body trembling involuntarily.
SAMUEL TURNER 
You done preachin’ for a while.
Don’t want you goin’ off with no
groups unless me or Jethro is
there, ya hear?
NAT
Yes, suh.
SAMUEL TURNER
Go on and get cleaned up. Want you
back in the field come mornin’.

Yes, suh.
As Samuel and Jethro walk off, Hark approaches.
HARK
Nat, you alright?
Nat collapses, face-planting in the dirt.
100 INT. SLAVE QUARTERS - NANA’S CABIN - DUSK 100
Nat lies on a cot, his back covered with steaming strips of
cotton. Bridget sits at his side. Nancy arrives with a thin
blade and a bottle of brown liquid. Bridget slowly peels back
a cotton strip to reveal an infested wound. She takes the
blade, cuts a shallow incision into the bubbled flesh.
BRIDGET
I watched your grandfather die. In
the old land. Saw him give up the
ghost with my own eyes. And he saw
me. He harnessed the Holy Spirit
that day. Yes he did.
She applies pressure to the wounds, sending blood and puss
oozing from his flesh.
BRIDGET 
I was proud of him. So proud. I
still thank God he died that day.
That he didn’t live to see what I
seen... To watch a strong man
broken down is a terrible thing.

Nat staggers in from the intense day of work. Sweat and dried
blood crust his shirt to his back. He spots Bridget in her
chair, faced toward the stove.
NAT
Hey Nana.
Nat grimaces as he peels off his shirt. Several lines of
fresh stitches.
NAT 
Stitches held up good...
Nat rinses his hands and face in a nearby pot of water,
suddenly stops. He looks to Bridget, walks to her.
NAT 
Nana?
Her lifeless eyes fixed forward. A needle and thread rests
between her fingers, a half sewn pair of pants in her lap.
102 INT. SLAVE QUARTERS - NANA’S CABIN - DAY 102
TIGHT on Nat’s face. His eyes cast down at something we don’t
yet see. We PULL BACK to reveal Bridget’s body wrapped head
to toe in linen on a plank table behind him. We continue to
pull back to find his eyes set on his closed Bible. He flips
toward the back.
“Ephesians 6:5-6 - Servants, be obedient to them that are
masters...”
“Matthew 5:38 -If anyone strikes you on the right cheek...”
“Luke 6:27 Do good to those who hate you, bless those who
curse you...”

Bridget’s funeral has long ended. Nat stands before her fresh
grave. Dozens of single flowers litter a wooden cross. In the
BG Hark arrives.
HARK
You alright?
NAT
Mostly.
I need you to round up a few men we
can trust. Have ‘em meet us near
the big cyprus at Cabin Pond, night

Hark eyes him, nods. A beat before Hark turns to leave.
NAT 
Hark...
He’s still here, brother. Even now.
104 EXT. DISMAL SWAMP - CABIN POND - NIGHT 104
Nat sits alone in front of a small smoldering brush fire. A *
few seconds pass before Hark and THREE OTHER MEN emerge from * the dark. Nat stands, meets them. Hark is flanked by SIMON
, Nelson and WILL (THE SLAVE WE RECOGNIZE FROM FOWLER
PLANTATION).
HARK
This is Simon. Samuel bought him a
month back in Norfolk.

Hold on. You come from Randall’s.
JASPER

Jasper timidly complies. Nat studies the faces before him.
NAT 
Let’s pray... Heavenly father, we
come to you this evening to thank
you for the gift of your Word. We
pray you guide our hearts and minds
that we may follow your will alone.
In Jesus’ name...

sections and pages I’ve been
allowed...

NAT 
But, I’ve gone back into this Word.
All of it. With new eyes. I see now
that for every verse they use to
support our bondage, there is a
truth demanding our freedom. For
every line they use to justify our
torture, there’s another that damns
them to hell for those actions.
They say by the darkness of our
skin, we’ve been cursed. That God’s
called our children and our
children’s children to be beast of
burden until death. That He’s
called our wives and daughters to
warm their bellies in the night...
This isn’t the word of the God I
serve.
He lets this sink in.
NAT 
The Lord has spoken to me; visions
of what is to come. A rise of good
against evil. “The first will be
last and the last will be first”...
We’ve been chosen.
NELSON
What we gon’ do?
NAT
The same as David and Gideon-and
Joshua and Sampson...
We will fight.
SIMON

SIMON
But they got guns.
NAT
We’ll take the armory in Jerusalem.
We’ll have guns too.
HARK
Jerusalem?
NAT
That’s right. We’ll start at
Turner’s, then fight our way there.
By then we’ll number in the
hundreds- thousands even. The
grapevine’s ablaze with talk of
fightin’. Slaves just like us, all
over, havin’ meetings. Waitin’ for
somethin’. Waitin’ for us.
The others don’t look so sure.

If ever there was a time to have
faith my brothers, it’s now.

Nat allows him in, but not before a quick glance outside.
NAT
Something wrong?
ISAIAH
There’s much wrong. 
Whether you consider me a friend or
not, I don’t know. But I care what
happens to you. The same way I care
about what happens to every other
soul on this property...

ISAIAH 
While I’m not privy to what was

it couldn't have been entirely...
productive.
Now, I don’t know what ideas swirl
in your head, but I’ve lived enough
to know the result of certain ideas
won’t lead to what you want.
NAT
All I want, I want for the
oppressed people of God.
ISAIAH
Do you want death for them? For
your wife and daughter?
NAT
If it be God’s will.
ISAIAH
God’s will? Who’s selected you the
instrument of such things?
NAT
He has.
ISAIAH
You walk a dangerous line.
NAT
In his ordered steps.
ISAIAH
And you’re sure it’s him doing the
“ordering”.
Nat only stares.
ISAIAH 
I may live in the house, but my
head isn’t in a hole. I know whites
are wrong for what they’ve done and
continually do. But I also know a
man of God is called to lead in
love. Anything else will only leave
us all worse off.
Isaiah studies him a beat before reaching into his suit
jacket, pulling from it a BOOK. CLOSER to reveal it is the
book Janice took from the shelf.

ISAIAH 
He is a God of love, Nat. Don’t

Nor will I forget he is a God of
wrath.
Isaiah turns back locks eyes with Nat a beat, before slipping
from the cabin.
107 EXT. COTTON FIELD - DAY  107
Nat pulls a near full cotton bag through a row. He glances up
to notice several slaves have stopped picking, their gazes
directed upward. A shadow creeping across their faces. Nat
follows their eyes to seeTHE
MOON PASSING IN FRONT OF THE SUN IN A BRILLIANT ECLIPSE.

A BODY explodes through the second floor window, lands in a
bloody, lifeless heap! Jasper nearly jumps out of his skin.
Before anyone else can reactThe
front door crashes open and a man we recognize as Earl

pursuit, gaining on him with every step.
EARL runs wildly, until he suddenly STOPS, realizing he

Will’s axe hacks into his neck. Will straddles Earl’s body,

forest, arriving to a clearing. Nat studies the treeline as
men continue to trickle in. Nearly fifty men in all. Even as
the last man emerges, Nat continues to eye the trees.
NAT
This all of us?
HARK
This it.
Hark studies the light part of the sky, smiles, then * chuckles. *

By now, I’d be two row’s down. Half

Laughter from the group.

 * But not today. *
NAT * No, suh. *  *
On to Jerusalem?
HARK
On to Jerusalem.
The phrase echoing through the ranks as Nat and Hark share a
look.
128 EXT. JERUSALEM - ARMORY - DAWN 128
A thick fog sits on the road. The Armory sits quietly on a
cul-de-sac in the distance.
129 EXT. JERUSALEM - ARMORY ENTRANCE - DAWN 129
Nat and Hark, armed, stand on the main road. Dozens of rebels
stand in ranks behind them, weapons ready.

Nat squints in the distance.
SILENCE AS THEY WAIT
Finally, RAYMOND COBB steps from within a bricked archway, *
JESSE steps out, loyal at his side. Cobb regards Nat across
the hundred yard stretch.
COBB
Throw down them weapons! Lay on the
ground!
CLOSER TO REVEALNeither
Nat, nor his men budge. A beat before A GROUP OF OVER
FIFTY ARMED, LOCAL WHITES emerge from hidden positions within
the brick cul-de-sac.
NAT
The LORD is our light and our
salvation, whom shall we fear?
We slowly track across the faces of the rebels as they eye
their adversaries. Cobb barks orders as the armed whites
scramble to line themselves up.
NAT  
When the wicked, even our enemies
and our foes, came upon us to eat
up our flesh, they stumbled and
fell...
A white man fastens a BAYONET onto his rifle. We pass Will...
NAT  
Though a host should encamp against
us, our hearts shall not fear:
Cobb unholsters his pistol. We pass Hark....
NAT  
...though war should rise against
us... in this will we be confident!
We arrive back to Nat, eyes focused and wild.
NAT 
REBEL!
Nat charges toward Cobb and his men, his rebels close behind.
Cobb lets out his own battle cry as he and his men charge!
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
5/8/15 - PINK 93
129 CONTINUED: 129
Men from both sides are killed instantly.
The two sides slam into each other with the sound of thunder!
Nat, fires his rifle, tosses it before pulling his axe and
sword. He swings both, connecting with flesh.
Cobb wields a RIFLE with an attached BAYONET. He plunges its
point into passing rebels.
Will crushes a white man’s head with the broad side of his
axe, before burying the sharp side into another man’s chest.
Hark fights off two men, with an empty rifle. He smashes one
unconscious with the butt before Jesse arrives, grabs him in
a choke from behind. He holds Hark as another charges with
his bayonet. Just as Hark is nearly pierced, he head-butts
Jesse, spinning him in front and into the blade.
Nat, kicks a man in the groin, raises his sword to swipe whenBANG!
A bullet pieces his shoulder. He drops his sword,
stumbling backward.
REVERSE to reveal Cobb holding a rifle. He rushes Nat, lunges
at him with his bayonet. Nat catches the barrel, hip tosses
him to the ground and pounces. The two roll until Cobb lands
on top. Cobb locks both hands around Nat’s neck in a choke.
Nat spots his sword just feet away, but just out of reach. He
fights at Cobb’s grip, finally separating two fingers,
breaking them backwards with a SNAP!
A monstrous left slumps Cobb to his side. Nat reaches,
snagging his sword as he climbs atop Cobb. Cobb strains
against Nat’s weight as Nat presses the sword tip toward
Cobb’s neck.
IN THE BG a white man is seen rushing toward Nat. He raises
his rifle and IS TACKLED out of the frame.
Nat’s sword pierces Cobb’s neck. He pushes it deeper, their
eyes remaining locked. Finally the sword’s hilt is pressed to
Cobb’s neck, pinning him into the ground below. Nat watches
until the last sign of life is gone.
Nat rises, his shoulder stained red from the gun shot. As he
looks around, we see only rebels stand- the ground littered
with bodies, black and white. A few white men can be seen
retreating in the distance. He locks eyes with Hark, both out
of breathNAT
C’mon!

Nat pulls his sword, grabs a nearby weapon and sprints toward
the Armory. Hark, Will and the remaining rebels, joining him.
130 EXT. JERUSALEM - ARMORY - MORNING 130
Nat and the rebels sprint into the cul-de-sac, arriving at
the Armory door. Will steps forward, smashes the lock with an
axe handle.
NAT
Line up!
HARK
Guns comin’!
The rebels toss axes and shovels aside as, line up as Nat and
Hark surge the entrance.
131 INT. ARMORY - SAME 131
Nat, Hark and others storm in to find dozens of stacked
crates.
NAT
Open em’ up and pass ‘em back!
The men begin cracking open the crates. Nat opens one himself
and his face falls.

crates EMPTY, HEAVY STONES sit in place of guns.

Gunfire rips through the slat walls. *
NAT’S POV *
-Outside the armory door, bullets perforate the exposed * rebels as they are attacked from every angle. *
Nat spots INFANTRY OF THE STATE MILITIA stand on rooftops and *
in widows of the surrounding cul-de-sac buildings. Their fire *
power continues to bear down on the rebels inside. *
Nat, Will, Hark and the remaining others crouch low, dodging * fire. Without warning, Will stands, storms outside it is met * with gunfire. *

Nat crawls towards the open door. As he reaches to close it, *
he spots two MILITIA SOLDIERS wheeling a CANNON. As they aim * it toward the armory door- *
NAT * Get back! *
SLOW MOTION as the cannon erupts, Nat diving for cover just *
before impact- BOOM! *
BLACK *
Nat emerges from beneath the loose rubble, his face and body * covered in ash-like dust and dirt. Daylight pours in from the * cannon’s exit blast at the back of the room. *
Nat spots Hark, a thick shard of shrapnel lodged deep between *
his collarbone. Nat crawls to him, struggles to drag him * towards the exit. Hark waves him off as he holds his wound. *
HARK * Go on. You gotta lead. *
A beat before they embrace. Nat sees a few other rebels * emerging from the debris. *
NAT *
Come on!
He helps three rebels through the opening, offers Hark a
final look, before exiting.
We stay with Hark, blood gushing through his fingers with
every breath.
134 INT. WOODS - DAY 134
Nat darts through the woods alongside a few of his men.
Finally, they stop. Only three rebels remain. Gunshots ring
out in the distance. The men crowd in. Nat barks instruction,
using his finger to draw a map in the dirt.
NAT
OK, we’re right here, about three
miles away from Cabin Pond. That’s
there we’ll regroup. Any other
survivors’ll meet us there...
Nat takes in the faces of his men. A closer look shows they
aren’t men at all, but boys.
5/8/15 - PINK 96

How old are you?
REBEL BOY 1

You’ve done good. You’ve been brave
in fighting...
But, it’s time to go home. If you
get stopped on the way, tell them
you didn’t have anything to do with
this. Tell them you ran when the
killing started.
The boys slowly stand, unsure.
NAT 
Go’on, now.
They run off into the woods, leaving Nat alone.
135 EXT. DISMAL SWAMP - DAY 135
Nat runs through the swamp, splashing through the soggy
marsh. He stops at a massive overturned tree, catches his
breath. He burrows beneath the tangled roots.

ANGLE ON a YOUNG WHITE SOLDIER, musket raised, as he arrives

Nancy hover just behind. Nancy holds Joanna who cries.
GENERAL CHILDS
You don’t know where he is?

ELIZABETH TURNER

GENERAL CHILDS
Elizabeth, I’ve known you a long

you and your family, but you’re
interfering with something real
important. A lot of people were
killed the last twenty-four hours.
6/15/15 - YELLOW 98
ELIZABETH TURNER
I know. One of them was my son.
GENERAL CHILDS
So Samuel sent you here to ‘help

NANCY
Yes, suh.
GENERAL CHILDS
How long before the killin’ did you

NANCY
Oh, suh, I don’t know nothing about
no killin- *
ELIZABETH TURNER * General! *
GENERAL CHILDS
Go get me that boy...
Why would Samuel send a field hand
to help in the house?
ELIZABETH TURNER * Our hands often go from field to
house when needed. Not every family
treats their slaves with your level
of savagery.
GENERAL CHILDS
Not every slave treats their
masters with the level of savagery
yours done.
Childs’ lieutenant returns with a terrified Simon.
GENERAL CHILDS 
Boy, what did Samuel tell you that
night? You lie to me, I’ll kill ya.
SIMON
Massa Samuel told me to bring Miss
Nancy to help out for a day or two.

ELIZABETH TURNER
If you’re done with your questions,
we’d like to get back to mourning.
General Childs tosses the paper, onto the table, along with
several coins.
ELIZABETH TURNER 
What’s that for?
GENERAL CHILDS
We’re taking the boy.
Simon’s face falls. *
ELIZABETH TURNER
You most certainly are not!
GENERAL CHILDS
Let’s go.
JOHN CLARK
Everything will be alright, mama.
As John Clark and Elizabeth embraceJOHN
CLARK 
They ain’t gon’ find him. Not

He offers a solemn smile before he joins General Childs, his
Lieutenant and Simon. They exit, leaving only silence, untilA

General Childs mounts his horse, tips his hat to Elizabeth

A viewing platform, where Nat spots John Clark who stands at * the flank of General childs. A million words unspoken. Nat’s *
eyes then drift to Jasper who stands amongst patrons. Nat *
studies Jasper who struggles to hold his gaze.
Nat’s face softens a beat, as he offers the faintest nod of
forgiveness. The sheriff motions for the roaring crowd to
settle. Within minutes, the area is near silent, save a few
scattered slurs.
SHERIFF

Nat regards the people. Then, with a firm voiceNAT

The sheriff exits and the crowd’s energy escalates to near
