In the brightest hour of my darkest day
I realized what is wrong with me
Can't get over you, can't get through to you
It's been a helter-skelter romance from the start
Take these memories that are haunting me
Of a paper man cut into shreds
By his own pair of scissors
He'll never forgive her, he'll never forgive her
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Sitting by a fire on a lonely night
Hanging over from another good time
With another girl, little dirty girl
You should listen to this story of a life
You're my heroin
In this moment, I'm lonely, fulfilling my darkest dreams
All these drugs, all these women
I'm never forgiven, this broken heart of mine
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go
One last kiss 
Before I go 
Dry your tears 
It is time to let you go
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
One last kiss 
Before I go 
Dry your tears 
It is time to let you go
One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go
One last kiss
