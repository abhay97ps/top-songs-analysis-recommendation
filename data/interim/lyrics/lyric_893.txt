You say you love me
And I believe you do
You really really love me 'cause I love you
I don't wanna take a chance
I don't wanna take a chance
I don't wanna take a chance and come out
Oh, and come out
And come out
Only losing in
I still remember the last love I had
Left me so blue
And oh-so sad
But I just wanna let you know
I don't wanna take a chance
I don't wanna take a chance
I don't wanna take a chance and come out
Oh, and come out
And come out
Only losing in
I've had lonely days, oh
And lonely nights
That's something that I don't wanna go through
No, no
Just give my heart some time
And I know I'll make up mind
When I give it up
I'm gonna give it up to you
You, you, you, you
One day, baby
When my heart is stronger
And I'll have this fear no longer
Maybe then I'll come running to you
But right now
I don't wanna take a chance
I don't wanna take a chance
I don't wanna take a chance and come out
Oh, and come out
And come out
Only losing in
