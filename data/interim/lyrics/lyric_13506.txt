Sudden darkness creeps into your soul
Envy moves the light of self control
The cage that holds you captive has the door
Burnin' with determination to even up the score
Hearts on fire
Strong desire
Rages deep within
Hearts on fire
Fever's risin', high
The moment of truth draws near
Time will not allow you to stay still, no
Silence breaks the heart and bends the will
Defense is guilty passions out of control
Rules and regulations have no meaning any more
Hearts on fire
Strong desire
Rages deep within
Hearts on fire
Fever's risin', high
The moment of truth is here
Oh!
Is here
Oh yeah!
Hearts on fire
Strong desire
Rages deep within
Fever's risin', energizin'
Right up till the end
Hearts on fire 
Strong desire
Rages deep within
