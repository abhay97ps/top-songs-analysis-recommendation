She rolled in
My little sandy town
She spent the summer there
A couple houses down
Well it was magic in the air
When she caught my eye
We shared three short months
And one long goodbye
She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah, the one that got away
Well she kissed my lips
Down on Ocean Drive
She set my world on fire
On the fourth of July
We wrote our names in the sand
Under the star-soaked sky
But it washed away like she did
With the rising tide
She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah, the one that got away
Every summer that rolls around
I'm looking over my shoulder
Wishing I could see her face
Wishing I could hold her
She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah, the one that got away
Yeah, she was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
She was the one that got away
She rolled in
My little sandy town
She spent the summer there
A couple houses down
