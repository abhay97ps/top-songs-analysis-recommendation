Forget your troubles 
Come on, get happy 
You better chase all your cares away 
Shout hallelujah 
Come on, get happy 
Get ready for the judgement day 
The sun is shining
Come on get happy 
The lord is waiting to take your hand 
Shout hallelujah 
And just get happy 
We are going to the promise land 
We're heading across the river
Soon your cares will all be gone
There'll be no more from now on
From now on
Forget your troubles 
And just get happy 
You better chase all your blues away 
Shout hallelujah 
And just get happy 
Happy times 
Happy nights 
Happy days are here again
