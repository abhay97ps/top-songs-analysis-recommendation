You said you didn't need her
You told her goodbye 
You sacrificed a good love
To satisfy your pride
Now you wish that you still had her 
And you feel like such a fool
You let her walk away
Now it just don't feel the same
Gotta blame it on something
Gotta blame it on something
Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah
You can blame it on the rain
Should've told her you were sorry 
Coulda said you were wrong
But no, you couldn't do that
You had to prove you were strong
Oh, if you hadn't been so blinded 
She might still be there with you
You want her back again
But she just don't feel the same
Gotta blame it on something
Gotta blame it on something
Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah
Come on and blame it on the rain
'Cause the rain don't mind
And the rain don't care
You've got to blame it on something
Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah
You can blame it on the rain
You can blame it on the rain
Blame it on the rain
Blame it on the rain, baby
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Blame it, blame it on the rain
Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah
Gotta blame it on something
Gotta blame it on something
Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah
You can blame it on the rain
