There's a story I want you to know
'Bout my baby - how I love him so
There's no other like my baby
No, no, no, no
I wanna tell you now
There's no other, don't mean maybe
No, no, no, no
Walkin' down the street in a crowd
Looking at my baby, feeling so proud
There's no other like my baby
No, no, no, no
While at at a dance, my baby by my side
He whispers to me someday I'll be his bride
There's no other like my baby
No, no, no, no
 No, no not like my baby
 No, not like my baby
 He's not like my baby
I wanna tell ya now
There's no other like my baby, oh no
