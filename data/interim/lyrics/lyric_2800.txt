Twas just a garden in the rain
Close to a little leafy lane
A touch of Heaven
Neath skies of gray
The raindrops
Kissed the flowerbeds
The blossoms raised
Their thirsty heads
A perfumed thank you
They seemed to say
Surely, here was charm
Beyond compare to view
Maybe it was just that
I was there with you
Twas just a garden in the rain
But then the sun came out again
And sent us happily on our way
And sent us happily on our way
