You know what you wanna do
See, I'll never ever go nowhere yet
Think of all the times
Baby, we've been freakin' from dusk 'til dawn
And I'm still not ready to go on
That's the way it flows when it gets real good
Back to back flexin' my manhood
 Why does it got to be so good
 Girl, you know you got me hooked
 Girl, you know you got me shook
 And I ain't goin' nowhere
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair 
I'm not ready to go nowhere
I'm not ready to get my clothes and go
Girl, I'm ready to start over again
I wanna go on and on and on and on
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair
I wanna go on and on and on and on
Girl, I'm ready to start over again
This freaky escapade has got me going
It gets better when it keeps on flowin'
I broke you off all night and I'm not tired
Bring your body here and take me higher
 Why does it got to be so good
 Don't you know you got me hooked
 Girl, you know you got me shook
 And I ain't goin' nowhere
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair 
I'm not ready to go nowhere 
I'm not ready to get my clothes and go
Girl, I'm ready to start over again
I wanna go on and on and on and on 
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair
I wanna go on and on and on and on 
Girl, I'm ready to start over again
Baby, we've been at it all night long 
I'm not ready  to end it while it's still strong (While it's still
Strong, baby)
As I look and see the sunshine  through the window (Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know I should be gone  but I can't let go 
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair 
I'm not ready to go nowhere
I'm not ready  to get my clothes and go
Girl, I'm ready to start over again
I wanna go on and on and on and on 
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair
I wanna go on and on  and on and on 
Girl, I'm ready to start over again 
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair 
I'm not ready to go  nowhere 
I'm not ready to get my clothes and go 
Girl, I'm ready to start over again 
I wanna go on and on and on and on
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair
