Mary Hill used to hang out in Cherry Hill Park
The game she played lasted all day 'til way after dark
All the girls they criticized her
But all the guys just idolized her
'Cause Mary Hill was such a thrill after dark
In Cherry Hill Park
Mary Hill loved to ride on the merry-go-round
All the guys got eager eyes watchin' Mary go 'round
In the daytime Mary Hill was a teaser
Come the night she was such a pleaser
Oh, Mary Hill was such a thrill after dark
In Cherry Hill Park
Oh, Mary Hill sure was fun down at Cherry Hill Park
Playin' games with everyone 'til way after dark
And then one day, Mary Hill, she married away
A man with money said, "Come on honey", and she said, "OK"
She went away to play a one-man game
And since that day it ain't been the same
'Cause Mary Hill was such a thrill after dark
Down in Cherry Hill Park
Ah, Mary Hill sure was fun down at Cherry Hill Park
Playin' games with everyone 'til way after dark
In Cherry Hill Park 
In Cherry Hill Park 
Whoa, Cherry Hill Park, yeah
