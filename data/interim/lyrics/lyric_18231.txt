You are the flame in my heart
You light my way in the dark, you are the ultimate star
You lift me up from above
Your unconditional love takes me to paradise
I belong to you
And you... you belong to me too
You make my life complete
You make me feel so sweet
You make me feel so divine
Your soul and mind are entwined before you I was blind
But since I've opened my eyes
And with you there's no disguise, so I could open up my mind
I always loved you from the start
But I could not figure out, that I had to do it everyday
So I put away the fight
Now I'm going to live my life, giving you the most in every way
I belong to you
And you... you belong to me too
You make my life complete
You make me feel so sweet
I belong to you
And you... you belong to me too
You make my life complete
You make me feel so sweet
I belong to you
And you... you belong to me too
You make my life complete
You make me feel so sweet
I belong to you
And you... you belong to me too
You make my life complete
You make me feel so sweet
