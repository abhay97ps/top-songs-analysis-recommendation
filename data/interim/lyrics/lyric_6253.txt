My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
Ever since I lost my baby
When you quit me baby
Tore me all apart
You gave my love to someone else
Now I've been stabbed in the heart
My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
Ever since I lost my baby
Won't you tell me baby
Tell me why I went wrong
Why must I be used all my life
Why must I be scorned
My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
Ever since I lost my baby
One thing pretty baby
I never will understand
How can you look me in the eye
And hold hands with another man
My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
Ever since I lost my baby
My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
My soul's got a hole in it
Ever since I lost my baby
