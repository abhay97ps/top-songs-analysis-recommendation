Woke up early this morning
Made my coffee like I always do
Then it hit me from nowhere
Everything I feel about me and you
The way you kiss me crazy
Baby, you're so amazing
Seven days and seven nights of thunder
The water's rising and I'm slipping under
I think I fell in love with the eighth world wonder
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I guess that I'm just fallin'
Deeper into somethin' I've never known, yeah
But the way that I'm feelin'
Makes me realize that it can't be wrong
Your love's like a summer rain
Washing my doubts away
Seven days and seven nights of thunder
The water's rising and I'm slipping under
I think I fell in love with the eighth world wonder
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's only been a week, but it's comin' over me, yeah
It's makin' me believe that
You're the one for me
Yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, ooh
Oh, oh, yeah
Seven days and seven nights of thunder
The water's rising and I'm slipping under
I think I fell in love with the eighth world wonder
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Seven days and seven nights of thunder
The water's rising and I'm slipping under
I think I fell in love with the eighth world wonder
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Seven days and seven nights of thunder
The water's rising and I'm slipping under
I think I fell in love with the eighth world wonder
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Seven days and seven nights of thunder
The water's rising and I'm, and I'm
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I fell in love with the eighth world wonder 
Ooh, hey, yeah, hey
Ohh-oh, yeah
