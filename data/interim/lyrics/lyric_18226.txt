I thought it was over
I thought I could move on
But I was wrong
I woke up last night
Calling your name
Feeling the blame baby
Thought I could quit you but
I still miss your love
What was I thinking?
Thinking I could still walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone, I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me?
Girl I should have known it
I couldn't last a moment without you
You've got every right
To turn and walk away
I can't make you stay
I broke your heart
That's the bottom line
I wasted so much precious time, baby
I see with your friend
Wearing a smile again
What was I thinking?
Thinking I could still walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone, I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me?
Girl I should have known it
I couldn't last a moment without you
Thought I could quit you but
I still miss your love
What was I thinking?
Thinking I could still walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone, I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me?
Girl I should have known it
I couldn't last a moment without you
Oh girl I should have known it
I couldn't last a moment
Without you
Ohhhh
