You say that you want me and now that you've got me, you're gone
So think, what you're doin' or else you'll regret what you've done
Don't come back tomorrow and say what we did wasn't right
You'll cry on your pillow and find it hard to sleep at night
Have you ever loved somebody?
Don't you know just what it's like?
Hurtin' someone that you're close to
Have you ever loved all night, all night?
Remember what happened the last time that you said, "Goodbye"
Remember the sayin' that once bitten now means twice shy
It's no use, me cryin', there is no denyin', it's right
But thinkin' has ruined the feelin' that we had to fight
Have you ever loved somebody?
Don't you know just what it's like?
Hurting someone that you're close to
Have you ever loved all night, all night?
If you hear people talkin' now
Will you laugh or cry?
If you cry I'll sympathize with you
If you laugh I'll die, if you laugh I'll die
Have you ever loved somebody?
Don't you know just what it's like?
Hurtin' someone that you're close to
Have you ever loved all night, all night?
Have you ever loved somebody?
Don't you know just what it's like?
Hurtin' someone that you're close to
Have you ever loved all night, all night?
Have you ever loved somebody?
Don't you know just what it's like?
Hurtin' someone that you're close to
Have you ever loved all night, all night?
