I am not of royalty
I'm an ordinary guy
From a little family
And the riches pass us by
No red carpets on the floor
Nothing fancy I can show
But when we all stand together
I hear trumpets blow
Oh there is a fair young maiden
I love her and she loves me
She is kind and understanding
Filled with personality
And the people closest to me
All respect and love her so
When I see how much they take to her
I hear trumpets blow
Oh it really does amaze me
All the happiness I feel
And with every passing day I find
I can't believe it's real
So I pray that it will last
At least a hundred years or so
And I know it's not impossible
When I hear trumpets blow
