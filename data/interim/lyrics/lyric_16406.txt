Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off me
Honey when you knock on my door
I gave you my key
Oooh-hoo
Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Oooh-hoo
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
And nobody told us
Because nobody showed us
And now it's up to us babe
Oooh, I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh you put the sparks to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights
Oooh-hoo
Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Oooh-hoo
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Oooh-hoo
Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
Oooh, I gave you my heart
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
