Better get into what you gotta get into
Better get into it now, no slacking please
United Nations ain't really united
And the organisations ain't really organised
Riki tiki tavi mongoose is gone
Riki tiki tavi mongoose is gone
Won't be coming around for to kill your snakes no more, my love
Riki tiki tavi mongoose is gone
Everybody who read the Jungle Book knows that Riki tiki tavi's a mongoose who kills snakes
When I was a young man I was led to believe there were organisations to kill my snakes for me
Ie the church ie the government ie school
But when I got a little older, I learned I had to kill them myself
 Riki tiki tavi mongoose is gone
Riki tiki tavi mongoose is gone
Won't be coming around for to kill your snakes no more, my love
Riki tiki tavi mongoose is gone
People walk around, they don't know what they're doing
They been lost so long they don't know what they've been looking for
Well, I know what I'm a-looking for but I just can't find it
I guess I gotta look inside of myself some more
Oh oh oh, inside of myself some more
Oh oh oh, inside of myself some more
Riki tiki tavi mongoose is gone
Riki tiki tavi mongoose is gone
Riki tiki tavi mongoose is gone
Riki tiki tavi mongoose is gone
I saw you today on a number twelve
Bus you were going my way
My way
