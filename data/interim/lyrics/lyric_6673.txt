Trapped in a mine what had caved in
And everyone knows the only ones left
Were Joe and me and Tim
When they broke through to pull us free
The only ones left to tell the tale
Was Joe and me
Timothy, Timothy
Where on earth did you go?
Timothy, Timothy
God, why don't I know?
Hungry as hell, no food to eat
And Joe said that he would sell his soul
For just a piece of meat
Water enough to drink for two
And Joe said to me, "I'll take a swig
And then there's some for you"
Timothy, Timothy
Joe was lookin' at you
Timothy, Timothy
God, what did we do?
I must've blacked out just 'bout then
'Cause the very next thing that I could see
Was the light of the day again
My stomach was full as it could be
And nobody ever got around
To findin' Timothy
Timothy, Timothy
Where on earth did you go?
Timothy, Timothy
God, why don't I know?
Timothy, yeah
Oh, Timothy
Timothy
Yeah, Timothy
