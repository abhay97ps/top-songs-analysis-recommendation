Every day's a lifetime without you
Hard to get through, since you’ve gone
So I do the only thing I know how to, to get by
I’m livin' for the night
I’ve drawn all the curtains in this old house
To keep the sun out, and off of my face
Friends stop by to check - in ‘cause I’ve checked out
I tell 'em I’m fine, I’m just livin' for the night
Daylight can’t hide the tears I cry, the pain that came with your goodbye
The memories that keep me out of sight
Every night I venture out, into those neon arms that hold me tight
I’m livin' for the night
I’m a whole lot easier to talk to, when I’ve had a few, I settle down
Whiskey kills the man you’ve turned me into
And I come alive
I’m livin' for the night
Daylight can’t hide the tears I cry, the pain that came with your goodbye
The memories that keep me out of sight
Every night I venture out, into those neon arms that hold me tight
I’m livin' for the night
I’m livin' for the night
Every day's a lifetime without you
