I've got dreams, dreams to remember
I've got dreams, dreams to remember
Honey, I saw you there last night
Another man's arms holding you tight
Nobody knows what I feel inside
All I know, I walked away and cried
I've got dreams, dreams to remember
Listen to me  rough dreams 
I know you said he was just a friend
But I saw him kiss you again and again
These eyes of mine, they don't fool me
Why did he hold you so tenderly?
I've got dreams, dreams to remember
Listen honey  rough dreams 
I still want you to stay
I still love you anyway
I don't want you to ever leave
Girl, you just satisfy me, ooh-wee, ooh yeah
I know you said he was just a friend
But I saw you kiss him again and again
These eyes of mine, they don't fool me
Why did he hold you so tenderly?
I've got dreams, dreams to remember
Listen to me, mama  bad dreams, rough dreams 
Don't make me suffer  rough dreams , bad dreams
