Ooh
Yeah, girl
Said a small boy once asked
When will I grow up?
When will I see what grown-ups do see?
In his fight to come of age
He would act an older age
To be recognized as one
And not a mass
And mama used to say
Take your time, young man
Mama used to say
Don't you rush to get old
Mama used to say
Take it in your stride
Mama used to say
Live your life
As the years went rushing by
He would cut down on his age
He would tell his girl of how it used to be
How his mommy passed away
But these lines she would say
And at the time
He couldn't understand
You're young
So enjoy
Don't hold on back
Do all you want to do
Now is the time
For you to stride
For you to get better in what you are doing
And mama used to say
Take your time, young man
Mama used to say
Don't you rush to get old
Mama used to say
Take it in your stride
Mama used to say
Live your life
Live your life
Live your life
Hey, mama used to say
Take your time, young man
Mama used to say
Don't you rush to get old
And Mama used to say
Take it in your stride
Mama used to say
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh
Mama used to say
Ooh
Mama used to say
Ooh
Mama used to say
Ooh
Mama used to say
