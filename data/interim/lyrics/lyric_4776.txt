Open up your eyes and wake up
Got a lot of time to make up, girl
Time goes by in such a hurry
Why'd you sit around and worry so? Don't you know
You've been living your life in a shell?
Now's the time has come to break the spell
Everybody's got to shine sometime
It's just a matter of time you know
There's a whole new world for you to discover
Wake up, wake up, baby
Life is just a book of pages
You still got so many to fill in
Don't put down what's happenin' around you
Just because they told you it's a sin
How do you know until you try?
Love is callin' so spread your wings and fly
Everybody's got to shine sometime
It's just a matter of time you know
There's a whole new world for you to discover
Wake up, wake up, baby
Got so many things to show you
Groovy things that we can share together
Baby, no, no, no, don't be afraid of tomorrow
Everybody's got to shine sometime
It's just a matter of time you know
There's a whole new world for you to discover
Wake up, wake up, baby
Everybody's got to shine sometime
It's just a matter of time you know
There's a whole new world for you to discover
Wake up, c'mon, wake up, baby
Everybody's got to shine sometime
It's just a matter of time you know
There's a whole new world for you to discover
Wake up, get up, baby
