You never hear about it
It's not the thing you talk over with friends
You never see it coming until it begins
But something stepped in between us
It's taken all of our time alone
In her heart love remains, but is seldom shown
So why does she cry herself to sleep at night?
Why do I have to work so hard to make things right?
To fall in love came naturally
To make it last is so hard, you see
I'm caught in between the two sides of love
A kiss goodbye, a kiss hello
You wonder why she get's lonely
You've got to show her, don't tell her
She's your one and only, yeah
So why does she cry herself to sleep at night?
Why do I have to work so hard to make things right?
To fall in love came naturally
To make it last is so hard, you see
I'm caught in between the two sides of love
We make promises, promises
And late at night you make big plans
Someday we'll run away and leave the love demands, yeah
So why does she cry herself to sleep at night?
Why do I have to work so hard to make things right?
To fall in love came naturally
To make it last is so hard, you see
I'm caught in between the two sides of love
Two sides of love
Two sides of love
Two sides of love
Two sides of love
