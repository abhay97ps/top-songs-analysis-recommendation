Please don't ever leave me
Please don't ever go
Won't you stay please don't take away
The only happiness I know
If you ever leave me
If you ever go 
On your way don't forget the day
You lost the only love you'll ever know
Girl won't you try to believe me
Girl don't you know love is blind
Now that you're trying to leave me
Slowly but surely I'm going clear out of my mind, yeah
Please don't ever leave me 
Please don't ever go 
Won't you stay, please don't take away
The only happiness I know 
If you ever leave me
If you ever go 
On your way don't forget the day
You lost the only love you'll ever know
La, la la la la la
La, la la la la
La la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la
