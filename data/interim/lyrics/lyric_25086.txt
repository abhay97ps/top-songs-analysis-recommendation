Woo
Me and my bitch, I swear we like the same sex 
Fuck with all my chains on, let's have chain sex 
Hangin' with the gang, you get your fangs wet 
Wanna kick with the gang? You gotta bang it 
If you gon' throw ice on, gotta swang it 
Holes in the wall, I cannot hang it 
Pour different colors, sippin', tainted 
Woah, think the vibe just start vibratin' 
Don't do playgrounds, we do not swing sets 
Shawty got the K, don't entertain threats 
Shawty came my way, she brought the same sex 
Bust it down, she talkin' body language 
Eatin' that punane, got my bangs wet 
We gon' have to change for the banquet 
Solo with Mulsanne, it's not the same specs 
Pull up, left with somethin' I ain't came with 
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Ice, froze, glow
Get, glow, get, glow 
Three main bitches thinkin' they my main bitch 
Hit the club and swap the hoes I came with 
Don't you come outside, we on that gang shit 
Had to switch my T-shirt 'cause she stained it 
Had to buy a visa, she from Moscow 
Fuckin' 'round with Travis, you get crossed out 
He used to be on, that nigga off now 
I done got so rich, I Saint Laurent my dawgs now 
Earrings cost a quarter certified by GIA 
If it's 'bout my bae or 'bout some smoke, I'm on my way 
Your bitch gave the Kid Cudi, but I'm not signed to 'Ye 
I nutted on her cheek, her new nickname is "Babyface" 
Me and my bitch, I swear we like the same sex 
Fuck with all my chains on, let's have chain sex 
Hangin' with the gang, you get your fangs wet 
Wanna kick with the gang? You gotta bang it 
If you gon' throw ice on, gotta swang it 
Holes in the wall, I cannot hang it 
Pour different colors, sippin', tainted 
Woah, think the vibe just start vibratin'
