Hey, what's up homes?
What's up how you doing?
Hey guys
Hi guys
Hey what's up?
Hi guys
Hey Frost, I want to introduce you to one of the homeboys from the neighborhood
This is Little Scoob
Scoob, that's Kid Frost
-What's up, homes?
Hey Frost, bust an old school jam!
-Alright little homie, yeah. Heh, heh
Q-vo, aquí estoy, yeah it's the big boy
Down with the home girls, down with the homeboys
Kicking back, listening to a Huggy Boy rola
Waiting for the night to hit so we can find some cholas
I told you I'll come back in nine tray
Bumping in my six tray, cruising in the calle
I gots my parle, órale ese
Cause when I do it, I do it all day 
And then I come back again
With another stack to spin on all my friends
And now I get my gangster roll on
Brand new clothes on and so on and so on
And now I need to beat the flow on
Here it is right here Frost, man go on
Yeah it's smoke going out with a bang
Cause it ain't nothing but a family thing, yeah
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
Oye vato 
Check out the style of my vocal
And take a look and see what the cat drug in
One big bad ass Mexican
And I'm ready for anyone, down for anything
And I can pass any test that many bring
Vatos want to know where I'm from
I'm from the barrio, East Los Aztlán
And ain't no neighborhood can mess with that
Cause it ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Now, chavalillos in the park after dark
And the hoodlums run scared when the dogs bark
So get out the neighborhood and don't look back
Because I cut no slack when I'm holding a Tec
And it's all about backing up your last name
We in the same game, it's a family thing
It's a family affair 
It's a family affair 
It's a family affair 
It's a family affair 
Kid Frost back and I'm down
And my familia is anyone whose skin is brown
Rancheros and the trucks saw the grey vans
Taggers in the alley with a bag full of spray cans
Here come the jura, got to bail out
And even them coconut cops but they sell out
The cholos the cholas who ain't soft
It's the mean mafioso, gangster Frost
Coming at ya'll, don't try to slam me
Cause Mexicans always got a big ass family
The cuetes, the balas, the Chevy Impalas
The gang bang cycles with the media call us
So if you're brown you're down, so stay proud
And remember, no busters allowed
Cause the Mexican people is a big ass gang, yeah
It's a family thing, huh
It's a family affair 
It's a family affair 
It's a family affair 
It's a family affair 
It's a family affair 
It's a family affair 
It's a family affair 
It's a family affair 
It's a family affair 
It's a family affair 
It's a family affair 
It's a family affair 
It's a family affair
