'Cause you know in the old days
They couldn't say the shit they wanted to say
They had to fake orgasms and shit
We can tell niggas today:
"Hey, I wanna cum, mothafucka!"
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it 
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it 
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it 
Your boyfriend is a dork, McLovin 
I just pulled up in a Ghost 
Fucked that bitch up out in London 
Then I fucked up on her cousin
Or her sister, I don't know nothin' 
And my niggas gettin' ignorant
Like a lighter, bitch, we ignant 
All this water on my neck
Look like I fell when I went fishin' 
So much diamonds on my bust down
Ooh, fuck, what's the time? 
Me and Smokepurpp sippin' drank 
Ooh, fuck, she take lines 
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it 
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it 
You're such a fuckin' ho
When the first time they ask you if you want sparklin' or still?
Why you tryna act like you was drinkin' sparklin' water 'fore you came out here?
You're such a fuckin' hâ€”
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck 
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck 
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck 
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck 
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I like my dick sucked, I'll buy you a sick truck
I'll buy you some new tits, I'll get you that nip-tuck
How you start a family? The condom slipped up
I'm a sick fuck, I'm inappropriate
I like hearin' stories, I like that ho shit
I wanna hear mo' shit, I like the ho shit
Send me some mo' shit, you triflin' ho bitch 
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it 
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it 
'Cause you know in the old days
They couldn't say the shit they wanted to say
They had to fake orgasms and shit
We can tell niggas today:
"Hey, I wanna cum, mothafucka!"
