I've been laid off from work
My rent is due
My kids all need
Brand new shoes
So I went to the bank
To see what they could do
They said son looks like bad luck
Gotta hold on you
Money's too tight to mention
I can't get an unemployment extension
Money's too tight to mention
I went to my brother
To see what he could do
He said brother like to help you
But I'm unable to
So I called on my father, father
Oh, my father
He said
Money's too tight to mention
Oh money, money, money, money
Money's too tight to mention
I can't even qualify for my pension

They're passing all kinds  of bills
From down capitol hill, we've tried them
Money's too tight to mention 
Money, money, money, money
We're talkin' about money money 
Money, money, money, money!

And that old man that's over the hill
