He is now to be among you
At the calling of your hearts
Rest assured this troubadour
Is acting on His part
The union of your spirits here
Has caused Him to remain
For whenever two or more of you
Are gathered in His name
There is Love, there is Love
Well, a man shall leave his mother
And a woman leave her home
They shall travel on to where
The two shall be as one
As it was in the beginning
Is now and till the end
Woman draws her life from man
And gives it back again
There is Love, there is Love
Well, there must have been a reason
For becoming man and wife
Is it love that brings it here
Or Love that brings you life?
(Is it law that brings you here
Or Love that gives you life?)
For if Loving is the answer
Then who's the giving for?
Do you believe in something
That you've never seen before?
Oh, there is Love
Oh, there's Love
Oh, the marriage  of your spirits here
Has caused Him to remain
For whenever two or more of you
Are gathered in His name
There is Love, there is Love
