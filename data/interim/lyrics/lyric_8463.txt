Oh, oh, lord
All alone again
You say it's been this way
Since you don't know when
There are a lot of places
A woman like you could go and see
Why your man won't take you
Is a mystery to me
Oh, I wish, how I wish
It was me you loved
Baby, I wish, how I wish
It was me you loved
Honest to god
Such a pretty thing
All locked up in
The crib by yourself
He comes home from work
Just to eat and sleep
He even make you promises
He'll never keep
Yet you stand by him
All faithful and can be
Can't you see you'd be better off
With a man like me
How I wish, how I wish
It was me you loved
Hey, how I wish, how I wish
It was me you loved
He's running the streets at night
Chasing every skirt
All along, doing his dirty dirt
Oh, yes, he is
You're sitting home all alone
While your man
He's out having fun
Oh
I wish you were mine
How I wish, how I wish
I want you by my side
With every step I take
I want you with me
For the rest of my days
How I wish it was me you loved
How I wish, oh, I wish
It was me you loved
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go
