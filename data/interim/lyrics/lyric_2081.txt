You better treat my baby good if you know what's good for you
You better never make her cry
Go on, make one mistake and I'll step in and take away the ache in her heart
So play it smart
You better treat my baby good if you know what's good for you
Don't ever let me see her blue
Go ahead and put her down once too often around a friend in town and you'll see
She's back with me
Who am I kiddin'?
She's better off without me now and I know that's good for you
But, all the same, keep this in mind
Just make sure ev'ry day that you treat her the way she'd like to say that you should
Treat my baby good
Just make sure ev'ry day that you treat her the way she'd like to say that you should
Treat my baby good
Just make sure ev'ry day
That you treat her the way she'd like to say that you should
Treat my baby good
