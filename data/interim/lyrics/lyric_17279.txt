 Previously on NWX versus Gun Titles
 Y'all remember I was about to fuck these niggas up cause y'all was talkin' mad shit
 Well all I remember is button shirt, bag zipped and Surf puttin' Roc on yo' ass like the Fast 6
 Nigga when?
 When that nigga called Paul Walker from Heaven and made him crash whips
 Nah see, you got it fucked up, see I remember a nigga sayin' "suck my dick" and I almost made him backflip
 Well I remember before the shot and after the shot
 I wasn't worried 'bout that shit
 Well you should've been
 Why?
 Cause that's the part in the battle when we was gettin' our ass whipped
 Well this time I'm back sucka, with a big mil' 
 This the last supper
 I ain't even wipe the tray  off I'ma bad butler
 Newspaper, shells everywhere
 I'm a Crab lover, you want the knife or the first round?
 Pick, that's a draft number
 Tie him to the front of the car
 And let him drag under
 Two letters, I'll let a hundred meter  mark
 Like a track runner
 Leg shot
 Lebron James
 I've got his Calves covered
Two niggas shootin' Roc without lookin'
 We the Splash Brothers
I caught him on a Dark night
 I pulled up with a Bane mask
 Time of death
 9:11
 That's a plane crash
Same casket, same morgue
 They toes get the same tag
 Well if you feelin' the shot then put a mil'  on The Roc
 Dame Dash
 Two buck fifties
 Come and get yo' stage pass
I bet he couldn't stop these autos with break pads
 If he escape fast then let the .8 blast
 I got somethin' big stashed; Drake's dad
 Last battle, that shit was all gas
 This battle is shoppin' sprees; I bring 'em all  bags
 In the battle
 Suck my dick
 After the battle
 Toy's flash
 Before the shot?
 Irving Plaza
 After the shot?
 Troy Ave!
 The .40 get to bustin', I get his whole team shot
 Nina lickin' next, she tryin' to get a G spot
 I'm shootin' Roc right over this square
 Tree top
 All my pieces hittin'
 I even got a green dot
 Muah, to make him kiss the pound, welcome to D-Block
 Nah, to give his  kicks, welcome to Reebok
They'll Reminisce Over You; Pete Rock
 Bodies off the wall, they'll cover Surf with the sheet Roc
 Strap on the back like new Airs
 Bomb stuck
 Two arms up, who cares?
 Milhouse, I'm leavin' lens on
 Everything blue here 
 Nah I'm leavin' shirts red and bottoms gone, I'm thinkin' Pooh bear
 What if they got two Glocks, two pairs and Tsu there?
 Then I'm gettin' him, Daylyt, Rex and Mook aired
 The look on the crime scene when the cops swing through there
 That shit was the Domino's logo, it was just three Dot's and two squares
 Hold up tho, I mean since you here, why the fuck they think you panic a lot?
 Cause I control my temper and don't fuck up the only chance that I got
You on the other hand wanna fight in every battle
 Bro I don't give a damn 'bout this spot
It's Space Jam, I got my talent back soon as I got my hands on the Roc
What we got? Another former Zip 'Em Up/Cave Gang/Dot wit' a death wish
 Then he turned Gun Titles
 Stupid nigga set trip
.40 in the left hand
 Forgot the "is he dead" kick
 I'm waitin' for the lead out, trip him by the exit
Grab him while he fallin', grip him by his necklace
Son tryin' to Slide, it's finna get Electric
Shootin'  forget about the breadsticks
Stomach shot, they can't tell his dinner from his breakfast
 You got that Puerto Rican chopper?
 No I got this from Cali
 To tape a Raptor nigga up
 Leave that option to Lowry
 Gauge liftin', Tay missin'
 Put his top wit' a 
 That's Chris Paul to Blake Griffin
 Toss Roc in the Ave
 Let's get the fun started
 Hammers you want, here's one cartridge
 Arms up, get the rock in the head
 I'm unbothered, lead the league in pump, rock and roll
 We punk artists
 How the fuck y'all Gun Titles
 And you can't hold gun charges?
This is round one, it's gettin' hot in here, what's your slogan?
 Zip 'em up
 What's mine?
 Get 'em the fuck outta here!
 Hell no, get this nigga that sucks the fuck outta here
Get this stupid nigga Roc sayin' he wasn't Zip 'Em Up the fuck outta here
 Get you bein' gay wit' your hand on your hip the fuck outta here
 Get sayin' you gon' knock Shine the fuck out, 60 feet away the fuck outta here
 I'm tired of watchin' fuckin' 2 on 2's of this nigga
Talkin' 'bout how his heater spray
Freestylin', sweatin', machetes that shoot either way
 K-Shine just standin' there
 Doin' nothin', and you don't even see it straight
That make him just like your mother
 What?
 Another bitch gettin' checks off of DNA
Well, I'm in the crib, hand held camera wit the lens and the snapshot
Scope for bird eye view, I'm here lookin' for a jackpot
 E'rybody dead
 I'm buckin' all, fuck 'em all, see a C
 Don't shoot
 This panorama  head to the fuckin' wall
 Aye...you was fuckin' soft, dip on your man when he's about to get his head beat
And you shouldn't be on stage leavin' DNA hangin' like a deadbeat
 K wrapped into Big T, I swear I'm tryin' to leave 'em all dead
 This a Perfect Day To Die, I could make it rain baldheads
 Pourin' slugs, no pornhub, we came squirtin'
 In the Cavalier with the heat
 Saga got the King James version
 Aye Surf, I got about 30 in this clip standin' out I'm at 'em
He dead by tomorrow, what's the rant about
 Ennis, , Durant, shit I'll run it back
Either I'm lyin'  or that's a whole lot of Thunder Cats
 Okay, but what else?
 Well, was Thunder Cats, don't ever try and play me, I don't need to get traded
I'm a Warrior, get crazy with this K, D
 Facts, aye look, I should take this nigga back like this is our business
Nigga I will black ya eye, make you an eye witness
They won't be able to identify niggas
Ya head, dent if I hit it
 Big rounds on on the ground
 Unidentified visits
 If you a foe
 If you a foe , I'm comin' wit' 'bout 60 when I'm sendin' mine
 One in the chamber
 What was left in the Area?
 59
 It's never over, even when he dead, if he got me mad
 I interrupt the choir, chainsaw and a hockey mask
 My DC niggas say Joe
 Well I'ma do Joe sloppy bad
 He walk up to the casket
 Rest in peace Houdini, I'll split that box in half
 Aye, I beat ya angel with a bottle of Cris'
 Levitate her
 Inf' beam, I'll put ray on ya bitch
 Elevate her
 Monk style, I'll put a dot on her head
 Meditate her
 Aye Surf get her arms
 Get the legs
 We gon' separate her
 See, he we go again this shit can get mean
Like if I keep goin' with the muhfuckin' scheme
18 wheeler backin' up, beep beep
 Respirate her 
 Switch the IV with Pine Sol
 When they medicate her
 Damn, that bitch survive
 Fuck Surf, we underestimate her?
 Louieville Slugger to the head
 They gon' have to reeducate her
Aye hold on, all that social media, for the bitches, the grip in the place
I'll Snap for that Chat and have my dawg  lick in ya face
 Wait Roc I got a great shot, double barrel, double scope
I see 'em both like face swap
 Whole team got the toast, we 'bout to do cheers over there
 Put this nigga from Corona in a box like
 "Yo, the beers over there."
 This shit bulgin' out the pants like a boner
If I gotta let it fly yo
 Cinco De Mayo
 I'll bring them 32 packs to Corona
 Aye I heard you moved to Flatbush, Bushwick, when I find you they gon' have to chalk you out
You get beat around the bush like...some shit I don't wanna talk about
 I'm in the car, .40 in my lap wit' the phone waitin'
 I got the Jeepers Creepers mask in the hallway, where they both stayin'?
 Two .23s, why need shooters, I got zone patience
 Aye, I'ma lock pick his door
 Eeeeeeee!
 Nah, we gon' take this shit outside, I got home trainin'
Look, I send the Cave rollin' through your neighborhood
60 deep
You either get jumped man or niggas die when this kick release
I pull my  deuce deuce from the shoe on this cat and blast away
You ain't hear me? Aye D the  the shells will do him like Jam Master Jay
 Adidas, Jump Man, Puma, this the part when I sneak another bar in
Suppressor holes on the nose, the K Swiss when I grip the pipe
That chopper got LA Gears
 That's different lights
 Aye Roc, why Shine ain't Dot Mobb no more?
 We had to take his soul  out, it wasn't fittin' right
 Aye D, the victim of BK in the box
 That's British Knights
 Gun Titles, whatup
 Aight well, I mean after that shit we up 1-0
But, why the fuck every time we battle, it's like niggas just zone out on you?
Them niggas be actin' like you got no lines
Shit, I'm a fan, I remember when you used to slide up like a dancer
You ain't that same nigga from '09
I remember when you used to give John John that "is he dead" kick
 That was fire
 I mean am I buggin', or do y'all niggas wanna see the old Shine?
Well if that's the case I'ma step aside
Kill these two bitch niggas on own time
One thing for sure, two things for certain
This fo' Roc, this for Surf and
Oh y'all waitin' for name flips, I'm puttin' work in
Fuck flippin' a name, I'm tryin' to flip a person
I said I was gon' knock you out, like you was ready to ride
Boy I had that Big Poppa, hope you Ready To Die
Long nose, I gotta hold it down, like I took it in stride
But my deuce will turn Roc if you look in my eyes
Blllatt!
Fuck ya hard bat, I'm on that time today
Give it up when ya cheese gettin' jacked on montereys
Wind shield, mirrors, doors when that Llama bang
That's how I had that V surfin'; hydroplane
Mind on flame, I'm sendin' him the torch
It'll shoot him in the backyard and sit him on the porch
Only need one bullet and it's finna get 'em off
The one sent was a head shot, that's a penny for ya thoughts
I'm thinkin' family visits, house pop ups, we doin' all that to get you, all on principle
He thought he was Saved By The Bell, D, I let 'em all out this missile
He try to run his  nose, it's not  smart, they blowin' all his tissue
I'm thinkin' baby wit' a fever
[D} Give his forehead the nickle
Y'all make the worst
 Reach decisions, for instance
 Ayo when you lock pick a door, cause you just did this
Ain't you supposed to be creepin' Surf?
I mean, every time you lock pick a door, why it be squeakin' Surf?
I mean when you hear the
{D] Eeeeeeeerrr
 Do you stop, peek in first?
 Even when breaking an entry you be reachin' Surf
 You make the worst reach decisions, for instance
 The whole world wants to know
 Not just the city, the world Craig
 You know, what the fuck is a "denany" Roc?
 What is that?
 Is that your aunt, is that your grandma?
 Is that somebody in your family Roc?
 Is that code word in Baltimore
 For, "Yo, I need some candy rock"?
 See that right there is when being gassed comes in handy Roc
 Y'all make the worst reach decisions, for instance
 If Smack, Beasley, Chico and Norbes was givin' out Reach God Grammys, y'all would get them awards quick
 And if they had a dollar for e'ry time y'all reach, y'all niggas would make the Forbes list
 But they the gun bar kings, they got a large clip
 Ahh shit
 We figured out whey they call themselves "Gun Titles"
 Cause you rap about the guns
 That this nigga get caught wit'
 Go Jackie Robinson nigga when you Murda Tsu
 Well I never Dodge a Jersey nigga he get the .40 too 
 I'm thinkin' Hardball with a .380
 Surf said you ain't been in them streets lately
 Til he the one dyin' in Jersey; G-Baby
 Tell this man "Stop"
 Pull up on his damn block
 Big dog that'll put him over the fence
 Sandlot
 He just sayin' that he 'bout steel
I get who's bangin' in that house killed
Now they dead people just
 Two Angels In The Outfield
 But Surf said it's like basketball, right?
 So tell 'em put his hands up
 I wanna have a competition
 I got a couple treys
 Nah, I'm thinkin' slam dunk, that nigga Roc said he tough
 He ain't tough enough
 Well whatchu want, the Tom or Hawk 
 I'm thinkin' double pump
 When mils get involved they don't want that problem again
Toss 'em in an alley
 Ooops
 That ain't no mistake he gettin' stomped with my Timbs
 What if they pull up to the Charger or Benz?
 Well then I been harder, I'm Vince Carter
 I got the arm in the rim
 It's time to retire, we cruisin' on y'all niggas, like Knight with the Rider
Two Cannons, Nick you won't like Mariah
We ain't worried 'bout the gas, just
 Makes it easier when we light 'em on fire
 Round 2
 It's gettin' hot in here
 What's your slogan?
 Zip 'em up
 What's mine?
 Get 'em the fuck outta here
 NWX man
 Last battle I said, "Suck my dick" and you was trippin' on me
But if a tranny would've said, suck his dick...you would've did it for him
So now, suck my dick, that's all I'ma rhyme about
 And on neighborhood Crip, if you touch him I'ma knock you out
How you feel about that last body Roc?
 Great victims
 I love bitches, but we treat these bitches
 Like we hate women
Violence
 Domestic  on the wall when the K spittin'
 Nobody cared about him
 Just his mother with DNA on her shirt like a rape victim
 New gun connect
 Show me some shit, you just a bitch
 You wanna hit a nigga
 Back to back all summer 16, use this
 It gotta be charged up
 But when it pop you don't miss
 And if he use the scope it give you Views From The 6
 I got a new K, I ain't tryin' to miss him
 If you a part of NWX, then you dyin' wit 'em
 They can't solve the case cause DNA from the crime is missin'
 Only nigga that survive is Sage
 Cause God was wit' him
 Fuck that, the Magnum blast the pastor pass it
 Then let the lemon squeeze on T 
 We'll split him Half & Half
 If it's beef, don't let me get my hands on a semi
A.D.  I'll put you before Christ before Anno Domini
 I ain't even gon' charge him
 This there, a cheap lesson
 Kidnappin' his daughter like
 This ain't no body 
 Don't be Keith Sweat-in'
Call him off the trap phone like, "I don't want shit nigga. Keep steppin'."
 or the Locs, either way you gotta get it from the C section
These niggas be goin' on dates
Bowlin', walks, movies, I don't know who be movin' weirder
 Well I'm from the gutter, clip longer than a walk in the park
I'll send a 'matic  through a movie theater
 Fuckin' they whole crew, that's how this nina gettin' down
 My aim impeccable, if I miss somebody I ain't seen 'em in awhile
 I started in that Lionz Den like K vs Goodz
 I had Roc outside with that Shotgun like Tay vs Suge
 Aye, tell them niggas from Detroit, we'll crash at they crib like they stuck wit' us
 From the shoulder, I click it like I don't want a ticket and make 'em buckle up
Wait, wait, he got a lil' weight, take an extra clip, double up
 I'm tryin' to give Marv a list  of reasons not to fuck wit' us like
 Them motherfuckin' weapons will bang
I'll send 'em questions  in a box like the Jeopardy game
 Or Wheel  Of Fortune
 I'll pull up to where they sell caskets like
 "I would like 'em all."
 Then fill every box like
 "I would like to solve."
What's up with them Cake's Up niggas?
 Cakes Up? {sighs} Chess/Steams
Any night I'll put 'em under a cover
 A rook', he , he a silly rabbit, I'll put one in his brother
 I would put his queen in a pawn  but I know that he love her
 So if I gotta steam Steams
 I be lookin' at Chess like Bishop when I'm huggin' his mother
 That'll be Steams dead, that means it's just one left, better
 I be ridin' 'round lookin' for the Cakes like it's sundress weather
I'll be honest, I ain't even watch Clips and John John
Cause every time I think of Clips and John John
 It just make you think of
 Puttin' clips in John John
 I'm walkin' 'round wit' a Super Soaker backpack, hollow tips splash out him
 I already sent that spic wet back to Brooklyn
Now that's Math's problem
 I'll pull up with blue flags for wherever you be K
 Tag him in blood on the wall for everybody to see K
 You not a G, D,  I'll pull up everywhere you be D
 And let a 'matic ring
 My Spanish papi will come load it, I call that my Latin King
 Gun Titles what up
 Jersey
 I mean y'all gotta bear wit' me, wow, I actually got to a third round with K-Shine, let's clap it up
Cause that damn sure ain't happen last time
 I was gon' kick some fuckin' ass, you know Fab with them Bad Vybes
 You the type of nigga to have a four quarter game, drop fifty and then fuck it up at halftime
 Oh y'all niggas think that shit is funny?
 I do
 Until I do what I did the last time
 See that's your fuckin' problem, all you gotta do is rap Shine
 Nah, they ain't sure until they see  shells like Laguna Beach
Keep it up, Reece's cup, it ain't hard to get two a piece
 I'm on the same page, Dwayne Wade, if he don't move from Heat
 Cops gon' find Surf in  a net
 Like a computer geek
 Let your Ruger speak
 They get a round on the net soon as they land
 Waikiki
 You can get the stick over your pride Roc
 Rafiki
 I keep my trey next to the kids
 Dashiki, pistol whip her then get Tsu mo'  butts; Rikishi
 They tried to say we got killed in that last 2 on 2
 That shit put me in a bad mood
 So I was talkin' to Beasley
 About what?
 Turnin' these niggas to fast food
 I'm in Jersey lookin' for 'em
 That's crazy I was in Baltimore, when D's wit' the mil' I'm goin' 4 for 4
 Make sure you put the dagger in Roc, split him three ways
 Well you can have it your way, let's find out where they be K 
 You was under the wing stop
 That nigga Shine almost made your jaw bleed
 I want the nigga that said, "Suck my dick"
 Then I want the nigga with the palm tree
I'll hop out the Bronco
 Then these arms squeeze
 With the mil'  through the window if you don't tell us where they are Beas' 
 You went deep and still caught the bullet
 Touchdown
 I then gave his boo everything
 Like a tough crowd, two K's
 Two treys 
 Them niggas lunch now
 Let them share the cig' 
 Like a bust down
 I ran up on Surf in the V, like, "What you frontin' for?" He tried to peel
 I blew at the wheels; that's a hoverboard
 Passenger side
 Driver's seat
 Like do not touch the fuckin' doors
 Or we pullin' from both sides like tug of war
 Llama split, that "suck my dick" shit almost got him punked
 TEC blow, the shit I let go will tear a block apart
 Big heat, I'm tryin' to Jeeps into shoppin' carts
 Well put they organs in it
 And grocery shop wit' the body parts
 These niggas been soft
 Niggas been gay, I got the drop from the start
 We catch they daughter's by the swing
 Leave 'em shot in the park
 Surf the number one hit
 Top of the charts, but it's Central Intelligence
 We came to shoot Roc in the heart 
Y'all niggas should've learned from Joe about butting  in
I got twenty shots for Roc
 I got another ten
 Surf don't jump in the way
 Unless you wanna win
 I'm shootin' Roc invisible
 Like Sheppard in Above The Rim
 I got a new hammer, fresh off the shelf, this shit is not for sale
 It get ugly wit' these Rockets, it is not Cassell
 Gloves on, ain't nothin' funny 'bout these prints  I am not Chappelle
 Dum Dums, I'm tryin' to give Roc The Bells
 We roll wit' a bunch of Bloods they got them shells
 Big hats, wit' two clips, this is not Pharrell
 We see your Warriors gettin' choked, this is not Latrell
 After the shot
 Hit 'Em Up
 Before the shot
 'Pac in jail
These niggas get the stick by the tree that's Django's wife
Or two heads in a box
 It's tango night
Big chopper, I lean left even when Kango tight
 So I guess It Takes Two to make a thing go right
 Two shots, 2Pac
 We be Hittin' Em Up
 This shit is like a new slot
 It be givin' 'em bucks
 See I like this K-Shine when you givin' a fuck
 Get 'em the fuck outta here
 After we done zippin' 'em up
 Aye Surf this battle rap shit is kinda gettin' ass
 So we should try some new shit is what you tellin' me
 We should try a new game
 What kinda game?
 Called Guess The Celebrity
 I ain't really into a lot of games I'm more into tools
But fuck it, these niggas terrible, tell me the rules
 Alright look, I'ma name a celebrity and you gon' tell me why you think I'm them
And if you happen to guess wrong then fuck it, I'ma fill you in
 That's cool, I can start?
 Yeah you start it
 Alright cool
I'm Floyd Mayweather
 Why? Cause you go hard in the ring wit' the quickest of jabs?
 Nah cause that .40 ain't got no loses and that mil' fit int he bag
 I'ma be Fetty Wap
 Cause you tryin' to grow dreadlocks
 Nah, for one I  Trap his Queen in a headlock
I grab her by a Remy, boy, pull it til I perm it straight
Check the murder rates
 Since 17 I had .38s
I'ma be Puff Daddy
 Puff Daddy, what the fuck? You tryin' to bring back old days?
 Nah, I can actually kill a group and bring 'em back on stage
 I can't top that, I'ma be ahhh, Kanye West
 Cause you worldwide known and your music get crazy plays
 Almost, nah, cause I walk around wit' two new baby K's
Hot box the G ride, it be smokey when I whip the Coupe
Shots have 'em twitchin' like Smokey in the chicken coup
Aye, I'll grip and shoot, catch all kinds of bullets
Mind ya business
Or Ezel, you catch Smokey shit from behind the bushes
I'm quick to pop, you know me brother
I had six bullets but it's ten of them
 Make it enough like Smokey mother
 I said it right, fuck last battle, these niggas dead tonight
Throw a punch, you'll be shocked at the counter like you ain't check the price
 If that ain't register, I'm comin' back and I'm bringin' both Macs
Don't leave 'til it's gross or  re-up and go back
 Boxes on boxes on boxes like that's where the cargo at
Red beam on his head like that's where the bar code at
Look, I'ma take his daughter, record her, it was protocol
 Nigga Roc like O Dawg wit' the tape, he tryin' to show it off
 But I was just tryin' to take her to the highest peak, that's when she goin' off
So the  Mountain Dew  seem high enough to throw her off
 I could get a fan to clap her like, "Here, hold a strap."
Whoever you see air 'em  miss  we gon' back
 I take both of you niggas out, I'm tryin' to save two bases
And see if when this Cal' rip Ken   your Babe Ruth take it
 If I gotta pull up in that van, damn I'm sendin' at least three niggas home, that's a grand slam
 It's like a Michael Meyers movie, every time they look up I'm behind y'all
 Long arm reach out with the glove, that's a fly ball
 Aye Surf, I don't be into that basketball shit, cause I don't really play
But if I was any of them niggas
 Who would you be?
 I'd be like Stay
 Who the fuck is "Stay"?
 Well you know Stephan Clay, they got a shot, they just lookin' better
So I ain't say "Steph'" or "Clay", "Stay" is them put together
These shots numb 'em and blind 'em, he'll never feel pain again
Feel like he moved to southern California, they'll never see Rain again
 If I kidnap Saga mother, that bitch gettin' beat tonight
Tie her up and feed Whitney Houston to the Preacher Wife
 I got a weapon, I send this guy to Heaven
We done touched more eights and nines than Saga reverend
His bitch cheap, a chicken box how I got to head
 His baby mother will jump that's probably not ya kid
 I'll catch him at the light like Harold, I'm thinkin' 'Pac & BIG
This Glock
 Like that tranny you know they both rockin' wigs
 Bald heads, like Uncle Fester, it be choppin' when it ring
 Any Wednesday I call my Cousin, It could get poppin' wit' the thing
 I'm at 'em , like "Where's Family?" them hammers come out
 In other words, if I get my hand in that house
 Gun Titles what up
