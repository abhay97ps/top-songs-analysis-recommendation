Baby, if you've ever wondered
Wondered whatever became of me
I'm living on the air in Cincinnati, Cincinnati, WKRP
Got kind of tired packing and unpacking
Town to town and up and down the dial
Maybe you and me were never meant to be
But baby think of me once in awhile
Heading up that highway
Leaving you behind
Hardest thing I've ever had to do
Broke my heart in two
But Baby, pay no mind
The price for finding me was losing you
Memories help me hide my lonesome feelin'
Far away from you and feelin' low
It's gettin' late my friend, I miss you so
Take good care of you, I've gotta go
Baby, if you've ever wondered
Wondered whatever became of me
I'm living on the air in Cincinnati, Cincinnati, WKRP
Got kind of tired packing and unpacking
Town to town and up and down the dial
Maybe you and me were never meant to be
But baby think of me once in awhile
I'm at WKRP in Cincinnati
