What a night this has been
What a rare mood I'm in
Why, it's almost like being in love
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
I could swear that I'm falling in love
And the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
From the way that I feel
Can't believe this is real
And it's almost like being in love
And the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
From the way that I feel
Can't believe this is real
And it's almost like being in love
What a night, what a rare mood
Falling in love, falling in love
Like I'm falling in love
