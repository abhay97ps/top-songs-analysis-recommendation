Yes, I fell in love last Monday
With a girl I met last Sunday
As I held her hand, tear fell like rain
From the girl I met last Sunday
Her hands were soft as cotton
Her face could never be forgotten
That's how I know I love her so
Yes, the girl I met last Sunday
Her eyes was bright as the moonlight
Her lips was cherry red
I knew that our love would
In the sweet little things she said
Yes, I fell in love last Monday
With the girl I met last Sunday
Now we doing fine, she's mine, all mine
Yes, the girl I met last Sunday
