I'm sending you a Valentine
In hopes that you're still mine
And if that Valentine
Doesn't reach you, it's okay
Now it's not as bad
Like you thought it would be
Come on, baby, and take my heart
I love you still and I always will
Be yours, be yours
Yours, yours, yours
I'm so in love with you
I'm sending you this Valentine
In hopes that you're still mine
And if that Valentine
Doesn't reach you, it's okay
I can't make up your mind for you
Just have patience
That's all you can do
I love you still and I always will
Be yours, be yours, yours
I'm on my knees
Begging you back, baby
There's nothing I won't do
If I could only hold you
In my arms again
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm so in love with you
There's nothing your baby won't do
If I could just 
I'm sending you this Valentine
I'm sending you this Valentine
I'm sending you this Valentine
I'm in love
Sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, baby
Don't give up on me 
I'm on your side 
There's nothing, nothing I won't do
I'm down on my knees
Begging you to stay
Darling, please say you
Won't go away 
Ooh, baby
