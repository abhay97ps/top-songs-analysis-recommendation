I told y'all
It was 'bout to happen, but y'all wouldn't listen to me
Now you see it's poppin' off
Got you in the club, dancin' your ass off
Break it down, break it down for me
Break it down, break it down, break it down for me
Break it down for me
If y'all ready get your lighter and put your fire in the air
'Bout to blow this up
It's on now
Petey Pab' done graduated
Broke 'em loose
Shook 'em off
Twist the game
Train comin'
Full speed!
Ain't nothin' stoppin' this muh'fucka
Puttin' it down
In my hometown
I got it rockin' at the show
All year a motherfucker stompin' in the flo'
Losing control!
Hands up
Bobbin' the dome
And you can call it what you wanna
But you better keep your eyes on it
I've been told ya over and over
I don't feel like talkin' no more
It's about to go down
I told y'all
It was 'bout to happen, but y'all wouldn't listen to me
Now you see it's poppin' off
Got you in the club, dancin' your ass off
Break it down, break it down for me
Break it down, break it down, break it down for me
Break it down for me
Move over
Makin' 'em diesel
Jesus
Clear the road
Block it off
Hold it back
Make a path for it
I'm a creeper
Carolina street sweeper
My brother keep her
You better believe her
Good as a bag of Afghanistan reefer
I can't fuck with me and y'all can't neither
You'll need bulletproof speakers
Will kill 79 people
The levels start to jumpin' on the needle
Then sparks start to shootin' out the speakers
DJ just just can't catch the needle
Clubs call the beaver for the flavor of the Petey
I told y'all
It was 'bout to happen, but y'all wouldn't listen to me
Now you see it's poppin' off
Got you in he club, dancin' your ass off
Break it down, break it down for me
Break it down, break it down, break it down for me
Break it down for me
When they ask me where I'm from I say
Greenville and Raleigh
Durham, Chapel Hill, Greensboro, Charlotte
Fairfield, Rocky Mount, and Tarboro
Pine Tops, Lil' Washington, Farmville
New Bern, Kinston, Snow Hill, Falkland
Please don't get me started
I could call 'em out til' tomorrow
Carolina's list alone is 16 malls
I'm bout to make a role call
Calling up, all out "Could Timbaland please report to the office!"
You can't miss kickoff
Watchin' these niggas get their shit off
Sending adrenaline rush through the whole park
Dust to dawn
From the club to the barn
From port to port
From yard to yard
I done brought it from the far beyond
Stated claim
Got a name, got it painted and framed
Motherfucker!
I told y'all
It was 'bout to happen, but y'all wouldn't listen to me
Now you see it's poppin' off
Got you in the club, dancin' your ass off
Break it down, break it down for me
Break it down, break it down, break it down for me
Break it down for me
I told y'all
It was 'bout to happen, but y'all wouldn't listen to me
Now you see it's poppin' off
Got you in the club, dancin' your ass off
Break it down, break it down for me
Break it down, break it down, break it down for me
Break it down for me
