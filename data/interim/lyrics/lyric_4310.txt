Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
My arms are missing you
My lips feel the same way too
I've tried so hard to be true
Like I promised I'd do
But this boy keeps coming around
He's tryin' to wear my resistance down
Hey, Jimmy
Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
You better hurry back
He calls me on the phone
About three times a day
No, my heart doesn't listen to
What he has to say
But this loneliness I have within
Keeps reaching out to be his friend
Hey, Jimmy
Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
You better hurry back
Need your loving
Need your loving
I wanna say
I'm not getting any stronger
I can't hold back very much longer
Trying hard to be true
But Jimmy, he talks just as sweet as you
Hey, Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
Jimmy, , Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
You better hurry back
Need your loving
Need your loving
Hey, Jimmy Mack!
You better hurry back
Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
I'm not gettin' any stronger 
Can't hold back very much longer 
Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back?
Need your loving 
Need your loving
