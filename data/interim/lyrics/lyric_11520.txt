I want to be seduced
Want a woman to take me out to dinner for two
Like to see her eyes get moody
Flirting with the thought of what flirting ought to do
Like to be real cool
Let her think about getting little me in bed
Have a chat about Magna Carta
Puerto Vallarta, something Ghandi said
I might demur politely, falter slightly
If she tried to fondle my knee
But I'm relatively certain I'd compromise if I know me
I want to be seduced
Want a woman to talk to me suggestively
Want to hear her say she'll be with me tomorrow morning
Drinking hot jasmine tea
Want her to make me laugh
Make a point of touching me when when she talks
Leaving all the jealous men in the joint
To mumble in their beer and gawk
I know it only happens
When I'm napping
Nodding in a reverie
That I find myself a woman who wouldn't mind seducing me
I know it only happens
When I'm napping
Nodding in a reverie
That I find myself a woman who wouldn't mind seducing
Starting from the moment that we've been introduced
I'd like to find a woman who wouldn't mind seducing me
