Yo, Jay

One day when I was chillin' in Kentucky Fried Chicken
Just mindin' my business, eatin' food and finger lickin'
This dude walked in lookin' strange and kind of funny
Went up to the front with a menu and his money
He didn't walk straight, kind of side-to-side
He asked this old lady, "Yo, yo, um, is this Kentucky Fried?"
The lady said "Yeah", smiled and he smiled back
He gave a quarter and his order, small fry and Big Mac
You be illin' , illin'
You be illin', illin'
You be illin', illin'
You be illin', illin'
To-day you won a ticket to see Doctor J
Front row seat , no pay
Radio in hand, snacks by feet
Game's about to start, you kickin' popcorn to the beat
You finally wake up, Doc's gone to town
Round his back, through the hoop, then you scream, "Touchdown!"
You be illin', illin'
You be illin', illin'
You be illin', illin' 
You be illin', illin'
The other day around the way I seen you illin' at a party
Drunk as a skunk, you illin', punk, and in your left hand was Bacardi
You went up to this fly girl and said "Yo, yo, can I get this dance?"
She smelled your breath and then she left you standin' in your illin' stance
You be illin', illin' 
You be illin', illin' 
You be illin', illin'
You be illin', illin'
For dinner, you ate it, there is none left
It was salty, with butter and it was def
You proceeded to eat it 'cause you was in the mood
But, holmes, you did not read it was a can of dog food
You be illin', illin' 
You be illin', illin'
You be illin', illin' 
You be illin'
You be illin', illin'
You be illin', illin' 
You be illin', illin' 
You be illin', illin' 
You be illin', ill-illin' 
You be illin', illin' 
You be illin', illin', ill-ill-illin'
You be illin', ill-ill-ill-ill-illin'
Yo, I know you ain't talkin' to me 
Man, you ain't sayin' nothin' 
Ill-illin' 
Talkin' 'bout my moms? Talkin' 'bout my moms?
