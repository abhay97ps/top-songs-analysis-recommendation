Every night that I held you
Made heaven from hell, yea
I did it for love
Like the change of the season
You grew cold for that reason
I did it for love
And when it all went wrong
And there's no use hanging on
I turned and walked away
Chorus:
I did it, I did it, I did it for love
Now you wanna know
Why I let you go
I did it for love
Well, I thought that I was tough
Well, I guess I'm not tough enough
I didn't do it for the glory
I did it for love
When you were lost in the night
And you feared for your life
I came running to you
And as I held you so tight
You said forever you and I
But girl, I knew
And now you stand and you say
How could I walk away
I love you too much to stay
Oh, I remember how it started
And we felt so alive
And the passion was burning inside
There's a lesson in love
When the heart grows wild
Well, I thought that I was tough
Well, I guess I ain't tough enough
I did it for love
Oh, Oh
I did it, I did it, I did it for love
Now you wanna know
Why I let you go
I did it for love
