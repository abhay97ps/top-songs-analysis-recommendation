I know I may be young, but I’ve got feelings too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So, let me go, and just listen
All you people look at me like I’m a little girl
Well, did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?
Always saying, "Little girl, don’t step into the club"
Well, I’m just tryna find out why, 'cause dancing’s what I love, yeah 
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, woah 
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy
What’s practical? What's logical?
What the hell, who cares?
All I know is I’m so happy when you’re dancing there
I’m a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you
I won’t deny it, I’m not tryna hide it
Baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me?
To another time and place
Oh, baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me?
Leaving behind my name and age
Let's go
Like that
You like it?
Yeah, now watch me
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, woah 
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
I really wanna dance, tonight with you
I really wanna do what you want me to
I really wanna dance, tonight with you
I really wanna do what you want me to
Baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me?
To another time and place
Oh, baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me?
Leaving behind my name and age
I’m a slave for you 
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you 
I won’t deny it, I’m not tryna hide it, baby
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, woah
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh 
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, woah
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
I’m a slave for you 
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you 
I won’t deny it 
I’m not tryna hide it 
Like that
