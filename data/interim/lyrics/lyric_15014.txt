She's the girl of my dreams
She's the girl on my mind
She used to play me for the fool
'Cause she's the hurting kind
I lost my heart in the East
Another part in the West
You better jump back, baby
You're the girl I love the best
I'm gonna ride the wind
There's nothing I won't do
I'm coming up real fast
I've got my eyes on you
See your eyes of love
Well, tell me what you see
I see your long black hair
Moving over me, yeah
Oh yes, I feel good now now
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about it
All right, all right, all right, I've got my eyes on you
All right, all right, all right, I've got my eyes on you, yeah
With my heart over here
Another part over there
I still got plenty left
And baby, I don't care
Oh, let's talk about love
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about love
All right, all right, all right, I've got my eyes on you
All right, all right, all right, I've got my eyes on you
Yeah, oh, oh, let's talk about it, aah
Don't blame me
I won't hurt you
Don't blame me
It's plain to see you know that it'll be yeah, oh, oooooh
Aah, aah, aah
She's the girl of my dreams
She's the girl on my mind
She played me for the fool
It's the hurting kind
Gonna ride the whirlwind, nothing I won't do
Coming up real fast, I've got my eyes on you
All right, all right, all right, I've got my eyes on you
All right, all right, all right, I've got my eyes on you
All right, all right, all right, I've got my eyes on you
All right, all right, all right, I've got my eyes on you 
All right, all right, all right, I've got my eyes on you 
All right, all right, all right, I've got my eyes on you
