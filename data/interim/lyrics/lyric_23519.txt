I got a piece of land out in the countryside
Lay back and smell the sun warm up the Georgia pine
Feels so good to be taking it easy
Why would I ever leave? 'Cause I know
I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good lookin' woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town where it feels like home
I've got everything I need and nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Homegrown
We got a fire goin' down by the riverside
Sip whiskey out the bottle, livin' like we'll never die
Come on and stay a while if you don't believe me
Why would I ever leave? 'Cause I know
I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good lookin' woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town where it feels like home
I've got everything I need and nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Homegrown
Homegrown
Homegrown
I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good lookin' woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town where it feels like home
I've got everything I need 
And nothing that I don't 
Everything I need 
And nothing I don't 
It's the weight that you carry from the things
That you think you want
It's the weight that you carry from the things
That you think you want
Weight you carry
It's the weight that you carry from the things
That you think you want
It's the weight that you carry from the things
That you think you want
I've got everything I need, nothing that I don't
Everything I need, nothing that I don't
Everything I need, nothing that I don't
Oh, everything I need and nothing that I don't
