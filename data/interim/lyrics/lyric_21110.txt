I'm calling his phone up just to tell him how much
I really love him cause he's everything I want
He listens to me, cares for me
So I truly believe
God sent me an angel up from above
That's gonna love me for life
Might as well be perfect
Only because it's the only way I can describe, so
If this isn't love
Tell me what it is
Cause I could be dreaming or just plain crazy
If this isn't love
Tell me what it is
'Cause I never felt like this, baby
If this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what it means to me
L-O-V-E, oh, if this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what it means to me
L-O-V-E, oh, if this isn't love
I'm selfish 'cause I don't wanna share him with nobody
Not even those people that came before me
But see, I never believe
God sent me an angel up from above
That's gonna love me for life
Might as well be perfect
Only because it's the only way I can describe, so
If this isn't love
Tell me what it is
'Cause I could be dreaming or just plain crazy, no
If this isn't love, no
Tell me what it is
'Cause I never felt like this, baby
If this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what it means to me
L-O-V-E, oh, if this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what it means to me
L-O-V-E, oh, if this isn't love
So if you got real love
Let me see you put your hands up
See you put your hands up
The kind of love that fits tight like a glove
Let me see you put your hands up
See you put your hands up
If this isn't love
'Cause I know I ain't crazy, I know I ain't trippin'
I know I ain't slippin', I know that it's love
See me with my hands up
If you think I'm dreaming, I know I ain't dreaming
'Cause this reason maybe and I know what is love
If this isn't love...
If this isn't love
Tell me what it is
'Cause I could be dreaming or just plain crazy, no
If this isn't love, no
Tell me what it is
'Cause I never felt like this, baby
If this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what it means to me
L-O-V-E, oh, if this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what it means to me
L-O-V-E, oh, if this isn't love
