Well, let me tell ya about my love
Some that is and some that ain't
Let me tell you about this one girl I know
The one I did  this ain't
She's walking up to me now
Tell me things so untrue
Talking all about the good things I'm missing
I said, "I give my love to you."
Every day and every night
I've got girls coming up to me
One weighs in at 250 pounds
And 
She's the fire chief's daughter
She might live up in the hills
Could be a farmer's big caller
I said you give me assorted pills
Ahhhh!
Owwww!
She's walking up to me now
Oh, people are feelin' pain
It's me she's gonna mate
She chased me down the alley
Tried to put her arms around me
She trapped me in a corner
And then she put her hand right on me
And then I said "Don't touch me"
Don't, don't touch me
Please don't touch me
Please, please don't touch me
That's the end of my story
People take listen to what I say
I know you think thing's a lot of glory
Well, I go through this every day
