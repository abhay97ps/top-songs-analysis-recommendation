Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring tingle tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "Yoo hoo!"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we
Were snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we
Were snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
(Ring-a-ling-a
Ding
Dong
Ding!)
