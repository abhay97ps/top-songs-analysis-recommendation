Ooh, just ain't enough love
Ooh, just ain't enough love
These are the words my baby spoke
As she bid her last goodbye
With tears in my eyes as she walked from my side
I sadly asked her why
And she said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
Now I was too busy, but that girl of mine
I'd buy her gifts from time to time
So sure this would satisfy, 'til she up and left me
With this reply
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
 I gotta leave you
Because, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
She said, She said, "Ooh, ooh," that's what she told me
And she said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
I said, sweet thing, sweet thing, please don't leave
I'm so sorry I made you grieve
So confident pretty words would make her stay
But this is what she said
As she turned and walked away
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
Ain't enough love, baby, 
That's what she told me 
Ain't enough love baby 
That's what she said I got to move on 
Ooh baby, ain't enough love
