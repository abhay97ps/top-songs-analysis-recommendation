I'll take the "L" from a lemon
Then I'll squeeze it till it's sweet
I'll take the "O" from the ocean
While the waves are asleep
I'll take the "V" from Venus
We'll sail on to victory
Well, if I can take that much effort
Baby, I'm sure you can add the "E"
In the morning when the sun comes up
In the evening when the sun goes down
When the moon is shining bright
Well, then we'll get the preacher
To lead us down the aisle
You know I'll say, "Indeed I do"
With a great, big, pretty smile
Then we'll be together
For eternity
Because we took caution
To find L-O-V-E
In the morning when the sun comes up
In the evening when the sun goes down
When the moon is shining bright
I'll put on the dress with roses
Open your eyes; I'll see that glow
We'll catch that Midnight Flyer
And on a honeymoon we'll go
We don't have to have a lot of money
But I'll swear by the stars above
We've got a lot of one thing, yeah
That's L-O-V-E, love
So, ain't that love
In the morning when the sun comes up?
Ain't that love
In the evening when the sun goes down?
When the moon is shining bright
Ain't that L-O-V-E, love?
I said
Well, we'll have
Hallelujah, I said
