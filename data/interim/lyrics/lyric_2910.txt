Have you looked into your heart?
Did you find a memory or two?
Even though the flame has died
Maybe there's a spark inside
Have you looked into your heart?
Have you searched through all your dreams?
Did you ever find a trace of me?
Even though you say we're through
That I'm not the one for you
Have you looked into your heart?
When the evening shadows
Fall upon my window pane
I find I'm crying over and over
And over and over again
Ever since we've been apart
All I do is pray for your return
Take a look and you will see
Maybe there's a place for me
Have you looked into your heart?
Ever since we've been apart
All I do is pray for your return
Take a look and you will see
Maybe there's a place for me
Have you looked into your heart?
