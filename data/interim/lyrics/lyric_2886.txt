Boom boom boom boom
Gonna shoot you right down
Take you in my arms
I'm in love with you
Love that is true
Boom boom boom boom
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
When you walk that walk
And you talk that talk
You knock me out
Right off of my feet
C'mon and shake 
Shake it up baby 
C'mon now baby 
I don't mean maybe 
You're driving me crazy 
C'mon, c'mon 
C'mon and shake 
Shake it up baby 
Yeah, shake 
I don't mean maybe 
You're driving me crazy 
C'mon, c'mon 
All right, all right
Come on, baby
The way you walk
The way you talk
When you walkin' that walk
And talkin' that talk
You knock me out
Right off of my feet
I need you right now
I mean right now
Come on, come on
Come on, shake it up baby
C'mon and shake 
Shake it up baby 
C'mon now baby 
C'mon now baby 
Come on and shake 
Alright, alright
C'mon and shake 
Shake it up baby 
C'mon and shake 
Shake, shake, shake 
Shake it up baby 
Come on, baby
All right, all right
