This is our fork in the road
Love's last episode
There's nowhere to go, you made your choice
Now it's up to me, to bow out gracefully
Though you hold the key
Whenever you call me, I'll be there
Whenever you want me, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
I'll be around
I knew just what to say, now I found out today
Although the words have slipped away, but I know
There's always a chance, a tiny spark will remain yeah
And sparks turn into flames and love can burn once again
Whenever you call me, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
Whenever you want me, I'll be there
I'll be around
I'll be around
I'll be around
I'll be around
All you got to say
If you really want me
