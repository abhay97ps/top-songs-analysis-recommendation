Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel love, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes
Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel love, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes
Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel love, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes
Lady 
Hear me tonight 
'Cause my feeling 
Is just so right 
Lady 
I just feel like 
I feel love 
For the first time 
Lady 
Hear me tonight 
Can't you see 
You're my delight 
Lady 
I just feel like 
I won't get you 
Out of my mind 
Lady 
Hear me tonight 
'Cause my feeling 
Is just so right
