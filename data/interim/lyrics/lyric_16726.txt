Come back, you know I miss you
Got to hold you once again in my life
It's late, it's quiet
A taxi waits at the door
Footsteps, a door slams
What's going on, it's quarter to four
So many times, so many tears
So many words unspoken
So many doubts, so many fears
So many hearts are broken
'Cause I'm lonely and I miss you tonight 
Got to hold you again in my life 
'Cause I'm lonely and I need you tonight 
Got to hold you again in my life 
The phone keeps ringing
Are you there with a friend
I call back, it's busy
I'll hang up and try once again
So many times, so many tears
So many words unspoken
So many doubts, so many fears
So many hearts are broken
'Cause I'm lonely and I miss you tonight 
Got to hold you again in my life 
'Cause I'm lonely and I need you tonight 
Got to hold you again in my life 
And a whoa, hoe
So many times, so many tears
So many words unspoken
So many doubts, so many fears
So many hearts are broken
'Cause I'm lonely and I miss you tonight 
Got to hold you again in my life 
'Cause I'm lonely and I need you tonight 
Got to hold you again in my life 
I'm lonely and I miss you tonight 
Got to hold you again in my life 
I'm lonely and I need you tonight 
Got to hold you again in my life 
Come back, baby come back
Come back, hey, come on, come on back
Take a boat, take a train, take the aeroplane, just come on back, yeah, yeah, come on back
I don't care, I don't care how you do it, come on back baby
