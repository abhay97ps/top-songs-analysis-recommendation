As I was walking down the street one day
A man came up to me and asked me
What the time was that was on my watch
Yeah... and I said
 Does anybody really know what time it is?
 Does anybody really care?
 If so, I can't imagine why
 We've all got time enough to cry
And I was walking down the street one day
A pretty lady looked at me
And said her diamond watch had stopped cold dead
And I said
 Does anybody really know what time it is?
 Does anybody really care?
 If so, I can't imagine why
 We've all got time enough to cry
And I was walking down the street one day
Being pushed and shoved by people
Trying to beat the clock, oh, no
I just don't know, I don't know, I don't know-oh
And I said... yes, I said
People runnin' everywhere
Don't know where to go
Don't know where I am
Can't see past the next step
Don't have time to think past the last one
Have no time to look around
Just run around, run around think why
 Does anybody really know what time it is?
 Does anybody really care?
 If so I can't imagine why
 We've all got time enough to die
Everybody's working
 I don't care
 About time
 I don't care
