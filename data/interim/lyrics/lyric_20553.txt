The summer that we wanted
Yeah, we've finally got it
Now's the time we get to share 
Each day we'll be together 
Now until forever 
So everybody everywhere 
Let's take it to the beach
Take it there together
Let's celebrate today
'Cause there'll never be another
We're stronger this time
We've been there for each other
Everything's just right 
Everybody, all for one
Our real summer has just begun 
Let's rock and roll and just let go
Feel the rhythm of the drums
We're gonna have fun in the sun
Now that all the hard work, work is done
Everybody, one for all
And all for one 
 All for one, one
Woo! 
Summertime together
Now we're even closer 
That's the way it's meant to be 
Oh, we're just getting started
Come and join the party
You deserve it same as me 
Let's take it to the beach
Take it there together
Let's celebrate today
'Cause there'll never be another
We're stronger this time
We've been there for each other
Everything's just right 
Everybody, all for one
Our real summer has just begun 
Let's rock and roll and just let go
Feel the rhythm of the drums
We're gonna have fun in the sun
Now that all the hard work, work is done
Everybody, one for all
And all for one
Everybody up!
Everybody rock it!
Take it from the top!
And never ever stop it!
It's not about the future
It's not about the past
It's makin' every single day
Last and last and last
Fun and sun, what could be better?
Let's have fun, everyone together now 
This is where our summer really begins 
The very last time it's ever gonna be like this
It's a party you don't wanna miss
Guys, show 'em we can make some moves, hey!
Girls, show 'em we know how to groove, oh!
Here
And now!
Let's turn the partyâ€”
Out!
Everybody jump in!
Everybody, all for one
Our real summer has just begun 
Let's rock and roll and just let go
Feel the rhythm of the drums
We're gonna have fun in the sun
Now that all the hard work, work is done
Everybody, one for all
Everybody, all for one
Let's rock and roll and just let go
Feel the rhythm of the drums
We're gonna have fun in the sun
Now that all the hard work, work is done 
Come on, everyone, let's dance 
We can't let the moment pass
Let's make the party last
All for one
All for one
