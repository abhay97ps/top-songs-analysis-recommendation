You wanna get close to me, the feeling so clear
But I need some time to see, vision through my tears
You wanna get next to me, I need your intrusion
I don't need to be blinded by confusion
Here is my heart, waiting for you
Here is my soul; I eat at Chez Nous
Love will find a way, if you want it to
Love will find a way, love will find a way for me and you
Love will find a way...
Love will find a way...
Love will find a way...
Love will find... 
So you want to get over me, and that's how you feel
Everything you want to be seems so unreal
I want to be all of you, and that's the confusion
It's so hard for me to draw a conclusion
Here is my heart, waiting for you
Here is my soul; I eat at Chez Nous
Love will find a way, if you want it to
Love will find a way, love will find a way
Love will find a way, if you want it to
Love will find a way, love will find a way
I believe that there's a way 
 Love will find a way
 Love will find a way...
