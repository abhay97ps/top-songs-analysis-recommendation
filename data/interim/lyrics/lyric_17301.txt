A little bit of ecstasy
A little bit of you and me
A little bit of such a free
A little bit of ecstasy
A little bit of ecstasy
A little bit of you and me
A little bit of such a free
A little bit of ecstasy
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you need me
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you love me
I'll be your dream
You be my fantasy
I'll be your dream
You be my fantasy
I'll be your dream
I'll be your dream
I'll be your dream
You be my fantasy
Ooh, ooh yeah
(Let the beat...
Let the beat...
Let the beat control your body)
A little bit of ecstasy
