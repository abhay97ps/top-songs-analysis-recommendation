Here's a song I love to sing
It's about the man that wears my ring
And even though he 's tempted he knows
I'll make sure that he gets everything
Cause when he's cold he knows i'm warm
And i warm him in my arms
And when he said how i make him glad and i'm his shelter from the storm
I'm his song when he feels like singin
And i swing when he feels like swingin
I don't know what i'd do that's right but it makes him come home at night
And when he's home i make sure he's never alone
And that's why i keep singin my song
And when he's home i make sure he's never alone
And that's why i keep singin my song
