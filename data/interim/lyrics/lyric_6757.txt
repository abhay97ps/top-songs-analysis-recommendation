I want to feel that you're here whenever I call
I need to be in your eyes ten feet tall
And when I see you walking down the street
You know how my head gets that funny feeling
You have me acting like a man insane
Right now I feel high just on your mane
Slow down, my head's spinning 'round like I just stood up too fast
Woman you heal my hungry feel each time you walk past
I would give you nearly everything if you would only tell me just how much you really really really really love me
Baby
I know I've never seen a woman quite like you
You've slowed and that's a sign of changes you've been through
You're something that I've never run into before
It's nice to know your head has opened up the door
I would give you nearly everything if you would only tell me just how much you really really really really love me
Baby
