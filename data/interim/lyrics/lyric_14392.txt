Livin' with my eyes closed
Goin' day to day
I never knew the difference
I never cared either way
Lookin' for a reason
Searchin' for a sign
Reachin' out with both hands
I gotta feel the kick inside
All fired up 
All fired up 
All fired up 
All fired up, fired up, fired up
Hey!
Ain't nobody livin'
In a perfect world
Everybody's out there
Cryin' to be heard
Now I got a new fire
Burnin' in my eyes
Lightin' up the darkness
Movin' like a meteorite
All fired up 
All fired up 
All fired up 
All fired up, fired up, fired up 
Now I believe there comes a time
When everything just falls in line
We live and learn from our mistakes
The deepest cuts are healed by faith
Now I believe there comes a time
When everything just falls in line
We live and learn from our mistakes
The deepest cuts are healed by faith
Now I believe there comes a time
When everything just falls in line
We live and learn from our mistakes
The deepest cuts are healed by faith
Now I believe there comes a time
When everything just falls in line
We live and learn from our mistakes
The deepest cuts are healed by faith
Now I believe
All fired up 
All fired up 
All fired up 
All fired up, fired up, fired up 
All fired up, now I believe there comes a time
When everything just falls in line
We live and learn from our mistakes
The deepest cuts are healed by faith
