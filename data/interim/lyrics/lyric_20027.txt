Two, three, four
Well, my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
I felt a little fear upon my back
I said, "Don't look back, just keep on walking"
Well, the big black horse said, "Look this way"
He said, "Hey lil' lady, will you marry me?"
But I said, "No no, no no no no"
I said, "No no"
You're not the one for me"
No no, no no no no
I said, "No no, you're not the one for me
Ooh, woohoo
And my heart had a problem in the early hours
So I stopped it dead for a beat or two
But I cut some cord and I shouldn't have done it
And it won't forgive me after all these years
So I sent her to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
Now it won't come back cause it's oh so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see, yeah
And it said, "No no, no no no no
I said, "No no
You're not the one for me"
No no, no no no no
I said, "No no, you're not the one for me"
Ooh, woohoo
I said, "No no no no, no no no
No, no
You're not the one for me" 
No no no no
No no
No no, you're not the one for me"
Big black horse and a cherry tree
I can't quite get there
'Cause my heart's forsaken me
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Big black horse and a cherry tree 
I can't quite get there cause my heart's forsaken me
