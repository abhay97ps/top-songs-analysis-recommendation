So you know
A lot of people tryna be like me, but, you know...
You just can't be like me
Ooh, Lil Pump
Ooh, yeah
Everybody wanna be like me 
Everybody wanna be like me 
Everybody wanna be like me
Bust down, big chains and dress fancy 
Everybody wanna be like me
Spent 2k last week on a white tee 
Everybody wanna be like me
Dropped 10k on my Gucci bedsheets 
Everybody wanna be like me

Bust down, big chains and dress fancy 
Everybody wanna be like Pump 
Everybody got fake dreads and love to take drugs 
I do this, bitch you do whatever you want 
Yes, I'm hella ignorant, I don't give a fuck
And everybody wanna be like Ye 
Everybody wanna go and smash Kim K 
You can talk shit about me everyday 
But I'm still rich at the end of the day
I take drugs like it's vitamin C
I'm a millionaire, but I don't know how to read 
I'm a role model that these kids wanna be 
I just smashed a pregnant bitch that's overseas 
Walk around with my side bitch on a leash 
I was 13 when I started sippin' lean 
Ballin' so hard, I feel like I'm KD 
Wear two bust downs, even when I sleep 
Everybody wanna be like me 
Everybody wanna be like me 
Everybody wanna be like me
Bust down, big chains and dress fancy 
Everybody wanna be like me
Spent 2k last week on a white tee 
Everybody wanna be like me
Dropped 10k on my Gucci bedsheets 
Everybody wanna be like me 
Everybody wanna be like me

Everybody wanna be like me 
Everybody wanna be like me 
Everybody wanna be like me 
Everybody wanna be like me 
Bust down, big chains and dress fancy 
I'm me, I'm me
So who you? You not me... urp
Everybody wanna be like Tune
Grow up to be like Tune, throw up the B like Tune
No one can be like Tune, know why? 'Cause he tycoon
And if the shoe fits, wear it, I can't if these not new
Lil' nigga, please, y'all my mini-mes
But the kid is not my son, shout out Billie Jean
You followin' my lead, my chopper isn't clean
And Lil Pump, he got the pump, I got the M-16
My pockets stuffy, they gon' need some antihistamine
Niggas always bit the stee, the bitches never bit the D
I'm pullin' out the facts, so tell your slime relax
And she a catfish, and he a copycat
What the fuck, though? Well, if you must know
I see these look-a-likes, it's kinda sus though, yerr
Young nigga from them hood with a plan
One foot in the street, one foot in the sand
One foot in the cleats, one foot in the Vans
One foot in your ass, one fourth of a Xan
Follow my footsteps, I give you instructions
Swallow, don't belch, you just drunk quintuplets
On my one-of-one shit, I keep it a hundred
Boy, I talk my shit, then wipe my shit with hundreds
You can't stunt like me, rich as fuck like me
Lil' black ass nappy head nigga
Let me shout out India.Arie, and ain't none like me
Mr. Dwayne Carter, only got one ID, yerr
I know that's right, you don't know that life
Stay in your own lane or make me bowl that strike, yerr
Everybody wanna be like me
But there's only one I in my e-y-e
