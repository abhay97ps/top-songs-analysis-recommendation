I saw it officer
It looked prehistoric ...
There's a monster in my pants
And it does a nasty dance
When it moves in and out
Everybody starts to shout
Monster, aaaah monster, aaaah
Get outta here monster!
Monster! monster!
Get outta here monster!
There's a monster in my pants
And it does a nasty dance
When it sees the light of day
You can here the people say
Oh no, a monster! oh no, a monster!
Oh no, oh no, oh no a giant monster
Monster! monster!
Oh no, a giant monster!
Shut the window, bolt the door!
Don't wanna see that monster no more!
There's a monster in my pants
And it does a modern dance
When it comes into a room
People hit it with a broom
Take that monster! take that monster!
Take it! take it! take that you awful thing!
Take that aaah! take that aaah!
Take it! take it! take that you naughty thing!
And they don't wear pants on the other side of france
But they do wear fleece to protect them from the beasts
Monster! monster! oh gee, a great big monster
There's a monster on the run and it wants to have have some fun
When it flies hup in the air, all the people stop and stare
The guys give a yell and the girls start to shriek
When they see its giant claws and it razor sharp beak
Gosh would you look at that thing
And i thought dinosaurs were extinct
Aaaaah!
