American hunter, bring them up the north side
Run, take the money, here's a bullet for your boyfriend
Eagle all gone, and no more caribou
You be the red king, I'll be the yellow pawn
Godspeed, Mother Nature
Never really wanted to say goodbye
Godspeed, Mother Nature, you know that I'm calling you, darling
Never really wanted to say goodbye
Godspeed, Mother Nature
Never really wanted to say goodbye
Godspeed, Mother Nature
Never really wanted to say goodbye
Shoot a few, knock them down, cost you half a buck now
Babe give you kisses if you hit a rubber duck now
You be the red king, I'll be the yellow pawn
Eagle all gone, and no more caribou
Eagle all gone, and no more caribou
No more, eagle all gone, and no more caribou
Godspeed, Mother Nature
Never really wanted to say goodbye
Godspeed, Mother Nature, I'm weeping, I'm crying for you
Never really wanted to say goodbye
Godspeed, Mother Nature, you know that I'm weeping for you
Never really wanted to say goodbye
Godspeed, Mother Nature, and I'm crying
Never really wanted to say goodbye
I know you're going to hear me, I'm weeping, nature
Weeping, Mother Nature
Never really wanted to say goodbye
And I'm weeping for you
Weeping for you, Mother Nature
And I'm crying for you
Never really wanted to say goodbye
Take care and visit me, Mother, Mother Nature
And I'm missing you
Never really wanted to say goodbye
Where have you gone?
Godspeed, Mother Nature, and I'm weeping for you
