I'd say it was the right time
To walk away
When dreaming takes you nowhere
It's time to play
Bodies working overtime
Your money don't matter
The time keeps ticking
When someone's on your mind
On your mind
I'm moving in slow motion
Feels so good
It's a strange anticipation
Knock, knock
Knocking on wood
Bodies working overtime
It's man against man
And all that ever matters is, baby
Who's ahead in the game
Funny
But it's always the same
Playing
Playing with the boys
Staying
Playing with the boys
After chasing sunsets
One of life's simple joys
Is playing with the boys
Said it was the wrong thing
For me to do
I said it's just a boys' game
But girls play too
My heart is working overtime
In this kind of game
People get hurt
I'm thinking that the people is me
If you wanna find me
I'll be
Playing
Playing with the boys
Staying
Playing with the boys
After chasing sunsets
One of life's simple joys
I don't wanna be
The moth around your fire
I don't wanna be
Obsessed by my desire
With the boys
You play too rough
Playing
Playing with the boys
I'll be staying
Playing with the boys
After chasing sunsets
One of life's simple joys
Is playing with the boys
Playing with the boys
Playing
Playing
Get up, get up
Playing
Get up, get up
Playing...
