Ayo, trophy wife, out, you won me
Until you had to find out it's one me
No-now you benched, aww, your bum knee
Now I'm the bad guy, call me Chun-Li 
'Cause you was slippin', yep, you clumsy
And everything I peeped, can't just unsee
Sips tea, and it's unsweet
Re-respect bad gyal when mi done speak 
Now he shooting his shot like drive-by
Why-why-why you had to make me go call up my side guy?
Ca-ca-can't let a f-boy eff up my nice vibes
Yo, Ariana, come let me give you a high five

"What did she say?", "What did he say?"
You don't listen 'cause you know everything
You don't even need dreams
Tellin' everybody, "Stay woke, don't sleep"
Ah, gonna break that shit down
You don't wait, tell 'em wait another round
Ah, guess you're way above it now
And that's your way to love it now
How can they tell you shit that you've been through?
They are so confused, who cares about their rationale?
If it ain't your view
That's the bottom line
Know-it-all 
Give you a box of chances, every time you blow it all 
As if it were shade, you would just throw it all 
It's like you're trying not to glow at all 
Know-it-all

Why do we have chemistry? 
With a need for speed 
Doin' things that trouble clings  to
And burns off our wings
Ah, gonna break that shit down
