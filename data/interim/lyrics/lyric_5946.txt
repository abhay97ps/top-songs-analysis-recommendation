It's the morning soon he'll rise
Find the glasses for his eyes
Aren't what they used to be
Picks up the clothes he's worn so long
On the bureau sits the picture of a lady
And the mural of a man who's been gone for many years
The old man walks in Echo Park
From bench to bench he moves from morning 'til dark
For the ducks some bread he brings
Wonder if he'll feed them this time next spring
Listening to the children play
Reminds him of other days
Many years ago
Thoughts of a child that he helped grow
And the memory of a letter saying dear sir
We regret to inform you, your son will not be coming home
Old man tell me are there fears
Do you measure life in years
Or is one day all you'll ever know
I've got to know
Have I been a good man
Have I tried to see the light
Wish I may, wish I might
Have the wish I wish tonight
Have I been a good man
