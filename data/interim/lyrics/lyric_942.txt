You're so pretty and so fine
I wonder will I ever
Make you mine
Things I wanna say
Things I wanna do
Most of all, I wanna
Fall in love with you
And that ain't 
That ain't 
That ain't 
I said fall in love with you
Come on over, baby
Have no fear
Tell me, pretty thing
You know I'd love to hear
Tell me that you care
Hold me in your arms
Kiss me sweet and tender
Show me all your charms
That ain't 
That ain't 
That ain't 
If I should fall in love with you
Oh, just love me
Each and every day
And I will love you
In the same old way
I will keep you
Here in my heart
We will never
Never, never part
You're so pretty
You're so fine
If I ever make you mine
Things I wanna say
Things I wanna do
Most of all, I wanna
Fall in love with you
And that ain't 
That ain't 
That ain't 
If I should fall in love with you
Oh, just love me
Each and every day
And I will love you
In the same old way
I will keep you
Here in my heart
We will never
Never, never part
You're so pretty and so fine
Wonder will I ever
Make you mine
Things I wanna say
Things I wanna do
Most of all, I wanna
Fall in love with you
And that ain't 
That ain't 
That ain't 
That ain't 
That ain't 
That ain't nothing 
That ain't nothing 
Nothing but good
