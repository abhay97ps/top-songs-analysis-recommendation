Pardon, darling, if I alarmed ya
I don't mean to bother you; I just wanna
Get you to pause and slow ya walk so
Maybe we can talk and I can try to charm ya
Just tryin' to find out who you are
I don't mean to come off like a telemarketer
I ain't no hood, no crook, no robber
I just want a part of your heart I can borrow
 and maybe I could call you up 
And maybe I can take you out 
So let's exchange digits and later arrange visits
Either your place or mine 
This a different type of commitment 
I'm talking 'bout a true friendship 
Someone I can depend on
To be down no matter what
Let me know if you wit' it 'cause, girl
It would be fly if you were my B-U-D-D-Y
Don't be shy, give it a try
I could be yours, and you could be mine
I can't lie; it would be fly if you were my B-U-D-D-Y
Don't be shy, give it a try
I could be yours if you could be mine
Sorry if I come off disrespectful
But my convo is a little bit to sexual
But, damn, it's incredible
Be more flexible
Cause the context of this text is a lil' special
But, but, wait, wait, let me explain
A buddy is a equal beneficial arrangement
A buddy is a buddy that don't be complaining
Wit' his or her buddy and da buddy they came wit'
 and maybe I could call you up 
And maybe I can take you out 
So let's exchange digits and later arrange visits
Even though it's all night 
This a different type of commitment 
I'm talking 'bout a true friendship 
Someone I can depend on
To be down no matter what
Let me know if you wit' it 'cause, girl
It would be fly if you were my B-U-D-D-Y
Don't be shy, give it a try
I could be yours, and you could be mine
I can't lie, it would be fly if you were my B-U-D-D-Y
Don't be shy, give it a try
I could be yours if you could be mine
Oh, oh, oh, baby
What I'm really tryin' to say is 
The definition of a real buddy is 
She's that one that you can have fun
And ride shotgun through the city with me
Together there's no limit to what we can do
And once we in it, girl, it's just about me and you
So, baby, what you say?
Don't pass this by
Cause if you decide
It would be fly if you were my B-U-D-D-Y
Don't be shy, give it a try
I could be yours, and you could be mine
I can't lie, it would be fly if you were my B-U-D-D-Y
Don't be shy, give it a try
I could be yours if you could be mine
It would be fly if you were my B-U-D-D-Y
Don't be shy, give it a try
I could be yours, and you could be mine
I can't lie, it would be fly if you were my B-U-D-D-Y
Don't be shy, give it a try
I could be yours if you could be mine
