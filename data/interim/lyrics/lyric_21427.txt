Oh yeah
I've got trouble with my friends
Trouble in my life
Problems when you don't come home, at night
But when you do, you always start a fight
But I can't be alone, I need you to come on home
I know you messin' around, but who the hell else is gonna hold me down 
I gotta be out my mind
To think it's gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave, but the other side still believes
And it kills me, to know how much I really love you
So much I wanna ooh hoo ohh to you hoo hoo
Should I grab his cell, call this chick up
Start some shhhh, then hang up
Or I should I be a lady
Ooo maybe caus' I wanna have his babies
Ohh yah yahh cuz I don't wanna be alone
I don't need to be on my own
But I love this man
But some things I just can't stand ohhhh
Ive gotta be out my mind
To think its gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave, but the other half still believes
And it kills me to know how much I really love you
So much I wanna oooohoo, to you hoohoo
Should I pay him back,to see how he'll react Ehhhhh
To see if he'll react to my love, my love ohhhh ohhhhh
I've gotta be out my mind, to think its gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave, but the other side still believes
And it kills me , to know how much i really love u
So much i wanna hoo hoo hoo, to you hoo hoo
Ooohhh and it kills me , to know how much  so much i wanna hooo hoo hoo to you hoo hoo
