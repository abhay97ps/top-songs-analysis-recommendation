Highfly, touch the sky
Whatcha gonna do now the well's dry?
Good time, feeling fine
Whatcha gonna do now there's no wine?
For many years
You played the joker and you always won
You wasted time
Always fooling 'round and having fun
Your luck ran out
Just like the sunshine when the day is done
Your dream subsided
When you decided that your chance had gone
Your chance to be someone
Highfly, touch the sky
Whatcha gonna do now the well's dry?
Good time, feeling fine
Whatcha gonna do now there's no wine?
You never tried
You just accepted things and didn't care
And now it's over
You look around you but there's no one there
It's too late now
Face the truth and don't you try to run
You're feeling sorry
And you've realised your chance has gone
Your chance to be someone
Highfly, touch the sky
Whatcha gonna do now the well's dry?
Good time, feeling fine
Whatcha gonna do now there's no wine?
Highfly, touch the sky
Whatcha gonna do now the well's dry?
Good time, feeling fine
Whatcha gonna do now there's no wine?
Highfly, touch the sky
Whatcha gonna do now the well's dry?
Good time, feeling fine
Whatcha gonna do now there's no wine?
Highfly, touch the sky
Whatcha gonna do now the well's dry?
Good time, feeling fine...
