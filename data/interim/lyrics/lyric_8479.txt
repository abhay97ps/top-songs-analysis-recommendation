Do you remember back in old L.A. 
When everybody drove a Chevrolet 
Whatever happened to the boy next door
The sun-tanned crew-cut all-American male
Remember dancing at the high school hop 
The dress I ruined with the soda pop 
I didn't recognize the girl next-door
The beat up sneakers and the pony tail
Beach baby, beach baby, give me your hand
Give me something that I can remember
Just like before, we can walk by the shore in the moonlight
Beach baby, beach baby, there on the sand
From July to the end of September
Surfin' was fun, we'd be out in the sun every day
Mmm, I never thought that it would end 
Mmm, and I was everybody's friend 
Long hot days
Blue sea haze
Jukebox plays
But now it's fading away
We couldn't wait for graduation day 
We took the car and drove to San Jose 
That's where you told me that you'd wear my ring
I guess you don't remember anything
Beach baby, beach baby, give me your hand 
Give me somethin' that I can remember 
Just like before we can walk by the shore in the moonlight
Beach baby, beach baby, there on the sand 
From July to the end of September 
Surfin' was fun, we'd be out in the sun every day
Beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby
Do do, do do do do
Beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby
Do do, do do do do
Beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby
Do do, do do do do
Beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby
Do do, do do do do
Beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby
Do do, do do do do
