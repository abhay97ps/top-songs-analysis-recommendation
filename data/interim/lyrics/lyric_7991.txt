I'm beginning to believe I get my kicks from being hurt
Instead of making love feel better, you just make it worse
You tell me go, then call me back, and then you set me free
You always come back to hurtin' me
You always come back to hurtin' me
As sweet and stinging as a honey bee
I'm never really sorry when you leave
You always come back to hurting me
Wanting you, I know I'm throwing good love after bad
But I'll admit the worst of you is still the best I've had
I'm that way, you're that way, and it's maybe meant to be
You always come back to hurting me
You always come back to hurtin' me
