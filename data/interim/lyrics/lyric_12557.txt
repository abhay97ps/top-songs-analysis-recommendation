Another morning, you are on my mind
Takin' up my time throughout the day
I try controllin' images I see
Always you with me, that's in my dreams
You give me fever, love I can't explain
Fire uncontained, what is this, girl?
I try to fight, but I never win
Seems I just give in to your embrace
But oh, you try so hard not to say
Oh, all the things you do to me, and girl, oh
Oh, my love can't be concealed
Girl, you know the deal
Baby, stay with me tonight
At my apartment, you'd come to the door
Quarter after four AM, hello
We start to kiss, ooh, we start to neck
You know what comes next, and you love it, girl
But oh, what we have it feels so good
Oh, and we both knew that it would, and girl, oh
Oh, the feeling is so right
Please come hold me tight
Baby, stay with me tonight
'Cause you give me special joy
Oh, make me feel just like a schoolboy, girl, oh
Give me feelings of delight
Please turn out the light
Baby, stay with me tonight
'Cause I love ya
You know I really do love you, girl
It's been my innermost fantasy
To share and care and to give my love to you through the night
You call me crazy, maybe that is true
But what can I do? I love you, girl
You got me movin', movin' left and right
Deep within the night, come here, my dear
You give me fever, love I can't explain
Fire uncontained, what is this, girl?
I try to fight, but I never win
Seems I just give in to your embrace
But oh, oh, I pray you never leave
Oh, 'cause my heart would surely grieve so, girl, oh
And you know I would not lie
Girl, you are my pride
Baby, stay with me tonight
'Cause you give me special joy
Oh, make me feel like a schoolboy, girl, oh
Oh, the feeling is so right
Please come hold me tight
Baby, stay with me tonight
Need you by my side, baby
Oh, baby, stay with me tonight
Oh oh oh oh
Baby, stay with me tonight
Oh, oh oh oh oh, baby
Oh, oh
Baby, baby, baby, yeah
I wanna run my fingers through your hair
Whisper sweet things in your ear, oh baby
Stay with me tonight
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey hey hey hey, baby
Stay with me
