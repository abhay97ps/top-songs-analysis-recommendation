Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Well my Mama sheds tears, and my Daddy just spits, 
They had it up to here and kicked me out because of it
Something wild's deep inside, man, I'm rattling my cage
I love you Ma, respect you Pa, get out of my way
Chorus:
'Cause I'm a jungleboy
Turn up the radio
A jungleboy
Hear me growling low
A jungleboy
Hey Mrs, Jackson, keep your daughter away from me 
'Cause I'm a definite threat to her purity, uh-huh-huh
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Well there's a mean old cop in the Burger King lot, 
Been after me for years, but I ain't been got
I got a mean set of wheels, and Lord he can't catch me
I lay some wheel and man I'm gone, a real cool breeze
Chorus
Hey Mrs. Jackson, man, I know it's late
It's about your daughter now, and it can't wait
See I'm her boy, if you don't approve
It's my town, toots, if you don't like it, move
'Cause I'm a jungleboy
I'm a jungle boy
I got her daughter
I'm a jungle boy
I got a plan
I'm a jungle boy
I got the bullets
I'm a jungle boy
I think i'll be a jungle man
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
