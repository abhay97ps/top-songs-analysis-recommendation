I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
Love is love and not fade away
Love is love and not fade away
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I'll try to show it if you drive me back
But your love for me has got to be real
Before you know just how I feel
Love real love, not fade away
Well love real love, not fade away
I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
Love to last more than one day
Well love is love and not fade away
Well love is love and not fade away
Well love is love and not fade away
Not fade away
Not fade away
