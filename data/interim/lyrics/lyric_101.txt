Up town, in penthouse number three
Up town, there lives a doll just made for me
She's the finest thing that you've ever seen
Up town, I see her most every day
Up town, but she never ever looks my way
I'm just a bellhop, you see I can't stop
And tell her what I wanna say
That one of these days, I'm gonna have money
She'll wanna be my ever lovin' honey
It won't be long, just wait and see
I'll have a big car, fine clothes and then I'll be
Up town, in penthouse number three
Up town, just my baby and me
That one of these days, I'm gonna have money
She'll wanna be my ever lovin' honey
It won't be long, just wait and see
I'll have a big car, fine clothes and then I'll be
Up town, in penthouse number three
Up town, just my baby and me
