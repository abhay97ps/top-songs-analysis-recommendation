Hey, can't you just see me
With my head in the air
The day you trip and fall
Right out of my hair
I'm gonna walk right by you
Like you were stone
Everything that I felt for you, baby
Will be dead and gone
Hey, can't you just see me
Can't you just see me, girls
Can't you just see me now
With my head in the air
Hey, can't you just see me
With another man
Just a-hugging and a-kissing
And him holding my hand
I'm gonna feel so happy
Just paying you back
For all the times that you hurt me, baby
By doing you just like that
Oh, can't you just see me
Can't you just see me now
Can't you just see me, girls
With my head in the air
Can't you just see me
Ooh ooh, can't you just see me now
Can't you just see me, girls
With my head in the air
I wanna look in your eyes
And see a whole lotta tears
You know that you done me bad
For a whole lotta years
And I might slap your face
All over the place
Ooh, can't you just
Can't you just, can't you just
Can't you just see me now
