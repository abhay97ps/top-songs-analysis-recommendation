If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts would tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back
If you could read my mind, yeah
If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thought would tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind that drugstores sell
When you reach the part where the heartache comes
The hero would be you
Heroes often fail
Never thought I'd feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back
If you could read my mind
If you could
If you could
If you could read my mind
If you could
If you could
If you could read my mind
If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts would tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts would tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind that drugstores sell
And when you reach the part where the heartache comes
The hero would be you
Heroes often fail
Never thought I'd feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone
And I just can't get it back
If you could
If you could
If you could read my mind
If you could
If you could
If you could read my mind
If you could
If you could
If you could read my mind
