Call yourself a family man
Talking about your family's plans
To bring the sweet talk deep and down
Works better than an average pickup line
You put your woman out to pasture
On the promises you gave her last year
Peace and love is on your head
The grass is greener playin' around
Your family seed is what you spread
Buddy, my friend
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Who you think you fooling, Buddy, my friend?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And what about your woman, Buddy, my friend?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Who you think you fooling, Buddy? Buddy, my friend
I don't care what you do
But there's a hypocrite that lives in you
'Cause if your woman gave her love in the same way that you do
You'd feel a way, you know you would
Buddy, my friend
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Who you think you fooling, Buddy, my friend?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And what about your woman, Buddy, my friend?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Who you think you fooling, Buddy? Buddy, my friend
Treat her that way
And you'll be X'ed soon, Buddy, X'ed soon
Treat her that way
And you'll be X'ed soon, Buddy, X'ed soon
It's better to be safe than sorry
But you gonna be sorry when it's too late
Buddy
Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, yeah
What's up?
Romeo, Romeo
