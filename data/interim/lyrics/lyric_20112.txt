Dro! I'm clean in this bitch 
Now I'm finna shoulder lean in this bitch 
Nigga buck, carbon 15 in this bitch 
This Grand Hustle team of kings is getting rich
I lean and get lit, lima bean Six
I take breath, the opposite of Primatene Mist 
I ride twenty-six and let my nine screens flip 
Dro be watching Oprah, Mac 9 up in a clip
Triple-black Phantom , nigga, nah, it ain't Tip 
With Lucky Charms, diamonds, man, but nah, it ain't Flip 
Hey, bounce , okay, then I let my shoulder lean
And I bet my car talk, and I bet my motor clean 
Suicide-door brown Rover look like pork and beans 
Everybody know me in the club 'cause they smoking me
Dro! Hoes scoping me, ice come from Boca Ree-ton
Hundred karats have 'em froze for an eon 
Red, black, and white Chevy, now I'm riding Deion
Put them lights off in my rims , now I'm riding neon
Our cars look like crayon, hoes know I'm the man though 
I can shoulder lean, I don't know how to dance though

First, I let my wheels spin, then I let my screen fall
Then I let my trunk beat at Greenbriar Mall, tall
Ahh, then, I pimp a ho, Take a bitch to Berlin
My bitch break niggas; after that, we fuck they girlfriend
My girl got a girlfriend, Chevy blue like whirlwind
Nigga, it's a drought on that boy, so I got that girl in
Pearl Benz, cocking hammer, Arm and Hammer propaganda
Bitches think I'm pimping in linen and salamander sandals
Dirty South hot 'cause Atlanta, show niggas with ana'
We ride Phantom, holler "Shawty" for grammar
Yep, now I be on TV, BET our channel
Hood nigga from Bankhead, I stay by Grandma Nana
I lay by my banana, dumping and punking monkeys 
Don't nobody live with my mom but a bunch of junkies 
Doughnut dunkin', bitch, I ride glazed on the haze
Gator-green Chevy, gator guts, alligator J's
