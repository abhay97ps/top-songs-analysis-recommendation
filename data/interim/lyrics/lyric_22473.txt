Life's too short to even care at all, oh whoa oh
I'm losin' my mind, losin' my mind, losin' control
Oh oh
These fishes in the sea, they're staring at me, whoa oh
Oh oh oh oh
A wet world aches for a beat of a drum
Whoa oh
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away
To some fortune that I, I should have found by now
I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down, come down
Life's too short to even care at all oh whoa
I'm coming up now, coming up now, out of the blue oh
These zombies in the park, they're looking for my heart
Oh oh oh oh
A dark world aches for a splash of the sun oh oh
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away
To some fortune that I, I should have found by now
And so I run now to the things they said could restore me
Restore life the way it should be
I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down
Life's too short to even care at all, oh
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind, losing control
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away
To some fortune that I, I should have found by now
And so I run now to the things they said could restore me
Restore life the way it should be
I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down
One more spoon of cough syrup now, oh whoa
One more spoon of cough syrup now, oh whoa oh oh
