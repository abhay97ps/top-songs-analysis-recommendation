I got the hungries for your love
And I'm waitin' in your welfare line
Well, I ain't got nothin'
But the shirt on my back
And an old two button suit
I walked outta my job
About a week ago
And now I'm sleepin' in a
Telephone booth
But I'm a-gonna be
The richest guy around
The day you say you're mine
I got the hungries for your love
And I'm waitin' in your welfare line
Well, when I first saw you babe
You nearly made me wreck
My ol' '49 Cadillac
I knew at a glance
That it was you for me;
I had to have your love by heck
I'm gonna follow you baby
Wherever you go;
I got nothin' to lose
But my time
I got the hungries for your love
And I'm waitin' in your welfare line
--- Instrumental ---
Well, you made me
The top dog on your hill
And I was overjoyed
But it didn't take long
'Til the thrill was gone
I joined the ranks of
The unemployed
Now, I'm right back where
That I started from
But that ain't gonna
Change my mind
I got the hungries for your love
And I'm waitin' in your welfare line
Yeah, I'm waitin' in your welfare line
I'm waitin' in your welfare line...
