ACT IV: the journey
"Floating"
Floating in the clouds with you
We can go out and watch a movie too
Stay with me, inside your heart
We could run away, we don't have to go far
We could run away into the moonlight
Bitch I know a place where there the air makes your skin tight
We can just go anywhere any place
Go as far as you want just don't push me away
Because you're my escape from the chaos
I'll see you at the moon river, meet me at the seance
I tattooed your name into my skin with a crayon
Cause the ink don't bleed it cemеnts all the pain I
Write about, fuck this class we'll lеave right about
Now I really wanna go cause I'm 'bout to shout
At all of these teachers
My friends won't talk to me cause I made some grave mistakes
I got a little drunk and I can't erased
All my past so I ask for a little faith
I took a leap and it changed my fate
Now I'm stuck where the Angels wait
And they sing
And I run
And they sing
And I run
And they sing
And I run
And they sing
And I run
And they sing
And I run
And they sing
And I run
Run
"In The Clouds"
Once upon a time in this galaxy there was a child
Scared of the moon outkasted and idle, wild
Seeing how the world spun all around his fingertips
Leaves of the trees made the music and so he gets
Taught as he grows up "I should be who I am
Be kind to all your people always try to understand"
But he couldn't comprehend what the fuck he was going through
Thoughts in his head wondering what the world is coming to
He thought the earth was ending in the year of 2012
So his life was carefree but his mind was in hell
'Cause a heaven seemed way too close for comfort
So at 9 years old he found the jump rope
He told everybody what he was about to do
And in theory he was supposed to be hanging from the roof
Now it's 9 years since and this child hurts me deep
'Cause I don't know who he is but his thoughts haunt me
Still
I don't even know who I am in the first place
All I know is that today I'm in the worst space
My girl is probably gonna leave me with the way she's acting
We get dramatic no wonder she wants to be an actress
I miss when you would just love on me and lay on my mattress
But nowadays I'm 'bout to snap, and I won't have it
Fuck your therapist I'm a terrorist when I start rapping
So fuck the principal, pussy I am the captain
You better strap in
I'm finding paradise
And to the moon we go we're afraid of the light
But we was born in the dark so we gon' be alright
We floating high in the clouds, I think I see the light
You better strap in
I'm finding paradise
And to the moon we go we're afraid of the light
But we was born in the dark so we gon' be alright
We floating high in the clouds, falling down from the sky
And see I thought we'd live forever
And though you say you love me we could never be together
Because I love you but I know I'll just hurt you again
I think about you everyday and wish we'd never end
Cause even though you say you love me, you show otherwise
I don't know if I cause you pain or if you're in disguise
But you're an angel's sweet soul up in Heaven's eyes
I wish that I could go to Heaven to be by your side
Even then I don't think that's the reason
That my thoughts are deceiving
Myself and my health cause I'm hurt over you
But I know that my heart is teething
Switch like the seasons
Call it covid because I'm not breathing
Someday I'm going back home to where my heart is beating
Fuck it I'm leaving
I'm going back there like gonzo
When I fly I won't see you tomorrow
Dead body on the pavement
Spirit in the sky
Now you wonder why I left
Cause I wanna go home
To where I belong
Far away from the earth
This is not suicide
This is just a rebirth
Motherfuck this life
I'm way too hurt
My love will soar above this dirt
You think you understand?
Fuck it I hope you don't
I'm sorry mama but it's clear to me I'm all alone
My vision's blurry but I'm sober like I'm in Kauai
So now I have to go and I never can say goodbye
These close encounters of the third kind are in my heart
We're all about to fly away so when I jump it starts
Cause from my world I'm the pilot I'm the captain
You should find your wings to be happy
So you better strap in
I'm finding paradise
And to the moon we go we're afraid of the light
But we was born in the dark so we gon' be alright
We floating high in the clouds, I think I see the light
You better strap in
I'm finding paradise
And to the moon we go we're afraid of the light
But we was born in the dark so we gon' be alright
We floating high in the clouds
I see the light
Floating in the clouds
Falling from the sky
Is this the moment I pass?
Will I ever die?
Or will I live forever?
To change the world and more
I'll work hard to push the boulder 'til I hit the floor
This plane is crashing down
My wings aren't working
My heart's hurting but all of a sudden
I see a child with the tears of a fallen angel
A reflection and discovery and so I thank you
I see the light
"With You"
So I wrote this song in 2017
But I thought it was still pretty good so
I just wanted to sing it
I just wanted to sing
Fenced off from the world
As it would be
Take off into the world
Where I should be
I never learnt how to fly
So this is gonna be one hell of a ride
But I'll be fine
So deep into the shadows where I lurk
In my mind everything always works
But I won't stop searching until you're
Found
Found, found
You know that your heart will find a way
But not today
Not for me
This plane isn't mine to crash but I'll take flight
Right before they dash
Away
I found this place around the bed
I thought it was great but all it lead to was
Nothing
Fuck it 
And everybody calls me names
They say I'm dumb but I just want to play
Bitch
Hehe
Well, fuck 'em 
So acceptance really isn't my thing
A woman once told me to find my wings
So I'll go there if I have to
Fuck what the rest say
Fenced off from the world, where I should be
Take off into the world, as I will be
So now you're gonna watch me fly
I'm gonna take off into the world 
Where you can't hurt me 
So please let me be
Let me be
Let me
With you
With you
With you
With you
With you
With you
With you
With you
With
"Sunrise"
Yeah I'm tryna find my way
I really hope you find your way one day
But why won't you talk to me
I missed when you walked with me
Oh fuck my life
Momma I am sorry but I gotta go and live my life
For my life
I don't think we could've lived forever
I just wish that we had lived at all
Even if you want to stay together
Still my heart will have to let you go
"Eternal"
I hope you
I hope you find your way
I hope you
I wish you
I wish you could've stayed
I wish you
I miss you
I miss you everyday
I miss you
I need you
I need you always
I need you
I'd do
Anything to go back
I'd do
I love you
My love is here to stay
I love you
I know you
I know you'll find your way
I know you
"Moon River"
So I'm on top of Pigeon Mountain and I'm recording this
Before I get into this, I just wanna say thank you
My name is Shaydon Stoutley A.K.A. JJ Shadow
And this song is just how I feel
It's how I've always felt
And it's how I'll always feel
I just wanna say thank you and I love you to everyone listening to this
And for giving me the time of day and night
Going for a walk man I couldn't trust anybody
Paranoid as fuck I think I saw some ghosts or something
Sitting on a bench while I'm writing all this
Looking out at the view of my perfect Heaven
I been tired, I been hurt and I been filled to the brim
With the subconscious thought that I will never see you again
I never really thought about it right up until now
So much time we could've spent or said word, fuck a vow
I never saw the power in love
This place is so beautiful so I'll come here again
While the stars are out
Hoping God don't change plans
I wanna live forever, then do it all over again
There's a family passing by I can't wait to have one
I'm looking at this cityscape and realise I'm not done
The cars pass and I hope they don't crash
But if this feeling lasts
I want to leave a legacy of love as my past
So please don't gasp, at the thought of me leaving
'Cause in our future we will rise
I look up into the sky and realise I stay dreaming
I thought I was in the darkness, then I thought I saw the light
First it was a rainbow now it's something so bright
That it could only come from the Heavens above
While you hope to find success all I do is choose love
Cause that's what I found, and it found me first
I love myself in every way at my best and my worst
Because even through all I've done it's still what I deserve
And you deserve it too, but let me tell you this first
You need to stop doubting
And choose love over fear, sometimes these people try to kill because their love was never there
When it's everywhere
It's here from me and to you
And it's easier to hate than to love bulletproof
So being vulnerable and giving love can hurt and make you bleed
But the solace you receive is really all that you need
When I crossed the moon river
I walked among all the trees
I left the cabin in the woods
As Pigeon Mountain succeeds
I reached the top and I'll never stop loving
So this one is for you
Thank you for the memories, everyone
Everything's alright, bitch, I love you
What the fuck?
Oh shit, fuck, I need to get back home
Fuck what time? Oh fuck
