Vernon'll meet me when the BOAC lands
Keys to the MG will be in his hand
Adjust to the driving and I'm on my way
It's all on the right side of Montego Bay
Sing out
Oh, oh
Come sing me la
Come sing me Montego Bay
Oh
And Gillian'll greet me like a brother would
I think I remember but it's twice as good
Like how cool the rum is from his silver tray
I thirst to be thirsty in Montego Bay
Sing out
Oh, oh
Come sing me la
Come sing me Montego Bay
Oh
They're dancing in the street
Lay on a lilo 'til I'm lobster-red
I still feel the motion here at home in bed
I tell you, it's hard for me to stay away
You ain't been 'til you been high on Montego Bay
Sing out
Oh, oh
Come sing me la
Come sing me Montego Bay
Oh
Sing out
Come sing me Montego Bay
Oh
Sing out
Come sing me Montego Bay
Oh
You gotta
You gotta sing
Come sing me la
Oh
Sing out
Come sing me la
Oh
You gotta
You gotta sing
Come sing me la
Oh
