Lyrics &
Hmmmmmmmmmmm
Some folks drink and some folks smoke
Some folks love and some folks don't
Some folks laugh and some folks frown
Some folks hear to gun you down
Goodbye John  six white horses come to take you home
Goodbye John   took you away before you sang your song
Hmmhmmmm  
Which is wrong and which is right
Some preach love and some preach fight
Takes every kind to make the world go round
Takes only one to gun you down
Goodbye Martin  six white horses come to take you home
Goodbye Reverend    took you away before you sang your song
Hmmhmmmm  
Some people stick pretty close to home
Some people are born with the urge to roam
Welcome welcome to our town
I Hope nobody tries to gun you down
Goodbye Bobby  six white horses come to take you home 
Goodbye Robert  took you away before you sang your song
Hmmhmmmm
Goodbye John  goodbye Martin  goodbye Bobby 
Took you away before you sang your song
Hmmmmmmmm
