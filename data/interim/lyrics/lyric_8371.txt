I thought she noticed me when I saw her
She seemed to check me out right away
So I -
Asked her name
I played the old game
Her reception seemed to be o.k
She was a cute little thing about fifteen
And she liked to make the schoolboys stare
It was an instant cosmic need
A Teenage Love Affair
It was getting hotter minute by minute
As each second brought her closer to me
And then we -
Finally touched and
We touched and we touched
And her hands felt their way over me
So we made love there in the daytime
When her mama left, we went upstairs
It was a total cosmic deed
A Teenage Love Affair
Teenage love affair
A teenage love affair
Teenage love affair
A teenage love affair
Teenage love affair
A teenage love affair
Teenage love affair
A teenage love affair
Then I heard a strange rumor about her
And i didn't know just what to say
It really -
Brought me down
You know it turned me around
Cause no girl had ever done me that way
But it didn't take long til I found out
That there's a lotta sexy girls out there
And I've got a built-in cosmic need
For Teenage Love Affairs
Teenage love affair
A teenage love affair
Teenage love affair
A teenage love affair
Teenage love affair
A teenage love affair
Teenage love affair
A teenage love affair
