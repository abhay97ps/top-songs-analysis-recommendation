Ayyo
It started in the 80s.  Brooks Junior High, Deff
Boyz incorporated and DBI.  It was
Lamar, emcee with the beatbox spitting
And I was guaranteed master rhyme technician with the
Bubble letter, iron on zodiac sleeves
Uh, bearing water in the place to be
B-boy prototype, a pro on the mic
Traveling the daylight in British nights.  Now trans-
-form to the 90s.  No one can get with me
Bigtime in high school, came to get busy with a
Fisherman hat, Bulls starter jacket
Week sixteen, top-seeded in my bracket
Lunchroom hallways, guaranteed to pack it
Pulled ‘em in the steel house jam like a magnet.  Now what’s
On the clock?  Atlanta, university
JP brawling hard, repping M-O-B.  It’s like
That, y’all

Yo, see, I
Was busting in the lounge, Krush Grooving to sound
Underneath, they are , moving the crowd
’98, it was fate.  Pennsylvania to state
My rhymes was at a 2-1-5 level of great
Traveling Penn campus when I got it in on
The mic—another random room—rapping at the gathering
Prophets of the ghetto, yo, what’s happening?  We had ‘em
Clapping while my classmates called me Derrick Jackson
The highlight: studio nights, earning the rights
For what I write to bang in your left and your right
 walking on the Moon like Mike.  The 4-
-1-8 made a flash for all the stereo types.  Now
It’s the 2000s.  Fatnice arousing
And I’ma be around like public housing
Styling it free, fire like D.M.C., and taking
Heed from the words of Masta A-C-E.  Tell ‘em
