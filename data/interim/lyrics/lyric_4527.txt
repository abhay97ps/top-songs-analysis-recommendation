Graduation Day
Graduation Day
It's a time for joy
A time for tears
A time we'll treasure
Through the years
We'll remember always
Graduation Day
At the senior prom
We danced 'til three
And then you gave
Your heart to me
We'll remember always
Graduation Day
Though we leave in sorrow
All the joys we've known
We can face tomorrow
Knowing we'll never walk alone
When the ivy walls
Are far behind
No matter where
Our path may wind
We'll remember always
Graduation Day
Though we leave in sorrow
All the joys we've known
We can face tomorrow
Knowing we'll never walk alone
When the ivy walls
Are far behind
No matter where
Our path may wind
We'll remember always
Graduation Day
