It took a whole lot of doin
But we did it
Yes we did girl
Oh lots of doin'
But we did it
Yes we did girl
It took a lot of doin’
Lots of renewing
We made mistakes but we had what it takes to get over them
It took a whole lot of making
But we made it
Yes we did girl
We took the bitter with the sweet
And when love got weak
We saved it
Yes we did girl
It took a lot of making, sometimes heartbreaking
And when I thought I didn't need it
You helped me shake it to get over girl
It took a whole lot of doin
But we did it
Yes we did girl
Oh lots of doin
But we did it
Don't you know we did it girl
We got down to nitty gritty
My mom thought it was a pity
It took a whole lot of doin
But we did it
Yes we did girl
Oh lots of doing
But we did it
Yes we did girl
It took a lot of doin’
Lots of renewing
We made mistakes but we had what it takes
To get over it girl
It took a whole lot of making
But we made it
Yes we did girl
Whole lots of making
But we made it
Yes we made it
It took a whole lot of doin
