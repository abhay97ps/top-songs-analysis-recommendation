I remember when we used to be in our teens
I wear bobby socks and old blue jeans
That was long so I?d like to say
I love you in the same old way, a-ha-ha
I love you in the same old way
Mmm
I remember when we used to babysit your brother
And who was watching us?
Your father and mother
That was long ago and I?d like to say
I love you in the same old way, a-ha-ha
I love you in the same old way
Now, heaven
I?m in heaven again
And I still remember where and when
And I love you
You still love me, hah
And that?s the way its gonna be
I remember when we were in school
A-learning how to live by the golden rule
That was long ago and I?d like to say
I love you in the same old way, a-ha
I love you in the same old way
Ho!
Mmm, heaven
I?m in heaven again
And I still remember where and when
I still love you
You know you love me
And that?s the way its gonna be
Hey, I remember when we used to be in school
A-learning how to live by the golden rule
That was long ago and I?d like to say
I love you in the same old way, a-ha-ha
I love you in the same old way, a-ha-ha
I love you in the same old way, a-ha-ha
