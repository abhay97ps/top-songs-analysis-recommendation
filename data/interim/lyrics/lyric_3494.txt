Oh, jealous heart
Oh jealous heart stop beating
Can't you see the damage you have done
You have driven him away forever
Jealous heart now I'm the lonely one
I was part of everything he planned for
And I know he loved me from the start
And now he hates the sight of all I stand for
All because of you, oh jealous heart
Now that he's gone
He's gone and found another
I know he loved me at the start
Through the years his memory will haunt me
And all because of you, oh jealous heart
And all because of you, oh jealous heart
