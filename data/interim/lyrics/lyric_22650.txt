Right about now
You're about to be possessed
By the sounds of Slaughterhouse
She strips to get tips
Those lips and those childbearing hips
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl

Those lips and those childbearing hips

I’m Crooked I, a.k.a., "Fuck-Your-Girl"
 up-up in the sky, when it come down, say—
These strippers are sprung, my middle initial is R, for Richard
And my nickname's right on the tip of her tongue, the side of her mouth is drippin' with—egg
Uh, I’m drunk right now, stumped right now; tryna figure out how
To get four chicks to sit on one chair—oh, yeah—turn the chair upside down

I said, "Yo, yo—
You got me on a string, I'm dangling like a yo-yo
You string me along and leave me hangin', and that's a no-no
In my world, 'cause I'll—I'll throw this dick on you girl."
Look——they call me, "Joe Butt-In," I be around when them hoes strut in 
This relationship is 50/50—if you meet me halfway, I get the whole nut in
'Cause I’m in town—just one day, now, spin round—get your face out the way
And just when she want an encore, I’m gone, Ma, sorry that I couldn’t stay—aye
And they call me, "O-E-double-L Ortiz," a.k.a., "Yaowa"
A.k.a.—nah, nothing, I just got an AK in my jeans, can I spray your flower?

When you finish that spit, let's split, where's your wrist, let me throw this grip on you, girl, girl
She’s got it—oh, she got all the homies 
In here, excited, oh, I don't really know 
How to describe it
