By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be risin'
She'll find the note I left hanging on her door
She'll laugh when she  reads the part
That says  I'm leavin'
'Cause I've left that girl, so many times before
By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be workin'
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But that phone will just keep on ringin' 
Off the wall 
Baby that's all 
By the time I reach Oklahoma she'll be sleepin' 
She'll turn softly and call my name so low 
And I know she'll cry  to think I'm really leaving her 
For time and time, I've tried to tell her so
She didn't know 
I'd really go 
Oh baby baby 
I love ya but I'm leavin 
 I'm gonna miss your love
But I got to leave ya 
 this time
This time I'm leavin, girl 
 I hate to leave 
 but I got to go 
 I'm going to miss your love 
 I'm going to miss your kiss 
 but I got to leave ya
 baby 
 I love ya
