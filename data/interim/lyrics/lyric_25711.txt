My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice 
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life 
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights 
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine 
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie
I don't even like dubs in mine 
What I look like with all them twenties? 
Know them hoes like how I'm coming 
What I look like with all this money? 
How I look havin' all these hoes? 
When I crack a smile, white gold 
Yeah, I'm talkin' diamonds, froze 
Came from the bottom, toes 
Yeah, backend Baby 
That's what they pay me a show 
That's probably some cap in my rap
By the time this shit drop, they gon' pay me some more 
And I still can go back to the trap
Send a box, pick it up, make a play at the store
Feelings still hurt from when I saved that ho
My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice 
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life 
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights 
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine 
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie
I don't even like dubs in mine 
Nope
Too raw, dope 
You know I'm one of the G.O.A.T.'s
She let me put it in the back of her throat
Walk in the bank with a M in a tote 
I'm tryna make a deposit
Let 'em try play with the money 
Shawty gon' take off your noggin
Long as she want it and pick it, I'm buyin' it
I had the Rover for a year, I don't drive
I get 'em whacked, I don't advise 'em to try it, yeah
I'm runnin' shit, I ain't lyin'
I got a backend for one twenty-five
I bought a Patek for one eighty-five
This shit gettin' easy at this point
My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice 
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life 
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights 
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine 
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie
I don't even like dubs in mine 
Heartless, don't need a valentine 
I call 'em racks, not bands 
Ain't no rubber band on mine 
I used to be down, down, down, down
Waiting on taxes time 
Look at me now, now, now, now
They pay me to flex and shine 
Big speaker like an eighteen inch sub 
I'm a hundred, you a dub 
Lookin' for me, I'm booked up 
50 Cent, I'm in the club 
Diamonds on my earlobe, ice on dyke 
One-fifty on studs
Rugrat, young nigga got it out the mud
My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice 
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life 
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights 
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine 
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie
I don't even like dubs in mine
What I look like with all them twenties? 
Know them hoes like how I'm coming 
What I look like with all this money? 
How I look havin' all these hoes? 
When I crack a smile, white gold 
Yeah, I'm talkin' diamonds, froze 
Came from the bottom, toes
