Going down that long lonesome highway
Bound for the mountains and the plains
Sure ain't nothing here gonna tie me
And I got some friends I'd like to see
One of these days I'm gonna settle down
But till I do I won't be hanging round
Going down that long lonesome highway
Gonna live life my way
One of these days I'm gonna settle down
But till I do I won't be hanging round
Going down that long lonesome highway
Gonna live life my way
Yes I'm going down that long lonesome highway
Gonna live life my way
