Me and Martha took a honeymoon
Below the border 'neath the silvery moon
She was eighteen and I was twenty-two
Now we're just a-doin' what the young folks do
We're goin' south 
To get that Acapulco gold
Ain't nothin' it can't fix 
Old dogs can learn new tricks 
When the streets are lined with bricks
Of Acapulco gold
We 'bout decided against the whole thing
But then we thought that we ought to swing
Thinkin' that the southland held the keys
To cure these cotton-pickin' sniffles and sneeze
We're goin' south 
To get that Acapulco gold
Ain't nothin' it can't fix 
Old dogs can learn new tricks 
When the streets are lined with bricks
Of Acapulco gold
Zig zag polly wolly diddum woddum doo
Hey diddle diddle, twenty-three-skiddo
Me and Martha sure had fun
Acapulco gold for everyone
We're goin' south 
To get that Acapulco gold
Ain't nothin' it can't fix 
Old dogs can learn new tricks 
When the streets are lined with bricks
Of Acapulco gold
??? even a matchbox, five cents
