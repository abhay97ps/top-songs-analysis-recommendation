Are we better off believing
What the ignorance suggests?
I wish living life was easy 
But mine has been a mess
They say it comes with the seasons 
But the seasons come and go 
I go blurry when I'm thinking
Is it me or vertigo?
Criticized, who am I to give up?
I’m breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? 
Or are we dreaming? 
After the ride
Are you leaving? 
Yeah
I've been better off than broken
I’ve been battered, I've been beat
I wish I was more outspoken
But the words are out of reach
Hmm, thought I loved you in the moment
I was happy, I was young
I've been learning, I've been growing
But the worst is yet to come
Criticized, who am I to give up? 
I'm breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? 
Or are we dreaming? 
After the ride
Are you leaving? 
Yeah

Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I’ve been falling with my 
Eyes closed, eyes closed 
I've been falling with my 
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been, I've been, I’ve been
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my
Eyes closed, eyes closed

Eyes low, eyes low
