Party, party, party time
Every time you call
You're on the party line
Sexy things you say
When you're really
Bathed in sweat
On the party line
Got you on the party line, yeah
Baby, baby
Can't keep me on hold
Don't you make my
Blood run cold
Found out the hard way
I was surprised
Looks like it's gonna be
Another round of lies
Party, party, party time
Every time you call
You're on the party line
Sexy things you say
When you're really
Bathed in sweat
On the party line
Got you on the party line, yeah
I can see the smile
On your pretty face
The sun came out
There's light in every place
Light in every space
Party, party, party time
Every time you call
You're on the party line
Sexy things you say
When you're really
Bathed in sweat
On the party line
Got you on the party line, yeah
Got to see the smile
On your pretty face
The sun came out
There's light in every place
Light in every space
Baby, baby

Don't you make my
Blood run cold
