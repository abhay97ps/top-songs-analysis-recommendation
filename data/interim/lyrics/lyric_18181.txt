I was ten years old the day I got caught
With some dime store candy that I never bought
I hung my head and I faced the wall
As Daddy showed me wrong from right
He said this hurts me more than it does you
There's just some things son, that you just don't do
Is anything I'm sayin' getting through
Said Daddy I can see the light
Oh, lessons learned, man, they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh, there's no way around it, 'cause this world turns
Oh, lessons learned
Granddaddy was a man I loved
He bought me my first ball and glove
Even taught me how to drive his truck
Circling that ol' town square
He spoke of life with a slow southern drawl
I never heard him cause I knew it all
But I sure listened when I got the call
That he was no longer there
Oh, lessons learned, man, they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh, there's no way around it, 'cause this world turns
Oh, lessons learned
Oh, lessons learned, man, they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh, there's no way around it, 'cause this world turns
Oh, lessons learned
