Angel I love you, you know I love you, but what can I say
You're not really here anymore and I know it
It's getting late they're waiting outside you're gonna run away
One more time, it might be-e too la-a-ate
Angel say no
You're better on your own
Angel say no no no
Baby don't you know-ow
Don't try to tell me, baby don't tell me, I already know
You got that look in your eyes that shows me 
I can't take it, I just can't take it, when you start to go-o
Well any American boy would fe-el the same way-ay
Angel say no
You're better on your own
Angel say no no no
Baby don't you know-ow
Cause you know I'm right
It's another night
You're gonna take that ride
 No no no no!
Angel say no
You're better on your own
Angel say no no no
Baby don't you know, baby don't you know
Angel say no no no
Angel say no no no
Angel say no no no
Angel say no no no
Angel say no no no
Angel say no no no
Angel say no no no

They got a needle and a hound
