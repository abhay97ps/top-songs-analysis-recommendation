I just left Hollywood, California
Our countries have become sewers
Not only Hollywood
There's San Francisco and New York and other cities
But by and large Hollywood
That has filled the land and filled the world with filth
I woke up this mornin'
I couldn't get out of bed
Felt like this heavy band were playin' in my head
They were screamin' through the ceiling
Screamin' through the walls
Stealin' all my photographs and laughing at them all
Well, I phoned the man at work and this is what I said
I woke up this mornin' but I couldn't get out of bed
And I said
Oh-oh, oh-oh
"You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll"
I said
Oh-oh, oh-oh
"You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll"
The change of style felt out of place
Got myself a suntan and a facelift for my face
Down to the cathouse, cruisin' in L.A
Found myself a pretty girl with nothin' much to say
Her conversation's like she comes from outer space
Got legs and long hair but I couldn't see her face
And she said
Oh-oh, oh-oh
"You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll"
She said
Oh-oh, oh-oh
"You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll"
Kick it
This one called the rebel rocker sound
Right
I sing about guitars, I sing a rocker song
We take a little walk in the New York town
Everybody round, livin' can't be stopped
Them heavy metal sound almost makin' me frown, ay
 irie
, gonna make you 
Went to the west to check out the best
All them rocky girls with the silicon chests
I say to you, mon, don't let them take your music away
'Cause you might play what you wanna play
And you might say what you wanna say
'Cause I must say
Bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum
Bum-a-biddly, bum-a-biddly, bum-a-biddly, bum
Bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum
Bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum
It takes an hour backcombing my hair
Chilling out on heavy grass and picking clothes to wear
Look in the mirror, walk out on the street
Bump into a policeman I didn't expect to meet
He said to me, "Hey, are you some kind of red?
Well, it looks to me, son, like you just got out of bed"
And I said
Oh-oh, oh-oh
"You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll"
I said
Oh-oh, oh-oh
"You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll"
Bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum
Bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum
Bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum
Bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum-a-billy, bum
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
