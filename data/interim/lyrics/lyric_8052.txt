Hey girl,  what's your name? 
I, I like your style 
Can I stick around and rap to you a little while?
And hey girl, don't turn away 
Please listen to what I have to say
Don't tell me some other day
Please, won't you stay
Oh, all my life, I prayed for someone like you, oh yeah
Oh, the look, the look in your eye
Tells me you feel the same way, too
Oh yeah
Hey girl, 
Can't I be your friend or not?
Can I see you again?
No, don't walk away 
If in your heart, you really want to stay
Girl, what you feel is for real
And believe me, it's okay
