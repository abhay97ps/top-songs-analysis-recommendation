Look up on the wall
There on the floor
Under the pillow
Behind the door
There's a crack in the mirror
Somewhere there's a hole in a window-pane
Now do you think I'm to blame
Tell me do you think I'm to blame
 you're never there
 you stop and stare
 isn't anywhere
If you're wrappin'
Up the world
Cause you've taken
Someone else's girl
When they turn on the pillow
Even when they answer the telephone
Don't you think they'll find out
Tell me don't you think they'll find out
 you're never there
 you stop and stare
 isn't anywhere
 doesn't really care
You want it, you've got it, you've gotta go
You want it, you've got it, now you know
It's an illusion
It's a game
A reflection
Of someone else's name
When you wake in the morning
Wake and find you're covered in cellophane
Well there's a hole in there somewhere
Yeah there's a hole in there somewhere
Baby there's a hole in there somewhere
Now there's a hole in there somewhere
 you're never there
 you stop and stare
 isn't anywhere
