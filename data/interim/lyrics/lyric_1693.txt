Three hearts in a tangle
And one heart will have to break
Three hearts in a tangle
What will be the loser's fate?
One heart I'm tied to
And the other heart's gon' love him true
Either way I go I'll bring sorrow, yeah
And one heart will be broken in two
If I had chose either one of these hearts
Then the other heart I'll surely break
And if I should leave, then I will suffer, yeah
And whose heart will pay for my mistake?
OH
Three hearts in a tangle
And one heart will have to break
Three hearts in a tangle
What will be the loser's fate?
Now, as I sit by my window
I'm watching the people go dancing by
And OH, I'm trying to reach a decision, yeah
And I'm afraid I won't do what's right
OH, I keep on singing
Three hearts in a tangle
And one heart will have to break
Three hearts in a triangle
What will be the loser's fate?
Three hearts in a tangle
One heart will have to break
Three hearts in a tangle
What will be the loser's fate?
Three hearts in a tangle
One heart will have to break
Three hearts in a tangle
What will be the loser's fate?
