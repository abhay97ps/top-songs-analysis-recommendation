Making love at the same time that you touch yourself 
Baby, nothing will happen, go crazy 
Your boyfriend treats you bad, he doesn’t control you 
He said-
My lil' devi 
She gets pornographic in intimacy 
Her husband doesn’t value her and leaves her alone 
And I'm always waiting for him with my gun 
And with me now she always gets wet
Baby girl 
Your boyfriend loves you but you are unfaithful 
Because you're a devil inside of a woman 
And when the sun hides you want to drink, Daughter of Lucifer

And when the sun hides you want to drink, Daughter of Lucifer
Baby, with ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
Baby, I am your criminal
Baby, with ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
Baby, your boyfriend will for forget it
Baby, with ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
Baby, with me you will move
Baby, with ram-bam-bam-bam-bam
Baby, with a shot he will die 
Why, why, whu 
Why are you going to be faithful 
Why, why, why
Baby, forget about him 
You're my lil' devil and I'm your demon
A love of the asylum
And if I see you with him I hate you
She always has me in insomnia
Medusa, Versace 
We always do 69 like Tekashi 
I'll break to you the whole secret, Illuminati 
She hops out with me at the disco in the Ferrari 
Smoking Mari' 
And you got your body done, baby, in R.D
And we fuck and we always cum at the same time
And I made you the love and got wrapped up in your skin
And my dick on your pussy I tatted you
Oh-oh-oh 
Baby, you're mine, forget that ma-a-n
And bounce that ass dancing reggaeton on me-e-e

My lil' devil 
She gets pornographic, she's not timid 
And her man doesn't value her and leaves her alone 
And I’m always waiting for him with my gun 
And she always falls in love, my lil' devil
