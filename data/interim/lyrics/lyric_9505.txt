Fun is in, it's no sin, it's that time again
To shed your load, hit the road on the run again
Summer skies in our eyes and a warmer sun
It's one for all, all for one, all for all out fun
Got to go to it
Going to go through it
Got to get with it
Looking good
Down the hood Of a funky ride
On the way
To the tide
Just to tan your hide
In the shade
Lemonade
In the sun ocean spray
To get your face
In the race
Or lay back's no disgrace
It's OK to get out there and
Have some fun
By yourself maybe
Or else with a special one
Good or bad
Glad or sad
It's all going to pass
So it's OK
Let's all play
And enjoy it while it lasts
Find a ride
