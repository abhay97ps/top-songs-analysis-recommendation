Ooh-ooh-ooh
What you doing tonight?
I wish I could be
A fly on your wall
Are you really alone?
Who's stealing your dreams?
Why can't I breathe
You into my life? 
What would it take
To make you see that I'm alive?
If I was invisible 
Then I could just watch you in your room
If I was invisible
I'd make you mine tonight
If hearts were unbreakable
Then I could just tell you where I stand
I would be the smartest man
If I was invisible
Wait, I already am
Saw your face in the crowd
I call out your name
You don't hear a sound
I keep tracing your steps
Each move that you make
Wish I could be
What goes through your mind 
Wish you could touch me with the colors of your life
If I was invisible 
Then I could just watch you in your room
If I was invisible
I'd make you mine tonight
If hearts were unbreakable
Then I could just tell you where I stand 
I would be the smartest man
If I was invisible
Wait, I already am
 Invisible
I'd make you mine tonight
I reach out
But you don't even see me
Even when I scream out
Baby, you don't hear me 
I am nothing without you
Just a shadow passing through
Ooh-ooh-ooh
If I was invisible 
Then I could just watch you in your room
If I was invisible
I'd make you mine tonight 
If hearts were unbreakable 
Then I could just tell you where I stand 
I would be the smartest man
If I was invisible 
If I was invisible 
If I was invisible 
If I was invisible 
If I was invisible 
If I was invisible 
If I was invisible
