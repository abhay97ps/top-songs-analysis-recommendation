When I was young I left the home
And went away, to Vegas
With my guitar and my dreams
I had to try to play and sing, in Vegas
But my momma told me I was wrong
And she begged me to stay at home
But my will was strong and
I had to make it big, in Vegas
Chorus
They'll put my name up in lights where I play
And the lines out in front will be long
I'll get a standing ovation from the people
When I start to sing my song
When I turn 'em on in Vegas
Well I've played every
Honky tonk and smokey bar, in Vegas
And I guess I don't have
What it takes, for Las Vegas
But my dreams still linger on
Oh my faith is almost gone
But my will is strong and
I've gotta make it big, in Vegas
Chorus
They'll put my name up in lights where I play
And the lines out in front will be long
I'll get a standing ovation from the people
When I start to sing my song
When I turn 'em on in Vegas
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la, big in Vegas
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la, big in Vegas
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la, big in Vegas...
