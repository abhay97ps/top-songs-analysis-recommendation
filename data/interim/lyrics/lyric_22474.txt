Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone 
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want
You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
You heard that I was starting over with
Someone new
They told you I was moving on
Over you
You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You try to break me, but you see
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
 fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone
 stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
 makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone!
Thanks to you I've got a new thing started!
Thanks to you I'm not the broken-hearted!
Thanks to you I'm finally thinking about me!
You know in the end
The day you left was just my beginning
In the end
 stronger {Stronger!}
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a 
What doesn't kill you makes you 
Just me, myself and I {Yeah!}
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little 
Doesn't mean I'm lonely  when I'm alone 
Stronger, stronger 
Just me, my {What doesn't kill you} self and I 
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger 
Stand a little taller 
Doesn't mean I'm lonely {What doesn't kill you} when I'm alone 
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
