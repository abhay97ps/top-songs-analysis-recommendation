When your world's closing in
And there's no place to hide
And you're needing a friend
To be there, at your side
Send a message to me
I'll arrive and you'll see
Whether you're right or wrong
This is where you belong
Give it a try and you'll see
Move in a little closer, baby
You've got to keep me closer, baby
Come in a little closer, baby
Together, we can make it happen
Wait and see
When your troubles arrive
Pouring down from the sky
And you're feeling the down
You don't know what to do
Give a holler to me
I'm the one that you need
Reach for my helping hand
Then you will understand
How simplified it can be
Move in a little closer, baby
You've got to keep me closer, baby
Come in a little closer, baby
Together, we can make it happen
Wait and see
Move in a little closer, baby
You've got to keep me closer, baby
Come in a little closer, baby
Together, we can make it happen
Wait and see
Move in a little closer, baby
You've got to keep me closer, baby
Come in a little closer, baby ...
