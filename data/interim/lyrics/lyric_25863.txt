Cut my heart about one, two times
Don't need to question the reason I'm yours, I'm yours
I'd move the Earth and lose the fight just to see you smile
'Cause you got no flaws, no flaws
I'm not tryin' to be your part-time lover
Sign me up for that full-time, I'm yours, all yours
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta say?
What a man gotta pray?
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day"
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta do?
What a man gotta prove?
To be totally locked up by you
You ain't trying to be wasting time
On stupid people and cheap lines I'm sure, I'm sure
So I‘d give a million dollars just for you to grab me by the collar
And knock on these doors, these doors
I'm not tryin' to be your part-time lover
Sign me up for the full-time, I'm yours, I'm yours, woo!
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta say?
What a man gotta pray?
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day"
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta do?
What a man gotta prove?
To be totally locked up by you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Tell me what a man gotta do
So, what a man gotta do? 
What a man gotta do? 
To be totally locked up by you 
What a man gotta say? 
What a man gotta pray? 
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day" 
So, what a man gotta do? 
What a man gotta do? 
To be totally locked up by you 
What a man gotta do? 
What a man gotta prove?
