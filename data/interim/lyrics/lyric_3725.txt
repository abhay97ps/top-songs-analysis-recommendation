You're too slow
Woman, you're too slow
Ain't got much time
Tell me your mine
Woman you're too slow
Done messed up my mind
Tryin' to figure on love
From you all I found
You're waiting around
Woman, you're too slow
You're too slow
Woman you're too slow
Ain't got much time
Tell me you love me
Woman you're too slow
I got a woman
My woman she's too slow
Keeps me in pain
And it's a dog-gone shame
A woman can be too slow
Everybody's sayin'
Woman you're too slow
You're gone dead and buried
Before we get married
Woman, you're too slow
You're too slow!
You're too slow
You're too slow!
You're too slow
You're too slow!
You're too slow
