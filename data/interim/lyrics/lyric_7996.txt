We used to laugh and play
All  of the live long day
Open  fields and open skies
Where we'd love to stay
Gather around me, children
On  my merry go round
And  travel along with me
Like kids we used to be
Oh  where are the sunshine days
We used to know
Planting seeds of happiness
Letting everything grow
Gather  around me, children
On my merry go round
And travel along with me
Like kids we used to be
All of the fun and games we played
Dreams and plans we made
Oh where did they go
Gather around me, children
On my merry go round
And travel along with me
Like kids we used to be
Gather around me on my merry go round
Gather around me on my merry go round
Gather around me on my merry go round
Gather around me on my merry go round
Gather around me on my merry go round
Gather around me on my merry go round
