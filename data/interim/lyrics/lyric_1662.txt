Well, I've got two lovers
And I ain't ashamed
Two lovers
And I love them both the same
Let me tell you bout my first lover
He's sweet and kind
And he's mine, oh, mine
And treats me good like a lover should
And makes me love him
I really really love him
Oh, oh, I love him so
And I'll do everything I can to let him know
But, I've got two lovers
And I ain't ashamed
Two lovers
And I love them both the same
Let me tell you 'bout my other lover
Well, you know he treats me bad
Makes me sad
Makes me cry
But still I can't deny
But I love him
I really really love him
Oh, oh
I love him so
And I'll do everything I can to let him know
Darling, well
Don't you know I can tell
That whenever I look at you
That you think that I'm untrue
Cause I say that I love two
But, I really, really do
Cause you're a split personality
And in reality
Both of them are you
Well, I've got two lovers
