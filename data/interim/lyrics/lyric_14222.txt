Ooh...yeah....
You are my favorite lady
And you are my favorite man, yes, you are
I know that's right
But it feels good to know that you feel the same
And forever and a day
Together we will be
Nothing on this earth could
Ever take you away from me
'Cause I've been kissed but I...
And I've been missed but I...
You're something special
And you know you're something special too
I love you 
And that's all I need to hear to make my day
'Cause you're always on my mind
No matter what I do
Nothing on this earth could
Ever keep me away from you
I've been kissed but I...
Oh, and I've been missed but I...
 Never
Oh, I've been kissed
And I've been missed but I...
Loved someone before but I...
No, I never, never, never, never
When I'm asleep at night
When I'm asleep at night
I dream I hold you tight
Ooh, I hold you tight
I never had a better love
Oh, oh....
No, I never knew love 
I've been kissed, baby, yeah
And I've been missed, girl
Never knew love, loved someone before
I never knew love
I never knew love
I never knew love like this, baby
I've been kissed, baby
And I've surely been missed
Let's sing it together
I never knew love like this
I never knew love like this, girl
I never knew love like this
I never knew love like this
I never knew love like this
Cherrelle, let me tell you how I feel
I never knew, baby 
Tell me how you feel, baby
I never knew love like this, girl 
I've been around the world 
But I never knew love
Never knew love like this, girl
Nobody kissed me like you do
I never knew your love could be so good
Ooh wee, baby, yeah, yeah
I never knew your love, I never knew
I gotta, gotta have your love, girl
Make it good to you, baby, oh
Take you home late at night, woman, yeah
Ooh, yes, Alex
Oh, sugar, yeah, oh, baby
Got to have your love
In the morning time
