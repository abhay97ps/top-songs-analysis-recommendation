Pictures of you
Oh, they're still on my mind
You had the smile that could light up the world
Now it rains, it seems the sun never shines
And I drive down this lonely, lonely road
Ooh, I got this feeling
Girl, I got to let you go
'Cause now you've got to fly 
Fly to the angels
Heaven awaits your heart
And flowers bloom in your name
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
You've got to fly 
Fly to the angels
All the stars in the night
Shine in your name
You know it hurts me way deep inside
When I turn and look, and find that you're not there
I try to convince myself that the pain
The pain is still not gone
Still I drive down this lonely, lonely road
Ooh, I got this feeling
Girl, I got to let you go
But now you've got to fly 
Fly to the angels
Heaven awaits your heart
And flowers bloom in your name
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
You've got to fly 
Fly to the angels
All the stars in the night
Shine in your name
Fllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
Ooh, yeah
And still I drive down this lonely, lonely road
Ooh, I got this feeling
Oh, I can't let you go
But I know that you've got to fly 
Fly to the angels
Heaven awaits your heart
And flowers bloom in your name
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
You've got to fly 
Fly to the angels
All the stars in the sky
Shine in your name yeah oww
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
I'm going to miss you
I'll miss you, girl
