You better run, run, run
A-here we come
Revving our engines under the sun
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'
Woah, keeping it cool
Smooth and steady
Slicked back hair
Man, things are getting heavy
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'
Two wheels and an open road
Wrapped in leather
Ready to go
Don't stop, stop the music
We ride fast like a bullet
We do anything we want, anytime we want
Oh yeah, oh yeah
We just ride, ride, ride all day
We're not gonna live any other way
Bubblegum, cherry pop
Go to the hop
Hanging with my brother 'cause his friends are so hot
While they're cruisin' for some bruisin'
Alright
I went to the drive-in and what did I see?
A hundred little betties all staring at me!
I was cruisin' for some lovin'!
I got these two wheels and an open road
So, pop that clutch, I'm ready to go!
Don't stop, stop the music
We ride fast like a bullet
We do anything we want, anytime we want
Oh yeah, oh yeah
We just ride, ride, ride all day
We're not gonna live any other way
Oh no, we're not gonna live any other way
Oh, it goes 1, 2, 1, 2, 3
A-who, who, who's ridin' with me?
I've got a gang full of bruisers, all cruisin' with me
And we're tearin' up, we're tearin' up, we're tearin' up the streets
Oh
Don't stop, stop the music
We ride fast like a bullet
We do anything we want, anytime we want
Oh yeah, oh yeah
We just ride, ride, ride all day
We're not gonna live any other way
So don't stop, stop the music
We ride fast like a bullet
We do anything we want, anytime we want
Oh yeah, oh yeah
We just ride, ride, ride all day
We're not gonna live any other way
No, we're not gonna live any other way
Oh no, we're not gonna live any other way
Oh
