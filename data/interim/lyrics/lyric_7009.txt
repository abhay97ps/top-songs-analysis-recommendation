I was driving on a misty morning highway
Hoping this time things might go my way
Longing for those Ponderosa Pines
Alone with Northern California on my mind
Sometimes the road will bring you sorrow
Sometimes the road will let  you down
Sometimes the road doesn't go anywhere
But sometimes the road will bring you home
Another flight back home to Butte County
Third time this year, third body to bury
As each one falls it feels less and less like home
All we took for granted eventually goes
Sometimes the road will bring you sorrow
Sometimes the road will let  you down
Sometimes the road doesn't go anywhere
But sometimes the road will bring you home
She said all she needed with her eyes
Underneath that painted Tennessee sky
I held her close and promised her that night
If only for a moment, it all was right
Sometimes the road will bring you sorrow
Sometimes the road will let  you down
Sometimes the road doesn't go anywhere
But sometimes the road will bring you home
