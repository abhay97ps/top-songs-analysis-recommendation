You're always in my heart
From early in the morning till it's dark
I got to see your sweet, sweet smile every day
When I wake up in the morning and I see you there
I always whisper a little prayer
I got to see your sweet, sweet smile every day
I got to know that you love me
And that you want me
And that you'll always be there
I got to know that you care
And I got to feel your arms around me
And that you need me
And you'll always be there
I got to know that you care
If my times are bringing me down
You're the only one that I want around
I got to see your sweet, sweet smile every day
And if I'm all strung out
You're the only one who can straighten me out
I got to see your sweet, sweet smile every day
I got to know that you love me
And that you want me
And that you'll always be there
I got to know that you care
And I got to feel your arms around me
And that you need me
And you'll always be there
I got to know that you care
I got to know that you love me
And that you want me
And that you'll always be there
I got to know that you care
And I got to feel your arms around me
And that you need me
And you'll always be there
I got to know that you care
You're always in my heart
From early in the morning till it's dark
I got to see your sweet, sweet smile every day
I got to see your sweet, sweet smile every day
I got to see your sweet, sweet smile every day
