It was those good ol' days when you'll enjoy the sunrays hit across yo' face
It was those good ol' days when you In yo' Niggas would be running on the streets and be shooting innocent people who haven't done anything to humanity, Remembering when you would be writing some rhymes In yo' paper sheet with just a beat, Yet back In those days while you where doing that shit, Thugs would be Robbing stores n' they got "JAIL" As there receipt, Thugs killed people down until they suffocated enough and finally hit the mark when they bleed, All these Young Niggas enjoy those days when you would just sit back on a tree and some 90's book you would read
Remembering those ol' days?
Yeah you remember, When those days amazed you right before September?
In those days damn Thugs would put there legs on the table and grab a grain of cocaine and they would snort that shit up to their nostrils until It hit there brain, Yeah those people who lived In our Generation back In those days had alot to Say and yet those blind brainless people didn't know which way? President or Human rights? They wouldn't pick the light they would just pick the riots and never ending bloody fights, Missing those days when the cinema brought black and white movies, Good ol' days when they where just minimum Man Jamaica the place I'm from,Yeah In those movies you would enjoy the old fashion beauty, Well In the 1 hour mark some man got shot by a jit with a uzi, Mental people where just moody
Remember those days when life was just simple and plain?
The days that would never end, When those 90's movie criminals didn't surrender? And yet those old jury episodes, The criminals couldn't defend
All these people know that those ol' days where just about fashion, All these music genre's with some passion, It was those days when Hip-Hop got some compassion, And those people enjoying comedy and laughing, Remember those white n' Black screen models when they had attraction, Yet you never thought of those murderers slashing and making peoples skulls bashing, It was those time we formed a Michael Jackson,Kids enjoying those tv-shows with Someone doing Magic, Yet right at those happy moments People die tragic, None would enjoy criminals Robbing shit and jewels none couldn't forget their actions
The days you can't never forget It flicks on to your brain like some magic switching lever
Sad Funerals going on people In a casket, All of those people getting news quickly on their ol' tv with antlers on top of them, They where saying "WHAT HAPPENDED" Someone was dying they where passing and a Maniac was laughing, Those days you can't forget they plug In your brain like a inlet, Yet now those old days are gone now It's just kids just playing games with their headset
Never Forget
