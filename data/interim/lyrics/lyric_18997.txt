Uh, uh, some deep shit
Uh, uh
Look away
Uh, uh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mama please stop crying, I can't stand the sound
Your pain is painful and it's tearin' me down
I hear glasses breaking, as I sit up in my bed
I told God you didn't mean those nasty things you said
You fight about money, 'bout me and my brother
And this I come home to, this is my shelter
It ain't easy growing up in World War III
Never knowing what love could be, you'll see
I don't want love to destroy me like it has done my family
Can we work it out?  Can we be a family? 
I promise I'll be better 
Mommy, I'll do anything 
Can we work it out? Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better
Daddy, please don't leave
Daddy please stop yellin' 
I can't stand the sound 
Make mama stop cryin', 'cause I need you around
My mama, she loves you 
No matter what she says, it's true
I know that she hurts you, but remember, I love you, too
I ran away today
Ran from the noise, ran away 
Don't wanna go back to that place
But don't have no choice, no way
It ain't easy growin' up in World War III
Never knowing what love could be, well, I've seen
I don't want love to destroy me like it did my family
Can we work it out?  Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better, Mommy, I'll do anything
Can we work it out? Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better 
Daddy, please don't leave
In our family portrait 
We look pretty happy 
Let's play pretend, let's act like it comes naturally
I don't wanna have to split the holidays
I don't want two addresses
I don't want a step-brother anyways
And I don't want my mom to have to change her last name
In our family portrait, we look pretty happy
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
In our family portrait, we look pretty happy
Let's play pretend, act like it goes naturally
In our family portrait, we look pretty happy
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
In our family portrait. we look pretty happy
Let's play pretend act and like it comes so naturally
In our family portrait we look pretty happy
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
Daddy, don't leave
Daddy, don't leave
Daddy, don't leave
Turn around, please
Remember that the night you left?
You took my shining star
Daddy, don't leave
Daddy, don't leave
Daddy, don't leave
Don't leave us here alone
Mom will be nicer
I'll be so much better, I'll tell my brother
Oh, I won't spill the milk at dinner
I'll be so much better, I'll do everything right
I'll be your little girl forever
I'll go to sleep at night
