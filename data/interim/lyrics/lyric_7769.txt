You're my soul song
My everything that I do song
My pick-me-up-when-I'm-blue song
That's why I sing all the time
You're my soul song
And that's why I call you
My solid gold song
Nothing in the world can ever go wrong
As long as you are mine
Nowhere in the world
Have I seen anything like you
In all my time
You give me a feel good feeling
Through and through
And it's so fine
I'm up with the sun
Cause I don't wanna waste it
I love you so much I can almost taste it
I can't stand still
When I look up and see you coming
I start humming
You're my soul song
My keep-me-safe-from-my-home song
My shelter-from-the-storm song
That's why I sing all the time
You're my soul song
And that's why I call you
My solid gold song
Nothing in the world could ever go wrong
As long as you are mine
You're my soul song
My everything-that-I-do song
My pick-me-up-when-I'm-blue song
That's why I sing all the time
Soul song
And that's why I call you
My solid gold song
Nothing in the world could ever go wrong
As long as you are mine
