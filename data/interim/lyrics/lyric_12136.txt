Rosanna's daddy had a car she loved to drive
Stole the keys one night and took me for a ride
Turned up the music just as loud as it could go
Blew out the speakers in her daddy's radio
She was shakin' 
Snappin' her fingers 
She was movin' round and round 
That girl was shakin' 
We started drinkin' wasn't thinkin' too straight
She was doin' 80 and she slammed on the brakes
Got so high we had to pull to the side
Her tits were shakin' 'til the middle of the night
Shakin' 
Snappin' her fingers 
She was up and down and round and round
Shakin' 
Shakin'  
I got a little nervous
When she took her coat off
She looked so pretty
Ahh yeah
I'm always talkin' baby talkin' too much
I love that little girl and I just can't get enough
It takes a lonely night with nowhere to go
Just call Rosanna, it's a hell of a show
And she's shakin' 
Snappin' her fingers 
She'll be movin' round and round 
Oh she's shakin' 
Shakin' 
Snappin' her fingers 
She'll be movin' up and down 
Round and round and round 
And shakin' 
Sha sha sha sha sha she was shakin'
Sha sha sha sha sha she was shakin'
Sha sha sha sha sha she was shakin'
Sha sha sha sha sha she was shakin'
