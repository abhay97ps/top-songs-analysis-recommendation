There's rumors of war
Men dying and women crying
If you breathe air, you'll die
Perhaps you wonder the reason why
But wait! Don't you worry
A new day is dawning
We'll catch the sun, and away we'll fly
Are you ready to sit by his throne?
Are you ready not to be alone?
Someone's coming to take you home
And if you're ready, then he'll carry you home
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
People say that he won't come
And I don't know what say you
But if he should, would you be the one?
I've got a little question I'd like to ask you
Are you ready to sit by his throne?
Are you ready not to be alone?
Someone's coming to take you home
And if you're ready, then he'll carry you home
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Brothers and sisters, I have many 
Stumbling along to do their thing 
Love is a song, it's better than any
It's better for music, it's easy to sing 
Are you ready to sit by his throne?
Are you ready not to be alone?
Someone's coming to take you home
And if you're ready, then he'll carry you home
Are you ready to sit by his throne?
Are you ready not to be alone?
Someone's coming to take you home
And if you're ready, then he'll carry you home
Are you ready? 
Are you ready? 
I've got to know, yeah 
You sound real good 
Are you ready? 
Gonna be sunshine again 
And the flowers growing 
Children playing 
Gonna be all right 
You've got to be ready 
I know you're ready 
Say it loud one more time 
Oh, yeah 
Oh, yeah 
Say that out loud 
Sing it out loud 
Sounds so good to me! 
Alright 
Gonna be alright 
Gonna be alright 
Alright 
Come on, y'all 
Make me feel so good 
Make me feel so good 
No more dyin'
