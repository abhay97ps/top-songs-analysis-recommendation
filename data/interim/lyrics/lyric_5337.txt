I've been trying
To make you love me
But everything I try
Just takes you further from me
You don't love me no no
So you treat me cruel 
But no matter how you hurt me
I'll always be a fool
If you don't want me 
If you don't need me 
And if you don't love me 
I've got to make you love me
Just got to make you want me
I've got to stop it
There should be a law 
And no maatter how
You put me down
I love you more
I feel so helpless 
And it ain't funny 
'Cause deep down inside I know
You're never gonna love me
If you don't want me 
If you don't need me 
If you can not love me 
I've got to make you love me
I've got to make you want me
Baby, can't you see
Yeah, yeah, uh huh
