Yeah!
Pathetic 
Accept it 
Your opinion 
Happy 
Servant 
Malice 
No toleration – invade 
Enraged 
Don't condescend 
Desire 
Disappoint 
You suffered then 
Obsession – take another look
Remember – every chance you took
Decide – either live with me
Or give up – any thought you had of being free
 I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you…
 the only thing I ever really loved was hate…
Anyone  anything  anyway 
Anybody  anybody 
I want  I need  I'll have 
I won't 
Obey  believe  just trust  worship  live for 
Be grateful  be honest  be precious  be mine 
Possession – feed my only vice
Confession – I won't tell you twice
Decide – either die for me
Or give up – any thought you had of being free
 I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you…
 the only thing I ever really loved was hurting you…
 I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you…
 the only thing I ever really loved was hate…
Yeah!
Yeah!
Stay inside the hole – let me take control
Dominate
You are nothing more – you are something less
Innocent
Something has to give – something has to break
Omnipresent
Fingers on your skin – let my savage in
You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it
 I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you… 
 the only thing I ever really loved was hurting you… 
 I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you… 
 the only thing I ever really loved was hate…
You're mine 
You're mine 
You're mine 
You're mine
