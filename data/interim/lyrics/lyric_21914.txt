I'm in love, alright
With my crazy, beautiful life
With the parties, the disasters
With my friends, all pretty and plastered
Every night, we're down to go out
Wakin' up on a different couch
'Til the next night, on the next flight
Yeah, I guess we're doin' alright
We're fallin' in love
'Til the sun's comin' up
Just livin' the life
Every single night, we fight
To get a little high on life
To get a little somethin' right, somethin' real
At least we try
Time after time
Try dodgin' all the douchebag guys
Try tradin' all the wasted times for somethin' real
In this crazy life
I just hope some people see
There's nothin' that I'm tryna be
Lemme just stop all the ​shit​-talk
I know I'm the new bitch on the block
I've been through my sketchy phases
Been broke, been a shitty waitress
But I'm not now, guess it worked out
Got here by runnin' my mouth
We're fallin' in love
'Til the sun's comin' up
Just livin' the life
Every single night, we fight
To get a little high on life
To get a little somethin' right, somethin' real
At least we try
Time after time
Try dodgin' all the douchebag guys
Try tradin' all the wasted times for somethin' real
In this crazy life
Every single night, we—
Every single night, we fight
To get a little high on life
To get a little somethin' right, somethin' real
At least we try
Time after time
Try dodgin' all the douchebag guys
Try tradin' all the wasted times for somethin' real
In this crazy life
