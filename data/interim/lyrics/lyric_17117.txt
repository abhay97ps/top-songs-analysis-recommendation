I got no hidden agenda here inside
Couldn't stop these emotions if I tried
You're all I wanna do
I got something here waiting just for you
Deep in my heart
That's where you shine
Give you my best all of the time
For no other reason, no other rhyme, baby
Just because I love you
Just because I love you
Like the moon and stars
It's a natural fact
Just because I love you
Just because I love you
Don't need to second guess
It's as simple as that
Just because I love you
I really do
Alone
Some things I do with only you alone
You drive me to a place I've never known
It intensifies
Every second you're not here to satisfy
All of my wants, all of my needs
Comes with your touch
So good for me
That's why I'm here and always will be
Just because I love you
Just because I love you
Like the moon and stars
It's a natural fact
Just because I love you
Just because I love you
Don't need to second guess
It's as simple as that
You make it easy
Just by being here
You free me, baby
You must be doing something right
All of my feelings
They just keep on getting deeper, baby
There's no end in sight
Deep in my heart, that's where you shine
Give you my best, all of the time
For no other reason, no other rhyme
Just because I love you
Like the moon and stars
It's a natural fact
Just because I love you
Just because I love you
Don't need to second guess
It's as simple as that
Just because I love you
Just because I love you
Like the moon and stars
It's a natural fact
Just because I love you
Just because I love you
Don't need to second guess
It's as simple as that
