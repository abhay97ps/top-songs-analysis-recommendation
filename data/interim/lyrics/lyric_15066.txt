You know I really wanna see you when you know I might not
I say I really love you and you say that you don't
The blues before and after
I get the blues before and after I'm with you
The blues before and after
I get the blues before and after loving you
Sometimes I need to hear you voice
Sometimes I don't want to know
You're takin' just what you need
And then you're well on your way
It's a shame that you won't see me when I need you tonight
Cause I know that if you did then everything would be right
And I've tried my very best to give the things that you need
But the blues they seem to follow me I never succeed
I wanna take you in my arms and you just don't wanna know
Just as always you have gotten your way
Just a normal complication in a typical day
