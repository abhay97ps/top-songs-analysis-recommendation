I would sail around the world
Look for gold and dive for pearl
But I know I will never get to go
I would like to win a prize, be in everybody's eyes
But it's true, I would probably not get to
My life has always been simple
No one ever knows when I come and go
And my dreams are ending at sunrise
And dreaming just don't make it so
So I've lived without regrets
Wouldn't change a thing and yet
Now and then, wish that I could start again
My life has always been simple
No one ever knows when I come and go
And my dreams are ending at sunrise
And dreaming just don't make it so
I would sail around the world
Look for gold and dive for pearl
But I know I will never get to go
But it's true, I would probably not get to
But I know I will never get to go
