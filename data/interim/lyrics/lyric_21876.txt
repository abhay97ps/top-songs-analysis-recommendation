I really want you to notice
I really wish you could see
I wrote this song all about you
And what you do to me
You really make me sick
Feel like I'm gonna puke
You really make me sick
I'm sick cause of you
I tried to write you a letter
I tried to write two or three
Been trying to tell you forever
Please listen to me
You really make me sick
Feel like I'm gonna puke
You really make me sick
I'm sick cause of you
Don't think I'm gonna make it
If there's a cure I'll take it
There nothing I can do
I'm sick in love with you
You really make me sick
Feel like I'm gonna puke
You really make me sick
I'm sick over you
I'm sick in love with you
