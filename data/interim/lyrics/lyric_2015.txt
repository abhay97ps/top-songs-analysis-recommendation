Sometimes you gotta love a little
Sometimes you gotta lie a little
Sometimes you gotta laugh a little
Sometimes you gotta cry a little
When I was very young, my mother said to me
This world that we live in is so funny
One day, victory, one day, defeat
You gotta be a man to take the bitter with the sweet
'Cause sometimes
Sometimes you gotta love a little
Sometimes you gotta lie a little
Sometimes you gotta laugh a little
Sometimes you gotta cry a little
The further down the road as I grew up
I met a little girl and I fell in love
I thought I had her love all to myself
Until I found there was someone else
Said, I know
Sometimes you gotta love a little
Sometimes you gotta lie a little
Sometimes you gotta laugh a little
Sometimes you gotta cry a little
Now, it's all over, I forgot that girl
I think that I'm ready to face the world
One day, victory, one day, defeat
Now I can take the bitter with the sweet
'Cause sometimes
Sometimes you gotta love a little
Sometimes you gotta lie a little
Sometimes you gotta laugh a little
Sometimes you gotta cry a little
