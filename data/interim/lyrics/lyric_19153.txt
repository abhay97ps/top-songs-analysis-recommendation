Uh
Hey, Dirty 
Look at that girl right thurr , she make me say
Ooh, ooh , ooh, ooh 
Do what you do 
I like the way you do that right thurr 
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr 
I like the way you do that right thurr 
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr 
I like the way you look in them pants, see ya fine 
Your momma a quarter piece, she far from a dime 
The type of girl that'll get'cha up and go make you grind 
I'm thinkin' about snatchin' her up, Dirty, makin' her mine
Look at her hips , look at her legs, ain't she stacked? 
I sure wouldn't mind hittin' that from the back 
I like it when I touch it 'cause she moan a lil' bit
Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a lil' bit
I know you grown a little bit, twenty years old, you legal
Don't trip off my people, just hop in the Regal
I swooped on her like an eagle swoop down on its prey
I know you popular, but you gonna be famous today, I say
I like the way you do that right thurr 
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr 
I like the way you do that right thurr 
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr 
I like the way you do that right thurr 
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr 
I like the way you do that right thurr 
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr 
She be shoppin' in Frontenac
Just look at her front and back
Man, she so stacked and she know that I want that
Her man, he's so wack, girl, can I taste yo cat?
Gave her three hundred to strip, like buyin' a throwback
She stay in the club, like to be seen, she got it honest
In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas
She be at events , cuss out the press when she pass 
All the high rollin' cats wanna pay for that ass
Ain't no half steppin', she strapped with a nice weapon
Trick, it's against the law for her to move them hips
If you ever seen her dirty, your mouth gon' drop
Worldwide fools probably tell you this off tops
I like the way you do that right thurr 
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr 
I like the way you do that right thurr 
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr 
I like the way you do that right thurr 
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr 
I like the way you do that right thurr 
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr 
I like the way she doin' that 
Plus I like it when she bring it back 
Ooh,  ooh, ooh, ooh,  do what you do 
I like the way she doin' that 
Plus I like it when she bring it back 
Ooh,  ooh, ooh, ooh,  do what you do 
Gimme what you got for a pork chop
Uh, he threw it at me like I was a shortstop
Huh, workin' in a Fatty Girl Hugga Top
Then she back it up on me and let it drop 
Make it hop, boing, like a bunny 
Girl, can I touch you where it's sunny?
Or a purse and make you give her some money
She should pose for Sports Illustrated
It's like a picture-perfect site
When she pass, all the other girls hate it
But I like the way you do that right thurr 
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr 
I like the way you do that right thurr 
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr 
I like the way you do that right thurr 
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr 
I like the way you do that right thurr 
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr 
I like that 
I like that 
I like that 
I like that 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, do what you do
I like that

I like that 
I like that 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, do what you do
