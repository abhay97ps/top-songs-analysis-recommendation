Somedays won't end ever and somedays pass on by
I'll be working here forever, at least until I die
Dammed if you do, dammed if you don't
I'm supposed to get a raise next week, you know damn well I won't
Workin' for a livin' 
Workin' for a livin' 
Workin' for a livin', livin' and a-workin'
I'm taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a livin'
Hey, I'm not complaining 'cause I really need the work
But hitting up my buddy's got me feeling like a jerk
Hundred dollar car note, two hundred rent
I get a check on Friday, but it's already spent
Workin' for a livin' 
Workin' for a livin' 
Workin' for a livin', livin' and a-workin'
I'm taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a livin'
Whoa, workin' for a livin'
Whoa, taking what they giving
Whoa, workin' for a livin'
Whoa, whoa
Bus boy, bartender, ladies of the night
Grease monkey, ex-junky, winner of the fight
Walking on the streets, its really all the same
Selling souls, rock n' roll, any other day
Workin' for a livin' 
Workin' for a livin' 
Workin' for a livin', livin' and a-workin'
I'm taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a livin'
Workin' for a livin', livin' and a-workin'
I'm taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a livin'
Workin' for a livin', livin' and a-workin'
