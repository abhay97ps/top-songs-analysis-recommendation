Flippin' the script, page one
We got the real McCoy's in the house, the big kids
Callin' all the shots
So here's the resume for the day, check it
Uh-huh, it's time to turn the page
So check it out y'all, check it, check it out 
Check it out y'all, check it, check it out 
Check it out y'all, check it, check it out 
Check it out y'all, check it, check it out 
Well here's some real-type shit, Grand Puba with the singer
Give thumbs up cause I'm glad I could bring her
Honey, clear your throat 
Yeah, the shit sound dope
Well, here goes the skit, it's the kick a rhyme
Sing to the beat shit that you wanna get with
Brothers try to copy but they just can't get it down right
This is how we move it tonight
So honey is you ready? 
So, kick the flavor, get the loot, and let's be jetty
Oh, oh , oh 
Oh , oh, oh 
Well I'll be damned if I do, damned if I don't
It's time to kick the flavor on the reel you think I won't?
And you know I come to kick the flavor, too
Well that's true, now how we do?
I gets busy, ayo, hon', me too
And that's nothin', 'cause that's the way we do
So get ready 
Because you know the deal and what's the real thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So let's get down, get down with honey from Uptown
When I'm done with this I'll be around like James Brown
Ain't no thing, honey just sing
You know I , and you
Yeah, you got it goin' on 
You got it goin' on 
You got it goin' on 
You got it goin' on
So check it out, y'all, check it, check it out 
Check it out, y'all, check it, check it out 
Check it out, y'all, check it, check it out 
Check it out, y'all, check it, check it out 
Uh, you know, you know I know 
Puba know how to flow
So bear witness to the Grand Puba sickness
Better get your medication cause it spreads on the quickness
Take notes of what's goin' on
Ayo, Grand Puba and Mary won't steer you wrong
Huh, it's just that shit let's get it on
And on and on, and on and on
Ayo, some try to flow but they just can't do it
But you know how that go ain't nothin' to it
But to do it, run right through it
Those who know the time, huh, already knew it
I drink a Snapple and I wet my Adam's apple
And head straight for the center, the dope style inventor
Quick to make a buck, 'cause it's not beginner's luck
Type of shit that hits when you pump it in your truck
Not Ashford and Simpson, Ike or Tina Turner
Sonny or Cher, it's somethin' dope on your ear
So whether Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, it don't make a matter
This is the type of shit to make the pockets fatter
It's simply splendid, the way that we bend it
But it's time for me to jet, so I'ma let Mary end it
You know, you know I know
Puba knows how to flow 
You know, you know I know 
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh 
Yeah, yeah
Ah-ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh baby, yeah
Ooh baby, yeah
Ooh baby, yeah
Ooh baby, yeah
Ooh baby, yeah
Ooh baby, yeah
