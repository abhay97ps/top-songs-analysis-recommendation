Burning embers, I still remember
All of those little things
But I don't feel it so much
'cause I am so out of touch
With my heart and it won't sing
Rusty rainbows
That's how the pain goes
Turning me inside out
Well, I come home at night
And you are out of my sight
Yes, I'm dying and there ain't no doubt
Well, I'm dying and there's no way out
Well, I try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
When I walk in the rain you won't know that I'm crying
A smile on my face and I'm trying
I'm trying to understand
That a love that is lost can never be found again
And you see me dance, I look like a happy man
Just when I think I'm getting it over
An old friend I should see
He said he knew you well
And baby I could tell
You know, he knew you even more then me
I went home laughing
And inside I'm crying
We had a special thing
You know I loved you so much
But girl I'm so out of touch
With my heart and it won't sing
You know my heart just won't sing
Still I try, try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
Well, I try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
Well, I try, try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
Well, I try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
Well, I try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
