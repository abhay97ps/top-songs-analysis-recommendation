I've never seen a boy who
Looks as good as you tonight
I'm feeling kind of fresh
You know, I'm looking out of sight
I know a little place
That we can run away and hide
And the only way to go
Is on a magic carpet ride
Come on and take a ride with me
I'll show you just how fun
My love can be
Put your heart into my hands
I'll take you to a wonderland
On my magic carpet
Flying so high
With my love to guide you
On my magic carpet
Nothing but sky and stars
All around you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I got a magic carpet
Wanna take you for a ride
You're getting kinda nervous
I can see it in your eyes
Your heart is beating faster
And your throat is getting dry
But once you've tried it, baby
It's the only way to fly
Come on and take a ride with me
I'll show you just how fun
My love can be
Put your heart into my hands
I'll take you to a wonderland
On my magic carpet
Flying so high
With my love to guide you
On my magic carpet
Nothing but sky and stars
All around you
On my magic carpet
Flying so high
With my love to guide you
On my magic carpet
Nothing but sky and stars
All around you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come and take a ride
Come and take a ride
Come and take a ride with me
Come on and take a ride with me
I'll show you just how fun
My love can be
Put your heart into my hands
I'll take you to a wonderland
On my magic carpet
Flying so high
With my love to guide you
On my magic carpet
Nothing but sky and stars
All around you
On my magic carpet
Flying so high
With my love to guide you
On my magic carpet
Nothing but sky and stars
All around you
