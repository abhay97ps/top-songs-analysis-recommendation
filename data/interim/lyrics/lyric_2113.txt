(Wishing well, Mr. wishing well
Wishing well, wishing well)
I was standing by the
Wishing well 
Feeling all alone and blue
I dropped a penny in the
Wishing well 
Wishing for a dream come true
Then down, down went the penny
Right next to all the many others
That lovers had thrown
Won't you help me
Mr. wishing well ?
Is it too much that I ask
Just a penny's worth of
Happiness ?
Is that far too great a task?
Please, send me a
Bundle full of paradise
Make her wonderful and very nice
I'm depending on you
To make my wish come true
Then I looked up from the
Wishing well 
And was I surprised to see
Someone standing by the
Wishing well 
Looking just as sad as me
Then our eyes met
What a feeling; I found her
Now I really wanna
Thank you, thank you
Mr. wishing well
Thank you, Mr. wishing well
Thank you, Mr. wishing well
