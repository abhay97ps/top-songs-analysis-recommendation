If you want it
You can get it
With your love
If you want it
You can get it
With your love
I had a feeling that I met you
Some place before
I had a feeling that I wanted you
Deep inside my soul 
When I saw your face just smiling back at me
I knew no other could ever take your place
If I want you to be part of my life
I gotta just wait, as long as it takes
If you want it 
You can get it
With your love 
If you want it 
You can get it 
With your love 
If you want it
You can get it 
With your love 
If you want it 
You can get it 
With your love
No matter how much time it takes you
To feel my love
I got a feeling that you'll want me too
Beside your soul, whoa
When you feel this way, if you think it's just a game
Don't be affected by the things that people say
Just try to believe the magic of fate
You gotta just wait, as long as it takes
If you want it
You can get it 
With your love 
If you want it 
You can get it 
With your love 
If you want it 
You can get it 
With your love 
If you want it 
You can get it 
With your love 
If you want it 
You can get it 
With your love 
If you want it 
You can get it 
With your love
If you want it 
You can get it 
With your love 
If you want it 
You can get it 
With your love
If you want it you can get it
