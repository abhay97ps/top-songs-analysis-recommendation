She's my fantasy
An image burnin' in my mind
Callin' out to me

No way she's gonna get away
This time everything is easy

Give or take a few

What do I have to do

Oh - there's somethin' I want you to know
Yeah, this time everything is all right
No way she's gonna get away
This time everything is easy
Any day - I'm gonna make her mine
Yeah, I'm gonna make her mine

And I've waited a long time
But the feelin's right and darlin' one of these nights
Yeah - I'm gonna let you know
Oh, this time everything is all right
No way she's gonna get away
This time everything is easy
Any day - I'm gonna make her mine
This time everything is all right
No way she's gonna get away
This time everything is easy
Any day - I'm gonna make her mine
Yeah, I'm gonna make her mine
Oh yeah, this time
