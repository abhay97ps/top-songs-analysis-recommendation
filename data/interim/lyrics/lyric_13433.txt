Ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh
Are you ready for the time of your life
It's time to stand up and fight
 It's alright 
Hand in hand we'll take a caravan
To the motherland
One by one we're gonna stand with the pride
One that can't be denied
From the highest mountain, and valley low
We'll join together with hearts of gold
Now the children of the world can see
There's a better way for us to be
The place where mankind was born is so neglected and torn
Torn apart
Every woman, every man
Join the caravan of love
Everybody take a stand
Join the caravan of love
I'm your brother
I'm your brother, don't you know
I'm your brother
I'm your brother, don't you know
We'll be living in a world of peace
In a day when everyone is free
We'll bring the young and the old
Won't you let your love flow from your heart
Every woman, every man
Join the caravan of love
Everybody take a stand
Join the caravan of love
I'm your brother
I'm your brother, don't you know
I'm your brother
I'm your brother, don't you know
Now the children of the world can see
There's a better way for us to be
The place where mankind was born
Is so neglected and torn
Torn apart
Every woman, every man
Join the caravan of love
Everybody take a stand
Join the caravan of love
Are you ready for the time of your life?
Are you ready for the time of your life?
Come go with me
Come go with me
Every woman, every man
Join the caravan of love
Everybody take a stand
Join the caravan of love
Every woman, every man
Join the caravan of love
Everybody take a stand
Join the caravan of love
