A car's got gasoline to run, down the road
A crop's got rain, dirt and sun, to make 'em grow
A song's got rhyme
A clock's got time
You got me and
Baby I got you
Yeah you're it
The missing piece that makes me fit
I got you, the breath I breathe
And there ain't nothing else I need
Baby I got you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I don't need a big ol' house, full of stuff
What my arms are wrapped around, that's enough
Your morning smile, your kiss goodnight
And everything's alright
'Cause I got you
Yeah you're it
The missing piece that makes me fit
I got you, the breath I breathe
And there ain't nothing else I need
Baby I got you
When the right goes wrong
When I'm scared to death and got nothing left to lean on
I got you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah I do
Baby I got you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah you got me too
I got you
Yeah you're it
The missing piece that makes me fit
I got you, the breath I breathe
And there ain't nothing else I need
Baby I got you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah baby
I got you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Baby I got you
Baby I got you
