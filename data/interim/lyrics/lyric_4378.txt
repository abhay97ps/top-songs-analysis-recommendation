You can’t believe it’s not butter but it’s better than the Bible
Thorn berry shit, I maps out the jungle like Nigel
Smashing, WZA keep the love everlasting
Spell casting, shell smashing
Y’all crab, niggas, scuttling around, wanna double down on y’all fuck shit like y’all trouble now
Tough boy never not tough no more
So if you can’t feel this then you niggas touch no more
So fuck em all if they can’t hang
It be the same old song, but these bitch niggas can’t sang
This shit is getting me tight
I be talking to god, so everything should be iight right?
I beat that ass quick, and left the buns raw
Thought you was stone cold; so what you stunned for
Shut the fuck up because your girl gets hit
For a quick spliff and some rib tips
This is the Wiz bitch
I know that common used to love her but I taught y’all how to touch her
I know sex sells, but I ain’t the customer
25 racks guarantees that I fuck ya
But here’s a discount, I heard you like your niggas gutta, Butta
Madwiz are and the club are in this bitch like, Sergio Mendez and Brazil 66
When I’m on Myrtle Ave then I might just catch you
In ya Benz coupe ordering the House Special, yes
I stick my foot into the crevice of the good lord
Manifesting bitches in my DM cause I’m bored
And you can’t get no clout
I’ll put a rubber on a shovel cause I’m diggin you out, yo
But honestly I gotta got you when I have time
These motherfuckin niggas blowin’ up my other line
Y’all know BRANDON get drunk and think he Scarface
He up at def Jam now tryna catch a case
Madwizard is an evildoer
The type of nigga that'll take ya bitch home just to read to her
And she love to hear those stories cuz I make it last
Gat concealed like a 40 in a paper bag
& by the morning if you still on my knob
Fuck around and I strike back like Jay and Silent Bob
I grabs on the Nina, and heat niggas up like crabs in the steamer
Bang bang boogie, up jump
Babygirl what kinda pumps you want
Let's go blunt for blunt, den humpty hump
You can't be mad because your girl gave neck
To me pat Sajak, and Alex trebek, 7
Bossa nova, I’m never crossing over
So y’all lucky like niggas with four four leaf clovers
That’s Pete Maravich on the Celtics, you dummy
Or Scalabrine, shining from the three to make you gal see me
Niggas said I sound like Nas too much
Now I don't take out my fronts before I light up the blunt, punk
Facts Nigga, I smack you wack niggas
And if you take my bitch I bet she bring yo mama back with her
