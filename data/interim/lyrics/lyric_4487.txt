Somebody broke your heart once before, yeah
Now you claim you don't want love no more
Listen, girl, hear what I say
How long do you think you can go on this way?
You know you can't stand alone no matter how you try
Got to have somebody to love, goes for you & I
All of a sudden you can't stand alone
Love brought you heartaches sometime, so wrong, yeah
Don't let it turn your heart into stone
I love you, baby; this you can recognize, yeah
I see a spark of love deep in your eyes
You know you can't stand alone no matter how you try
Got to have somebody to love, goes for you & I
All of a sudden you can't stand alone
Love brought you misery; that may be true
But that is something that we all go through
Oh come put your hand in mine & don't look back
Let's fall in love, baby; that's where it's at
You know you can't stand alone no matter how you try
Got to have somebody to love, goes for you & I
You know you can't stand alone no matter how you try
Got to have somebody to love, goes for you & I
