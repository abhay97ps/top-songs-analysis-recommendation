Here we are, of what is left
Of a husband and a wife
With four good kids who have a way
Of gettin' on with their lives
And I'm not old, but I'm getting
A whole lot older every day
It's too late to keep from going crazy
I've got to get away
The reasons that I can't stay
Don't have a thing to do with bein' in love
I understand that loving a man
Shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one who feels
Like this world's left you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time
Our boys are strong now
The spitting image of you when you were young
I hope someday they can see past
What you have become
I remember every time I said I'd never leave
But what I can't live with is memories
Of the way you used to be
The reasons that I can't stay
Don't have a thing to do with bein' in love
I understand that loving a man
Shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one who feels
Like this world's left you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time
Twenty years, have came and went
Since I walked out of your door
I never quite made it back
To the one I was before
And God it hurts me to think of you
For the light in your eyes was gone
Sometimes I don't know why
This old world can't leave well enough alone
The reasons that I can't stay
Don't have a thing to do with bein' in love
I understand that loving a man
Shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one who feels
Like this world's left you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time
