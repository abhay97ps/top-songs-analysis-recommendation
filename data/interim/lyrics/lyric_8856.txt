Come on everybody
It's gibbon time
We're the Goodies
How do you do?
We've just been down to the zoo
We saw a monkey in a cage
Doing a dance
That could be the rage
It's not hard
So let's all do the funky gibbon
Ooo, ooo, ooo
Do, do, do the funky gibbon
We are here to show you how
Ooo, ooo, ooo
Ooo, ooo, ooo, the funky gibbon
He's just like you
So come on and do
The funky gibbon now
Dogs are always howlin'
Cats are always yowlin'
But gibbons only
Like to sing and dance
Oop, oop, sh boop
You'll be like that monkey
Get a little funky
And in a while
Start to smile
Gibbon half a chance
Do, do, do the funky gibbon
We are here to show you how
Ooo, ooo, ooo
Ooo, ooo, ooo, the funky gibbon
He's just like you
So come on and do
The funky gibbon now
Ooo, ooo, the funky gibbon
Ooo, ooo, ooo the funky gibbon
Gee, the world would be good
I?
Me, with just a little gibbon tea
Sha, la, la
We slap that gibbon
Oh, feel the rhythm
And you'll groove
And dance up to the planet of apes
Do, do, do the funky gibbon
We are here to show you how
Ooo, ooo, ooo
Ooo, ooo, ooo, the funky gibbon
He's just like you
So come on and do
The funky gibbon now
Ooo, ooo, the funky gibbon
Ooo, ooo, ooo the funky gibbon
Ooo, ooo, the funky gibbon
Ooo, ooo, ooo the funky gibbon
Now everybody get ready
To do the funky gibbon
Drop one arms down by your knees
And the other arm
Reach up to the trees
Let your wrist go limp
Like a bent baboon
Get ready to sing
This gibbon's tune
Will you give me an ooo
Will you give me another ooo
And will you give me an ooo
Now put 'em together
What've you got
Do, do, do the funky gibbon
We are here to show you how
Ooo, ooo, ooo
Ooo, ooo, ooo, the funky gibbon
He's just like you
So come on and do
The funky gibbon now
Ooo, ooo, the funky gibbon
Ooo, ooo, ooo the funky gibbon
Ooo, ooo, the funky gibbon
Ooo, ooo, ooo the funky gibbon
He promised to buy me
A bunch of blue gibbons
To tie up my bonny brown
Ooo, ooo, the funky gibbon
The funky gibbon
