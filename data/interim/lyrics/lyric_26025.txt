Ooh, ooh, no, no
NLE the Top Shotta
Uh, posted , in front of the trap 
Selling dope 'til the sun come down 
Take a fuck nigga right off the map 
When I hit him with this whole hundred rounds 
Yung Joc, in the club with my Glock 
You want to play, and then this bitch going down 
We ain't hesitatin', bullets get to blazin' 
I'ma lay him down like he in the lounge
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk down on 'em in Balenciaga runners
My blood slime a nigga out just like an anaconda
You go against me, then you fucked just like a used condom 
I roll 'em up and then I smoke 'em like some good ganja, ayy 
Still doing drive-bys, but I wanna walk 'em 
If I can't find 'em, you know I'm gonna stalk 'em 
Caution tape up on the scene, I had to white chalk 'em 
Running from my gun, but my bullets had to hawk 'em

Nigga, I was posted on the corner where the J's at
Roll up in the four by four, pull up at the corner store
And I got red in my drink when I pour up soda
I remember prayin' that the feds never take the Motorola
Choppa got the chopper, make 'em do a backflip
Pay my dawg a dime to walk him down, he need the racks, bitch
I been drinkin', I been taking all this codeine to the face
Got a lot of M's in the safe
Caught a murder, then I beat the case
I was just about to do the race

Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
