I'll hold you down
I'm on my way
DJ Khaled!
All you've been thinking 'bout
Do anything you want and let emotion rule your mind
Rule your mind 
And now you say you're dreaming of doing it anywhere
Oh yeah, just tell me where it's on your mind
On your mind 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sit in my whip and see the stars 
Show me just who you are 
You know who really hold you down 
And when you not around 
I'll hold you down
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
I'm the one gon' hold you down
I'm on my way
I'm the one that be rolling up
In that Bentley truck 'cause I'm rolling up
Want you like right now 
You the one got all I need
Give me all of you or all of me 'cause
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
I had some problems back home 
I ain't with that bullshit at all 
Maybe it's that Virginia in me 
Have a young nigga go so hard 
Oh, but through it all you stuck with me
Through it all you never ducked off like them cowards
When it hit me, get me?
Girl, I swear to God you the real one and you know it
And I don't hurt anyone of y'all for the real one and you know it
And I hold it down
Started from the bed, ended up on the floor
And I lift that ass up off the ground
I'ma put you on my shoulders, let me give you what's in store
Girl, you deserve it, all the time you been serving
Away from the realest nigga in here, I'ma take you away
And I'll hold you down, I'ma hold you down
I'ma hold you down, baby
I'll hold you down
I'm the one gon' hold you down
I'm the one gon' hold you down
I'm on my way
I'm the one that be rolling up
In that Bentley truck 'cause I'm rolling up
Want you like right now 
You the one got all I need
Give me all of you or all of me 'cause
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
Put you in that Ghost so you enjoy the town
Even when the roses die, you mesmerized by the flying sky
We gotta socialize and cherish times 
This shit is deeper than love
I pull up in that Lamborghini , the doors in the sky
Shit is straight up suicide
You in that new Bentley truck, new, new Bentley truck 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We've been playing in that Versace 
We go to Abu Dhabi for a hobby 
Your body my new Bugatti 
I'll hold you down
I'm the one gon' hold you down
I'm the one gon' hold you down
I'm on my way
I'm the one that be rolling up
In that Bentley truck 'cause I'm rolling up
Want you like right now 
You the one got all I need
Give me all of you or all of me 'cause
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
Live an expensive life
And I'm just getting started, I get instant hype
'Cause you're forever my lady
Forever my baby 
Hold you down, hold you down
Girl, you helped me up when I was down, in and out, girl
Hold you down like I'm supposed to
Real nigga, I know you
Real nigga, I know you 
I'll hold you down
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
