I say this all started in some guy's basement
Which in itself is weird
Like what did we think battling in that man's house was gonna do for our careers?
But he gave us a couple dollars, we took it
We got a chance to chill with our peers
Then you let it slip, about how you were jealous of this luxurious ass beard
So now we here
It's the peculiar case of Marvin and his lying friend
Whoever you called to get dirt on me, you better fly 'em in
Cause if you think that's gon' help you win one round, you better try again
This gon' be a biblical ass whooping, Daniel, welcome to the lion's den
I gave you your whole fucking style
Racism included
But you kinda like Marvwon lite, nigga you watered down and diluted
Let me hear some extra rude shit, out the window goes this cool shit
Can't nobody in this building say "nigga" unless I approve it
Go Gokuâ€™s back, but I'm only hear to speak to Vegita
Call me a "moolie"
I'ma Do The Right Thing and burn down your pizzaria
You will literally have hot sauce
I'm talking en fuego Prego
I'm just trying to build with this wop, nigga those are dego Legos
But now he's in a box, you know a Dead Man, I'm talking "Ayo"
I'll make this a-hole smell worse then ten day old mayo
What you say bro? You thugging?
Who in here done seen Daniel's goon?
Right, well he sings to the cops, nigga we all know Daniel croon
What happened? I am heroin, hot shit, I am what's on Daniel's spoon
I will put my animals on his head, nigga since he wanna be Daniel Boone
I said yo
I say isn't that shit cute? You coming out your face
Checking your shit, probably got some calls about some pounds you flake
Shit, it's been ten fucking years, you still sound weird and out of date
Talking shit about my beard, you're so fucking fat even your beard's outta shape
I said he don't look like much now, but back in my days he was an O.G
I mean, I used to repeat some of what you told me
Cause back then I used to think you was Kobe
So I wanna give you a moment of respect, and tell you homie to homie
I learned a lot from you Marv', you're like my Obese Won Kenobi
I said I could reach for his windpipe, leave him sleep with a quick swipe
I mean honestly y'all sometimes it's hard for me to be mean to this guy
Cause you look on the outside like how I feel on the inside
I mean honestly, I didn't even wanna approach this like that
Dawg, holy fucking shit you're fat
You prolly fucking quit the match if I told you the McRib was back
I ain't even trying to go there and play tit for tat
But the bitch that took your virginity prolly try to give it back
So I don't wanna hear shit about how you gon' run up with Llamas
Dawg you get five steps out the car you'd be fucking exhausted
You look like 90% of your clothes are fucking pajamas
It looks like every time you go the gym they play Fuck Up Some Commas
Him and his old girl used to have a special vibe
Until one day they got into a fight cause you tried to take the extra fries
Bitch don't play then Marv fucking said "goodbye"
So funny how shit didn't workout cause he ashamed to have an ex her size/exercise
I'll kick the door open while you're fucking like, "What is y'all doing?"
Any bitch that fucks you is beyond stupid
You're such a large human your favorite sex position is Lay On Top Until She Stops Moving
I say, he be trying to lock bitches down like they under arrest
Shit is basically a life sentence of uncomfortable sex
He's either gonna crush her to death or she's gonna drown in a puddle of sweat
She's basically fighting for her life until she runs out of breath
And then he be holding his chest, hoping for the best
Last time homie had some sex he got sued by his mattress for post traumatic stress
The bitch tried to give me back my virginity huh?
That sounded like fun
The only thing that bitch tried to give me back was my illegitimate son
I'm nice with these moves, I'll make your head spin like a break dancer
And Aspect said you gon' see him about telling people that he got fake cancer
Anytime. If he does have cancer I'm gonna win easily
Why would you fight a person with cancer? Who are you?
This battle shit is fun, you love it, it's such fun ain't it?
I've been waiting on this match up longer than a fucking Lush One payment
I'm underground, but don't mistake me for one of them abstract writers
I will put mo' people in yo' crib than a Team Backpack Cipher
{Chokes}
This Cal' will push his brim, that's Pat Stay's hat
I made a living off of these letters, nigga I'm Pat Sajak
You are not who comes to mind when I think of that Bay rap
I will literally kill you to bring Mac Dre back
That's Town business
King shit, this crown business
Who in here think Caustic is it?
Well nigga you in the clown business
Let's get back to this you writing rounds business
I heard the story, I said these bars are strange but Danny's a coke head
Are we really surprised that his lines are 'cane/Arcane?
You been mid tier your whole career
Nigga, nothing but a weak spitter
In the FreshCoast history books, you are nothing but a seat filler
I heard it don't take shit to hit yo' bitch
Some Reggie weed and some cheap liquor
With a coaching I heard the bitch make balls magically disappear like a flee flicker
Sometimes you're kinda good Marv'
I give the fat man credit
You know how I know you're overweight?
How?
Cause you fucking snore while you're awake
You are going to get 3-0'd by cholesterol, no debate
And you haven't won a battle in fucking forever
You been in a drought longer than the fucking Golden State
Y'all wanna hear how fucking disgusting Marv' is?
He scavenges for food that others discarded
To keep it warm he keeps it tucked under his armpit
And when he gets tired his fucking stomach doubles as an armrest
That's not even possible. That's not even humanly possible
Try it. I double dare you
I mean y'all should be happy
You don't get to see someone this fat often
It looks like you just had a problem with an assistant manager at a Baskin Robbins
Fucking fat, black, obnoxious
Running around looking like Blacktion Bronson
So what it really be
Out here looking like a Mark Henry mini me
Ain't no grilling me, I break him into three parts like a trilogy
Nickle be pointed at his face like a window's peak
Bitch you bigger than a wildebeest
That shit will get you fricassed
I can use your titty meat to feed a million children in the Middle East
So what you wanna do tubby?
You can't fuck with me I'm too hungry, you too chubby
I'm six foot, 220, you six foot two of me
I mean imagine him, at the gym
Trying to get his abdomen flat again
Bad news buddy it ain't fucking happening
Last time he got in my car he fucking cracked the rims
Fucking shit beard to the side and cause an accident
Y'all remember the BP oil spill? That was him
Nah I'm bullshitting, you're way too black to swim
Y'all in here thinking that I'm having a friendly match with him
But what y'all don't know is that the loser gotta buy dinner
So fuck that shit I have to win
During my research I saw a picture of you and your little man the other day
....
What? This isn't me choking, that was me being quiet cause I had nothing nice to say
But you? You gon' ruin him
Right now see he's prolly a dreamer
He has absolutely no idea that his papi's a tweeker
But it's right in front of his face, in black and white
Like Wally and Beaver
He gon' watch dope take his famous parent away like Bobbi Christina
People say Caustic is fake racist
I said, "When did the facts switch?"
If he say he in love with the cocoa, it ain't got nothing to do with a black bitch
Really? I lost my virginity to a black girl. That's bullshit
We just lost J Arch, we lost PH, we lost Sean P
And I'm saying that to mention that Danny I love you
This is not a battle, this is yo' intervention
And I hope you know that I'm coming with the most humblest intentions
Cause being a 30 year old blow head is obviously a fucking cry for attention
Whoooo! Tough crowd
It's getting a little heavy
Yeah the shit got real. Let's get back to fat jokes
You know the deal, they pay me I show up and show out
Everybody came to see this G take the win over Steffani, No Doubt
It's amazing how your mother is known as a private dancer
And it's ironic how you're racist and on your shirt is a Black Panther
If you talk while I'm speaking, I got something that'll leave you leaking
It's crazy how they made you look like Drake on the flier
But in real like you Meekin' him
It only puts me back to something when I was young that I was told
Always heard that the good die young
Well Caustic I am living proof that the great die old
Y'all niggas thought Caustic could beat me, fuck is you crazy dude?
I'm a Detroit nigga and I just bought them .380's through
And the last thing he gon' see is that D over that navy blue
Like, "Wigger, look at what you made me do."
Sometimes I don't understand our friendship Marv'
Sometimes I gotta revise the strategy
I mean, I feel like we spend most of meals asking you like, "Why are you mad at me?"
I mean, I tried to take the guy to Applebees
And he fucking blew up on the waitress like a Chinese factory
I said I'm kinda nice dawg why fight it?
You talking about striking dawg I wouldn't fucking try fighting
I mean I'm too quick dawg, I'm fucking white lightening
Shit you said it yourself I even look like Drake in the right lighting
Shit you think I forgot about y'all?
Y'all some fucking cheaters
I know what you kids do
Stole the fucking WRC tapes the second you start losing
That's a bitch move
Y'all been rapping for 20 fucking years, never fucking improve
Plus you're cool with Quest holding you back, he's like the big spoon
Man, you and Quest have been together forever
From the jump he could tell you were better so he fucking locked you down longer than Nelson Mandela
Dawg, people like you make it hard for people like me to pay respect to their elders
Dawg, you been on the same fucking Quest for 20 years like Legend Of Zelda
So what's with the attitude?
I never met anybody as fat as you
I can hear your fucking heart arteries clogging fucking jamming too
If you fucking feeling froggy about this shit then do what you have to do
My team will clap for stupid shit like Family Feud
I said shit I wish you would try to catch me slipping while I'm out here perfect dawg
I stays with the nine like she damn near perfect
Shit I might just have to burn him if he ever try to take mine
I heard you was scared to death of jail, that's what I heard through the grapevines
You be walking the yard, holding pockets on the main line
Bitch, you more like Floyd's homie, prolly kill yourself if you face time
Shit, said there ain't too much to this gangsta stuff
Get money, fuck bitches, don't say too much
It's the king of disrespect, dawg, I play too much
You still waiting to get saved, you pray too much
Out of town, motherfuckers in The Bay too much
Stay in your Lane Bryant you in the way too much
I got sent upstate for pushing weight too much
I kill the fucking plug he make me wait too much
I'm crazy, drugs up in my face too much
I'm way too much, bitch you just weigh too much
I said, those fucking arteries inside here are fucking set to explode
People this big don't live that long dawg, I'm just letting you know
Avocado's already uploading your battle highlights into Editor Pro
So in a year from now when you die your memorial video is queued up and fucking ready to go
You said you was gonna rap circles around me and I was giving you power
I would rap circles around you but that would take literal hours
