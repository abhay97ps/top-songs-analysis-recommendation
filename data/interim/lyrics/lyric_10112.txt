 Music: Theme from Close Encounters of the Third Kind
You must use the Force
You must use the Force
You must use the Force
 Music: "The Raider's March" from Raiders of the Lost Ark
Long time ago, far, far away
Long time ago, far, far away
Kiss a Wookiee, kick a droid
Fly the Falcon through an asteroid
'Til the princess is annoyed
This is spaceships
It's monsters
It's *Star Wars*
We love it!
Come and help me, Obi-Wan
X-Wing fighter and a blaster gun
Dance with ewoks, oh, what fun!
This is spaceships
It's monsters
It's *Star Wars*
We love it!
 Music: "Main Title March" from Superman
Get in there you big, furry oaf
I couldn't care less what you smell!
I take orders from only me
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell
Your highness, your worshipfulness
Your highness, your worshipfulness!
No one cares if you upset a droid 
That's because droids don't tear your arms out of socket 
I suggest a new strategy: let the Wookiee win
That's because nobody cares if you upset a droid
 Music: "Flying" from E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial
Now we listen to Luke whining
One more season, one more season, one more season
I was gonna go to Tosche
Station for power converters
Now I guess I'm going nowhere
It just isn't fair!
 Music: "Main Title" from Jaws
Wookiee!
Wookiee!
Wookiee! Wookiee!
Wookiee! Wookiee!
Someone move this walking carpet
Someone move this walking carpet
Someone move this walking carpet
Someone move this walking carpet
Kiss your brother, kiss your brother
Princess Leia!
Well, I guess you don't know anything about women
Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy?
 Music: "Theme" from Jurassic Park
Luke, I'm your father
It is useless to resist
Come with me, my son
We will rule
Search your feelings, it is true
So, you have a twin sister who
Obi-Wan was wise to hide
If you will not turn
Then perhaps she will
Give in to your hate
You are mine
 Music: "The Raider's March" from Raiders of the Lost Ark
Long, long, long time ago
Far, far, far, far away
Long, long, long time ago
Far, far, far away
Kiss a Wookiee, 
Kick a droid, 
Fly the Falcon 
Through an asteroid!
'Til the princess 
Is annoyed 
This is spaceships
It's monsters
It's *Star Wars*
We love it, it's true!
Coming to you!
So let's go 
Stand in line 
Cause it's al- 
-most the time! 
May the Force be with you all!
