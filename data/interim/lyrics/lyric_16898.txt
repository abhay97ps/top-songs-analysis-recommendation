Late at night when all the world is sleeping
I stay up and think of you
And I wish on a star that somewhere you are
Thinking of me too
'Cause I'm dreaming of you tonight
'Till tomorrow, I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room, dreaming about you and me
Wonder if you ever see me 
And I wonder if you know I'm there 
If you looked in my eyes, would you see what's inside?
Would you even care?
I just wanna hold you close, but so far
All I have are dreams of you
So I wait for the day 
And the courage to say how much I love you
Yes, I do
I'll be dreaming of you tonight
'Till tomorrow , I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room, dreaming about you and me
Coraz칩n
I can't stop dreaming of you
No puedo dejar de pensar en ti
I can't stop dreaming
C칩mo te necesito
I can't stop dreaming of you
Mi amor, c칩mo te extra침o
Late at night when all the world is sleeping
I stay up and think of you
And I still can't believe that you came up to me
And said, "I love you"
I love you too
Now I'm dreaming with you tonight
'Till tomorrow  and for all of my life
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room, dreaming with you endlessly
With you tonight
'Till tomorrow , I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world where I'd rather be
Than here in my room, dreaming with you endlessly 
I'll be dreaming of you tonight 
And I'll be holding you tonight 
Dreaming  with you tonight 
 Dreaming
