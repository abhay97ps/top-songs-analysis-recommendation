Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Ooh, Sunday morning
You're gonna find my love shinin' on you
Ooh, I'm waiting
I'm forever anticipating
Your face on my pillow
You're the sunshine pourin' through my window
And like the grapes on the vine
Love is sweeter with time
And you were made to love
Ooh 
Sunday morning 
You're gonna find my love shinin' on you
Ooh 
Sunday morning 
It's like the best of everything fallin' on you
Your eyes shining on me
You're the brightest star in the sky I can see
Your kiss, ah, I'm so thankful
And the love that you give is so delightful, yeah, yeah
And the birds in the trees
Singing love songs to me
Saying you was made to love
Ooh 
Sunday morning 
You're gonna find my love shinin' on you
Ooh 
Sunday morning 
It's like the best of everything fallin' on you
When I see your face
Like the mornin' sun
You spark me to shine
I love you, baby
Ooh 
Sunday morning
You're gonna find my love shinin' on you
Ooh 
Sunday morning 
It's like the best of everything fallin' on you
Ooh 
Sunday morning 
When we shared sweet love like no other
Ooh 
Sunday morning 
Like a summer day with your lover
Ooh 
Sunday morning 
When we shared sweet love like no other
Ooh 
Sunday morning 
Like a summer day with your lover
Ooh 
Sunday morning 
When we shared sweet love like no other
