All this time, I couldn't shake your memory
And I never knew the sweetest love was the first
So what am I supposed to do about this curse?
Oh, baby, I've got you to blame
And I'm calling, calling out your name
Oh, he was so fine
Jimmy Lee, oh, he was so fine
Jimmy, Jimmy Lee
Jimmy, Jimmy Lee
Find me rushing off to school every morning
Never had a care
Acting crazy, always laughing when I'm running
'Cause I knew you'd meet me when I got there
Stealing kisses in the hall before the first bell
You smelled so fine
Though we'd just met I guess you knew me so well
You had the number to my heart line
Well, just between you and me
He was the first one
He stole my heart
And he ran like a bandit
I don't understand it
Jimmy Lee, this one's for me
And I'll always remember
History, biology, and that magical December, ooh boy
Jimmy Lee, where can you be?
If this song ever finds you
Won't you please explain to me
Why you left me behind you, yeah
 Jimmy
On the average twice a week I think I see you
On some avenue
Someone laughs or shakes his head they way you used to
I guess I got myself a loose screw
I grew up and had my share of adventure
Well, I've had some fun 
But you never need to question my intentions
'Cause each guy is just another rerun
Just between you and me
He was the first one
He stole my heart
And he ran like a bandit
I don't understand it, hey, hey
Jimmy Lee, this one's for me
And I'll always, always remember
History, biology, and that magical, oh, December
Jimmy Lee, where can you be?
If this song ever finds you, yeah yeah yeah
Won't you please explain to me
Why you left me, oh, behind you
Jimmy Lee, this one's for me
