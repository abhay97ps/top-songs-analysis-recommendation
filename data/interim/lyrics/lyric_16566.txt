Another day, I call and never speak
And you would say nothing's changed at all
And I can't feel much hope for anything
If I won't be there to catch you if you fall
Again 
It seems we meet 
In the spaces 
In between 
We always say 
It won't be long 
Oh, but something's always wrong
Another game of putting things aside
As if we'll come back to them some time
A brace of hopes, a pride of innocents
And you would say something has gone wrong
Again 
It seems we meet 
In the spaces 
In between 
We always say 
It won't be long 
Oh, but something's always wrong
Yeah, hey, hey
Yeah, hey, hey, hey
Yeah, hey, hey
Yeah, hey, hey, hey
Again 
It seems we meet 
In the spaces 
In between 
We always say 
It won't be long 
Oh, but something's always wrong
Something's always wrong
Something's always wrong
Hey, hey, hey, hey
