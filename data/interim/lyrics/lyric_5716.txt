Never in my life before
Have I ever cried
The way I've cried for you
Because you abuse me
To amuse your friends
And you use me
That's where your story ends
And I turn around
And love you, baby
Never in my wildest dreams
Even when I made believe
I knew I'd never own you
No, I've never really known you
But I turn around
And I love you, baby
And even though I can
Never really know for sure
What's in your heart
I'm gonna hold on
Knowing that you're
The hurting kind
And if the day ever comes
When you say you're
Gonna leave me
I would lose my mind
Every day and every little way
Everything I do or say
I do for you
But you abuse me
To amuse your friends
And you use me
That's where your story ends
And I turn around
And love you, baby
I turn around and love you
Oh, yeah
I'm always thinking of you
Oh, yeah
I turn around and love you
Oh, yeah
I'm always thinking of you
