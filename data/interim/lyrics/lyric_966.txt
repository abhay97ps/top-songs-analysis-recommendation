Scene 16
-Miss Cloud? -
(Cloud and Aerith arrive in Wall Market, busy with the hustle and
bustle of people. Aerith runs around, checking things out.)
"This place is scary in a lot of ways. Especially for a girl. So
we've got to find Tifa fast."
]]
"I just can't make up my mind. Mmm."
"Huh? About what?"
"Hmmm, don't make me say it. It's the shop down on the right."
"Hey, you two. Why don't you get some rest?"
"We have a beautiful room, how 'bout it?"
"Aren't cats great? This one's a little big, huh?"
"Hey boy! You shore got a good lookin' heifer there!"
"Take her to Don's place, and you'll make a mint."
"Whoa!"
"Why don't you say something, if you're standing there?"
"Please come in. Here's a free 'Pharmacy Coupon' if you enter
now."
"Welcome! Sit wherever you like!"
"I'm gonna get another Pharmacy Coupon today."
"umf... scarf... glub..."
"I always get the Special."
"It's thanks to the Don that we can eat like this."
"umf... grunt... smack... Don't sneak up on me like that!"
"It's a little early to start eating. Come back in a bit."
"...We're closed now."
"Oh... what should I do... Should I just buy it......?"
"Welcome. Please take your time."
"Don't push! Hooligan!"
"All this trash. Can't we do anything with it?"
"All this, belongs to the owner of the Weapons Shop. He keeps
picking things up and saving them here."
"Oh, you mean the owner who even has a tank in his shop."
"But no matter how you look at it, it's just trash..."
"Join the club."
"Try it with us."
"All right... 1, 2, 3. Squats are all in the rhythm."
"I'm doing my best, bro'!"
"How's... this!?"
"Whew, times are bad."
"...And then..."
"Hmm, hmmm, oh really?"
"Yes? If you want to order, do it at the counter." [Note: You
don't seem to be able to order]
"Hey, could you do somethin' for me? Someone's been in there
all day and they're not comin' out. I can't hold it anymore!"
"HEY... someone's IN here... Don't look!"
"You want somethin'? I don't wanna hear any complaints 'bout
how things look."
]]
"Man... Should I go.... or not?"
"I get so mental at times like this. I'm hopeless!"
"Hey!! Aren't you...?"
"What!! You mean, you're.... too?"
***Cloud
Yeah, me too.
"You're Tifa's childhood friend, and you brought a girlfriend
to a place like this!?"
"What kind of guy are you!!"
"What the hell!! You *%^&!! This ain't no #$*&^% show!! I'm busy
right now!!"
"I'm feelin' like there's gonna be a fight!"
"Urrgh... no way... I can't go on."
"Things aren't working out."
"Between our differences and my pay, it just isn't cutting it."
"Welcome!! Even unpopular dweebs, like you may meet your
destiny here!!"
"You looking for a girlfriend too?"
***Cloud
You know a girl named Tifa?
"Hey, you're pretty fast. Tifa's our newest girl."
"But, unfortunately, she's having an interview right now."
"Here at the Honey Bee Inn, it's customary for all the new girls
to be taken to Don Corneo's mansion."
"Don Corneo's a famous dilettante. Now he wants to settle down
and is in the market for a bride."
"The Honey Bee Inn is a private club. Only members can go in.
Shoo, shoo."
[Note: The whole scene of getting into Don Corneo's mansion is very
open-ended. Your results may vary. I have included all the dialogue you
could encounter while getting the various items, as well as what happens
when you reach the Don's mansion with different amounts of the items.
Remember that it is NOT required to get all of the items, and no matter
how feminine you get, it will not have any bearing on the progression of
events through the game.]
"This is the mansion of Don Corneo, the most powerful man in
Wall Market."
"Look, the Don's not into men. So don't let me catch you around
here again..."
"Hey, and you got another cute one with you!"
"Hey, this looks like the Don's mansion. I'll go take a look."
"I'll tell Tifa about you."
"No!! You can't!!"
"Why?"
"You DO know... what kind of... place this is, don't you?"
"Then, what am I supposed to do? You want to go in with me?"
"Well being a man, that'll be pretty hard. Besides if I bust in
there, it'll cause too much commotion."
"But, I just can't let you go in alone... Oh, man......"
"First, we'll need to find out if Tifa's alright...."
"What's so funny, Aerith?"
"Cloud, why don't you dress up like a girl? It's the only way."
"WHAT!?"
Aerith]
"Just wait. I've got a cute friend I want to bring."
Cloud]
"Aerith! I can't....."
Aerith]
"You ARE worried about Tifa, aren't you? Then come on, hurry!"
Aerith]
"Excuse me! I'd like to get a dress."
"Umm, it might take a little time. Will that be all right?"
"What's the problem?"
"Well, my father, the owner, has been in a slump lately. You
see, he makes all the dresses."
"And, where is your father?"
"He's probably plastered at the bar."
"So... You're saying we can't get a dress unless we do something
about your father?"
"Yes. I'm sorry. He's caused so much trouble."
"!"
"You'd help me bring him back?"
"Well, if don't do something, we don't get a dress, right?"
"Really!? Please help my crazy old dad. I just don't know what
to do anymore...."
"All right, we'll do something. Let's go, Cloud!"
"Excuse us, are you the father of the girl at the Clothing Store?"
"I own the Clothes Shop... but I ain't your father."
"I didn't say that...."
"Make me some clothes."
"I don't make men's clothes. And I don't feel like makin'
anything right now."
"Cloud, you wait over there for a second. I'll try and talk to
him."
"Why don't you go over there and have something to drink."
"You know, mister."
"He always said that just once, he'd like to dress up as a girl."
"So, that's why I wanted a cute dress for him..."
"What!? A tough lookin guy like that?"
"So, how 'bout it? Will you make him one?"
"...might be interesting. I was gettin' a little bored just
makin' regular clothes."
"Then you'll do it for us?"
"Yeah, all right. What kind of dress you want?"
"Something..."
(You get to choose what kind of dress you get here. If you make these
choices, you will get the Silk Dress, the sexiest dress. Any other
combination will get you a non-sexy dress.)
That feels soft
"And something...."
that shimmers
"Hmm, got it. Y'know I got a friend that has the same taste
as him. I'll go talk to him."
"Oh, you're here. It's ready. Go try it on."
(They receive the Silk Dress. Cloud looks like he is dreading this. He
steps into the dressing booth and we hear scuffling sounds.)
"How... do you put this thing on?"
"Whoa! What are you doing!"
"It's still not right. A wig! That's what you need!"
"Umm, I thought you might, so I talked to my friend about
getting one."
"You know the gym? You'll find a lot of people there like you.
Go and talk to them."
"...'like you'? Aerith, what did you tell him?"
"Does it matter? Anyhow, we got a pretty dress!"
(They travel to the gym and speak to the man watching the squat-thrust
match. We can only assume it is a man; he appears to be wearing women's
clothes.)
"You the one.... Who wants to be cute?"
"Cute?"
"Right."
"And about the wig..."
"Yeah, I heard. But it'll cost ya."
"Urrrrgh!!!"
"Big Bro!! The only way you're gonna get cuter is if you can
beat the Big Bro!!"
"That's right!"
"So, you've got to compete with us!"
"You're right. Let's do squats."
"All right! We'll beat you out of this gym!"
"Are you...?"
"THE beautiful Bro?"
"What? You didn't know? Always running around here saying
Big Bro' this, Big Bro' that...."
"Never mind that, come over here."
"No. I'll explain the rules."
"From the ready position, push Square button to squat, push X
Button to get up, and push O Button to go back to the ready position."
"So it's Square Button, X Button, O Button in that order."
"Got it?"
***Cloud
Got it
"Whoever has the most squats at the end of 30 seconds gets the
wig."
"I'm not going to lose."
"Big Bro's wig is MINE!!"
"Just be quiet..."
"It's not fair for you to start right away. So, you want
practice?"
***Cloud
A little
"Then, start practicing!"
"You had 20 squats."
"Now let's begin the real thing. Start!"
"He had 17 squats and you had 20 squats."
"You're really something. Okay, I'm a man of my word, here
you are."
'I'm so mad I'm so so so--- mad!"
"Shut up! Don't cry just because you lost!"
"Uuuhh, Bro's fists of steel cut to the bone!"
"Hey man. Got a minute? I need to talk... man to man."
***Cloud
What is it
"Really! I really appreciate it."
"......I'm sorry but, young lady? Would you turn the other way,
for a second?"
"Why.....?"
"......Aerith."
"Gosh!"
"I'm sorry, lady."
"Now here's the thing. Do you know that vending machine in the
inn?"
"I'm itchin' to know what they're selling in it. I just can't
ask a girl to go get it."
"What? Why don't I buy it myself? Well to tell you the truth,
I got in a fight with the guy at the inn and can't go there anymore.
Come on, so how 'bout it?"
***Cloud
I'll go
"Good, thanks. I'll be waitin' here when you're done."
"Finished?"
(They go to the inn and get a room there. Late that night, Cloud gets out
of bed and goes to the vending machine in the hallway.)
"He means this?"
CHOICE
Don't buy it
Buy the one for 200 Gil 
Buy the one for 100 Gil
Buy the one for 50 Gil
"I got it."
"Oh, really!! Hey!"
"Geez."
"And, what was it?"
"A protein drink set. That jerk. I'm gonna do so much more
business than him, his head'll spin."
"Thanks, bud. I'm motivated now. Take this, it's not much..."
(Cloud and Aerith go to the Honeybee Inn. A guy on the path there
gives them a members Card. They speak to the bouncer.)
"Hey! Is that a 'Member's Card' I see shining in your hot
little hand?"
"Please, come in."
"...Hmm. That's how you'll fool them."
"......Hmmmmmmmmm. So that's how you fooled them."
"Let's go!!"
"Poo, I uh, mean, Sir..."
"Hurry..."
"Please choose a room. (Gosh, he's so weird... but then again,
they all are.)"
(Cloud ducks into the dressing room for the Honeybees and speaks to them.
Repeatedly.)
"Hmm, hmm, hmm....."
"Ohhh, I just can't seem to lose weight. Hmm, hmm, hmm..."
"Sir!! You can't come in here."
""
"Eyaah!"
"Don't!"
"Paste, paste, paste....."
"(Oh God... here's another one of those guys. You know, the
delicate type. Just ignore him, just ignore him.)"
"Fluff, fluff, fluff..."
"(Hmm! I guess he doesn't realize his position. I feel sorry for
him. Just ignore him, just ignore him.)"
"Pita, pita, pita...."
""
""
"Mix, mix, mix...."
"(What should I do... Is he following me? Really? What if he
follows me home...?)"
""
"Shake, shake, shake..."
"(You think he's after me? Really? This guy makes me sick... And
his eyes are weird too....)"
"(Yeah, don't hurt these guys' feelings. Let's at least say 'hi'
to him."
"Uhh.... Hel... Hello."
"What a nice day, today."
***Cloud
Introduce yourself
Cloud
"By the way, I haven't introduced myself yet."
"I'm Cloud, a jack of all trades."
"Oh, yeah...? Welcome, Cloud."
""
"Take care... Cloud."
***Cloud
Not interested
"NO WAY! I'M SO SHOCKED!!"
"Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm......... hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm... hmm, hmm, hmm,
hmm..."
"Phew... ...it's so tiring."
"Oh!!"
"Is something the matter?"
***Cloud
Not yet.....
"OH......!!"
(Cloud exits the dressing room. He takes a peek through the keyholes of
some occupied doors. Behind the first one, The Lovers Room....)
"....Woooo...ow!"
"...wheez...."
"Phew...."
"What's wrong, Grandpa? You keep sighing."
"...wheez... puff... You know, Grandma..."
"You talking about this room?"
"...whew... I know our son rented this for us and all, but...."
"It's too nice for us. Big round bed, gorgeous tub, I just can't
get comfortable."
"Don't worry about it. It's a high class neighborhood, in the Big
City."
"You keep complainin' and we'll get into trouble."
"...wheez..."
"...Wooo...ow!"
(Lightning flashes... a guy in a tub... another standing... one is dressed
as a king.)
...The wind's calm now....
It's the curse of the resurrected Satan... Our beloved Queen does
not awaken...
The time is ripe...
A legend has been passed on through generations...
"Psst... "
"...whisper... whisper... (We have a luncheon with President
Shinra...)"
"Psst..... "
"Psst.... "
"Psst.... "
A legend has been passed on through generations....
.....the sought after Promised Land....
"Psst.... "
....One with Blue Eyes....
"Psst....(It's like this every time we have a business trip to
Midgar.)"
.....and a Great White Sword on his back.....
""
.... Will not lead to the Promised Land.....
"Psst.... (What're you complaining about. You're just holding the
lights. I've gotta wear this heavy armor!)"
"Psst.... "
"Psst.... (Oh yeah, did you hear? The President's wife found out
about this little hobby of his.)"
"Psst... "
"Psst... "
"Geez!! Mr. Prseident!! I mean, Your Majesty..."
"Ohhh... I'm sorry. Please remove the ancient curse!"
"I'll take this room."
"All right, Now all we have to do is enter the room."
"You're not going to have a change of heart, are you?"
***Cloud
Don't make me repeat myself
"Oh, don't be angry with me.... (Geez.... this one' probably the
violent type....)"
"All right, please."
"This way, please."
"Shall we begin?"
"I guess since you chose this room, that would mean you..."
"Hate being lonely?"
***Cloud
I'm used to being alone
Cloud
"I'm always alone."
"All right, all right. "
"Come on, everyone's waiting."
***Cloud
Everyone...?
"Here they are."
"All right, everyone."
"One, two! One, two!"
"Yeah!!"
"One, two!! One, two!!"
"Wassup!!"
""
"Oh man..."
"What should I do...?"
***Cloud
I'm outta here
"I've got no time to mess around with you."
"Outta my way!"
"...heave... pant..."
"Don't be so embarrassed! Loosen up, bubby!"
"...heave... pant..."
"Let's wash off all our sweat and dirt together!"
"Wassup!!"
(They all move in towards Cloud. The camera pans up to the ceiling so that
just the tops of their heads are showing.)
"Bubby! You're the intimate type, huh!!"
"...heave... pant... Wow!! Would ya look at that!"
"Isn't bathing great...?"
"It soothes your heart."
"How is it, bubby!?"
"Feels good, huh?"
***Cloud
.........
"I don't feel good. Let me out..."
"You'll get used to it. Try counting to ten."
"Ten..."
"Nine..."
"Hey bubby, how old are you?"
"Eight..."
"Twenty one..."
"You're less than half my age. I'm so jealous."
"So how 'bout it...?"
"Do you wanna join my "Young bubby's" group?"
***Cloud
Not interested
"Seven..."
"Six..."
"Maybe in another life."
"Well, if that's how you feel... too bad."
"We have a trip planned at a cabin out in the country."
"Five..."
"Four..."
"Three...."
"Two..."
"One..."
"Alright, that's ten. I'm gettin' out."
"Why don't you stick around and play a bit?"
"Daddy's so lonely..."
"Bubby!!" This is important to
me."
"Here's a memento of our time
together!"
"Hope we meet again!"
"This is SOME underwear.... I'm supposed to wear this...?"
"Well, if it's to save Tifa... I guess there's no way around."
"I'll take this room."
"All right, Now all we have to do is enter the room."
"You're not going to have a change of heart, are you?"
***Cloud
Don't make me repeat myself
"Oh, don't be angry with me.... (Geez.... this one' probably the
violent type....)"
"All right, please."
(Cloud enters. There is a bright flash of light and the room dims. Cloud
walks forward and sees a ghost of himself, transparent, kneeling by the
tub. The ghost rises and walks to him.)
"Hmm.....? You.....?"
"What are you doing in a place like this?"
"That's what I want to ask you. Should you be foolin' around
here?"
"You think problems will go away just thinkin' about them?"
(The ghost rises, lifts his sword above his head... and falls forward, into
Cloud's body. He falls and the screen goes black)
"Oh no!"
"Help! Someone...! Hurry!"
"You can't change anything by just sitting back and looking at it."
"What are you saying?"
"It's started moving."
"What has?"
"Wake up!"
"rub, rub, rub..... rub, rub, rub, rub...."
"thump... pound.... thump... pound..."
"poik... poik... ...squish."
"Uh... OW..!!"
"Wake up!!"
"Wake up!!"
(Screen fades in to show Mukki straddling Cloud and slapping him upside
the head. Cloud sits up and Mukki flops down on the bed.)
"Phew, I'm so relieved."
"Bubby!! I heard you collapsed."
"No, no, no."
"Don't get so uptight."
***Cloud
Huh...?
"Hmm...? They say youth is so long but so short."
"Let's give this next one your best shot."
"Time's up. Bye, buddy."
"Don't get depressed over a thing like this."
"It happens to me all the time."
"I'm so sorry... There's a lot of 'adult' things going on..."
"For your inconvenience, please take this, okay?"
"What, this rag? For me!? I just don't get it."
".........."
"If I were to dress up like a woman... Then I've got to really
prepare carefully."
"Seems like I could put makeup on here."
***Cloud
Have them put makeup on
"I have a favor to ask of you. Can you put makeup on me too?"
"...paste, paste, paste....."
"Oh... my....."
"Uh, sir!! It's almost closing time..."
"So, please remember any personal belongings."
"Uuuuuh! I want flowers too! But, I get so nervous in front of
cute girls..."
"It just seems more natural to get cautious..."
"Hey!! Cloud!!"
"Yes, what will you have?"
"Hmm..."
***Cloud
Today's Special
"One Today's Special."
"Comin' up!"
"In this store, you pay first. It'll be 70 Gil."
"Thank you. Just a second."
"There you go. Enjoy."
***Cloud
"It was all right"
"Thank you. Here's an item coupon for the Pharmacy."
"You can exchange it for one item there."
"We're out of coupons, so we stopped giving them away. Watch for
our NEXT promotion!"
"Whoa!"
"Why don't you say something, if you're standing there?"
"Oh, you have a coupon. Then please select any one medicine you
like."
"Here you are."
(He gives him the Digestive. They go to the bar and speak to the guy in
the bathroom.)
"HEY... someone's IN here... Don't look!"
"What... urk..."
***Cloud
Give her medicine
"Huh? You'll really give me some? Thanks."
"Phew, I feel better now. This is for your kindness."
"Aren't you going to change?"
***Cloud
Okay... I'm ready
"Hmm, not bad. This may be a new business for me."
"Yeah, you're right. Should we try it?"
"Thanks for showing us something new. My father's got his
motivation back now. So the dress is on the house."
"Walk more nicely like... this. Miss Cloud."
"What do you mean 'nicely'?"
"Oh you're so cute, Miss Cloud."
"Aaah, I want one. Do you have one that'll look good on me too?"
"How's this?"
"How about that one?"
"Father, what are you talking about? This one's much better."
"No, what are you saying? This one."
"...I want THIS one."
"I'm going to go change."
"......No peeking!"
"So? How do I look?"
"Oh, you're no fun!"
Scene 17
- Rescue Tifa From Don Of The Slums -
"Damn!! Your friend's hot, too!"
"Come in, come in!!"
"Two ladies coming through!"
"Hey, ladies."
"I'll go and let the Don know you're here. Wait here. Don't go
wandering around..."
"Now's our chance. Let's find Tifa."
(Cloud goes upstairs and through a door. He comes out in a torture chamber.
Aerith follows. They see Tifa there, dressed like... .. a slut, to be blunt
about it.)
"...Tifa?"
"Nice to meet you. I'm Aerith."
"Cloud's told me a lot about you."
"...And you are?"
"Hey you're the one with Cloud in
the park..."
"Right, with Cloud."
"Oh....."
"Don't worry. We just met. It's nothing."
"What do you mean, 'Don't worry'... about what?"
"No, don't misunderstand."
"Cloud and I grew up together. Nothing more."
"Poor Cloud, having to stand here and listen to both of us call
him nothing."
"Right, Cloud?"
"Cloud?"
"????"
"Cloud!?"
"Why are you dressed like that!? And what are you doing here!?"
"Forget that, what happened to you after the fall!? Are you
hurt!?"
"Hey, give me a chance to explain."
"I'm dressed like this... because there was no other way to get
in here."
"I'm all right. Aerith helped me out."
"Oh, Aerith did..."
"Tifa, explain. What are you doing in a place like this?"
"Yeah, ummmm...."
"Ahem! I'll just plug my ears."
"I'm glad you're OK."
"Thanks. What happened?"
"When we got back from the Number 5 reactor, there was this weird
man."
"So Barret caught him and squeezed some information out of him."
"That's when the Don's name popped up."
"Right, Don Corneo."
"Barret told me to leave the lech alone..."
"But something's been bothering me."
"I see. So you wanted to get the story straight from Corneo's
mouth."
"So I made it here, but now I'm in a bind."
"Corneo is looking for a bride."
"Everyday, he gets three girls, chooses one of them, and then....
...and, well....."
"Anyway, I have to be the girl... or I'm out for tonight."
"Sorry... but I overheard..."
"If you know the three girls, there's no problem, right?"
"I guess so, but..."
"We have two here, right?"
"No, Aerith! I can't have you get involved."
"Oh? So it's all right for Tifa to be in danger?"
"No, I don't want Tifa in...."
"Is it all right?"
"I grew up in the slums... I'm used to danger."
"Do you trust me?"
"Yes. Thanks, Ms. Aerith."
"Call me Aerith."
"He---y!!"
"It's time, ladies. The Don is waiting!"
"I told ya not to wander around... I tell ya, women nowadays..."
"Hurry up, will ya!"
"I probably don't need to ask but the other girl is..."
"Me...... right?"
You're right, there was no need..."
"...to ask."
(Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa enter the Don's room. He is seated at a desk,
with a flunky on either side.)
"All right, ladies!"
"Line up in front of the Don!"
"Hmmm! Good, splendid!"
(He jumps over his desk and checks out
Aerith.)
Don Corneo
"Now, let's see... Which girl
should I choose? Hmm--- hmm---!"
(He checks out Cloud, who tries to face
away.)
Don Corneo
"This one?"
Don Corneo
"Or this one?"
Don Corneo
"Woo-hoo, I've made up my mind!!"
"My choice for tonight is....."
"This little beauty!"
"Fu, fu, fu.... Be nice, Don."
"This slender little girl!"
"Don, you've got great taste."
"This healthy-looking girl!"
"Wa, wait a sec! I mean, uh, please wait a moment!"
"Woo-hoo!"
"I love chickies who play hard to get! Yeowza!"
"You can have the other ones!"
"Yes, sir! Thank you sir!"
"Well then, shall we go my pretty?"
Scene 18
- Lounge Chaos -
"Hey guys! We've got guests."
"We'll take REAL good care of you."
"This is all thanks to the big boss, Don Corneo!"
"Heey!! Three cheers for Don Corneo!"
"Heh, heh.... Well ladies, are we, uh, all ready?"
"Hey... what's wrong? Want me to keep you company?"
"No... I'm flattered, but no thanks."
"Because..."
"Because...?"
"Because..."
"I ain't INTERESTED in a buncha scrubs like you!"
"Wha.... a MAN!???"
"God damn it! You think you can get away with this! Get him!
Knock the crap out of him!!"
"Grr! C'mon, what's the matter with you good for nothings!?"
"All right now, COME ON! I'll show you how it's done!!"
"Cloud!!"
"Tifa!!"
***Cloud
You all right?
"Of course! If you take me lightly, you're gonna pay for it!!"
(Cloud is about to go in to the Don's room when Aerith screams from the
torture chamber.)
"No--!! Help!!"
"No-!!"
"Ha ha ha... Wait, you!"
(Cloud looks down. Kotch is comically chasing Aerith around in circles.
Aerith runs up the stairs and Kotch follows. When Aerith reaches Cloud,
she kicks Kotch in the crotch.)
"I'm so sorry!"
"oh, oh, oh...."
"heh, heh, heh..."
"Aerith!!"
***Cloud
You all right?
"I told you. I'm used to danger."
"To tell you the truth, my heart was pounding."
Scene 19
- Ecchi Don -
(Don Corneo and the girl he chose are sitting in his extravagantly and
tastelessly decorated bedroom. It smacks of 'Love Hotel'.)
"Woo-hoo!"
"Come, come, don't be so shy..."
"I know...."
"But you know, Don Corneo, I'd like you to explain something
before we start..."
"Hm? Oh, you mean about THAT?"
"Don't worry. I'm single. There, feel better now?"
"No... I'm not asking about that......"
"Wa... wait a minute! No, not yet!!"
"Come! Come!"
"Aooooooh!! I can't wait any longer! Here comes papa!!"
"Cloud!!"
(Don does a belly flop at Tifa. She hops out of the way, and Don comes
down face first.)
"Wha... what the hell? Who goes there?"
"You still don't get it do you, Don Corneo?"
"Get what?"
"Woo-hoo!"
"Come, come, don't be so shy..."
"Ye... yes..."
"But Mr. Don. I'd like you to explain something to me first..."
"Of course, my dear. I'll take you through it slowly, step by

"No, that's not what I meant!"
"NO, STOP! Just, wait a second!!"
"Come! Come!"
"Aoooooh!! I can't wait any longer! Here comes papa!!"
"Cloud!!"
(Don does a belly flop at Aerith. She hops out of the way, and Don comes
down face first.)
"Wha... what the hell? Who goes there!?"
"I'm sorry, Don."
"Get what?"
"Ahh, we're finally alone..."
"All right, pussycat... Come to daddy!"
"You're so cute, I never get tired of looking at you."
"Do you like me, too?"

Scene 20
- I'll Smash Them -
"Shut up, we're asking the questions now..."
"What did your assistants find out? Talk! If you don't tell
us..."
"...I'll chop them off."
"No! Not that! I'll talk! I'll tell you everything!"
"So... talk."
"...I made 'em find out where the man with the gun-arm was. But
that's what I was ordered to do."
"By who?"
"No--! If I told you that, I'd be killed!"
"Talk! If you don't tell us..."
"...I'll rip them off."
"Waaaaah--! It was Heidegger of Shinra!"
"Heidegger, the head of Public Safety Maintenance!"
"The head of Public Safety Maintenance?"
"Did you say the Shinra!? What are they up to!? Talk!"
"If you don't tell us..."
"I'll smash them."
"...You're serious, aren't you.... ...ohboy, ohboy, ohboy."
"... I'm not fooling around here either, you know."
"Shinra's trying to crush a small rebel group called AVALANCHE,
and want to infiltrate their hideout."
"And they're really going to crush them... literally."
"By breaking the support holding up the plate above them."
"Break the support!?"
"You know what's going to happen? The plate'll go PING"
"and everything's gonna go BAMMM!! I heard their hideout's in the
Sector 7 Slums..."
"I'm just glad it's not here in Sector 6."
"They're going to wipe out the Sector 7 Slums!?"
"Cloud, will you come with me to Sector 7?"
"Of course, Tifa."
"Just a second!"
"Shut up!"
"No wait, it'll only take a second."
"How do you think scum like me feels when they babble on about the
[truth?"
***Cloud
They've pretty much given up on life
"Buuzzzzz! Wrong!"
(He flips a switch and Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa fall through a trap door to
the sewer below...)
