Time after time when we're together
I tell you I love you now and forever
Your doing me wrong but there's nothing I can do
We've been through days when nothing would go right
In your arms your holding me so tight
Please won't you let me come into your heart
We would make love
Through rainy weather
Go to the movies and laugh together
Please won't you see girl what your doing to me
Chorus:
Girl, why don't you just understand
Why I've got to be your man
Why don't you let yourself go
Don't you know
Time after time my feelings are so hurt
It will take both of us to make our love work
I'll give you love if you just give me a chance
Once in your life see that this is real
Will it be pain and sorrow that I feel
If this is love won't you see it through my eyes
Remember the days when we would just hold hands
Holding and kissing in the warm sand
Those were the times when I knew you cared
Chorus
Oh girl, here I am dialing your number
Sometimes I really don't know how you feel about me
But i'm gonna let you know how I feel about you
Chorus
Time after time when we're together
I tell you I love you now and forever
Your doing me wrong but there's nothing I can do
