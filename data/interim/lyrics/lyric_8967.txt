Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side!
Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side!
I know you want us both and I know the reason why
I can give you so much lovin
But presents she can buy you
Last night you're in my arms
Tonight I'm all alone
How long 
Will this game go on?
How long? Oh, oh how long?
And it's plain, plain enough to see that
You're not the man for me
I can't keep playing games that keeps my heart in pain
I want to turn and walk away but it's harder to do
Than it is to say
Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side!
I betcha, I bet you got another
Yeah, you got a, a-got another lover!
I caught you, I caught you
I caught you with her twice!
I caught you, I caught you
I bet you treat her nice
Can she love you?
Can she love you like me?
Aww, can she love you?
Can she set you free?
I know you got another
Another chick on the side
It might hurt me for awhile but of one thing I am sure
I'll get over you, yes I'll find someone new
Each time I open up my heart
It seems to just get torn apart
Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side!
I just know you got a...
I know you got another
I know you got a, you got another lover
You got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side
I know, I know, I know you got a chick on the side
Can she love you? Can she love you like me?
Can she love you? Can she set you free?
I saw you, don't you try to hide
Don't hide it from me, no no no
I saw you, don't you try to hide
Don't hide it from me, no no no
You thought you would hide it, hide it
Hide it from me
