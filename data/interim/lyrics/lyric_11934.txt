You can have this dance with me
You can hold my hand
And whisper in my ear
Sweet words that I love to hear
Don't be shy
Just take your time
I'd like to get to know you
I'd like to make you mine
I've been waiting
Sitting here so patiently
For you to come over
And have this dance with me
And my number is
Beechwood four, five, seven, eight, nine
You can call me up and have a date any old time
Don't be shy
Just take your time
I'd like to get to know you
I'd like to make you mine
Beechwood four, five, seven, eight, nine
You can call me up and have a date any old time
Don't be shy
Just take your time
I'd like to get to know you
I'd like to make you mine
And my number is
Beechwood four, five, seven, eight, nine
You can call me up and have a date any old time
Beechwood four, five, seven, eight, nine
You can call me up and have a date any old time
