Oh, two lovers parked on lovers lane
Just a watchin' the stars above
They don't have to say a thing
They're speaking the language of love
Ooo-be do-be do-be doo
Ooo-be do-be do-be doo
Ooo-be do-be do-be doo-be-do-do
A-do-be-do-do-do-do
Oh, two lovers sipping on a chocolate shake
You can tell what they're thinking of
Their eyes are saying little secret things
They're using the language of love
Ooo-be do-be do-be doo
Ooo-be do-be do-be doo
Ooo-be do-be do-be doo-be-do-do
A-do-be-do-do-do-do
Oh, two lovers sitting in English class
Don't know what the teachers speaking of
Ain't learned no English but they're learning fast
The language of love
Ooo-be do-be do-be doo
Ooo-be do-be do-be doo
Ooo-be do-be do-be doo-be-do-do
A-do-be-do-do-do-do
Ooo-be do-be do-be doo-be-do-do
A-do-be-do-do-do-do
