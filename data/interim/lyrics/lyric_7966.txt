I found the love you threw away
Now you realize you made a mistake
But now she's mine and we're doing fine
You can't steal her love, no use in trying
Your eyes may shine, your teeth may grit
But none of this good lovin' are you gonna get
Finders keepers, losers weepers
I found the love you lost and I'm gonna keep her
Finders keepers, losers weepers
I found the love you lost and I'm gonna keep her
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
This woman's love is super fine
Lord knows I'm glad I made her mine
You treat her bad, you know you made her sad
Now you realize the good thing you had
But it's too late, don't even try
Never gonna give her up and I ain't lying
Finders keepers, losers weepers
I found the love you lost and I'm gonna keep her
Finders keepers, losers weepers
I found the love you lost and I'm gonna keep her
Your eyes may shine, your teeth may grit
But none of this good lovin' are you gonna get, whoa
Finders keepers, losers weepers
I found the love you lost and I'm gonna keep her, hey, hey
Finders keepers, losers weepers
I found the love you lost and I'm gonna keep her
