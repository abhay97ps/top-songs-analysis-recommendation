You take me down, spin me around
You got me running all the lights
Don't make a sound, talk to me now
Let me inside your mind
I don't know what you're thinking, sugar, ooh
But I just got that feeling, sugar, ooh
I can hear the sirens burning
Red lights turning
I can't turn back now
So hold on tight
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Show me your soul, I gotta know
Bet that you're beautiful inside
Toes on the gas, car moving fast
Come take the wheel and drive
I don't know what you're thinking, sugar, ooh yeah
And I just got that feeling, sugar, ooh yeah
I can hear the sirens burning
Red lights turning
I can't turn back now
So hold on tight
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
Come on baby
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
