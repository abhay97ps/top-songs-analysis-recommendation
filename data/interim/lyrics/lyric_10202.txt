I reminisce bout the time when cats was making good raps
Back when rapping was about living off scraps
The birth of a child on the 8th of October
Today’s rap game is drunk, I’m just tryna make it sober
Common said it best when he said “I sed to love H.E.R.”
It’s about to get real so I suggest you find some cover
Take it back to the days with the Flash and the Message
Finding real rap today, pulling survivors outta wreckage
It’s hard to be reborn when you were never in the game
Yet you still sell more records than real rappers,  it’s a shame
Y’all taking hip hop and running in the wrong direction
I’m just hoping to help out with the resurrection
Proud to be part of the hip hop nation
But I’m kinda getting bored of commercialization
“Give me that late 80s early 90s old school”
Man Paid in Full was just so cool
A Tribe Called Quest was a real crew
Seems today’s rappers bit off more than they could chew
Is it just me or have things gone awry?
And sucker emcees tryna pass me by
So give me the mic, and let me spit it
This for today’s rappers being omitted
Just tryna give respect, where respect’s due
While I reminisce over you, my god
Now I’m not saying the game is completely dead today
Be a Fiasco if I didn’t praise my man Lupe
Just one of the few cats who keep it real like Nas
Can’t forget Talib Kweli with the Gravitas
Kick it to The Roots with the strong foundation
Tip still keeping it going for the Zulu Nation
And my man Shad K is like no other
If the rap game were a test, he’d pass with Flying Colours
And K’naan not afraid, to make rap jealous
Have me reminiscing of the days with the Fugees Zealots
Same Love got us fighting for our civil rights
Like 2Pac brought the war on poverty to light
Need more rappers who’re aware socially
Time to fight the power like we from Public Enemy
Still got love for mister Bobby Ray
But I like your more conscious B.o.B., Bombs Away
K.R.I.T. told me not to run with the crowds
If you wanna be heard than you gotta be loud
Missing the days of storytelling like La Di Da Di
Now guys just rap about a new Bugatti
Show me a rapper who is crazy enough to be
Conscious, not what society wants to see
Go On and On like, Erykah Badu
While I reminisce over you
I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of wayback, so many bear witness to greatness
Tired of every rap song being all about joints
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the R the O-Y, where would this song be
Without Rock and Smooth letting me use this beat
Cuz not enough people notice what I’m describing, see
The rap game getting killed by the industry
So let’s get the game back to where it is
Quit making it all about showbiz
Mainstream screaming like, “we want you to please us”
Industry in our pockets, only tryna squeeze us
I strive to be live cuz I got no choice
Take a minute to hear more than just my voice
Hope that my words, stick like glue
Till then, I reminisce over you
