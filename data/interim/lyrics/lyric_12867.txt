Lights out, aha
Blast, blast, blast
Lights out, aha
Blast, blast, blast
Lights out
Dancing in the dark
To the radio of love
Dancing in the dark
To the radio of love
I know that it's wrong
To be dancing with no lights on
And I know that it's wrong
To be holding you for so long
And for the of the night
I'll be holding you tight
So tight
Dancing in the dark
To the radio of love
Lights out, aha
Dancing in the dark
To the radio of love
Lights out, aha
Oh, what can I do
All I need is to dance with you
And turn the lights down some more
We're the only ones left on the floor
Let the music play
I want to hold you this way
Girl, stay
Dancing in the dark
To the radio of love
Lights out, aha
Dancing in the dark
To the radio of love
Lights out, aha
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, holding you, girl
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, baby please
Lights out, aha
Blast, blast, blast
Lights out, aha
Blast, blast, blast
Lights out
Dancing in the dark
To the radio of love
Lights out, aha
Dancing in the dark
To the radio of love
Lights out, aha
Dance, dance, dance
Radio of love
Oooh, girl, in the dark
Shine on, love
Oooh, girl, in the dark
Oooooh, aah baby
Oooh, girl, in the dark
