I can't wait any longer
Baby, I mean I can't wait any longer
Mm, I gotta have you
I gotta know how it is to touch you
To hold you
To feel you
Our lives have touched
Our minds have touched
And I can't wait any longer for our bodies to touch
Our souls to touch
I can't wait any longer
This feeling's gettin' stronger
Satisfy my hunger
You're the only one who can
Where do I have to go? 
What do I have to do? 
Who do I have to lie to? 
So I can lie with you
I can't wait any longer
Patience has never been one of my virtues
Baby, when I want something, I want it now
And I want you now
I wanna kiss you now
I wanna love you now
I can't wait any longer
This feeling's gettin' stronger
Satisfy my hunger
You're the only one who can
Where do I have to go? 
What do I have to do? 
Who do I have to lie to? 
So I can lie with you
I can't wait any longer
I can't wait, I can't wait, doo-doo-doo
Baby, I can't wait any longer
I want you now
Mm, now, yeah
I can't wait, I can't wait, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
I can't wait, I can't wait, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
