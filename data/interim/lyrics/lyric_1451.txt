Don't cry, baby, don't cry, sugar
Dry your eyes
And let's be sweethearts again
Because you know
You know I didn't mean
To ever treat you so mean
Right now, oh, yeah
Come on, honey
Let's try it all over
One more time
Oh, don't cry, don't cry, baby
Don't cry, don't cry
Honey, oh, dry your eyes
And let's be, come on
Let's be sweethearts again
Oh, oh, oh, because you know
You know I didn't mean
To ever, ever, oh
Treat you so mean right now
Right now, oh, yeah
Come on, baby
And I wonder can I be
Your sweetheart one more time
Right now, right now
Oh, I said don't cry
Oh, honey, don't cry, baby
Don't cry, don't cry, sugar
Oh, right now
Dry your little eyes
Oh, oh, and let me be
Your little cookie one more time
Right now, yeah, yeah
Oh, I said don't cry, don't cry, baby
Ooh, don't cry, don't cry, sugar
Oh yeah, don't cry
