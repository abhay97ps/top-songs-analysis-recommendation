Young nigga win, win, win, win , how can I lose? 
Uh, how can I lose? , uh, how can I lose?

Me and Trav' in a coupe , paparazzi, we switch the route 
Yeah, see your bitch gettin' loose, huh
I'm in LA with the views, huh , I'm in LA with your boo 
We on the quest with the tribe 
It's way too late, pick a side 
Jack make them boys come alive 
Better not fuck up the vibe 
Runnin' this shit with a stride
You know my gang the flyest
I'm with the gang, gang, gang, gang, BOYS hoppin' out of coupes 
I'm switching' lanes tryna maintain, duckin' boys in the blue 
I see you holdin' out on my change, I'm needin' all of the loot 
When I'm ridin' off on my side, best believe I got the scoop 
I could make a hundred right now, give it all to the troops 
Whole squad got the juice , send a stain like a flute 
Whole squad goin' up, JACKBOYS on the loose 
In the H, reppin' Screw 
Flamin' Harlem with the goons 
We was wildin', skippin' school 
Now we can go make the 
Now we can go make the millions, Trinidad my crew
Cactus Jack on my shoe
And this shit
I came from the mud, straight to the top 
Shooters outside double parked
I'm from New York, she like how I talk
She need an ass, it's bought
Came to my chambers, we went wild
Drove the bitch crazy, gave 'em all miles
I'm with young Jacques, know it's goin' down
Smokin' that Jack, get it by the pound 
Don't need the pussy, I'm in and I'm out 
But I'm still smokin' that loud
Hit my hoes when I'm in town 
They know who got the Scouts 
I'm with the gang, gang, gang, gang, BOYS hoppin' out of coupes 
I'm switching' lanes tryna maintain, duckin' boys in the blue 
I see you holdin' out on my change, I'm needin' all of the loot 
When I'm ridin' off on my side, best believe I got the scoop 
I could make a hundred right now, give it all to the troops
Whole squad got the juice, send a stain like a flute 
Whole squad goin' up, JACKBOYS on the loose
Yeah, I'm from the North where they robbin' and killin' 
Young nigga rich, but I'm still from the trenches 
Luxury Tax, my water by G
P-I-R-U, bitch, I bang what I bleed
I'm passin' out pills, I'ma geek up the VIP 
One shot to the head and make sure he don't miss
I fuck on the bitch, have her stalkin' on Fifth
Still pourin' up Act', they say it don't exist 
Fifth got some vibes at the crib
Like, "I wanna fuck right now"
Keep hundred on hundreds for real
Bitch, I'm goin' up right now
Bitch rollin' some weed, you know gang in the stu'
Bottles on bottles, 1942
Models on models, this shit nothin' new
You might catch some shots takin' shots at the crew
I like my hoes by the two
Blew 800K on a coupe 
We fucked, it wasn't nothin' else to do 
You play with La Flame, I'ma shoot 
This a hundred round drum, I got mob ties
This a double M truck, ain't no broke vibes
Now we only take jets for the hard times
Know I call up them killers, they gon' slide
Bitch, I'm with the gang
I'm with the gang, gang, gang, gang, BOYS hoppin' out of coupes 
I'm switching' lanes tryna maintain, duckin' boys in the blue 
I see you holdin' out on my change, I'm needin' all of the loot 
When I'm ridin' off on my side, best believe I got the scoop 
I could make a hundred right now, give it all to the troops
Whole squad got the juice , send a stain like a flute 
Whole squad goin' up, JACKBOYS on the loose
