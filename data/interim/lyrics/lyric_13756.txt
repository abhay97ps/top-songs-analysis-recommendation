In the 21st century, you can dance
Get your feet off the ground if you can jump
And if you believe then you can fly
If a man can dream, then he can defy
Hit it, gravity
Yeah, huh, ow, horns
Wait a minute, look here
Gravity, the big G
G-R-A-V-I-T-Y
Gravity, say it
Gotten a hold on me, huh
For the third verse, the sun
I've been trying to get the funky job done
Pull myself up and work that funk
Don't listen to the wrong honky tonk
Just say it
You got no sense, you dance too fast
You burn all night, you'll never last
If every man can dream he can defy
G-R-A-V-I-T-Y
Gravity, wow, big G
G-R-A-V-I-T-Y
Gravity, ha
G-R-A-V-I-T-Y
Wait a minute
Small town or big city
There's a fat cat there sitting pretty
Watch me break out in a cold sweat
Jump back in, you ain't seen nothing yet
You shake it up, you dance too fast
Make it real, make it last
If every man can dream then he can defy
G-R-A-V-I-T-Y
Big G, let loose, let loose
Hey, gravity, the big G
G-R-A-V-I-T-Y, say it
Gravity, gotten a hold on me
Leit me explain
If you can dream then you can fly
G-R-A-V-I-T-Y
If you can love, then you can defy, ow
G-R-A-V-I-T-Y 
Gravity, the big G 
Gravity, ha, the big G
What they told me, ha
Gravity, the big G
G-R-A-V-I-T-Y, say it 
Gravity, good god
Gotten a hold on me, won't let go of me
Gravity, ha, the big G
Ow, hit me! 
Gravity, gotten a hold on me
Wait a minute, hit it, Fred
Got 20 G's, going up
We got 40 G's, yeah
Release the pressure over there
Push a button, man, ha
Got 60 G's, yeah
Hey Sam, push a button
Sell the G's, yeah
We got 80 G's, 90, a hundred, oh
Big G 
Gravity, what they throwing me

Gravity, say it, and we'll get funky
Gravity, yeah
Everybody say it now 
Gravity, ha
