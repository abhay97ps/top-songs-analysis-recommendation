Love is a flower that blooms in the spring time
Beneath the light of the moon in the spring time
We're grooving together like two turtle doves
Since I met you baby, everything's coming up love
Everything's coming up love baby
Love is a song in the breeze in the spring time
Sung by the birds and the bees in the spring time
Loves overflowing, blue skies above, rains are withholding
'Cause everything's coming up love
Everything's coming up love baby, love love, love, love
In the spring time
In the spring time
Girl if you're thinking what I'm thinking of
Bells could be ringin'
'Cause everything's coming up love
Ooh baby yes it is
Everything's coming up love
Everything's coming up love, love love, love
Everything's coming up love
Everything's coming up love, love love, love
Everything's coming up love
Everything's coming up love, love love, love
