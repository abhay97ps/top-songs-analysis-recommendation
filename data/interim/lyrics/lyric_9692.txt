Long Time
It's been such a long time
I think I should be goin', yeah
And time doesn't wait for me
It keeps on rollin'
Sail on, on a distant highway, yeah
I've got to keep on chasin' a dream
I've gotta be on my way
Wish there was something I could say
 I'm just movin' on
You'll forget about me after I've been gone
 I don't want no more
It's just outside of your front door
Ah yeah yeah yeah
It's been such a long time
It's been such a long time
Well, I get so lonely
When I am without you
But in my mind, deep in my mind
I can't forget about you
Good times, and faces that remind me, yeah
I'm tryin' to forget your name
And leave it all behind me
You're comin' back to find me
 I'm just movin' on
You'll forget about me after I've been gone
 I don't want no more
It's just outside of your front door
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
It's been such a long time
It's been such a long time
Yeah!
It's been such a long time
I think I should be goin', yeah
And time doesn't wait for me
It keeps on rollin'
There's a long road, I've gotta stay in time with, yeah
I've got to keep on chasin' that dream
Though I may never find it
I'm always just behind it
 I'm just movin' along
 Hey, just movin' along
 Takin' my time
 Yeah
