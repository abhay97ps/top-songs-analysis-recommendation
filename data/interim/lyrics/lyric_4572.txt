What am I living for
If not for you
What am I living for
If not for you
What am I living for
If not for you
Oh, nobody else
Nobody else will do
What am I longing for
Each lonely night
To feel your lips with mine
And hold you tight
You'll be my little girl
My whole life through
Baby, nobody else 
Nobody else will do
I want you close to me
That's all I know
I want you all the time
Cause darling I love you so
What am I living for
If not for you
What am I living for
If not for you
What am I living for
If not for you
Oh, nobody else 
Nobody else will do
Oh, nobody else 
Nobody else will do
Baby, nobody else
Nobody else will do
