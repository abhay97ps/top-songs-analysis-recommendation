Baby, you're my heart's desire
Your love sets my soul on fire
You're my type
You're my kind
You're always on my mind
You're my heart's desire
When the sun come up in the mornin'
You're the first thing, baby, on my mind
When the sun go down in the evenin'
You're the last thing, baby, on my mind
Baby, you're my heart's desire
Your love sets my soul on fire
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
There ought to be a law against the way
You turn me on, baby, night and day
I hear your voice, but you're not there
I see your face, baby, everywhere
Baby, you're my heart's desire
Your love sets my soul on fire, yeah
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, you're my heart's desire
Your love sets my soul on fire
You're my type

You're always on my mind
You're my heart's desire
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't know why I love you so
But I know that I'll never let you go
Don't know why I need your love so bad
But you're the only love I've ever had
Baby, you're my heart's desire
Your love sets my soul on fire
You're my type
You're my kind
You're always on my mind
Baby, you're my heart's desire
Your love sets my soul on fire
You're my type
You're my kind
You're always on my mind
