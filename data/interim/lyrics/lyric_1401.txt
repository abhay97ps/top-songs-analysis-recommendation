We do amazing on the regular
I guess you gotta roll with it
A bunch of data on the cellular
Homey I think you should roll with it
New York where I come from, YO where my head lay
Bring me the word I’m like Damu, I gotta do what the red say
Making sure that my head low faith high and walk right
A black man life reverse full count got your two balls and three strikes
But bump that student of the game believe I learn my lesson
Never star struck I feel right at home whoever I’m addressing
All my fam know what it is and all my enemies is guessing
Never nothing on my chest, I never front I know I’m blessed but I digress
Dudes be play timing, double vision no split screen
Tryna playoff that he really on his eighth seed like a Knick team
And my team good, torch ours, flame on and it burn mean
Y’all feeling it is like us waiting for a stop sign to turn green
Bump that we control the hood without your affirmation
Pumping light into the night homey with no collaboration
So I work 8 days of the week with no exaggeration
And I grind til my fortune cookie say congratulations oh my God!

Homey I think you should roll with it
Because I do this, homey understand me that I do this
Crucify me cause I’m ready for the kisses of you Judas
And I promise you won't break til the day Jehovah take me
Eat impossible for breakfast tell me what have you done lately, I go hard
When its time to construct the rhyme is like when lava erupts, they’re hot enough to make thermometers bust
The subject matter in my verses be weighty, like the iron Scott Steiner would pump
Rappers wanna keep your mind in the dump, so they on their records lying they suck
But if the truth started selling records boy they couldn’t blow with their sinuses stuffed
When I get my rhyme on I’m a time bomb and the seconds on the timer are up
I will combust then all of your idols get crushed, I shine like a diamonds that buffed
Here's the secret to shine I rely on a spirit that's beyond all of us
God interrupts then he's guiding the thrust of my pen and he's filling my mind till it floods
I'm no superstar. To be honest I'm actually stupid y'all
If I try on my own it be super hard so that's proof the bars are a move of God
When I step aside and let Yeshua drive he inspires lyrics that renew the mind
He will take you deeper than a Scuba dive and then pick you up like an uber drive oh
Lord!

Jungle gym and got the words flippin’, got them in my like oh woah
Michael Jack with fatigues and timbs moon walkin’ in slow mo
I got peace I got joy I smile in all of my photos
But His grace don’t stop with me, it could save you too Bono!
I ain't really wanna do this, I was chilling in the cut tryna seek a little grace little peace
Trials that I face don’t sleep, so how can I rest knowing death tryna pray on me
Straight to the point swagger Johnson, cooking up like I was Action Bronson
Blacking out like that’s unconscious with a truth deeper than Toni Braxton stop it
Woah woah woah woah I’m like let me be honest
See I got a boat load of those flows but if I boast than that will be Godless
Lord have mercy on me I’m a sinner and I know it
I get urges when that beat hit just to get all braggadocious uh
I hear a lot of Christian rappers doing it its all up in they music and I know it ain't right Lord
I just wanna punch em’ in the face and I be in the gym training like a UFC fight for it
I repent of that, let me get it back I be thinking like Lord have mercy
Popping off like gigi gack with a fitted cap with God and can't no man hurt me Gone!
