You gotta believe there is something inside of me
You might say, "How could you so fast"
Is the way you make me feel like you understand
There is a way I can meet your demand, girl 'cause
If you see the sun in my eyes
It should be as no surprise
It's the light of love inside of me
Now tell me what do you see
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
I know it's hard to see how I feel this way
I just don't have control of my heart
And if you feel what I feel and you wanna stay
Just give me a sign, girl, and we'll never part
And if you see the sun in my eyes
It should be as no surprise
It's the light of love inside of me
Now tell me what do you see
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
You gotta believe there is something inside of me
You might say, "How could you so fast"
Is the way you makin' me feel like you understand
'Cause there is a way I can meet your demand, girl 'cause
If you see the sun in my eyes
It should be as no surprise
It's the light of love inside of me
Now tell me what do you see
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes 
In my eyes
