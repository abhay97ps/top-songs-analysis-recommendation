You've got me swingin' on a rainbow
Walkin' around in the rain
Playin' with the raindrops
I'm doin' flip flops
Look what one kiss can do
You've got me warm in the winter
Cold on a summery day
Never know the reason
Heart's out of season
Look at what one kiss dan do
Never thought that I would fall
Love was not for me
I wanted to be just a roamin' lover
Happy and careless, always to be free
You've got me, hook, line and sinker
Just like a fish on a hook
You better pull the line in
Baby, I can't win
Look what one kiss can do
I only want to just be careless and free
And I never thought that
You would fall in love with me
You've got me, hook, line, and sinker
Just like a fish on a hook
You better pull the line in
Baby, I can't win
I've got it bad
And I feel so glad
Just look what one...
Just look what one...
Just look what one kiss can do
