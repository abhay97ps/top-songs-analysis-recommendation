21
I feel like the motherfuckin' Grim Reaper
The biggest smoke blower
Put a motherfuckin' chimney on my stick
Brand new MAK-90 with the drum attached 
You a shit talker, we got drums for that 
Tryna fist fight? Boy, you dumb for that 
You gon' get a bullet in your lung for that 
Draco get to kickin' like Liu Kang 
F&N on me in the Mulsanne 
Glock 19 in the Blue Flame 
I was strapped when I slid inside your boo thang 
21 immortal, we'll never die 
Loyal to my brothers , I'll never lie 
Call me bird dog 'cause I cheat and I'm fly 
And I love winnin', I'm upset if it's a tie 
Get you off the ground just to knock you to the floor 
Let's go blow for blow , let's go toe to toe 
When it's time to battle, they don't never ever show 
When it's time to battle, I'm the first one at the door 
At the door with a Draco
Don't nobody move, I don't wanna have to blow
Rappin' ass niggas get spinned at they show
That's why I need some help, I got a fetish for the smoke
It get fatal in the bottom, used to rumble in the den 
Hit him with a combo, gotta finish him 
AK make you frown since you think you wanna grin 
Seems like all the models just be fallin' in my DM's 
Coolant on the TEC, it get hot like Scorpion 
I'll burn his ass, lil' buster
You thought it was straight, I got some chemicals in this magazine
I'll perm his ass 
Wanna be a gangster, but he misguided 
I'll learn his ass 
He went against me and they called 9-1-1 
They had to infirm' his ass 
"How many tops you done got popped?" Whole bunch
"How many times you ran from the smoke?" Nigga, not once
Eastside nigga fuckin' all the hoes, and I love guns
Ain't no fucking diamonds in my mouth, nigga, these gold fronts
And we known to handle all the business, nigga, ASAP
Had her at the slaughterhouse, how the fuck you cape that?
Ain't no body shots, nigga, you know I told him face that
Now he in the ocean, heard they hit him in his wave cap
You took your shot and you missed it 
I just beat it up and you kissed it 
Took the rap game and I milked it 
Took the rap beef and I killed it
Neck all froze like Sub Zero, dawg 
He wifed a thot, he a hero, dawg 
All I care about is my dinero, dawg 
Only thing I'm chasing is dineros, dawg 
Dread-headed killer like Cyrax 
Brought a gun to a fist fight like Jax 
Nah, fuck that, only thing scare me is a rat 
Slaughter Gang, pick your poison, dagger or the axe 
Stand-up guy, they respect my mind 
If you foul out, get a tech', my nine 
If you ain't a hundred, don't text my line 
If you know you hatin', don't check my Live 
You know I'm Slaughter Gang so the smoke is immortal
Ain't nothin' changed, I'll slaughter your daughter
She said she was a dime, but her friend was a quarter
I had a threesome, then I flushed the rubber down the toilet
She tried to give me head, it was boring
Codeine got a nigga snoring
I wonder if she would've slept with the poor me
Savage keep a Draco and it corn beef
Chopper cut you up like Kitana 
My chopper in the band, it's a drummer 
Russell Westbrook, I was strikin' like the Thunder 
You was somewhere runnin' 'round whinin' to your mama 
Y'all play conservative, we gon' send a blitz 
I'm the type to catch a tech', foul, hit him in his shit 
He think he a made man, hit him in the head 
Don't you try to run now, hit him in the leg 
People wanna say the stuff I say, but they be scared 
Jab turn a lightskin pretty boy red 
It's a fatality if you try to handle me 
Real top shotta, don't you ever try to ramp with me 
Got enough bullets that could kill your whole camp with me 
I was bad as hell in school, they even tried to counsel me 
I don't like to talk, don't you try to tongue-wrestle me 
And my block good, you'll never get the best of me 
You know I'm Slaughter Gang so the smoke is immortal
Ain't nothin' changed, I'll slaughter your daughter
She said she was a dime, but her friend was a quarter
I had a threesome, then I flushed the rubber down the toilet
She tried to give me head, it was boring
Codeine got a nigga snoring
I wonder if she would've slept with the poor me
Savage keep a Draco and it corn beef
