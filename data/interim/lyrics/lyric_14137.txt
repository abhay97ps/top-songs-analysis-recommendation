Empty rooms without a view
And empty space to see it through
Blow by blow my first mistake
Fast hearts begin to make
You never said that you'd change your mind
Never said you could
You never said that you'd need me back
If it's love you want
Let the feeling go
Follow your heart
So the story goes
If there's time for us
Maybe heaven knows
Love will return
So the story goes
I love you
Moving clouds, fading grey
Slid through, another day
Passion runs, where passion kills
Clouding up, those diamond towns
You never said that you'd change your mind
Never said you could
You never said that you'd need me back
If it's love you want
Let the feeling go
Follow your heart
So the story goes
If there's time for us
Maybe heaven knows
Love will return
So the story goes
I love you
So the story goes
You never said that you'd change your mind
Never said you could
You never said that you'd need me back
If it's love you want
Let the feeling go
Follow your heart
So the story goes
If there's time for us
Maybe heaven knows
Love will return
So the story goes
I love you
If it's love you want
Let the feeling go
That's how the story goes
If it's love you want
Let the feeling go
That's how the story goes
If it's love you want
Let the feeling go
That's how the story goes
If it's love you want
Let the feeling go
How the story goes
If it's love you want
Let the feeling go
How the story goes
If it's love you want
Let the feeling go
If it's love you want
