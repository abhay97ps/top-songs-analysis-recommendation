Everyone's looking for something real
Everyone's taking all they can steal
Brother to sister
Look at each other
Face to face
There's something missing here in this human race, hey
Inside me
Is a part of you
And I know inside you
Is a part of me
Yeah
Person to person
Place to place
We run from each other
Lost in the race
Brother to sister
Hold on to each other with all we got
Our time is coming if you're ready or not
If you're ready or not, oh
Gimme something real
Gimme something real
Inside you
Is a part of me
Yeah, yeah
Brother to sister
Hold on to each other with all we got
Our time is coming, oh
If you're ready or not
If you're ready or not, oh
Gimme something real
Something real
Inside you
Make a world where we can feel
We will always be together
Something real
Inside you
Is a part of me
