You're not supposed to say the word "cancer" in a song
And telling folks Jesus is the answer can rub them wrong
It is not hip to sing about tractors, trucks, little towns, and mama, yeah that might be true
But this is country music and we do
Do you like to drink a cold one on the weekend and get a little loud
Do you want to say I'm sorry or I love you but you don't know how?
Do you wish somebody had the nerve to tell that stupid boss of yours
To shove it next time he yells at you?
Well this is country music and we do
So turn it on, turn it up, and sing along
This is real; this is your life in a song
Yeah this is country music
Are you haunted by the echo of your mother on the phone
Crying as she tells you that your brother is not coming home?
And if there's anyone that still has pride and the memory of those
That died defending the old red, white, and blue
This is country music and we do
So turn it on, turn it up, and sing along
This is real; this is your life in a song
Just like a road that takes you home
Yeah this is right where you belong
This is country music
This is country music
