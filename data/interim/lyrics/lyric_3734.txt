I met him at the place
Where we always meet
He put his arms around me
He smiled
And when I told him
I didn't love him anymore
He cried 
And when I told him
His kisses were not like before
He cried 
I knew that our romance was over and done
But for him it had just begun
And when I told him
Another boy had caught my eye
He cried 
And when I kissed him
A kiss that only meant goodbye
He cried
When I told him 
When I kissed him goodbye 
Like a baby 
Oh my Lord, what have I done? 
When I told him...
