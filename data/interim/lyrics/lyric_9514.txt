Uh
And she dance to the song 
She my sunshine, I ain't never comin' home 
Ooh, she dance to the song 
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Money on the table 
Perfect like Eve but I'm no Abel 
She make the crowd go, "Ooh," she smooth
Money on the table 
Sweet like fruit but I'm no Abel 
She make the crowd go, "Ooh," she smooth
Dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
She want it to rain so I throw these bands up
Dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
I don't want nobody but you 
GPS, my pimpin', baby, fuck with me tonight
I won't lead you wrong, won't you let me in your life? 
All this ice I'm rockin', you know I can't wait in line
I got all this money but don't have a lot of time
Money stacked up too high, ain't no way I'm fallin' off 
All these wolves we brought out, she like "I'll just follow y'all"
I just came to ball out, I make these bitches have withdrawal
She say every time she see me that she hittin' the mall 
Dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
She want it to rain so I throw these bands up
Dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
I don't want nobody but you 
Big boy business, came up independent
Straight up out the trenches, add it up 
This lil' bitch, she bad as fuck 
Money make her get nasty, yeah 
I'ma let her ride passenger
All the dope boys won't fuck on her
Killin' these hoes, it's a massacre
Every time she pull up, fuck it up
Heard you fell in love with a trafficker 
Love when we fuck, it's rough as fuck
She snuck in that Derringer
Don't run up on us, don't try your luck
Broke niggas keep tryin' her 
But they gon' have to step it up 
Rich niggas keep flyin' her
So it's gettin' hard to keep in touch
And she dance to the song 
She my sunshine, I ain't never comin' home 
Ooh, she dance to the song 
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Money on the table 
Perfect like Eve but I'm no Abel 
She make the crowd go, "Ooh," she smooth
Money on the table 
Sweet like fruit but I'm no Abel 
She make the crowd go, "Ooh," she smooth
Dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
She want it to rain so I throw these bands up
Dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
I don't want nobody but you
Dirty dancer, dirty dancer
She wanted to throw these bands up
Dirty dancer, dirty dancer
I don't want nobody
