Party, funky party
Party, funky party
Uh, ahh, uh, ahh
Uh, ahh, uh, ahh
There's this place I know
Way across town, yeah, yeah
Where everyone, everyone, yeah
Specialize in getting on down
And they call it
Something like this
Party, funky party
Party, funky party
There's always a smile
On everyone's face
And when you walk
Through that door
You know, you know
You got the right place
And you hear some sound like
Uh, ahh, uh, ahh
Uh, ahh, uh, ahh
Party, funky party, yeah
Party, funky party
Party, funky party
Party, funky party
Party, we had a funky party
Party, funky party
