You would've never learned the words to "Amazing Grace"
Never felt the chill of a pew when you lost faith
Well, blood, sweat, and tears wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't strike out a couple hundred times
If you never hit rock bottom, never cussed the sky
You would've never known to ask the good Lord why
Or ever changed your life
If you never had hard days
If you never had a heartbreak
Never had more than you can take
Or carried the weight
Of life on your shoulders
Would you feel like you earned it?
Would you live with a purpose?
Or ever known your own strength
If you never had hard days?
You wouldn't know what it's like to dance in the rain
Never see the silver lining when the skies go gray
You wouldn't know a dream come true from a few that don't
You'd never find your way on a broken road
If you never had hard days
If you never had a heartbreak
Never had more than you can take
Or carried the weight
Of life on your shoulders
Would you feel like you earned it?
Would you live with a purpose?
Or ever known your own strength
If you never had, if you never had
The downs and scuffs, the scars, the ruts
And all you put behind you
When the wins, the ups, the rise aboves
Are right there to remind you
If you never had hard days
If you never had a heartbreak
Never had more than you can take
Or carried the weight
Of life on your shoulders
Would it feel like you earned it?
Would you live with a purpose?
Or ever known your own strength
If you never had
If you never had hard days?
Yeah, if you never had hard days
Mmm
