The tears that you're starting to cry are no good
'Cause you know I loved you much better than anybody would
And it was understood
That I wouldn't be staying around a long time
You knew that someday I'd wake up, baby
And I'd find somebody further down the line
I'm the son of a lovin' man
My daddy told me get you all the lovin' you can
And I can
Cause I-I'm the son
I'm the son, son
I'm the son, son
I'm the son, son, son of a lovin' man
My daddy before me told me
That his daddy before him told him
Never wait around and never settle down
Cause there are too many women who will hold on tight
To a lovin' man who will come along and treat them right
But you got to leave with the morning light
I'm the son of a lovin' man
My daddy told me get you all the lovin' you can
And I can
Cause I-I'm the son
I'm the son, son
I'm the son, son
I'm the son, son, son of a lovin' man
So don't get upset 'cause I'm going away
Goodbye's the one word that I never say
Cause you know that I'm coming back again sometime
Cause I-I'm the son
I'm the son, son
I'm the son, son
I'm the son, son, son of a lovin' man
I'm the son of a lovin' man
My daddy told me get you all the lovin' you can 
I'm the son of a lovin' man
My daddy told me get you all the lovin' you can
I'm the son of a lovin' man
My daddy told me get you all the lovin' you can
