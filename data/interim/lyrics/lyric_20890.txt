I've had a little bit too much, much 
All of the people start to rush 
A dizzy twister dance, can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone 
What's goin' on, on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember, but it's alright, a-alright
Just dance
Gonna be okay, da-da-doo-doot-n
Just dance
Spin that record, babe, da-da-doo-doot-n
Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance
Just, j-j-just dance
Wish I could shut my playboy mouth 
How'd I turn my shirt inside out? 
Control your poison, babe, roses have thorns, they say
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight 
What's goin' on, on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember, but it's alright, a-alright
Just dance
Gonna be okay, da-da-doo-doot-n
Just dance
Spin that record, babe, da-da-doo-doot-n
Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance
Just, j-j-just
When I come through on the dance floor, checking out that catalogue 
Can't believe my eyes, so many women without a flaw
And I ain't gon' give it up, steady, tryna pick it up like a call
I'mma hit it, I'mma beat it up, latch onto it until tomorrow, yeah
Shorty, I can see that you got so much energy
The way you twirlin' up them hips 'round and 'round
And there is no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime, stay, let me watch you break it down and
Dance
Gonna be okay, da-da-doo-doot-n 
Just dance 
Spin that record, babe, da-da-doo-doot-n
Just dance 
Gonna be okay, da-da-doo-doot-n 
Just dance 
Spin that record, babe, da-da-doo-doot-n
Just dance 
Gonna be okay, da-da-da-dance 
Dance, dance 
Just, j-j-just dance 
Incredible
Amazing
Music
Woo!
Let's go!
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic, got my blueprint, it's symphonic
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic, got my blueprint, electronic
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic, got my blueprint, it's symphonic
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic, got my blueprint, electronic
Go, use your muscle, carve it out, work it, hustle
Don't slow, drive it, clean it, Lysol, bleed it
Spend the last dough  in your pock-o 
Just dance
Gonna be okay, da-da-doo-doot-n
Just dance
Spin that record, babe, da-da-doo-doot-n
Just dance 
Gonna be okay, da-da-doo-doot-n
