Superman, Superman, Superman
And there you go pickin' on me again
Pushin me to the very end
Tellin me to move another mountain
Well just cause you can walk on water
That ain't no sign I can
You know your mama should have named you Superman
Superman, Superman, Superman
Now lets go through this one more time
You do your thing and I'll do mine
Well, honey, baby
We got to draw the line
Cause your hang-up is a messin' with mine
All I can do is the best I can to change the way
That you can't stand
And if it ain't good enough for superman
He ain't good enough for me...
Superman, Superman, Superman
So you don't have to rub it in
Just cause your right and I'm wrong again
Sometimes right is just as wrong as wrong is
And I ain't never gonna learn to make it rain
And I wouldn't if I could for all the wool in Spain
So you go right ahead and do it, do it Superman
Superman, Superman, Superman
Now let's go through this one more time
You do your thing and I'll do mine
Well, honey baby
We got to draw the line
Cause your hang-up is a messin with mine
All I can do is the best I can
To change the way that you can't stand
And if it ain't good enough for superman
He ain't good enough for me...
