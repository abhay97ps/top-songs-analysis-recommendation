And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunt my reverie, and I am once again with you
When our love was new and each kiss an inspiration
Whoa, but that was long ago
Now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
Beside a garden wall when stars are bright, you are in my arms
The nightingale tells it's fairytale of paradise where roses grew
Though I dream in vain, in my heart it always will remain
My stardust melody, the memory of love refrain
Sometimes I wonder
Why I spend the lonely night
Dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
Though I dream in vain, in my heart it always will remain
My stardust melody, the memory of loves refrain
Beside a garden wall when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairytale
Of paradise where roses grew
Though I dream in vain, in my heart it always will remain
My stardust melody, the memory of loves refrain
Beside a garden wall when stars are bright, you are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairytale
Of paradise where roses grew
