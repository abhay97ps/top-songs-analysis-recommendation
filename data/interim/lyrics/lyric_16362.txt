For the first time, babe
You blew my mind
And when you stared at me
You turn me on
And now you got me going krazy

Making sweet love to me
It's all right, cause you make
Me feel, oh, so good inside
I never knew that
I could feel this way
The way you turn me on
And now you got me going crazy
Oh, you got me krazy for you
I never knew that I could feel this way
Oh, you're making me krazy

Going out of my mind
Oh, oh

Boy, you're driving me out of mind
And you know that you're
Making me krazy for you
Ain't no doubt about the way I feel
