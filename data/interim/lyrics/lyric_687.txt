It starts with...
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alo-
I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off 
Taking their time right behind my back
I walk alone, I walk alo-
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work
Work, work, work 
But you gotta put in work, work, work, work
Work, work, work
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work
Work, work, work 
Let my body do the work, work, work, work
Work, work, work
I'm in the house!
Here it comes!
Extra extra, read all about it
The best burgers in town from all around
People from around the world come and get it
The line goes around like a merry-go-round
Demo sonnanja dame
Mou sonnanja hora
Kokoro wa shinka suru yo motto motto
Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah!
How many shrimps do you have to eat 
Before you make your skin turn pink 
Eat too much and you'll get sick 
Shrimps are pretty rich
Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah! 
When worlds collide
You'll laugh so hard you'll swear you've died
When worlds collide
Hold my hand, I'll be your guide
When worlds collide
Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah!
Buckle up for the sweetest ride 
And prepare to have your mind blown wide 
When worlds collide 
When-whe-whe-whe-whe 
Like a G6
Welcome to my mine, we are mining diamonds
We ain't gonna strip mine
We don't have to fight mobs 
Welcome to my mine
Play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds
We don't gotta dodge lava 
Shout to all my lost boys 
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shout to all my lost boys 
We're rowdy 
Shout to all my lost boys 
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shout to all my lost boys 
We're rowdy 
Shout to all my lost boys 
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shout to all my lost boys 
We're rowdy 
Shout to all my lost boys 
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shout to all my lost boys 
We're rowdy 
Bangarang! 
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs
And I'm under each snare 
Break it down bitch, let me see you back it up
Drop that ass down low then pick that motherfucker up
Break it down bitch, let me see you back it up
Drop that ass down low
DJ Khaled!
Bill Nye the Science Guy
So much swag, even on my hoverboard
Wake me up
Wake me up inside
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside
Save me
Call my name and save me from the dark 
I'm gonna pop some tags 
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket 
I, I, I'm hunting, looking for a come-up 
This is fucking awesome 
Nugget biscuit, nugget in a biscuit
Nugget biscuit, nugget in a biscuit
Nugget biscuit, nugget in a biscuit
Dip it all in mashed potatoes
Turn it up!
Turn it up!
Harder!
Harder!
Girl you can wear my sweatshirt 
'Cause you're the only one I hold 
And I don't want you to be cold 
So baby wear mine- 
Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind wanting to start again
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards one blow from caving in
Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six feet under, scream, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
Cause, baby, you're a firework 
Come on show them what your worth 
Make them go "Oh, oh, oh!" 
As you shoot across the sky-y-y 
Subatomic penetration, rapid fire through your skull
How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose control
Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones
Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Get up get down
Three steps down
My DJ gonna break it down 
Get up get down
Three steps down
My DJ gonna break it down
Drop the bass
And I say
Hey, yay, yay, yay, yay
Hey, yay, yay
I said hey, what's going on?
And I say
Hey, yay, yay, yay, yay 
Hey, yay, yay
Can't keep my dick in my pants
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know fo' sho!
The ting goes skrrrahh
Pap, pap, ka-ka-ka
Skidiki-pap-pap
And a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door?
Todokete
Setsunasa ni wa namae o tsukeyou ka "Snow Halation"
Omoi ga kasanaru made
Matezu ni kuyashii kedo sukitte junjou 
Binetsu no naka tameratte mo dame da ne
Tobikomu yuuki ni sansei mamonaku Start
You're a firework
You know, let them see what you are worth-
This song has been my mortal enemy for about 4 years now...
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
How many shrimps do you have to eat
Before you make your skin turn pink
Eat too much and you'll get sick
Shrimps are pretty rich
Then you can wear my sweatshirt
And you can tell your friends we'll be together till the end
Girl you can wear my sweatshirt
'Cause you're the only one I hold and I don't want you to be cold
So baby wear mine
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
Flamingo, oh, oh, oh-ooh-oh. Pink
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Flamingo, oh, oh, oh-ooh-oh
How could this happen to me?
I made my mistakes
I've got no where to run
The night goes on
As Iâ€™m fading away
I tried so hard
