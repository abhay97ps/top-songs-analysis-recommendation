Just another emotion
Is this something more
If it's only a passionate phase
I'd rather just close the door
Turn away, turn away, turn away
Walk away, walk away, walk away
Walk away
When you know that I need you
Walk away
When you hear me call you
 walk away
Don't you see that I want you
Here by my side
 walk away
When you know that I need you
 walk away
When you see me coming
 walk away
When you know that I need you
By my side
I'm sure that I'll get over you
It'll take me a while you see
Next time, there won't be no next time
Save all my feelings for me
 walk away...
