They say that you will never settle down
They say that you just have to run around
But they don't realize you're in for a big surprise
Tonight you're gonna fall in love with me
I'm gonna treat you like you're a king 
To win your lovin' I'll do anything 
I'm gonna treat you fine, I'm gonna make you mine
Tonight you're gonna fall in love with me
All the girls are after you, it really shows 
But tonight I'll hold you tight & you will be 
In love with me 
Before you know it, you will be my guy 
My friends will turn their heads when we walk by 
One kiss will be the start, one kiss will win your heart
Tonight you're gonna fall in love with me
