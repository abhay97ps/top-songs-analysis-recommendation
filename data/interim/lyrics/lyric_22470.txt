I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly 
I used to think that I could not go on
I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
And life was nothing but an awful song
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become Neo when they aiming at me 
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends 
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood 
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising 
I win, thrive, soar
Higher, higher, higher
More fire
, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
I believe I can fly 
I believe I can touch the sky
I believe I can fly 
I believe I can touch the sky
See, I was on the verge of breaking down
Paint they own pictures, then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined 
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near 
See we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfickle time to spare 
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me 
But when you go hard your nays become yays
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's
, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
I believe I can fly  {Fly}
I believe I can touch the sky {Ooh-ooh, uh, yeah}
I believe I can fly 
I believe I can touch the sky {Fly}
I believe I can fly 
 Then I can be it
 If I just believe it
 There's nothing to it
Get ready for it
I believe I can fly  {Ooh-ooh}
I believe I can touch the sky {Fly}
I think about it every night and day  {Oh}
Spread my wings and fly away {Ooh, whoa}
 I believe I can soar  {Get ready for it}
 I see me runnin' through that open door {Get ready for it, fly}
{I can fly} I believe I can fly   
 I believe I can fly
I believe I can
