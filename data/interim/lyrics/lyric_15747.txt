Didn’t know if I could make it
I tried to hold out
As long as I could
I have to tell you
How I feel
‘Cause I don’t want to be misunderstood
It’s time
That we got together
And prove what love should be
Our love could be like a dream
We would be a fantasy
If only you will just
Love me
I’ll be there for you
Love me
It will be a dream come true
Love me
Happiness is overdue
Love me
The way that I love you
I know you’ve been through
So many changes
With other loves that weren’t there for you
If you let me in your life
I’ll do all that I can
To make this love paradise for two
Someone to share life forever
That’s what I’ll be for you
We’ll leave the whole world behind
This would be reality
If only you will just
Come on, come on
Won’t you love me
We can leave the whole world
The whole world behind 
Won’t you love me?
The way I love you
We can leave the whole world
The whole world behind
Oh, oh
I love you, baby
Yeah
I know you’ve been through so much pain
I know you’ve been through so much pain
But we can leave the whole world
The whole world behind
Come on, won’t you love me
Baby, would you love me
Oh, we could leave the whole world
Behind
Behind
La-la-la
Love me, baby
