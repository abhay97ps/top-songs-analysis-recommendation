Ding dong
Ding dong
Oh those bells they are ringing in the tower
They seem to know the hour
When we are together
Oh those bells they say you're mine forever
Let's put our hearts together
To join us as one 
Those bells bells are ringing for ours to come around
To join us together so no one can make us part
Oh those bells have put our hearts together
And have joined us forever
Forever and ever to part 
Ding dong Bells bells
Ding dong Bells bells bells
