We never walk
We never talk
We never find the time To be close again
There it goes again
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
Too much concern for money to burn
Too many things to do Now you don't need me
And I don't need you
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
One by one They fail Now the leaves our lover
Cling to the ground
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
Too much too soon Too much temptation
In a hurry It's a sad situation
Too much worry I can tell Well it's over now
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
There it goes
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
When it's right, it's all right
When it's wrong, it's all wrong
When it's gone, it's all gone
It's too late
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
I can tell Well it's over now
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
