I've done got over, yes I've done got over at last
I've done got over, yes I've done got over at last
I'm a natural born lover since I got rid of all my trav'lin
Yes I've done got over at last
No more crying, no more sighing, no more walking the floor over you
No more crying, no more signing, no more walking the floor over you
I'm a natural born lover, since I got rid of all my trav'lin
Yes I've done got over at last
