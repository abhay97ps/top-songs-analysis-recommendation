Party, 'cause you know the future's all yours
Dance 'til your feet don't touch the floor
Celebrate the day you've waited for
Party, like you're ready for so much more
Do it like you know it's never been done
Go a little crazy, have too much fun
Today's the day, c'mon, everyone

Everybody, now

All the girls, and all the boys
Don't you know we got it goin' on?
All together, we belong
Fun to be young

Lookin' good with a new attitude
Turn the party out
Time to shine

Everything we wanna
Finally, we get the chance
Everybody wanna celebrate 
Let the party never end 
Ready for the summer holiday 
Anticipating what's ahead 
Now we're better than we've ever been 
And you know we do it right 
Acapella, now, bring it in 
Come on, girls, one more time
Chillin' out, break it down
That's the way we do it now 
Attitude in the groove
Getting into something new 
Say goodbye to yesterday, future lookin' good to me 
All together, raise your hands
Time to party, time to dance
