We talked it over
And we both agree
We've come to the
End of the line
Your taxi’s waiting
Go now, don't look back
I'm the only thing
You’re leaving behind
I know you gotta do
What your heart tells you to
But if you find your heart's
Made a fool out of you
Don't let her know, baby
Don't let her see
Hold back your tears
Til you get back to me
And we'll cry, cry, cry
Together, oh, yes, we will
Cry, cry, cry, together
Good luck, my darling
You have my blessing
Don't feel guilty about
Leaving me alone
Where did I fail you
That's the big question
That will keep me company
When you're gone
But if you ever find
That you’re not satisfied
You gotta promise me
That you’ll swallow your pride
Remember that
Misery loves company
If she makes your heart break
Then run back to me
And we'll cry, cry, cry
Together, oh, yes, we will
Cry, cry, cry, together
I know it ain’t that hard
To cry sometimes
Cry, cry, cry, together
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Don't you know
Cry, cry, cry, together
Lay your head upon
My shoulder, baby
Cry, cry, cry, together
And we'll laugh about it
When we get a little older
But for now, cry, cry, baby
