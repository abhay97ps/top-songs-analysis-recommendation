The City Council met last night, the vote was four to three
To tear the home town depot down and build a factory
To take that stretch of history and tear it off the map
And to take old engine number nine and turn it into scrap
Blue Water, Blue Water, Blue Water Line
Blue Water, Blue Water, Blue Water Line
If you can't afford a quarter
Then you ought to give a dime
If everybody gave then we could save the Blue Water Line
Oh I could tell you stories of the glories of that train
Of the 49'er miners and the time old Jesse James
Stole a thousand golden nuggets in that great train robbery
And when old Abe Lincoln rode with Tad upon his knee
Blue Water, Blue Water, Blue Water Line
Blue Water, Blue Water, Blue Water Line
If you can't afford a quarter
Then you ought to give a dime
If everybody gave then we could save the Blue Water Line
Just twenty thousand quarters and forty thousand dimes
And we'll ride again to glory on that old Blue Water Line
We'll have William Jennings Bryant
Stokin' coal on number nine
So reach into your pockets boys for the old Blue Water Line
Blue Water, Blue Water, Blue Water Line
Blue Water, Blue Water, Blue Water Line
If you can't afford a quarter
Then you ought to give a dime
If everybody gave then we could save the Blue Water Line
If everybody gave then we could save the Blue Water Line
Blue Water, Blue Water, Blue Water Line
Blue Water, Blue Water, Blue Water Line...
