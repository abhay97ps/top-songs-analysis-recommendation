She walks in the field
That's just across the way
Picks all the flowers
That brighten up the day
And her blue velvet cape
That she wore around her neck
And the red in her cheeks
Gave a rag doll effect
And the wind in the trees
Sing a sad, sad, sad song
I lay in my bed
Listening all night long
Oh, wind in the trees
Sing a song for me
Bring back the rag doll to me
Oh, how I long to have her back by my side
The happiness of yesterday
Damn near cost my pride
There ain't nothing worse than losing
When you had everything to gain
Got to get that woman back
Or nothing will be the same
And the wind in the trees
Sing a sad, sad, sad, sad song
I lay in my bed
Listening all night long
Oh, wind in the trees
Sing a song for me
And bring back the rag doll to me
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
