Hello, mom‚ this is flame
She's a dancer we've decided to be married
In a week or so
I met her and we fell in love a month ago
I know it's all quite sudden
But when it's right you know
Hello‚ mom‚ this is flame
She's a lady. She makes my life a poem not just a nursery rhyme
She showed me life and love I thought I'd never find
I know you'll really like her, just take a little time
Mom she says I'm different from the other men
She's known before
I guess there's been a few
But mom she say's I'm different
Now can't you tell
I know you're going to like her when you know her like I do
Hello, mom‚ this is flame
She's only human, and we've all done things before we wouldn't do today
None of us is perfect, like you always say
So why should I be worried that you're gonna turn away
This will sound funny‚ but she told me
You would not approve when I brought her home to you
Now tell her that was silly like I told her
Cause I knew how you would treat her
At least I thought I knew
Hello, mom, this is flame
And she's a person and her life before I knew her doesn't matter now
You've already made your mind up anyhow
I cannot understand you being so unkind
But you're welcome in our home any time you change your mind
