 Mademoiselle
Say, oui oui, amour
 Senorita say
Si, si, Senor
 eso peso means
A kiss for sure
Love makes the world go round

Dedicated to man
 they throw you
Kisses with the wave of a fan
 writing lovey
Dovey letters in the sand
Love makes the world go round
Pretty fraulein's in Germantown
Really know how to
Show your heart around
In Chinatown, they got
Something nice and I'm
Not talking about the rice

Really rocks the show
 Senorina's
Make you yell bravo
 rubbing
Noses with an Eskimo
Love makes the world go round
Paree, Madrid, Brazil
Love makes the world go 'round
Japan, Mexico, Honolulu
Love makes the world go round
Pretty fraulein's in Germantown
Really know how to
Show your heart around
In Chinatown, they got
Something nice and I'm
Not talking about the rice
 Broadway baby
Really rocks the show
 Senorina's
Make you yell bravo
 rubbing
Noses with an Eskimo
Love makes the world go round
Love makes the world go round
Love makes the world go round
Love makes the world go round
