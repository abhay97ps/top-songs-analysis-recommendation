This is all
Bad-bad news
I'm just bad, bad news
Good thing, the two
Bonnie and Clyde, the money and who?
It's bad news
Bad, bad for you
But I'm back on the coffee bean 
Anything in between, yeah 
Back of the coffee line
Back, back, back in the bathroom line 
How would you feel if I had you? 
Trust me, you would be mad too 
Shawty, we can be mad cool
Just hit me if anything past due
Your family told you I'm a bad move 
Plus, I'm already a black dude
Leavin' the bathroom, my hands is half-rinsed
If only a nigga just had sense
Speaking in past tense 
It's been a week and a half since
We ain't been speaking and that meant
You feeling free in my absence
I've been going through a lot behind this glass tint, yeah
Back of the coffee line
Back, back, yeah, back in the bathroom line 
I know they told you I'd be bad for you 
Don't worry, I'll be back for you
All the money and cars, stripper hoes and the tattoos
Bad news
Back off a coffee bean, reflecting on all you see
Stressing over award shows
She's stressin' over her wardrobe 
Bought the mansion on foreclose 
No matter how many tickets your tour sold
You feel this deep in your torso
Feel like someone's readin' your horoscope 
Some shit only me and the Lord knows 
SOS is for those who hear this in morse code 
Too many doors closed, cul-de-sacs and fork roads 
Still ended up at the North Pole
This is where remorse goes 
This shit'll have you in divorce court 
Fighting over your seeds
Fighting over your deeds, sliding over your keys 
Alimony and fees 
As your lawyer proceeds 
To give out bad news
I'm just bad, bad news
Good thing, the two
Bonnie and Clyde, the money and who?
It's bad news
Bad, bad for you
But I'm back on the coffee bean anything in between
Back of the coffee line
Back, back, back in the bathroom line, yeah
