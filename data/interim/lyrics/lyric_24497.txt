Hey
Southside
Wizop
Offset
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
Woo!
Mil' in a week 
I bought a iced out Philippe 
Yeah, playin' for keeps 
Suck up the gang, she a leech 
Came in the game with a key 
My pockets blew up, Monique 
Ooh, she got that perfect physique 
I'll tape a brick to her cheeks 
Now that I'm gettin' this money
I'm fuckin' these thotties, they tryna get come-ups 
This a good week, I've been stackin' up Ms
And I'm snatchin' that Wraith in the mornin' 
I was that nigga locked up in the cell
And they treated me like I was normal 
Thankin' the Lord for them blessings
I just left the Met Gala dressin' up formal 
Look at my boogers, they big as you 
You could get shot with your nigga too 
The stick make a nigga do boogaloo 
Bentley Mulsanne but the seats masseuse 
I'm havin' more stripes than Adidas boost 
Dick in her mouth like a edible 
Nigga start shootin', you better move 
I fight for my gang, I won't let 'em lose 
Your bitch, she wantin' the pipe, aight
This shit all started off likes 
Hopped in my DM and wrote me a kite, flight 
She on the very first flight 
Finesse a nigga then get his shit bike 
Psych, right, nigga, goodnight 
Poppin' that shit 'cause he thinkin' he pipe, pipes
Hunnid rounds drum with the knife 
Me and the Wop, Biggie and Pac 
But we so different, we keepin' the Glock 
I'm on a yacht and the yacht on my watch 
Fuckin' a thot on the ocean, Dubai 
I'ma play dumb but I see all the plots 
She know what I'm 'bout 
You hit this dope and your heart gonna stop 
They callin' the cops 
Hop on the jet, this a twenty passenger 
Offset a maniac, I'm the massacre 
I take your heart out and shoot your bladder up 
Get to the top and we blew the ladder up 
Ran up my money, I'm talkin' lateral 
Got that bitch high off a Perc' and Adderall 
Pull out the fire and you better grab it all 
Bitch, I'm Offset and I'm 'bout to set it off

I just left the Met Gala dressin' up formal 
I'm havin' this shit but you had it 
Show me respect like your daddyâ€™s dad 
Yeah, Gucci the magnet, cash in the cabinet
I just woke up in a palace 
I did a walk through, I'm in Dallas, man 
Flew in two bitches from Cali 
Big Bs on me, I'm rocking Bally 
They drunk and they just walkin' barely
I'm headed to Paris to pick up a bag 
And they treat me like one of the Jacksons
These niggas ain't trappin', ain't makin' transactions 
A nigga rob you, he be practicing 
Four bitches all tryna swallow this
I feel like I'm fightin' an octopus 
Thought it was killers camped out in my bushes 
To come to find out it's photographers 
Feds watch me with binoculars 
Mad 'cause a nigga gettin' popular 
Flexin', your ho wanna lock me up 
Drop Top Wop but the top is up 
Negative turn to a positive 
I don't care none 'bout no obstacles
I could care less 'bout the bloggers, boy 
80K stuffed in my joggers, bruh
