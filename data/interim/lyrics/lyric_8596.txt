Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
When you're tryin' to flee from any fakin' grin
I tell you what to do from the swing of mighty men
Find yourself some roots to let it all hang out
Get into some dancing, do what it's all about
Loose booty
Loose booty
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Life can be confusing 
If you feel like losing 
This life would be amazing 
My minutes turn to days 
Loose booty, loose booty
Loose booty, hey hey hey hey
Now I got to get on 
Don't wanna steer you wrong 
Owe it to yourself and 
And if you're too relaxed then 
Loose booty, loose booty
Loose booty, loose booty
Booty, booty, booty, booty, booty, booty, booty, booty
