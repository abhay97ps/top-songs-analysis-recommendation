These half-truths you're telling me
Won't bring me to my knees
Scraped up and bruised
From your fickleness I plead
Just let me feel some ease
From creatures of your greed
Just let me feel some ease for me
I'm not so glad I met you
It makes me want to go away
Until you think it's over
I touch
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Where do we go from here?
You know I'm not the only one
Where do we go from here?
You know I'm not your only son
Where do we go from here?
Stop dreaming 'bout the shiny gun
Where do we go from here?
No, I'm not the only one
These broken dreams are screams to me
The difference I can't see
The way you look and talk to me
You're cursing me I freeze
The combination of lost control
The loss of soul, I wheeze
Just give some ease to me
Where do we go from here?
You know I'm not the guilty one
Where do we go from here?
You know I'm not your only son
Where do we go from here?
Stop dreaming 'bout the shiny gun
Where do we go from here?
No, I'm not the only one
SHIT!
I touch, yeah, yeah, yeah
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go?
Yeah
