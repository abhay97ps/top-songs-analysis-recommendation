Do not move, baby Do not move
Ah, look at you; I just want to take this in
The moonlight dancing off your skin
Our time let us take our time
I just want to look in your eyes and catch my breath
Because I got a feeling
This could be a one of those memories
We want to hold on to, cling to, the one we cannot forget
Baby this could be our last first kiss, the door to forever
What if this was that moment, that chance we are taking?
History in the making
Inside, baby inside
Can you feel the butterflies floating all around?
Because I can sure feel it now
Tonight, maybe tonight
Is the start of a beautiful ride that will never end
And baby I got a feeling
This could be a one of those memories
We want to hold on to, cling to, the one we cannot forget
Baby this could be our last first kiss, the door to forever
What if this was that moment, that chance we are taking?
History in the making
Right here, right now
Holding you in my arms
This could be a one of those memories
We want to hold on to, cling to, the one we cannot forget
Baby this could be our last first kiss, the door to forever
What if this was that moment, that chance we are taking?
History in the making
