 Girl, I need to know why
 What did I do, girl, what did I do
You broke my heart
Check this out, honey
It seems like 99 years have gone by
Since the last time I talked to you, you know
I never realized that somethin' so innocent and so sweet
Could make a man feel so much pain
Times you'd jump out of my car
And I'd chase you till I was out of breath
Go to your job and pick you up
But you never showed up that day 
Where were you, baby 
Who was you seein', it's a hurtin' feelin', sugar
How could you, why would you abuse my love, sweetheart
Cursin' me out in front of my friends
And I could never do anything to you
Cause there was no way I could hurt somethin' 
I treasured so much
Thought I was right on time, but it seems like I was too late 
You hurt me, baby 
But hey, I'm man enough to admit it 
What I wanna know is why 
 Tell me, baby
 Tell me, baby
You broke my heart, baby 
Yo, the way it happened was crazy 
We had a argument 
I didn't see you for two or three days
And then when I go to the movies to get you off my mind 
I see you sittin' there holdin' hands with the next man
Caught you on the phone a couple of times, but it was always your cousin
 Step off, just a friend 
People used to tell me, "L, she was fakin'"
But I couldn't see it, I was blinded by love 
Nothin' was too expensive
No night was too rainy
I was always there for you 
I did things few call me a fool for doin'
Droppin' your friends off, all that
All I wanted in return was your undivided attention and love
If my heart had eyes it would cry
You're still in my world 
Life is worth livin' love
Tell me why
 Why would you do it to me, baby, yeah, yeah
 Hurt me so bad when you left me, baby
You broke myyyyy baby 
I walk around talkin' to myself
Do another day gets nothin'
Am I goin' crazy, baby
I look at the photograph that we once shared
And think about the moment, yeah, yeah
About each other
Remember the things I used to say to you, girl
There's a right and a wrong way to love somebody
I'll always give all my love to you
I'm on a merry-go-round and round
Girl, how deep is your love
I've got to go outside in the rain
It's not to late too make it last forever
Why, why, why, why me
Why, why, why, why me
No, baby, no, baby, no, baby, no, baby, no, baby
No, no, no, no, no
Tell me not true
Ooh, do you know, do you know how much I love you
You were my woman and I was your man
Oh, girl, I'll never, never, never, never, never, never understand
