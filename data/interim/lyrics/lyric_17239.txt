Stealin all my flows, why the fuck do you do that
Saying that I'm spoiled when you’re flexing every single rack
Stuck up in the field, in the middle like a quarterback
Flexin all the muscles, got that bitch up doing jumping jacks
808s be pounding give a bitch a heavy heart attack
Pull up in a foreign so you know we always pumping gas
Puttin Camo on a track imma keep on running laps
Imma cut down, cut down, like a lumberjack
Get a touchdown, touchdown like a quarterback
Getting thrown down, thrown down, fuck it up bad
Making all these plots, all these plots, no construction maps
Bitch I'm going turbo, going turbo, gotta run it back
Bullshit, I was trynna give u love
Tried to resist, all the shit that I did for you
Nonsense, zip it lock it put in yo pocket
Saucin, neck on Fiji ain’t no water faucet
Rocket, never going down unless I drop kick
Tropics, I'm in LA with the Tropics
Poppin, lately I've been topic of discussion
Profit, running through the money like I'm Sonic
Rocket, never going down unless I drop kick
Tropics, I'm in LA with the Tropics
Poppin, lately I've been topic of discussion
Profit, running through the money like I'm Sonic
Now why these bitches wanna act up
Trynna ask for money all because I just gassed up
Pull up at the doormat like you got a job at GrubHub
Came in with the homies ain’t no way we getting snatched up
Acting all tough and shit, why u callin' back up?
You ain’t no comedian, you can’t even stand up
Need a music hook up, like a fucking fishing rod
If you work at Mickey Dee’s, you know imma diss yo job
Cannot catch up, cause you doing the most
About to celebrate cause I'm making a toast
Might get pneumonia, my neck is on froze
This shit ain’t a secret cause everybody knows
I'm just a king, that is stacking his gold
Put in the bag, cause I am the GOAT
All these haters think I'm always capping
But I'm never cappin', it’s the truth be told
I’m in LA, first, it's hot, then it cold
It don't make sense, plus the vibes are just bold
Why the fuck you sayin' that is super cool
Stop it with the capping, plus we got wack schools
Rocket, never going down unless I drop kick
Tropics, I'm in LA with the Tropics
Poppin, lately I've been topic of discussion
Profit, running through the money like I'm Sonic
Rocket, never going down unless I drop kick
Tropics, I'm in LA with the Tropics
Poppin, lately I've been topic of discussion
Profit, running through the money like I'm Sonic
Money like I'm sonic
Money like I'm sonic
LA with the tropics
LA with the tropics
