Come over here!
Some girls, they like candy
And others, they like to grind
I'll settle for the back of your hand
Somewhere on my behind
Treat me like I'm a bad girl
Even when I'm being good to you
I don't want you to thank me
You can just spank me
Ooh!
Some guys like to sweet talk
And others, they like to tease
Tie my hands behind my back and
Ooh, I'm in ecstasy
Don't slobber me with kisses
I can get that from my sisters
Before I get too cranky
You better
Like hanky panky 
Nothing like a good spanky 
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky
Like hanky panky 
Nothing like a good spanky 
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky, guy
Oooh!
Please don't call a doctor
'Cause there's nothing wrong with me
I just like things a little rough
And you better not disagree
'Cause I don't like a big softie, no!
I like someone mean and bossy
Let me speak to you frankly
 You better
Like hanky panky 
Nothing like a good spanky 
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky
Like hanky panky 
Nothing like a good spanky 
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky, guy
Oooh, yeah
What about?
Yeah!
That's an interesting...
Oooh!
My bottom hurts just thinking about it
 Treat me like I'm a bad girl
 Even when I'm being good to you
 I don't want you to thank me 
You better
Like hanky panky 
Nothing like a good spanky 
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky
Like hanky panky 
Nothing like a good spanky 
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky, guy 
Oooh, yeah 
Get the picture? 
That's the way I came into this world 
The doctor said, "Lady, she's a beautiful girl" 
He gave me a spanky and I started to smile 
So give it up, honey, 'cause I want it
Yeah
