VERSE 1
Get out, damn it
Close the door, don't slam it
Let me be alone a while
To give my nerves a rest
Whatever you do I love you
No matter what you do I love you
And I want to run out after you
But I don't know what's best
CHORUS
You will take good care of me
I'll be your caretaker
You'll be the maker of the peace
I'll be the peacemaker
You will take good care of me
And I'll be your caretaker
You'll be the maker of the peace
I'll be the peacemaker
VERSE 2
Hours later
I hear the key in the front door
We look each other in the eye
A timid, sorry pair
There's a little more conversation
Just little more conversation
A battle's lost, a war is won
I think we've cleared the air
CHORUS
