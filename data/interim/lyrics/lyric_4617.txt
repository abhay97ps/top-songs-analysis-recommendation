It ain't no use to sit and sigh now, darlin
And it ain't no use to sit and cry now
T'ain't no use to sit and wonder why, darlin
Just wonder who's gonna buy you ribbons when I'm gone
So times on the railroad gettin' hard, babe
I woke up last night and saw it snow
Remember what you said to me last summer
When you saw me walkin' down that road
So I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road
You're the one that made me travel on
But still I can't help wonderin' on my way
Who's gonna buy you ribbons when I'm gone?
