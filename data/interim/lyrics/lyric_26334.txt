I don't want nobody else
I don't want nobody else
Give you all of my attention, mmm
It's straight shots, no champagne sippin' tonight 
Add Netflix to this massage, better yet turn that shit off 
'Cause I love to hear you cussin' at me
Like, "Ooh, shit, baby, too deep"
You never felt this feeling when I touch you, ooh
I never loved nobody like I love you, ayy
That's why I only want you to love 
I don't want nobody else 
I only want you to love 
I don't want nobody else 
They say love is all we missing 
Let's play "Oui" while we French kiss it all night 
Let's lay down while we watch stars
Let's dance until last call
Wake up, you text you're thinking about me 
Yeah, I never felt that feeling when I'm touching 
I never loved nobody like I love you 
That's why I only want you to love 
I don't want nobody else 
I only want you to love 
I don't want nobody else 
Oh, uh
Kissing on you in public 
They could tell it's mine, don't touch it
If you ever leave me, I'd be upset
Talking sick to my stomach, I don't play about my woman, nah
Wishin' we could get high and make love stoned
In the sheets to a love song
Your heartbeat be the beat I put words on, oh-oh
 Yeah
We should be team us 
Girl, I want you all the time
Ooh, you ease my mind
That's why I only want you to love 
I don't want nobody else 
I only want you to love 
I don't want nobody else 
I don't want nobody else 
I don't want nobody else 
Talking sick to my stomach, I don't play about my woman, no
'Body else 
I don't want nobody else 
I only want you to love 
 I don't want nobody else
