Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, oh-oh, yeah
 What you thinking?
You think that you could be better off with somebody new
You say you're leavin'
Well, if you wanna leave, there ain't nobody stopping you
I won't beg for your love
Won't say, "Please"
I won't fall to the ground on my knees
You know I've given this everything
Baby, honestly, baby, honestly
I lie for you, baby
Die for you, baby
Cry for you, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you, baby, and only you, baby
The things I do, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
I never cheated 
Deleted everyone 'cause they made you uncomfortable
These accusations 
I can't apologize for something that I didn't do
I won't beg for your love
Won't say, "Please" 
I won't fall to the ground on my knees 
You know I've given this everything 
Baby, honestly, , baby, honestly 
I lie for you, baby
Die for you, baby
Cry for you, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you, baby, and only you, baby
The things I do, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
Oh, tell me what you've done for me
Oh, tell me what you've done for me
Oh, yeah
You know I've given this everything
Baby, honestly
Tell me what you've done for me
I lie for you, baby
Die for you, baby
Cry for you, baby
But tell me what you've done for me 
For you, baby, and only you, baby 
The things I do, baby
 But tell me what you've done for me
Oh, tell me what you've done for me
Oh, tell me what you've done for me
