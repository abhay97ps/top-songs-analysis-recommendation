Would you like to live in Houston, where the cowboys come to town
Or maybe Pensacola, where the sun shines all year 'round
Or even New York City, where the city never sleeps
I'm offering you the option before you get in too deep
If you can do anything else, baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start, you can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't, baby, you can you stay right here
There's work up in Seattle, if you don't mind the rain
San Diego to Savannah, they'd all be glad you came
But life with me would always be a roller coaster ride
You won't hurt my feelings, whatever you decide
If you can do anything else, baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start, you can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't, baby, you can you stay right here
This place might look real good right now, but looking good don't last
But if you choose it, anyhow, I'll give you all I have
If you can do anything else, baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start, you can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't, baby, you can you stay right here
Baby, you can stay right here 
Oh, baby, you can stay right here 
Baby, you can stay right here
