That big ol' butt makes a preacher want to kill, for real tho
'Cuz you go girl, I wanna rock your world, get down the curves
That girl's got me crazy, the way you're kickin' them Daisy's
I wanna lay you, love

See I know how to satisfy you
Gimme that good love, money can't buy you
Damn, I wanna try it, so gimme that funky chunky Dunkie

Back that butt up and make it beat
