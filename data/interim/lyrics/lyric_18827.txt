The waves keep on crashin' on me for some reason
But your love keeps on comin' like a thunderbolt
Well come here, a little closer
'Cause I wanna see you, baby, real close up
You got me feelin' hella good
So let's just keep on dancin'
You hold me like you should
So I'm gonna keep on dancin' 
A performance deserving of standing ovations
And who would've thought it'd be the two of us?
So don't wake me if I'm dreamin'
'Cause I'm in the mood, come on and give it up
You got me feelin' hella good
So let's just keep on dancin'
You hold me like you should
So I'm gonna keep on dancin' 
You got me feelin' hella good
So let's just keep on dancin'
You hold me like you should
So I'm gonna keep on dancin' 
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah
You got me feelin' hella good
So let's just keep on dancin'
You hold me like you should
So I'm gonna keep on dancin' 
You got me feelin' hella good
So let's just keep on dancin'
You hold me like you should
So I'm gonna keep on dancin'
