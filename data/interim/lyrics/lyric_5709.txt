It’s knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk 
That makes me know that I can leave
My sleeping bag behind your couch 
Yes it does 
It’s knowing I’m not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And your ink stains that have dried upon some line
Keeps you on the back roads 
By the rivers of my memory 
It keeps you ever gentle on my mind 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh 
It’s not clinging to some rocks and ivy planted
On some column now that binds me, no, it don’t
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
We did it, baby
It’s knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving
When they turn around and find
That you’re moving on the back roads 
You’re still on my memory 
You’re ever gentle on my mind 
Yes, I’m baby 
Yeah, you are gentle 
You are gentle 
You are gentle and gentle 
You are gentle on the back roads 
Yeah, yeah 
You are gentle on my mind 
Say that, babe 
You are gentle on my mind 
Yeah
