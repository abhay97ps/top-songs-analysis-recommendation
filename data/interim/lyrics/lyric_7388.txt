Eve, there's a woman in your eyes
Oh Eve, you made me realise
Eve, give me a smile
Oh Eve, you're only a child
But it's making me turn my head all the time
'Cause looking at your face is like seeing the sunshine
Eve, I'll never let you down
Oh Eve, I'll always be around
And it's making me turn my head all the time
'Cause looking at your face is like seeing the sunshine
Oh Eve, give me a smile
Oh Eve, you're only a child
