Keep here taking another dri-
Life has not been easy for you
You went wrong in love
There's something about him that doesn't please you anymore 
That's why she goes out and do what she does 
Life is one and time will not stop
I tell you because I have seen how you get lost loving 
Baby‚ I think time is running out
He changed you being better than her 
For women and a couple of bottles 
For friends who aren't really friends 
Because I know they will write to you when he leaves you
And now in secret and without dissimulation 
I found her wanting to forget her ex 
Now she does what she wants when she wants 
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too 
When the DJ turns on the music 
She dances like never before 
And now in secret ‚ and without dissimulation 
I found her wanting to forget her ex 
When the DJ turns on the music
She dances like never before 
Now she does what she wants when she wants
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too
They left her alone, now she shows it on the disco
She always dances uncensored, for a man she doesn't cry 
Don't trust anyone, anyone 
Today's are drink day and for the street, street 
She wants to drink, she wants to dance 
And she wants to smoke and she's going to get drunk 
She doesn't love anymore and doesn't call and doesn't claim
And I look for her in Lambo' and we end up in my bed
I don't want to talk about him, let's go to the wall 
I want to see everything you know 
You are asking me to put, but here it doesn't fit 
She wanted to lose her rhythm and I have the key, yeh-yeh-yeh
Do you want to see how hard am I? 
Come on, baby, it's that I'm without insurance
When I'm with you, I always feel good, yeah
You are mine, I swear you
Baby, when the DJ turns on the music 
She dances like never before 
And now in secret , and without dissimulation 
I found her wanting to forget her ex 
When the DJ turns on the music
She dances like never before 
Now she does what she wants when she wants
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too
Who wants me to take her to a private place
But to do it without anyone noticing
She told me he has a tough boyfriend
She tells me that why I arrive and don't greet
I said: "Forgive me, baby, I'm unique"
Drop the music bass, I want to see you
Sweating, baby, until dawn
There's another baby that wants to see me, you have to know
But, calm down, I'm having a good time, you too
It doesn't matter, baby, whatever who says 
I know that he doesn't value you 
But I'm not for love now, baby
Enjoy and don't look at the time 
I only fall in love with you, lady 
Woh-woh-woh, stop that shit, nigga
Now, the days are gray for her 
Because their mornings aren't happy 
He no longer treats her as before 
She is single and she want to go to the disco 
Let me take you and ride you in the red Mercedes 
You going to get excited 
For that you blush with me 
While you forget everything bad he did to you
Forget it, it's been a while since he forgot about you 
I want to keep you, baby, I want to be your boyfriend 
You are pretty with your beautiful body 
And that tummy with more squares than Tetris
When the DJ turns on the music 
She dances like never before 
And now in secret , and without dissimulation 
I found her wanting to forget her ex
When the DJ puts the music, music 
She enjoys it while she can 
Now dance, smoke, drink, all alone
She arrives at the house and they don't tell her anything
What a good life she has 
She is drunk, but asks for another bottle 
Is that at that time the note is high
She highlights happiness
And now in secret and without dissimulation 
I found her wanting to forget her ex 
Now she does what she wants when she wants 
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too 
When the DJ turns on the music 
She dances like never before 
And now in secret , and without dissimulation 
I found her wanting to forget her ex 
When the DJ turns on the music
She dances like never before 
Now she does what she wants when she wants
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too
Everybody go to the discotek; atention!
