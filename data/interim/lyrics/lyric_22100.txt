Loving you, isn't the right thing to do
How can I, ever change things that I feel?
If I could, maybe I'd give you my world
How can I, when you won't take it from me?
 Go your own way
 Another lonely day
 Go your own way
Tell me why, everything turned around?
Packing up, shacking up, is all you wanna do
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
Open up, everything's waiting for you
Ohh
 Go your own way
 Another lonely day
 Go your own way
Oooohh-heey!
 Go your own way
 Another lonely day
 Go your own way
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh!
You can go, you can go
Ooh! 
Call it another lonely day, yeah 
Go your own way
