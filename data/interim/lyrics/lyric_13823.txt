I hear a heart beat
It's ringing out across the universe
It sounds so lost and lonely
It must come from somewhere deep inside of us
And the operator says:
"All is calm an' all is quiet
Close your eyes an' sleep tonight"
This is the world calling 
This is Earth 
This is the world calling 
This is us 
I'm on a train now
I'm moving through the yellow fields of rape
There's so much beauty
I wished that I believed enough to pray
Then the operator replied:
"Spinning 'round, you're wrapped in blue
There's no one looks as good as you"
This is the world calling 
This is us 
This is the world calling 
This is us 
This is the world calling 
This is us 
And it goes on, and on
What we gonna to do, because it cannot go on?
What we gonna to do, because it cannot go on?
So, wrap me in your arms and baby keep me warm tonight
What we gonna to do, because it cannot go on?
What we gonna to do, because it cannot go on?
So, wrap me in your arms and baby keep me warm tonight
This is the world calling
This is us
This is the world calling
This is us
This is the world calling
This is us
This is the world calling
God help us
And it goes on, and on, and on
This is the world calling 
This is the world calling 
This is the world calling 
This is the world calling
All is calm and all is quiet
Close your eyes, sleep tonight
This is the world calling...
