Oh yeah
Whoa  yeah
Whoa  yeah, yeah
You take one step, I'll take two
Three steps from true love
You  take one step, I'll take two
Three  steps from true love
Walking through life
Like  you're walking on glass
Forgetting about your future baby
And living in the past
Hey hey
I  know you've been hurt
It's something you can't disguise
Hey hey
You are never dessert
What it's going to take to open up you're heart
You take one step, I'll take two
Three steps from true love
You take one step, I'll take two
Three steps from true love
I know you think I'm jiving
You think all men are the same
You think I'm going to steal your love
And break your heart again
Hey hey
I know you've been hurt
It's something you can't disguise
Hey hey
You are never dessert
What it's going to take to open up you're heart
You take one step, I'll take two
Three steps from true love
You take one step, I'll take two
Three steps from true love
You take one step, I'll take two 
You take one step, I'll take two
You take one step, I'll take two
Three steps from true love
You take one step, I'll take two
Three steps from true love
You take one step, I'll take two
Three steps from true love
You take one step, I'll take two
Three steps from true love
I know you think I'm jiving
You take one step, I'll take two
Three steps from true love
I ain't gonna steal your love
You take one step, I'll take two
Three steps from true love
You take one step, I'll take two
Three steps from true love
You take one step, I'll take two
Three steps from true love
You take one step, I'll take two
Three steps from true love
