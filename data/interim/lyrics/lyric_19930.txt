And my chain, Toucan Sam that
Tropical colors, you can't match that 
Gotta be abstract 
You catch my girl legs open, better smash that 
Don't be surprised if she ask where the cash at 
I see she wearin' them jeans that show her buttcrack 
My girls can't wear that, why? That's where my stash at 
I put my MAC down , that's where you lack at 
She need her candle lit , and I'ma wax that

It's Weezy Baby, January, December, the same

Fresh on campus, it's the Birdman Junior 
Money too long, teachers, put away your rulers 
Raw Tune, not a cartoon 
No shirt, tattoos, and some war wounds 
I'm hot, but the car cool
She wet, that's a car-pool
Been in that water since a youngin, you just shark food 
Quick Draw McGraw, I went to art school 
Yeah, the lights is bright, but I got a short fuse 
Don't snooze 
Been handlin' the game so long, my thumbs bruised
Your new girlfriend is old news
You ain't got enough green and she so blue, yeah 
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true 
Everything is easy, baby, leave it up to Weezy Baby
Put it in the pot, let it steam, let it brew 
Now, watch me melt, don't burn yourself, 'cause

Yeah, riding by myself, well, really, not really 
So heavy in the trunk, make the car pop a wheelie
Who? Weezy Baby, or call me Young Baby 
My money three-sixty, you only one-eighty 
Half of the game too lazy 
Still sleeping on me, but I'm 'bout to wake 'em, yep
I'm 'bout to take 'em to New Orleans and bake 'em 
Yeah, it's hot down here, take a walk with Satan, yeah 
Come on mama, let the Carter make you 
Toss you like a fruit salad, strawberry grape you 
They ball when they can and I'm ballin' by nature 
Addicted to the game like Jordan and Payton 
Y'all in the race and me, I'm at the finish line 
Been runnin' for too long, it's time to give me mine 
Straight down your chimney, in your living room, it's I 
Weezy, allergic to wintertime, hot
