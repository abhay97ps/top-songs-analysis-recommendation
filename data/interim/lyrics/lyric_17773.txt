It's the things you do
That have made me fall
So in love with you
You can have it all
What else can I do
Nothin' left to prove
It's the things you do
You touched my love line
So deep inside I
Never thought I'd feel so good
Oh no
No need to hide now
Open up your mind now
Let me make it understood
Because
'Cause nobody ever said to me
All of the things we shared within
Now that I know that you can see
Let me feel you up
It's the things you do
That have made me fall
So in love with you
You can have it all
What else can I do
Nothin' left to prove
It's the things you do
You and me baby like the ABC, K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Could it be unity I need like J Hoffa?
Romance your body work it out, uh proper
One of the finest things on my mind is
How you make me feel like gold, your queen Midas
Straight A plus the material I bust
But the things that you do
Keep me up and it's a must
Nobody ever said to me
All of the things we shared within
Now that I know that you can see
Let me feel you up
It's the things you do
That have made me fall
So in love with you
You can have it all
What else can I do 
Nothin' left to prove 
It's the things you do
That have made me fall
So in love with you
You can have it all
What else can I do
Nothin' left to prove
Give me a chance and let me in
There's no need to hide what's there within
Now that I know that you can see
Let me feel you up
You got that Midas touch
I love you more than enough
For all the things that you do
It's the things you do
So in love with you
You can have it all
What else can I do
Nothin' left to prove
It's the things you do
