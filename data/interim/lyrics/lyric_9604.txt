Where have the numbers gone
That marched across my bed
The faces after faces
Still inside my head
No words of love
The hollow sound
Of hungry people in the night
Do not say it was wrong or right
But call it flight 
Oh, can Heaven tell me
Where they are now
They could fill cathedrals
Where are they now
They're in the dance halls
They're in the diners
They're in the streets
Where are they now
At the movies
They're in the bar rooms
Where are they now
They're in the dance halls
They're in the diners
They're in the streets
Where are they now
At the movies
They're in the bar rooms
They could fill cathedrals
They could fill cathedrals, baby
Each one is kind of special
As the music played
And so I'd end up leaving
When I should have stayed
Away from this
And all too fast
Another lover hits the dust
So much for all the time and trust
From love to lust
And back to love
Oh, can Heaven tell me
Where they are now
They could fill cathedrals
Where are they now
They're in the dance halls
They're in the diners
They're in the streets
Where are they now
They're at the movies
They're in the bar rooms
Where are they now
They're in the dance halls
They're in the diners
They're in the streets
Where are they now
They're at the movies
They're in the bar rooms
Oh, they could fill cathedrals
Oh, they could fill cathedrals, baby
Oh, they could fill cathedrals
