And I love you, baby
And I, and I love you, baby
And I love you, baby
And I, and I love you, baby
And I love you, baby
And I, and I love you
And I love you
An angel has always been thought
To be one of God's most precious works
I guess that's how she had you fooled
Because she was an angel in disguise
Hurt and pain could never come from her
So you left me only to find that
Hurt and pain involves her
But now you see your mistakes
And now you see your angel was a fake
But my love was never misplaced
See, baby, my love is true
And most importantly, still, I love you
An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
And though she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you
An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
And though she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you
I found it quite strange
The way you said her name
And when you look in her eyes
I see the lust you can't deny
It's more to this than what you said
'Cause in your sleep, you called her name
You say she's just a friend
I knew right then 'cause the rain began, oh-oh
An angel in disguise she was 
But somehow you fell for her 
And though she broke your heart that day 
And left you in the rain 
But still, I love you 
An angel in disguise she was 
But somehow you fell for her 
And though she broke your heart that day 
And left you in the rain 
But still, I love you
She seemed so familiar the day that I met her
Who was she foolin'?
I had a clue of what she was doin'
Thoughts of suspicion brought to my attention
I fell in her game, and I'm so lost
Please stop the rain, oh-ooh
An angel in disguise she was 
But somehow you fell for her 
And though she broke your heart that day 
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you 
An angel in disguise she was 
But somehow you fell for her 
And though she broke your heart that day 
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you
And when my music stops
And when my tears dry
And when the rain ends
My heart will beat again
And when my music stops
And when my tears dry
And when the rain ends
My heart will beat again 
An angel in disguise she was 
But somehow you fell for her 
And though she broke your heart that day 
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you 
An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her 
And though she broke your heart that day 
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you
I love you
I will never do the things she did
Take your heart and run away with it, no, no
'Cause I really, really love you 
An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
And though she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you
