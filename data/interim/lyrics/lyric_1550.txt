If you should hear
That someone new
Has eased the pain
Of losing you
Don't you believe it
Not for a moment
Don't you believe it
Because it isn't true
Those angry words
That made us part
Put out the flame
That's in my heart
Don't you believe it
Not for a moment
Don't you believe it
Because it isn't true
I haven't changed
I still love you
And it will always be
I only hope and
I pray each night
You'll feel the
Same about me
So if you hear
Some false alarms
Like you're not welcome
In my arms
Don't you believe it
Not for a moment
Don't you believe it
Because it isn't true
Oh, how I still love you
