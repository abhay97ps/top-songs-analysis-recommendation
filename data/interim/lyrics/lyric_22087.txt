I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty, too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror, who's inside there?
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, hey
My outsides are cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you
I've tried different ways, but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
I'm just tripping
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so 
You can buy all the makeup that M.A.C. can make
But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I to 
Be in a position to make me feel so
Damn unpretty
I feel pretty
Oh, so pretty
I feel pretty and witty and bright
Never insecure until I met you
Now I'm being stupid
I used to be so cute to me
Just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things
Maybe get rid of you
And then I'll get back to me, hey
My outsides look cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you
I've tried different ways, but it's all the same
At the end of the day, I have myself to blame
Keep on tripping
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so 
You can buy all the makeup that M.A.C. can make
But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I to 
Be in a position to make me feel so
Damn unpretty
I feel pretty
Oh, so pretty
I feel pretty and witty and bright
And I pity
Any girl who isn't me
Tonight 
Tonight 
Tonight 
Tonight 
I feel pretty 
Oh, so pretty 
I feel pretty and witty and bright 
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to 
Be in a position to make me feel so
Damn unpretty
I feel pretty
