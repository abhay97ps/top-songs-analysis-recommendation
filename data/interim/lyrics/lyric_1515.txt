I can still remember
When you moved in next door
I brought you some choc'late
From the corner candy store
When it started raining
You started crying too
That was the first time
I sang this song to you
Rain rain go away
Come again some other day
Rain rain go away
Bring my love a sunny day
We grow up together
And as the years went by
Ev'rybody knew that we were
Sweethearts you and I
Through many april showers
I held your hand in mine
Between the raindrops
We sang time after time
Rain rain go away
Come again some other day
Rain rain go away
Bring my love a sunny day
I went away to college
You said you'd wait for me
Then I got your letter
Asking me to set you free
Tomorrow you'll be maried
There's nothing I can do
But wish you sunshine
Now and your whole life through
Rain rain go away
Tomorrow is her wedding day
Rain rain go away
Bring my love a sunny day
