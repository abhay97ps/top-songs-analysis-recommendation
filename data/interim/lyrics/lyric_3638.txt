Two broken hearts lonely, looking like
Houses where nobody lives
Two people each having so much pride inside
Neither side forgives
The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief
Pride is the chief cause and the decline
In the number of husbands and wives
A woman and a man, a man and a woman
Some can and some can't
And some can
Two broken hearts lonely, looking like
Houses where nobody lives
Two people each having so much pride inside
Neither side forgives
The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief
Pride is the chief cause and the decline
In the number of husbands and wives
