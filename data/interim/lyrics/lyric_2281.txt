If somebody told that they didn't love you
And later they told you they think the whole world of you
Would you still love them? 
Would you still love them? 
Would you still love them? 
Whoa, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
If somebody told you they believe you
And that with every chance they still deceive you
And if somebody told they need you bad
But when you're gone, they still ain't sad
Would you still love them? 
Would you still love them? 
Would you still love them? 
Whoa, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I can't forget you, I can't forget you, I can't forget you
I can't ever forget you
If somebody told you they didn't love you
Later they told you they think the whole world of you
Would you still love them? 
Would you still love them? 
Would you still love them? 
Whoa, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I still remember, I still remember, I still remember
I'll always remember
