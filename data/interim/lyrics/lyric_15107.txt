Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's a girl I used to know
I saw you standing in the corner
And I pretended not to see
You were looking over your shoulder
Then you turned away from me
My friends all asked me if I knew you
I did not know quite what to say
So many reasons to forget you
'Cause I can't bring back yesterday
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just a girl I used to know
She doesn't mean a thing to me
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just a girl I used to know
There's much more than
The eye can see
I heard a voice speak to me softly
I turned around and saw your smile
More beautiful than I remembered
I said hello, it's been a while
My friends all say I must be crazy
To ever walk away from you
Won't be a victim of temptation
There's only one thing I can do
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just a girl I used to know
She doesn't mean a thing to me
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just a girl I used to know
There's much more than
The eye can see
I should have
Never left your side
Feels like the first time
I laid my eyes on you
Guess love was stronger
Than I ever knew
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just a girl I used to know
She doesn't mean a thing to me
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just a girl I used to know
There's much more than
The eye can see
My friends all say I must be crazy
To ever walk away from you
Won't be a victim of temptation
There's only one thing I can do
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Just a girl I used to know
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Just a girl I used to know
