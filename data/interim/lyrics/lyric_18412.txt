Silhouette of a perfect frame
Shadows of your smile will always remain 
Beginners' love soon fades away
Oh, baby, we go on, I will always
 Long as I live
You will be 
Oh, baby, you and only
 Long as I live
You will be 
And I'll choose you again
I'll keep an old candy-coated valentine
Memories of you-you when you were mine
A tarnished ring on a tarnished chain
Times keep changin', come sun or rain
 Long as I live
You will be 
My first love and my only love
 Long as I live
 You will always be my, oh, be my first love
See, as long as I live, long as I live
I like it, baby
Sing to me
You will always be my first love
You'll be my
And I'll choose you again
Ooooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooooh, ooh-ooh
A tarnished ring on a tarnished chain, oooh, ooh
Times keep changin', come sun or rain
 Long as I live, baby, yes
You will be 
I will always love you, baby
My first love
 For the rest of my life, you will always be
My first love
Only, oh, yeah, yeah
Ohhh, oh, KeKe
Oh, yes
