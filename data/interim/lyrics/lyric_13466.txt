All together now
Live-
Live is life 
Live is life 
Live is life 
When we all give the power
We all give the best
Every minute of an hour
Don't think about the rest
Then you all get the power
You all get the best
When everyone gives everything
And every song everybody sings
Then it's life 
Live is life 
Live is life 
Live 
Live is life, when we all feel the power
Live is life, come on stand up and dance
Live is life, when the feeling of the people
Live is life, is the feeling of the band, yeah
When we all give the power
We all give the best
Every minute of an hour
Don't think about the rest
Then you all get the power
You all get the best
When everyone gives everything
And every song everybody sings
Then it's life 
Live is life 
Live 
Live is life 
Live 
Live is life 
Live 
Live is life 
And you call when it's over
You call it should last
Every minute of the future
Is a memory of the past
'Cause we all gave the power
We all gave the best
And everyone gave everything and every song
Everybody sang
Live is life
