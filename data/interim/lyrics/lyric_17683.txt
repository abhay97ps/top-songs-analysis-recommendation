Come on now
Oh'oh'ho'ho'oh'
Here we, here we, here we go again
Well, boy
I caught you slipping , ooh, you must be trippin'
'Cause now I know, oh, yes I know, mmm
About your other girls in your past, in your black book
A very long time ago, oh'ho'oh'ho'
Well, you must think I'm crazy
You must think I'm blind
If you want to keep me, boy
Then stop wasting my time
Here we go again
It's the same old song
You're thinking you're gon' do me
Like the other ones before, baby
Here we go again
It's the same old song
Ooh, straighten up your act
Or else I'm walking out the door
All this time  I thought that I 
Was the one who had the problem, oh yeah, mmm
I gave you everything, hoping things might change
But still you ain't around, so, whoa'oh'oh'
You must think I'm foolish 
You must think I'm blind 
If you want  my precious love 
Then stop telling me lies 
Here we go again
It's the same old song
You're thinking you're gon' do me
Like the other ones before, baby
Here we go again
It's the same old song
Ooh, straighten up your act
Or else I'm walking out the door
You know I've tried to give you the world
Oh, and everything that you need, oh'oh'
Oh, I tried  so many times 
You still mistreated me, oh, here we go
Here we go again
It's the same old song
You're thinking you're gon' do me
Like the other ones before, baby
Here we go again
It's the same old song
Ooh, straighten up your act
Or else I'm walking out the door
Here we go again
It's the same old song
You're thinking you're gon' do me
Like the other ones before, baby
Here we go again
It's the same old song
Ooh, straighten up your act
Or else I'm walking out the door
Here we go again
It's the same old song
You're thinking you gon' do me
Like the other ones before, baby
Here we go again
It's the same old song
Ooh, straighten up your act
Or else I'm walking out the door...
