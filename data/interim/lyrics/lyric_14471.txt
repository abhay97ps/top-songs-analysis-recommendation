I can't believe I could have been so blind, but love is strange
I thought about it for a long long time, but the truth remains
I don't need another lonely night to dry my tears
The answer's plain as black an' white and I can see the picture very clear
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye
It isn't like you never had the chance to change your tune
Did you think that I'm a dime a dance, well the dance is through
I've been doing things for way too long
But baby that's over 
It won't be easy but I gotta be strong
And if I wanna cry I don't need your shoulder
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye
I'll find someone else
Who's nothing like you
Two can play the game as well
And your gonna be sorry baby when it's over
I've been doing things for way too long
But baby that's over 
It won't be easy but I gotta be strong
And if I wanna cry I don't need your shoulder
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
