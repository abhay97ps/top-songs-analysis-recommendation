You been talkin', talkin' to the people
Tryin' to get them to go your way
Tellin' us not to worry
That we won't be led astray
So blind, and signifying
Your opponents always lying
Think about the mistakes you make
'Cause I believe America's at stake
You know, busin', busin' is the issue
Do you have a plan with you
If, if you have a plan
If you have a master plan, got to vote for you
Hey, hey, got to vote for you
You're the man
We don't wanna hear no more lies
About how you planned to economize
We want our dollar value increased
And employment to rise
The nation's taxation
Is causin' all, all this inflation
Don't give us no peace sign
Turn around and rob the people blind
Economics, is the issue
Do you have a plan with you?
'Cause if you've got a master plan
Got to vote for you
You're the man
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
