I saw her standin' on the corner
A yellow ribbon in her hair
All my boys could not help cryin'
Looky there, looky there
That's tough, she's diggin' me
Young blood, yes, it is
Young blood
Young blood
Can't get you outta my mind
Just one look and I was captured
I tried to walk but I was lame
Just could not help myself from shoutin'
What's your name, what's your name
Now looky here, girl, come here, baby
Young blood
Young blood
Young blood
Can't get you outta my mind
What crazy stuff, she looked so tough
I had to follow her all the way home
Then things went bad, I met her dad
What's he say, boys? "You'd better leave my daughter alone"
I couldn't sleep a wink for tryin'
I saw the risin' of the sun
All night long my heart was cryin'
She's the one, she's the one
I saw her first, she wants me
Young blood, yes, it is
Young blood
Young blood
Can't get you outta my mind
What crazy stuff, she looked so tough
I had to follow her all the way home
Then things went bad, I met her dad
Look, get your hands off my daughter
Before I play a little Hank Aaron meledy on your head
Ya understand
I couldn't sleep a wink for tryin'
I saw the risin' of the sun
All night long my heart was cryin'
She's the one, she's the one
Let's take a walk, sugar, just get your car
Young blood, yes, it is
Young blood
Young blood
Can't get you outta my mind
