Starbright, I have made a wish upon you
Now my heart is counting on you
Won't you grant my wish tonight
Starbright, won't you glow with all your splendor
Won't you make her heart surrender
Won't you make her mine tonight
Help me. Help me make her heart discover
Just how much I really love her
Help me make her mine tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh starbright. since you know how much I need her
Can't you spare some light to lead her to my empty arms tonight
Repeat last verse
Oh starbright
