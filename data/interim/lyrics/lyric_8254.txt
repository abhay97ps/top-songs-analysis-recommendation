Don't wait for the postman
If you're looking for a letter from me
There won't be anymore
There won't be anymore
And don't sit by your telephone
If you're waiting for a call from me
There won't be anymore
There won't be anymore
Don't think of the love we had 
'Til you turned bad 
And broke my loving heart in two
And when your heart is breaking
And you need some loving from me
There won't be anymore
There won't be anymore
Don't think of the love we had 
'Til you turned bad 
And broke my loving heart in two
And when your heart is breaking
And you need some loving from me
There won't be anymore
There won't be anymore
It won't be like before
There just won't be anymore
