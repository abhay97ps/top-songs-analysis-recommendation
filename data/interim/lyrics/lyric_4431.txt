I can't seem to make you mine
Kissing all around all the time
You fly around like a bee
Hurtin' everything you see
I try everything I know
To make you wanna love me so
The only thing you do
Is try to put the hurt on me
Can't you see what you're doin' to me
You fill my heart with misery
With every breath and step I take
I'm more in love with you
I can't go on like this
A little bit of love and not one kiss
I've gotta have your love every day
Love that's real and will stay
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
Come back baby, 'cause I'm all alone
Come back darlin', 'cause I need your love
Come back, 'cause I wanna love ya
Girl, I wanna love ya tonight
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
