There's a crack up in the ceiling
And the kitchen sink is leaking
Out of work and got no money
A Sunday joint of bread and honey
What are we living for?
Two-roomed apartment on the second floor
No money coming in
The rent collector's knocking, trying to get in
We are strictly second class
We don't understand
Why we should be on dead end street
People are living on dead end street
Gonna die on dead end street
Dead end street 
Dead end street 
On a cold and frosty morning
Wipe my eyes and stop me yawning
And my feet are nearly frozen
Boil the tea and put some toast on
What are we living for?
Two-roomed apartment on the second floor
No chance to emigrate
I'm deep in debt and now it's much too late
We both want to work so hard
We can't get the chance
People live on dead end street
People are dying on dead end street
Gonna die on dead end street
Dead end street 
Dead end street 
People live on dead end street
People are dying on dead end street
Gonna die on dead end street
Dead end street  
Head to my feet 
Dead end street  
How's it feel? 
How's it feel? 
Dead end street 
Dead end street
