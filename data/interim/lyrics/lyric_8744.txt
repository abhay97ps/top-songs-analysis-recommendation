You're accusing me
When you didn't cheat, baby
And that's not being fair to me
You must believe half of what you see
And none of what you hear 
Only facts you can put your hands on
And even then you should check it out 
You believe in me
As i believe in you, baby
We are known to be 
You must believe half of what you see
And none of what you hear 
Only facts you can put your hands on
And even then you should check it out 
Those backstabbers
They smile in your face, baby
And when your back is turned
They try to take your place
You must believe half of what you see
And none of what you hear 
Only facts you can put your hands on
And even then you should check it out 
Believe in me, baby
I'm the one, baby
