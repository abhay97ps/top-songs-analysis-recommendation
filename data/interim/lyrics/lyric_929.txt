Jokes on you, we back, and now we never leaving
This evening, we beat the beat and this bonus is one we’re keeping
We’re dreaming, we’re never sleeping, no days off and ain’t no weekends
Going harder than the cement, no ceiling to our achievements
We got some doubters and haters but they won’t break us no
This is for the Savior, we’re working towards something greater yo
Three with flavor, this shouldn’t work when on paper
But it does, so we going off
Gift given by God, so we showing off
Buzzing like a gnat, no Romanoff
Get to know us 'fore we blow like Molotov
Bang bang, gang gang, REJX, this ain’t no thang
Ain’t no aim to make a name or make you all just say my name
That ain’t my thang, to sell my soul, just to go and make some bank
I’m unashamed to praise His name and tell you ‘bout His saving grace
But along the way, I might just flex
Never play the game, in the way you meant
Gonna beat all the odds, even up my debt
Gave my life to my God, made a deal like bet
Okay, I hope you enjoyed the fruits of our labor
We ending major, we majored in crushing haters
We’re avoiding failure, just a group of dream chasers
In the favor of the Savior, bye player we’ll see you later
Jones, see you later
Living in a new spot, writing all of my thoughts
Working more than I ought, never missing my shot
Living in a new view, seeing all I can do
Legend like I’m Mewtwo, climbing up with my crew
Y'all ain't seen the last of us, keep it goin' win or bust
Started weak like Pidgey Gust, now we strong like homies trust
Yeah, and we shooting for the mountaintop
Worked too hard for this so close that we ain't gonna stop
Get on board and watch your head or else you'll get the chop
This my second home we cookin' in the music shop
Duck down cause we goin' for the kill
Aim at the game take it down climb the hill
Sit at the top on a throne made of bars
Yo look found a new place to chill in the stars 
Well maybe one day, but now I'm really glad
I've seen dream after dream come to me thanks to my Holy Dad
Life’s been stressing me, God’s been blessing me
People testing me, learn to live like free
Drop my selfish ways, lose my former days
I’m new it’s not my praise, a gift like holidays
I’m changed like paraphrase, on fire my heart’s ablaze
My mind’s a scary place, but watch I will amaze
You've only seen the beginning of what we will display
No more delays, catch the craze, welcome to the fanbase
How you want me to do this man
I’ve been in the biz, no business plan
I’ve seen what it is, I understand
I gotta do more, I get it man
Gotta run it up, don’t let it land
Gotta make more rhymes, like “Sam I Am”
Gotta stay on the grind, like skating man
I better do more, I get it man
You wanna see me run bro like Umbro or umbrella
We stay live like Coachella, we fly high with no feathers
We shoot far like go getter, we bound up ain’t no fetter
We make bars like trend setter, we go hard ain’t no one better to
Ain’t no one better, I get it man, I understand
My business plan, is “do this man”
Like running man, I’ll do the dance
I’ll be the man, to get the man
Out the frying pan, like Peter Pan
I’ll never land, my right hand
Like Danny Rand, is strong like I’m Iron Man
Taking down another villain man
Got the team with me man they really fam
Billy Russo nothing man I finished him
Pinned the King down, Daredevil man
Punished others but their names are really bland
So I’m never gonna give em any cred
Gonna grab the hammer like I’m Rogers man
Realize that I’m worthy and never end
Yeah, hmm, wooo
