Do you wanna dance under the moon light
Squeeze me all through the night
Oh, baby, do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance and hold my hand
Tell me I'm your lover man
Oh, baby, do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance and make romance
C'mon pretty baby and take a chance
Hey, baby, baby, do you wanna dance
 Do you wanna dance
 Do you wanna dance
 Do you, do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance under the moon light
Squeeze me all through the night
Oh, baby, do you wanna dance
 Do you wanna dance
 Do you wanna dance
 Do you do you wanna dance
 Do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance 
Will you take a chance 
Will hold my hand 
At least let me be your lover man 
Can I hold your hand 
Let me be your lover man 
Can I hold your hand
