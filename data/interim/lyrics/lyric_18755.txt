Thumb stuck high in the air
Destination anywhere
This road decides to go
Underneath the desert sky
I find a place to hide and rest my weary bones
This underpass will shade the heat
As my mind drifts off to sleep...
There you are with your hair all down
And your feet are bare and your cotton gown
What a beautiful sight
In the moonlight
The way you're looking at me with your loving eyes
You let me know that for all my life
You would always be my only girl
But that's another place in time
Back when you were mine
In another world
A car stops way up ahead
I climb inside her hair is red
I thank her for the ride
She talks the miles away
I nod and smile and try to say
Anything to be polite
But as the darkness ends the day
Another voice whisper's my name
There you are with your hair all down
And your feet are bare and your cotton gown
What a beautiful sight
In the moonlight
The way you're looking at me with your loving eyes
You let me know that for all my life
You would always be my only girl
But that's another place in time
Back when you were mine
In another world
There you are with your hair all down
And your feet are bare and your cotton gown
What a beautiful sight 
In the moonlight
The way you're looking at me with your loving eyes
You let me know that for all my life
You would always be my only girl
But that's another place in time
Back when you were mine
In another world
In another world
In another world
