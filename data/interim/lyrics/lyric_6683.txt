I don't have you to myself
I know you've been seeing someone else
We can't go on this way
And so I've gotta say
It's up to you Petula
Do the things you wanna do with your life
It's up to you to choose
I only hope you do it right
It's up to you Petula
Do the things you wanna do with your life
Well do you want my love
Petula now it's up to you
I have known for quite a time
You wanna be his as well as mine
Well I don't think I'll wait 
So don't wake up too late
It's up to you Petula
Do the things you wanna do with your life
It's up to you to choose
I only hope you do it right
It's up to you Petula
Do the things you wanna do with your life
Well do you want my love
Petula now it's up to you
You've kept me on a string
And that ain't such a funny thing 
I guess I've had my fill
Although I love you still
It's up to you Petula
Do the things you wanna do with your life
It's up to you to choose
I only hope you do it right
It's up to you Petula
Do the things you wanna do with your life
Well do you want my love 
Petula now it's up 
To you
It's up to you Petula, do the things you wanna do
It's up to you Petula, Petula now it's up to you
It's up to you Petula, do the things you wanna do
It's up to you Petula, oh Petulia now it's up to you
It's up to you Petula, oh do the things you wanna do
