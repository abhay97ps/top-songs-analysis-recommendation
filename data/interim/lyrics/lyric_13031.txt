I’m the real fucking king of Gotham
I’m the real fucking clown of Gotham
I'm the real fucking king of Gotham
I'm the real fucking clown of Gotham
Yenno I ain’t rob stone, so I ain’t bill so I won’t chill
Packing pills till the hills, there’s a hole I gotta fill
Yenno I eat her up, she’s sweet like that Honey dill
My spine is filled with chills, I said fuck it with all the pills
I rather blow up and murder the beat like a fire coming out've the grill
You’re saying I’m cheap, I wanna go eat, yenno I love it for the thrill
I ain’t for sale, keep you’re receipt, I’ll kick you in the face with my cleats
I’m feeling pale, from beating my meat, gotta fetish ain’t talking 'bout feet
I’m talking about rhymes, like Royce da 5’9, I’ll kill you then post it on vine
I’m between your girls thighs, I gotta ill mind, Imma clown call me pennywise
I’ll shove your face in pie, I come in disguise, I’m wise like Yoda
My face is poker, when I choke her, I’m crazy call me the joker
I went into class, they ask me so many questions
I don’t even answer, I just give them a suggestion
Why do you fuck around with those feminists?
Might as well go take a knife a cut your wrists
But let me take it slow cuz you acting feminine
Or is it because of all that medicine?
But you better worry cuz I’ll crack your skeleton
I won’t be hesitant, cuz it’s Like how I break crab legs!
Yenno I have those bad days, but like the gamer's I never get faze
I thought I was as toxic like a parasite
But then I saw venom and I was fine
Climbing faster then the speed of light
Reaching worldwide like a satellite
I wanna bad bitch, so they hear me when I’m talking
Don’t wanna cat fish, I’m the one doing the mopping
Imma go crazy, my eyes are gonna turn into Hopsin’s
Just call the suicide hotline, cuz you don’t have any logic
Her names hope, but the P is silent on the weekends
If it ain’t start with a P, yenno she won’t be eatin’
So she goes both ways, she really get her freak in
Then I kill her like it’s fucking GTA
You wanna play?
But you have the PS4 controller that’s unplugged
Like what your older brother gave to you when u were young
When it’s her time of the month, she rides my face. Now I look like Kratos
She whips her, toss her, pound her, fold her, beat her like she’s Play-Doh
Yea, These shitty rappers get easy fame
If I wasn’t asian, it would be the same
When I wake up my blood is filled with rage
Like I’m playing dc vs mortal kombat in 2008

Asian Bruce Wayne, Bitch i'm Bruce Lee
Could call me a Sayain, and you could call me a Lee

Yenno I’m going crazy my minds an insane asylum
My dark thoughts are my Harley Quinn, she really help me find them
I’m not a scaredy cat, who runs away like a cheetah
I got balls like Goku and Vegeta
These people look at my bank account and get confused
Because they ain’t the same color as Pikachu
Nowadays we living in a snowflake generation
They can take my bars and use it as
