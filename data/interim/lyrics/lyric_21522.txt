Boy, if you ever left my
My side
It'd be like taking the sun from
The sky
I'd probably die without
You in
My life
'Cause I need you to
Shine, shine
Your light
Oh
You're everything to me, hey
The air that I breathe, oh
A sign so I'll see, oh Lord
You're everything to me, oh
I can't repay you for all that you've done
Always come first and second to none
The love that you give me is equal to ten
My peace, my joy
You are my
My strength, oh
You're everything to me, whoa
The air that I breathe, oh
A sign so I'll see, oh that
You're everything to me
Never thought I'd feel a love like this
Better than our first date
Sweeter than our first kiss 
Ain't no other person for me
You're my best friend
My lover
 My everything
You're everything to me, whoa
The air that I breathe, oh
My sight, so I see, oh
You're everything to me, whoa, I
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Say yeah
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
Whoa, oh, hey
