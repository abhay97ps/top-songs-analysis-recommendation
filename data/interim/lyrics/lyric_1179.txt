I know you think I'm foolish
But somewhere down the line
I'll meet someone
Who wants a true love
And darling there'll be no next time
You've made all kinds of promises
What made you change your mind
Someday you're going to miss me
But darling, there'll be no next time
Oh, so many times I given in
I've been hoping you'd change your ways
But so did you
I've gained my confidence
I don't - I don't see you for days and days
And I did my best
Oh, my very best
To make our two hearts bind
So darling, it's now or never
There'll never be - there'll never be a next time
No, no, never, never, never be a next time
