I'm waitin' on the sun to set 'cause yesterday ain't over yet
I started smoking cigarettes, there's nothing else to do I guess
Dusty roads ain't made for walkin', spinnin' tires ain't made for stoppin'
I'm givin' up on love 'cause love's given up on me
I gave it everything I had and everything I got was bad
Life ain't hard, but it's too long to live it like some country song
Trade the truth in for a lie, cheatin' really ain't a crime
I'm givin' up on love 'cause love's given up on me
Forget your high society, I'm soakin' it in kerosene
Light 'em up and watch them burn, teach them what they need to learn; ha!
Dirty hands ain't made for shakin', ain't a rule that ain't worth breakin'
Well, I'm givin' up on love 'cause love's given up on me
Now I don't hate the one who left
You can't hate someone who's dead
He's out there holdin' on to someone, I'm holdin' up my smoking gun
I'll find somewhere to lay my blame the day she changes her last name
Well, I'm givin' up on love 'cause love's given up on me
Well, I'm givin' up on love, hey, love's given up on me
