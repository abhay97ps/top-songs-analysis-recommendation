In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
Yeah yea
How could you be so heartless? Oh
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Yeah, I know of some things that you ain't told me
I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless, yeah
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, he's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
â€˜Cause I already know how this thing go
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Yeah, how could you be so heartless?
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
