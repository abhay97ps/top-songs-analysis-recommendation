Only Love
By Bill Quateman
Only love can make me do what I'm doin'
Only love can make me do what I'm doin', now
Only love can make me do what I'm doin'
Only love, only love
Anybody can sing a love song
Love doesn't know any right or wrong, no, no
Open your heart and sing along
Sing it:
Only love can make me do what I'm doin'
Only love can make me do what I'm doin', now
Only love can make me do what I'm doin'
Only love, only love
Well, you don't have to be afraid to say "I love you"
'Cause somebody sometime somewhere is gonna love you
I know there's proof of it, because I do
And I'm singin':
Only love can make me do what I'm doin'
Only love can make me do what I'm doin', now
Only love can make me do what I'm doin'
Only love, only love
There's been a lot of folks singin' for a long, long time
There'll be a lot of folks singin' for the same kind
All of them sayin', "Let your love shine"
You know I hear all of the sayin' "Let your love shine"
And I'm singin':
Only love can make me do what I'm doin'
Only love can make me do what I'm doin', now
Only love can make me do what I'm doin'
Only love, only love
