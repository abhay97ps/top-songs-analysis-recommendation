Sitting in a restaurant
She walked by
I seem to recall that certain look in your eye
I asked who's that?
You said with a smile
Oh, it's nobody
Nobody
Well, maybe that explains the last two weeks
You called me up, dead on your feet
Working late again
I ask who with
You say nobody
Oh, nobody
Well, your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name
Well, I wonder
Does she think shes being clever?
You say nobody's after you
The fact is what you say is true
But I can love you like nobody can even better
Late last night
We went for a ride
You were miles away
I asked who's on your mind?
You said nobody, nobody
Why do you ask?
Oh, her again
I could have told you that
We went back home
Got ready for bed
I said to myself I've got one shot left
You're still mine
And I won't stand in line behind nobody
Oh, nobody
Well, your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name
Well, I wonder
Does she think she's being clever?
You say nobody's after you
The fact is what you say is true
But I can love you like nobody can even better
