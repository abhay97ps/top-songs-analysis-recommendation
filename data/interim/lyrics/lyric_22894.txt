I fell down, down, down
Into this dark and lonely hole
There was no one there to care about me anymore
And i needed a way to climb and and grab a hold, of the edge
You were sitting there holding a rope
And we'll go up, up, up
But I'll fly a little higher
Go up in the clouds because the view's a little nicer
Up Here, My Dear
It won't be long now, it won't be long now
When we get back on land
Well I'll never get my chance
Be ready to live and it'll be ripped
Right out of my hands
And maybe someday
We'll take a little ride
We'll go up, up, up
And everything will be just fine
And we'll go up, up, up
But I'll fly a little higher
Go up in the clouds because the view's a little nicer
Up Here, My Dear
It won't be long now, it won't be long now
If only I had a little bit more time
If only I had a little bit more time with you
We could go up, up, up
And take a little ride
We'll sit there holding hands and everything will
Be just right
And maybe someday I'll see you again
We'll float up in the clouds and we'll
Never see the end
And we'll go up, up, up
But I'll fly a little higher
Go up in the clouds because the view's a little nicer
Up Here, My Dear
It won't be long now, it won't be long now
