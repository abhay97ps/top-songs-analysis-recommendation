You spent the night
In a steel hotel
Where the birds whistled
Where the birds whistled
You have to wonder
What's goin' on
And maybe this time
You're overdrawn
This time around
The pressure's on
You hope for happiness
Your hands are scarred
I've seen your girl
You think she's cute
Don't make her crazy
Don't make her sad
The sky is painted
Deep shades of blue
I hope for happiness
I think of you
This time around
The pressure's on
You hope for happiness
Your hands are scarred
