It's love when you're
Feeling like a child of light
It makes beautiful people
A sun tripper through the night
What you need is love 
When the under current gets you down
With topaz illusions and
Shadow confusions around
Keep going in and out of it
In and out of it
In and out of the sun
Keep going in and out of it
In and out of it
In and out of the sunshine
Are you getting any sunshine
Are you getting any sunshine
Sunshine, baby, sunshine, baby
It's love 
When you're going down a shining path
With the needles of sunshine
Weaving their way through the grass
What you need is love 
When you're tangled in a plastic dream
Baby, turn on the fever
And be a sun beamer with me
And we're going in and out of it
In and out of it
In and out of the sun
Keep going in and out of it
In and out of it
In and out of the sunshine
Are you getting any sunshine
Are you getting any sunshine
Sunshine, baby, sunshine, baby
It's love 
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh
What you need is love 
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh
What you need is love
