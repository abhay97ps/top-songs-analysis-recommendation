I was sitting in traffic for the fifth year in a row
Wasting my time just to get where I don't even wanna go
I started jotting things down on a Krispy Kreme sack
Everything I'd do if I could leave this place and never look back
I wanna do it all
Visit Paris in the fall
Watch the Yankees play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition, lay down the law
I wanna do it all
I wanna drink tequila down in Tijuana
Say, "why not" when somebody says, "hey do you wanna"
I wanna get my heart broke once or twice
Settle down with the love of my life
Rock little babies to sleep at night
I wanna do it all
Visit Paris in the fall
Watch the Yankees play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition, lay down the law
I wanna do it all
I wanna spend today, every now and then
Just doing what I wanna do
When I wanna do it
Anytime I wanna do it
I wanna do it all
Visit Paris in the fall
Watch the Yankees play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition, lay down the law
I wanna do it all
See Niagra Falls, fight City Hall
Feel good in my skin, beating the odds with my back to the wall
Trying to rob Peter without paying Paul
I wanna do it all, I wanna do it all, I wanna do it all
