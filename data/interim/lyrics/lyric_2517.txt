The world is full of lonely people
I know because I'm one of them
I don't have someone who
I can give my kisses to or share my heartaches
When I am feeling blue
I'm in the world of lonely people
Who wait around for someone's call
I know that feeling of wanting someone you can love
But having no one at all
Once I had a guy
And though I loved him so
He cared for someone else
So sad to see him go
I need him so
I'm in the world of lonely people
And here I'll stay till who knows when
All I can do is cry
And count the minutes ticking by
Until he's in my arms again
All I can do is cry
And count the minutes ticking by
Until he's in my arms again
Until he's in my arms again
Until he's in my arms again
