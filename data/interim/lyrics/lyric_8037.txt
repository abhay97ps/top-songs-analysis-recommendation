Baby, when I found out you were lyin'
Playin' around and connivin'
Undesired tears I was cryin'
'Cause sugar coated lies I was buyin'
I was just a backseat driver in a car of love
Goin' wherever you take me
Don't know why I put up with the pain
'Cause nobody else could make me
You got me goin' 
You got me goin'  Hey, hey 
You got me goin' 
You got me goin'  Hey, hey 
When you led me to the water I drank it
Man, I drank more than I could hold
When you took my mind and body
You know you wanna take my soul
Where can I run
Where can I hide
Who can I talk to
Tell me what, what can I do
When you got me goin' 
You got me goin'  Hey, hey 
You got me goin' 
You got me goin'  Hey, hey 
Hee...you got me goin' 
You got me goin'  Hey, hey 
Been around with every guy in town 
Funny but I just can't put you down 
You got me goin' 
You got me goin'
