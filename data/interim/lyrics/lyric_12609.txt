Wet my whistle
Wet my whistle
Wet my whistle
Just like sweet wine baby
Your love's intoxicatin'
Why'd I had to taste it mmh
This is much too good to waste it
So baby let me love you
I'll place no one above you
Cause I'm hooked babe
On your love
Just because
I just had to wet my whistle
When I kissed your lips girl
I couldn't get enough
I had to wet my whistle
Just a little bit baby
Was much too much
Wet my whistle
First I was only playin'
Now look where love is layin'
So softly on my pillow 
I'll never ever let you go 
Love was never on my mind
I thought I'd better take my time
But girl you drive me crazy
 You're so fine
And I'm hooked baby
On your love
Yes I'm hooked baby
I just can't get enough
Said I'm hooked baby
On your love
Just because
I just had to wet my whistle
When I kissed your lips girl
I couldn't get enough
I had to wet my whistle
Just a little bit baby
Was much too much
I had to wet my whistle
When I kissed your lips girl
I couldn't get enough
I had to wet my whistle
Just a little bit baby
Was much too much
Wet my whistle 
 Ooh
 Baby
 Just a little bit
 On your love
 Baby
 Whoa whoa
 Baby
 Baby
 Whoa whoa
 Ooh baby
 Ooh baby yeah
I just had to wet my whistle
When I kissed your lips girl
I couldn't get enough
I had to wet my whistle
Just a little bit baby
Was much too much too much
I had to wet my whistle
Oh when I kissed your lips baby
You know how to drive me crazy
Oh oh
Was much too much
I just had to wet my whistle
