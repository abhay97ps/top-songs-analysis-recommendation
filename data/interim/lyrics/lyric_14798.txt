In the middle of the darkness
Creepin' round your door
In the shadows of a foggy night
Can you hear 'em call
Reachin' out for something
That's not really there
Just another lonely night
There's danger in the air
In the back of an alley
Don't step around
Somebody's watching
Don't make a sound
With a hush and a whisper
Another teardrop falls
You wanna fight the feelin'
Can't you hear your momma call
As you gaze in wonder
At the things you see
Never stop hopin'
What will never be
That's right, that's right
Never walk the streets at night
No, not alone
You wait for a reason
You're puttin' your life on the line
Can you get back home?
I wanna get back home
You're backed in an corner
Up against the wall
You can't move but you're fallin'
Gotta try and grab a hold
Your heart keeps pounding
And as you close your eyes
You feel it slippin' away
You gotta find some place to hide
As you gaze in wonder
At the things you see
Never stop hopin'
What will never be
That's right, that's right
Never walk the streets at night
No, not alone
You wait for a reason
You're puttin' your life on the line
Can you get back home? Yeah
No, that's right, that's right
Never walk the streets at night
No, not alone
You wait for a reason
You're puttin' your life on the line
Can you get back home?
That's right, that's right
Never walk the streets at night
No, not alone
You wait for a reason
You're puttin' your life on the line
Can you get back home?
That's right, that's right
Never walk the streets at night
No, not alone
You wait for a reason
You're puttin' your life on the line
Can you get back home?
