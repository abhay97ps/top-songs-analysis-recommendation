I stand at your gate
And the song that I sing
Is of you, love
I stand and I wait
For the touch of your hand
And of you, love
The roses are crying
A moonlight serenade
The stars are aglow
And tonight how their light
Sets me dreaming
My love, do you know
That your eyes are
Like stars brightly shining
I bring you and sing you
A moonlight serenade
Let us stray till break of day
In love's valley of dreams
Just you and I, a summer sky
A heavenly breeze kissing the trees
So don't let me wait
Come to me tenderly
In the moonlight
I stand at your gate
And I sing you a song
In the moonlight
A love song, my darling
A moonlight serenade
Let us stray till break of day
In love's valley of dreams
Just you and I, a summer sky
A heavenly breeze kissing the trees
So don't let me wait
Come to me tenderly
In the moonlight
I stand at your gate
And I sing you a song
In the moonlight
A love song, my darling
A moonlight serenade
