I look at your face, is that the face I love?
It's been a long time since I've seen you
You got a lovely place, the kids both send their love
We still get lonely, baby, without you
And girl, you don't have to walk in the rain anymore
'Cause baby, I know things could be just the same as before
When you walk through my door, you'll be home
You don't have to walk in the rain
Walk through my door, you'll be home
I was so afraid, I almost turned away
But you know I need somebody to cling to
I look at your face, I love you anyway
It's been a long time since I've seen you
And girl, you don't have to walk in the rain anymore
'Cause darlin', I know things could be just the same as before
When you walk through my door, you'll be home
Girl, you don't have to walk in the rain anymore
'Cause, baby, I know things could be just the same as before
When you walk through my door, you'll be home, girl
You don't have to walk in the rain
Walk through your door, you'll be home
Girl, you don't have to walk in the rain anymore
No, you don't have to walk in the rain anymore
Yeah yeah, you don't have to walk in the rain anymore
