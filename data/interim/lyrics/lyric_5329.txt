Sweet  young thing
Like you 
You've gone and made me
Lose my cool
Sweet  young thing
Like you 
You're all I need
To see me through
I said I'd never love again
I've always been on the losing end
When you touched my hand
I knew right there and then
I loved you, I loved you, baby
I love you
 sweet young thing
Like you 
You've gone and made me
Lose my cool
Sweet  young thing
Like you 
Yeah, babe, you're all I need
To see me through
My whole life was upside down
Misery and heartbreak
Followed me around
Things that used to make me sad
Have got a brand new sound
I love you, I love you, baby
I love you
Sweet  young thing
Like you 
You've gone and made me
Lose my cool
Sweet  young thing
Like you 
You're all I need
To see me through
