How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you, yeah
High up, you're falling back down
Trapped in a concept, falsely accused
Misused and misled
Bitch, I'm hopin' you fuckin' rest in peace
Now the fact that I'm alone is fuckin' comfortin'
And I can't seem to shake this fuckin' feeling in myâ€¦
Uh, cold shoulder, heartbroken, misspoken
I'm cut open, her fingers in all my stab wounds
And if she could, she'd probably dance on my grave
Inside my head, I see your face
I fuckin' hate that I love you still 
Carry on, like flights, I just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, like flights, I just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, like flights, I just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Yeah
How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you, yeah
High up, you're falling back down
