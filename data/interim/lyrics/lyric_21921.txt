Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water 
And I think of all the things, what you're doin'
And in my head I paint a picture 
'Cause since I've come on home 
Well, my body's been a mess 
And I've missed your ginger hair 
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie?
 Valerie-e-e 
Va-a-lerie yeah 
Valerie-e-e 
Did you have to go to jail
Put your house on up for sale
Did you get a good lawyer-e-er?  
I hope you didn't catch a tan 
I hope you find the right man who'll fix it for you 
Now are you shopping anywhere 
Changed the color of your hair 
And are you busy?  
And did you have to pay that fine 
That you were dodging all the time 
Are you still dizzy-y-y? 
Since I've come on home 
Well my body's been a mess 
And I've missed your ginger hair 
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie?
Valerie-e-e 
Va-a-lerie yeah 
Valerie-e-e 
Well, sometimes I go out by myself 
And I look across the water 
And I think of all the things, what you're doing 
And in my head I paint a picture 
'Cause since I've come on home 
Well, my body's been a mess 
And I've missed your ginger hair 
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop makin' a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie?
Valerie-e-e 
Va-a-lerie yeah
Valerie-e-e

Valerie Valerie 
Why don't you come on over Valerie?
