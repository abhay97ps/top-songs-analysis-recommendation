There's a boy I know
He's the one I dream of, ooh-ooh
Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the clouds above, mmm
Oh, I lose control 
Can't seem to {Get enough, uh huh}
When I wake from dreaming 
Tell me is it 
 How will I know? 
How will I {know}
 How will I know? 
How will I {know}
How will I know? 
I say a prayer  heart beat
I fall in love 
I'm asking you 
How will I know? 
I try to phone  {Can't speak}
Falling in love 
This love is strong 
I'm shaking {Ooh-ooh}
I wish I had you 
 mistaking 
What I feel is  
Oh, tell me
If he loves me 
If he loves me
If he loves me not 
If he loves me 
If he loves me
If he loves me not
Oh! How will I know?
How will I know?
If he's thinking of me
I try to phone  {Can't speak}
Falling in love 
This love is strong 
How will I know?
How will I know if he really loves me? 
I say a prayer with every heart beat 
I fall in love whenever we meet 
I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things 
How will I know?
