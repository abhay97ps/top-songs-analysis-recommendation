Cristina: Uh...Uh.
Cristina: Oh you're stupid. Oh God. You're stupid, evil, sadist and I wanna kill you.
Meredith: Endorphins are good. Endorphins are mood elevators. This is supposed to make us feel better.
Cristina: Oh god. Do you feel better?
Meredith: I'm stupid.
Cristina: Slutty mistress.
Meredith: Pregnant whore.
Cristina: Sleeping with our bosses was a great idea.
Meredith: You know what's ruined for me?
Cristina : Ah?
Meredith: Ferry boats. I used to love ferry boats and Derek's got a thing for ferry boats. Now every time I see a frigging ferry boat...
Cristina : You know what's ruined for me? Coronary artery by-pass grafts ... and aortic aneurysms. God I used to love aortic aneurysms.
MVO: Surgeons are control freaks. With a scalpel in your hand, you feel unstoppable. There's no fear, there's no pain.
Meredith: Have you cried yet?
Cristina: Hello?
MVO: You're 10 feet tall and bullet proof.
Cristina: Do you think we'll feel better if we cry? You know like just let it out?
Meredith: Probably. Yeah.
MVO: And then you leave the O.R.
Cristina : Do you wanna cry now?
Meredith: No.
Cristina: Okay, lets, lets jog.
MVO: And all that perfection. All that beautiful control just falls to crap.
Cristina: What is she doing?
George : She's hanging out with Alex.
Cristina: Why?
George : I dunno. I think ... ... I think they might be friends.
.
George : Make the lambs stop screaming.
Izzie: You guys are wrong about him, alright? Once you get to know him, he's really sweet.
George: He's Alex.
Cristina: Punk ass.
Alex : Hey Grey. Izzie was telling me you have tapes of your mom performing surgery. I'd kill to see the Ellis Grey in action.
Izzie : Hey you know what? Maybe you can come over tonight and we can all watch it together? Right?
Meredith: Oh yeah, if this were a hell dimension.
Cristina: Yeah, run away pig boy.
George: Do you have a thing for Alex?
Izzie: No.
Cristina : Oh.
Izzie: I don't.
Cristina: Oh!
Bailey: Are we saving lives or having a tea party? Walk faster people.
Richard: Ah hem.
Derek: Nice hat.
Richard: Shut up.
Derek: What are you doing here?
Richard: I'm going back to work.
Derek: You're not cleared for surgery.
Richard: Leave me alone. I've been sitting home for a week watching Oprah giving away things on TV.  Oprah, Derek! ... You clear me now or I'll hurt you.
Derek: If you want me to clear you so soon, maybe you should've thought about that before you gave chief to Burke and invited Satan to Seattle.
Richard: Satan?
Addison : Good morning. Richard, like the hat.
Derek: Satan speaks.
Addison: Actually I prefer to be called ruler of all that is evil. . But I will answer to Satan.
Derek: What is she still doing here?
Richard: I asked her to stay. We have a pediatric surgery attending on maternity leave.
Addison : Actually I could use you on a consult. Will you ah meet me up there Derek?
Derek: Ah yeah. Fine
Derek: I'm not clearing you for surgery.
Richard: Fine, I can catch up on my paperwork.
Cristina: Mr. Gaston is scheduled for resection non-small cell carcinoma today. He did well overnight, has remained afebrile. He's had a dose of ceftriaxone this morning. He's pre-op labs are unremarkable. His chest x-rays, um, are unchanged from the previous.
Mr. Gaston: I own a couple of dry-cleaning stores. Never believed what they said about inhaling the chemicals, but...
Burke: We're going to do everything we can for you, Mr. Gaston.  Did Oncology see him yet?
Cristina: Uh, they're waiting for the surgical path.
Burke: Thank you, Dr. Yang.
Cristina: You're welcome, Dr. Burke.
Meredith: I know. I just think you should still tell him about the baby because he'd at least have the responsibility of having to pay.
Cristina: No! You know what? He'll never know. It's over. Once this pregnancy is taken care of, Burke won't even be a blip on my radar. He'll be smudge.
Meredith : Right.
Cristina: You know, Meredith? ... Leave the sarcasm up to me ... Really, it doesn't suit you.
Alex: Kelly Roche. She's 23 years old. In for a scheduled ETS for treatment of her erythrophobia hyperpyrexia.
Izzie : Erythrophobia?
Cristina: Blushing.
Bailey : You have any questions about the procedure?
Kelly: Oh. Dr. Sh ...  ... Dr. Shepherd explained everything. He was very... huh...helpful. He gave me some literat ...  ... sorry...
Alex: Don't be. Half the patients that come through here have the hots for Shepherd.
Bailey : Dr. Karev.
Alex: What? ... It's true.
Izzie: Hey, why do you do that?
Alex: What?
Izzie: Act like an ass when everybody but me is around, they hate you enough as it is.
Alex : So? ...  What?
Bailey: Hey there's a new surgical case coming up from the pit. Likely diverticulitis. Let's go.
Woman: Watch it! Hands off me! I could report you to the chief and you'd be out on your ass.
Ellis: Where is the chief?!?
Cristina: Patient's name is ...ah...
Ellis: Where is the chief?!? You're all amateurs.
Cristina: complaining of intermittent cramping pain and diarrhea. Also suffers from ...ah...
Ellis : AMATEURS!
Cristina: Alzheimer's.
Bailey: Patient's name?
Cristina: Um...
Bailey: Yang! Patient's name!
Ellis : What the hell are you doing here?
Ellis : Haven't I told? How many times have I told you not to bother me when I'm at work?!
Cristina: Ellis Grey.
George: Meredith's mother.
Ellis : You're amateurs! You're amateurs!
George: Meredith, are you okay?
Bailey : Just zip. . Dr. Karev stick with ETS case and Alex her blushing impulse not a toy for you to play with or button for you to push. Understood?
Cristina : Hey Meredith, you know um my great grandmother, she died with Alzheimer's.
Izzie: My god, why would you say that?
Cristina: Look, I'm just trying to help.
Bailey: Izzie, the Dr. Shepherd's need an intern up in the NICU.
Izzie: Wait, both of them? ... To..gether...and me by myself with the two married people who hate each other?
Bailey: Go.
Bailey: Christina you're on the thoracotomy.
Cristina: With Burke? Oh can I have the hateful married couple instead?
Bailey : Okay, I'm sorry I thought that I was your resident not your hostess. I assign, you take. Is that a problem?
Cristina : N-nn
Bailey : Is there some reason why it's inconvenient for you to spend the day in the OR. learning from Dr. Burke?
Cristina: No. I'm very happy to be working with Dr. Burke. Thank you very much.
Bailey: George, take care of Dr. Grey.
George: Yes. Thank you.  She needs a friend right now.
.
Bailey: What?
George: Oh you mean Ellis the ...  mother.
Bailey: Are you able to work today?
Meredith: Yes. I'm fine.
Bailey: Cause I would understand it if you wanted to be with your ...
Meredith: No. My mother and I don't have the easiest...it's just better if I'm working.
Bailey: Okay. You're on scut.
Meredith: Excuse me?
Bailey: While we take care of your mother, you can catch up on charting, run samples to the lab, go over 
Meredith: I told you, I'm fine.
Bailey: Yea and I appreciate that you're fine but I have to anticipate a certain level of distraction from you today. Even in the face of all that fineness. So scut now!
Derek: Where's the mother?
Addison: Gone. She stuck around long enough to get the kid strung out and then took off. Nice, huh?
Derek : Addison!
Addison: Derek I know it's a long shot. I know that.
Derek: You told me you had a newborn with an invasive mash. You fail to mention that she's premature, underweight and addicted to narcotics. There's no way that this baby is going to survive spinal surgery.
Addison: You don't know that.
Derek: Even if she does, she's a mess. She'll just get meningitis seizures. She's going to live a short painful life.
Addison: You don't know that.
Derek: It's my job to know that.
Addison: You're not God Derek.
Derek: Excuse me?
Addison: I'm sorry honey but you're not. You don't get to decide 
Derek: Wait did you just call me honey . Don't call me honey!
Addison: Fine. You're not god Dr. Shepherd. Look if a patient has any chance at survival, which I think she does, then you have a responsibility 
Derek: Don't talk to me about responsibility.
Addison: You took an oath Derek!
Derek: Oh don't you dare talk to me about oaths!
Addison: Derek, I messed up. People mess up.
Derek: You slept with my best friend in my favorite sheets.
Addison: The flannel sheets? You hate the flannel sheets.
Derek: No I love the sheets.
Addison: You like the Italian sheets with the paisleys 
Derek: Would you just stop talking about the sheets?
Addison: Fine!
Izzie: Look I'm sorry. I'm just gonna go. I'll go check on the labs.
Derek: Addison, don't do this.
Addison: Derek ... look she's a fighter. Look how far she's come already.
Derek: Don't get attached. Don't get involved. Just ... don't make her life more painful than it already is.
Addison: Derek, please. She has nobody. She needs someone to fight for her.
Derek: She's too far gone. You have to let her go. Let her go in peace.
Addison : Fine Derek, walk away. It's what you do best.
Burke: I've enjoyed the opportunity to show you my capabilities in this arena however brief.
Richard: Stop fishing, Preston. You did a good job. ... But I'm back now and I don't plan on going anywhere, anytime soon.
Burke: I am glad that you're back. I'm just hiding my joy...deep down inside.  And ah chief ... the hat ... it's a little pimped out.
Meredith: Welcome back chief.
Richard: It's good to be back, Dr. Grey. Uh what can I do for you:
Meredith: It's my mother sir.
Meredith: I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. I know you two are close. But she made me promise. She seems to be reliving the heyday of her residency a lot these days. And I just thought maybe if you could stop by and say hello, it would mean a lot to her.
Richard : Well of course.  Do you need a day off?
Meredith: Oh no. I'm fine.
Richard: Yeah.
Meredith: Okay 
George: Um...if you could just hold still
Ellis: I'm in the middle of my work day Thatch.
George: Thatch? No, I'm Dr. O'Malley.  Okay. I just need to check your...
Ellis: Darling I'm not in the mood to play doctor now. Hands off, I'm busy. Um...
Meredith: George.
George: Um.
Ellis: Damn it Thatcher I mean it no.
Meredith: George.
Meredith: She's allergic to penicillin.
George: Yeah? Oh yeah it said on her chart.
Meredith: Oh. ... You just have to be patient.
George: Okay. Do you um ... who's Thatch?
Meredith: My dad, Thatcher. ... What did she ... is she ... is she talking about him?
George: Um...yeah. She's...
Meredith: She never talks about him.
George: You're, you're all right.
Meredith: No, yeah, yeah. I'm good.
George : Good.
Meredith: Um. I can't be here.
George: Of course, I mean we're good here, we're great, so...
Meredith: Okay.
George: Okay.
Meredith: Dr. Shepherd.
Derek: Meredith. I heard. Is it true?
Meredith: Yeah. Secret's out.
Derek : Ohhh.
Meredith: Dr. Shepherd, I ... 
Derek: You don't have to call me Dr. Shepherd.
Meredith : Dr. Shepherd. I want in on a surgical case. I can't just do nothing all day.  And you owe me this. And I never ask you for anything like this, so...
Derek: I have ETS this afternoon. You'll scrub in.
Doctor: Here Dr. Yang.
Burke: You're late.
Cristina: I apologize.
Doctor: Suction.
Burke: Just starting to dissect around Mr. Gaston's tumor.
Burke: I've almost got visualization.
Derek: Hey Kelly.
Kelly: Dr. Shep  Dr. Shepherd. God. Sorry. Damn it.
Derek: Kelly.
Kelly: Yup. 
DErek: Kelly.
Kelly: Mmm hmm.
Derek: This might be the last time that ever happens.  How are her labs?
Alex: H&H are stable. Chest x-rays show no acute process.
Derek: Good. You're ready to go?
Kelly: Are you kidding? I've been ready since the 3rd grade.
Derek: Did you read the literature I gave you?  You understand the possible side-effects?
Kelly: Compensatory sweating of the back, abdomen, thighs and legs. Possible gustatory sweating. Horner's syndrome occurs in less than 1% of patients. Brachial plexus injury. Pneumothorax and hemothorax are highly unlikely but possible side effects of the surgery.
Derek: You did your homework. . Take her to pre-op. I'll alert the O.R.
Alex: Do you know what all those words mean?  Brachial plexus injury could cause paralysis of the arms. Pneumothorax is a collapsed lung.
Kelly: I know 
Meredith: Are you sure you want to risk all of that? Over a little bit of blushing.
Kelly: Is that ... what you think this is? A little bit of blushing? Just a school girl embarrassment? You both saw what happened when Dr. Shep ...  ... when Dr. Shepherd was here. What did you think?
Alex: Well I thought you liked him.
Kelly: I do but you think I wanna room full of doctors to know about it?
Alex: It's not like we're gonna...
Kelly: It's not just you guys. It's not just this once. It happens ... every time I have a feeling for anyone ... in my life.  I can't ... get mad. I can't be happy. I can't feel anything without the whole world knowing. I can't have a secret. Can you imagine living that way you're entire life?
Ellis : Get away from me you insipid little man.
George: Dr. Grey calm down.
Ellis: Get out of here! Get out of my room now!
George: Dr. Grey calm down!
Ellis: Get away from my house!
George: Please!
Nurse: What can I do?
George: Calm down!  Please get some haloperidol.
Ellis: Don't give me that look. That sapful, little soulful puppy routine. I know it by heart, Thatch! And I'm over it.
Ellis: I don't wanna hear about your day, your students, your pathetic little research grants. My ... my work is what counts! It's what pays for this house. It's pays for ... it pays for you! And it pays for, it pays for Meredith!  And your precious lifestyle. So why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it!  Meredith make thinks she needs you but sure as hell don't.
George: Dr. Grey.
Nurse: Here it is.
Kelly: Are you okay?
Meredith: That's something I'm supposed to be asking you.
Richard: O'Malley.  I understand you're working on Ellis Grey.
George: Yes sir, I'm trying my best.
Richard: Right. Keep me informed of her progress and take good care of her. She's an old friend of mine.
George: Really? Because actually I could use some help. Could, could you help me ... examine her?
Richard: Um, ah... I'm just a little busy just now...uh..ah...gotta run.
George: Right. Okay. It's just that she seems to think that I'm her ex-husband and she won't let me touch her.
Richard: It's funny you do...look a bit like Thatcher.
George : I look a bit like Meredith's dad?
Richard: Um...just take good care of her George.
George: But...like her dad? ... ... I need help.
Alex: Hey.
Izzie: Hey.
Alex: Woah, wait, wait.
Izzie: What?
Alex: You have an eyelash.  Make a wish and blow it away.
Alex: Hey Nurse Ratchet, there's a dead guy stinking up Room 41 25. Do something about it before he rots!
Izzie: See? That is exactly what I'm talking about.
Alex: Come on.
Izzie: Why are you so up-tight in showing people that you're a decent human being?
George: Remember when he wallpapered the hospital with pictures of you in your underwear?
Izzie: Yeah... Yeah I do. 
Alex: That was before I knew you.  Thanks man, very helpful.
George: I need you to help me do an exam on Meredith's mom.
Alex : Oh a standard exam. You did go to med school, right?
George: She thinks I'm her ex-husband. She won't let me.
George: Dr. Grey.
Ellis: Oh damn it Thatcher I'm at work. I've already told you I'm too busy to deal with you now. No more cartoons.
George: She means interruptions.
Alex: No more interruptions Thatch. You heard the doctor. 
Hi ma'am I'm Dr. Karev.  Please to meet you Dr. Grey. I've always admired your work.
Ellis: So you're familiar with the laparoscopic-grey method?
Alex: Oh I've studied footage of the operation you pioneered.  You're something else.
Ellis: Good. Well then we're wasting time. Let's scrub in.
Alex: Well Dr. Grey I'm going to need to do a short exam before you start surgery. I know. New hospital policy. Annoying PR crap.
Ellis: Ah!  Make it quick.
Alex: Why don't you wait outside Thatcher? I can take it from here.
Alex: Take a deep breath.
Izzie: She's got a good grip.
Addison: Yeah.
Izzie: I don't think, ...  it doesn't look good.
Addison: She's a got a resistant strain of pneumococcus. The antibiotics aren't working. You may want to get yourself reassigned Dr. Stevens. I don't think we'll be operating today.
Izzie: So do you think Dr. Shepherd was right?
Addison: She's just too far gone ... She does have a good grip.
Burke: The tumor has infiltrated the pericardium.
Burke: Yang.  Yang!
Cristina: What, sorry?
Burke: Is my surgery interrupting your daydreaming?
Cristina: No. Sorry.
Bailey: You have a problem?
Izzie: No.
Bailey: You have a mocha latte?
Izzie: No.
Bailey: Then go away.
Izzie: Actually I need a new assignment. The uh Shepherds' preemie case is not surgical.
Bailey: Not surgical?
Izzie: Non-operable.
Bailey: Sucks.
Izzie: Yeah.
Bailey: Did you know about Ellis Grey? Did Meredith tell you?
Izzie: No. It's just that you think, you think you know someone. You know who they are. You share a house. Make wishes on eyelashes with them. ... We don't know each other. None of us. We're just a bunch of interns who work together. There's nothing there.
Burke: There is an arrhythmia when I press down on the tumor. That is a sign of what, Yang?
Cristina: Um ... ... ah it's a sign of, it's a ... it's a sign that the uh tumor has infiltrated the pericardium.
Burke: Possibilities?
Cristina: In all...I'm sorry. I ...
Burke: Do your homework Yang. It could be causing a tear in the aortic muscle of the heart.
Doctor: Hmm. So he's got a broken heart.
Doctor: Dr. Yang are you okay?
Burke: Cristina. Cristina.
Burke: Somebody help her!
Burke: Cristina! Don't just stand there dammit. Somebody help her. Get a gurney in here!
Burke: Cristina.
Izzie: Cristina.
Bailey: We've got it Dr. Burke. We've got it.
Burke: Okay talk to me. Tell me what we do we know. What do we know? Talk to me Stevens.
Izzie: I don't know.
Burke: Come on people let's move.
Bailey: Cristina! What hurts?  Let's get her out of here. There's a patient on the table. Lift.
Bailey: Good, good.
Burke: Dr. Bailey when you get her stabilized, I need a report please.  Dr. Bailey?!
Bailey : Right Dr. Burke!
Bailey: Uh! Her pulse is racing. I need her on a monitor to get a BP. Also I want her started on a liter of LR wide open  Izzie run ahead to emergency and let them know we're on our way.
Izzie : What?
Cristina : Seven weeks. I'm pregnant Izzie. Izzie, I'm pregnant.
Bailey : Uh, okay no. We're going to pre-op instead.  Find Addison Shepherd. Izzie be discreet.
Addison: So I'm leaving in the morning.
Richard: No.
Addison: Excuse me?
Richard: No. I'm not accepting your resignation.
Addison: It's not a resignation Richard. It's notification. I don't officially work for you.
Addison: I came here for one case. I can track the twins progress from New York.
Richard: What about the preemie?
Addison: I'm letting go of the preemie, you know that. ... He calls me Satan, Richard.
Richard: You don't like to hide from a fight.
Addison: It's not a fight. He wins.  I'm leaving in the morning.
Richard: What is it O'Malley?
George: It's Dr. Grey, sir. Ellis.
George: CT confirmed diverticulitis but a liver mass was also found.
Richard: My god.
George: Poor Meredith. As if her mother having Alzheimer's isn't bad enough now she has to deal with liver cancer.
Richard: You won't know that its cancer until you do a biopsy O'Malley.
George: Right. Sorry.
Izzie: Excuse me Dr. Shepherd. We need you fast.  Um...it's Cristina, one of our interns. She's ...  she's collapsed.
George: Cristina's collapsed?
Addison : Why do you need me?
George: Cristina's pregnant?!
Izzie: Shut up George.  Please come.
Addison: This doesn't change anything Richard I'm still leaving in the morning.
George: This is a very bad day.
Derek: Okay Dr. Karev if were going to stop her blushing we have to expose the sympathetic ganglion chain, which resides where?
Richard: It's time to clear me for surgery Shepherd.
Derek: What?
Richard: I know you heard me. I'm standing right here.
Derek: Chief I'm a little busy. We'll talk about it later.
Richard: Just give a verbal okay and we can do the paperwork later.
Derek: I cannot do that.
Richard: I am your chief of surgery. This is not a request.
Derek: With all do respect, sir in this situation I am not your subordinate. I'm your doctor. Once week after brain surgery, you are not ready to resume medical practice.
Richard: It's a simple procedure. A needle biopsy. A resident could do it.
Derek: So let a resident do it. What am I missing here?
Meredith: It's for my mother, isn't it? You think she has cancer?
Richard: George needs your signature.
Derek: Look Richard I know she's your friend but I'm not clearing you for surgery.
Meredith: What's her total bili?
George: It's actually only 4.  It's not great but it's not terrible.
Meredith: That's why I didn't see the jaundice
George : No one could we just have to wait and see.
Meredith: What aren't you telling me?
George: It's Cristina.
Addison: Have you notified the father?
Bailey: Cristina? Cristina? Uh, Cristina? Cristina? Is there anyone we can call?  Oh we're losing her.
Addison : Oh man do you see that? It's an extra uterine pregnancy in the tube there. She's bleeding out.
Richard: Ah good you're finished. I need you to do a needle biopsy.
Burke: Uh...gotta go check on ... there's someone I need to see about. I had an intern collapse on me in the middle of surgery so if this can wait...
Richard : No I need you to do a needle biopsy now.
Burke: Chief now is not the time.
Richard: Look, I'm not in the mood for a debate. You understand. You'll do it because I asked you to.
Richard: Because I need you to.  It's Ellis Grey.
Izzie: She's gonna be okay, right?
Addison: How attached was she to this pregnancy?
Izzie: I don't know. She's a pretty private person.
Addison: She's lost a lot of blood but I've got it from here.  Dr. Bailey you must have a surgery or two of your own today.
Bailey: I'm fine right here.
Meredith : Can you do the follow up? I wanna check on Cristina.
Alex: Yeah. You know what's wrong with her?
Meredith : Don't!
Derek: Sorry.
Meredith: Don't be sorry. I'm so tired it, you being sorry.
Derek: Dr. 
Meredith: Don't do it!
Derek: Dr. Grey ...
Meredith : Dr. Grey, seriously. Are you concerned about Alex finding out about us? Is that what matters to you? Do you really think he cares?
Meredith : Alex do you care that I was the intern stupid enough to screw the married attending?
Alex: No.
Derek: It's okay.
Meredith : It's not okay! You have a wife who's not easy to hate.  Who's annoyingly kind and painfully smart and currently saving my friend's life.
Derek : Meredith just... 
Meredith: Don't! Stop talking to me like you're my boyfriend! Stop talking to me at all.
Alex: Dude, that was rough.
Bailey: Need something?
Meredith: I'm coming in.
Bailey: No you're not.
Meredith: I am. I'm her friend.
Bailey: Exactly. She's lying on the operating table, naked, exposed. She's sedated but she's probably scared out of her mind. Now right now she's not a doctor. She's not your friend. She's a patient and she deserves to have all the privacy I can give her. You're not going in there.
Meredith : We went jogging this morning. I made her go jogging. There's no way that could of?
Bailey: No. It started out this way. Nothing caused it to happen.
Meredith: You have to let me in there.
Bailey : You can try. I'd have to take you down. Hey I might be short but you're pretty tiny. I could do it.
Meredith: Right now. Just in this moment. I hate you.
Bailey: Hmm, yeah well I can take it.
Burke: Alright Dr. Grey we're going to put you to sleep for a little while, but I promise we'll have you back into surgery in no time.
Ellis: Richard, thank god you're here. You beautiful man. That husband of mine is making me crazy.
Addison: Look at that, BP is stabilizing.
Derek: She's stronger since this morning.  There's no reason in the world why she should be stronger since this morning.
Addison: She's really beautiful, isn't she?
Derek: I'll tell you what. If she makes it through the night, if she has a little bit more strength I'll operate.
Addison : You know the way I see it we could deal with us in one of three ways.
Addison: Option 1. I could apologize. You could forgive me and come home and we could move on with our lives like adults. Or, option 2. I could apologize. You could forgive me, come home but, you can still bring it up to use against me whenever we argue.
Derek: Are you trying to be funny?
Addison: Satan has a sense of humor.
Derek: What's the 3rd?
Addison: I don't know what the 3rd option is.
Addison: I just know that I still love you.
Burke: Tell them the chief said to put a rush on this biopsy. Tell them it's Ellis Grey.
George: Okay.
George: Dr. Burke do you want the histological grade and staging or any specific stains?
Burke: Have them run all tests.
(He continues to stare at the board. The camera focuses in on next to C.YANG:
EXPLOARATORY LAPAROTOMY
ECTOPIC PREGANCY
PRPS. SALPINGO - OOPHERECTOMY
INPATIENT
Dr. Burke is shocked)
Cristina: What happened?
Bailey: You had an extra uterine pregnancy. Your left fallopian tube burst.  Dr. Shepherd ... she did everything she could but there was too much damage. She couldn't save the tube.
Kelly: Hey.
Meredith: Hey.
Kelly: Is it over?
Meredith: Mmm hmm. The surgery was successful. We're just doing a follow up. Dr. Shepherd will be in to check on you in a while.
Kelly: Say that again.
Alex: What?
Kelly: Say his name. Dr. Shepherd.  Oh my god look at my face. Dr. Shepherd. Dr. Shepherd.
Meredith: Guess it was worth the risk. 
Alex: Still think its nuts having major surgery just so people can't tell how you're feeling.
Meredith: Really, you do?
Alex: Nah. I guess not.  You could talk you know. If you need to.
Meredith: I'm fine.
Alex: You've said that word so many times today it doesn't even sound like a work anymore. Just saying you can talk to me cause even if I repeat every word you say no one around here likes me. They'll just call me a liar and move on.
Meredith : Izzie likes you. . You're blushing.
Alex: Shut up.  Look for what it's worth, I don't know how you're still on your feet. If I found out my mom might have cancer I'd be under the bar right now.
Meredith: You want the ugly truth?
Alex: What you have an ugly truth?  I never would have picked you to have an ugly truth.
Meredith: I'm more afraid she doesn't have cancer.
Alex: Well. Liver cancer's fast. Painful but its fast and they give you morphine. They don't give you morphine for Alzheimer's.
Meredith: No they don't.  What kind of person wishes their mother has cancer?
Richard : It's hard. I know its hard being the one who's gone. But man it isn't easy being the one who's still around.
Izzie: Hey did you get your mom's biopsy results back yet?
George: Not yet.
Meredith: How's Cristina?
Izzie : She's ah... she's gonna have a lotta pain for a few days but she'll be okay.
Meredith: I'm glad you were there.
Izzie: Are you?
Meredith: Yes, I am.
Izzie: It's just  it's just that a lot of the time it feels like you and Cristina are kinda over there and ... I'm here.
Meredith: So bout Alex.
Izzie: Yeah I know, I know. You guys hate him. Fine.

Lab Tech: Here you go.  Ellis Grey.

Ellis: Oh please Thatcher I've had a long day. Go away
George: No! 
Ellis: What?
George: No.  I am Thatcher Grey and I'm your husband. And uh I know you don't like me very much but ... the fact is I don't always like you very much either.  I don't like the way you speak to me. And I really hate the way you speak to Meredith. She deserves better from you.
Ellis: I'm sorry.
George: You are?
Ellis: What's wrong with me Thatch?

Derek: Meredith?
Meredith : Oh.
Derek: Meredith.
Meredith : Don't. ... Please, please just don't say anything.
Derek: Okay.

Izzie: Hmm
MVO: And still there are times when it just gets away from you.
MVO: When the world stops spinning. And you realize that your shiny little scalpel isn't gonna save you.
Burke: We went in expecting to simply remove the tumor. Instead it was a little more complicated. The tumor infiltrated into the pericardium causing a tear in the outer muscle of the heart.
Mr. Gaston: Um. That's a lot of medical talk.
Burke : It means um ...  It means ... that you had... you had a broken heart literally.  um ... but now I am um ...  but now you're going to be fine.
MVO: No matter how hard you fight it. You fall. And its scary as hell.
MVO: Except there's an upside to free falling. It's the chance you give your friends to catch you.
