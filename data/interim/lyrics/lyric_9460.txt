Well, well, well
Here we are
Me and you
Shoop shoop
Me and you
Well, well, well
Singing like we used to do
Do wah ditty ditty
Do you remember the sweet sounds
Do you remember the good times
Do you remember how it
Used to be so fine 
You forget about the time
When we were street singing
We were beauties in the night
We were sweet street singing
With the future looking bright
I`ll remember street singing
For the rest of my life
Hey, hey, hey
Sure and we was nobody`s fool
No, no, nobody`s fool
Hey, hey, hey
Always playing super cool
Supe, supe, super cool
Do you remember the old days
Singing down in the subways
Do you remember
How we used to sound so fine 
And we didn`t have a dime
When we were street singing
We were beauties in the night
We were sweet street singing
With the future looking bright
I`ll remember street singing
For the rest of my life
Do lang, do lang, do lang
Shoo bop, shoo bop
Do lang, do lang, do lang
Shoo bop, shoo bop
Do lang, do lang, do lang
I`ll remember street singing
For the rest of my life
Oooh, remember, oooh
Street singing
Street singing
Street singing, do lang, do lang
Do lang, do lang, do lang
Street singing
Street singing
Street singing, papa oom mow mow
Papa oom mow mow.......
