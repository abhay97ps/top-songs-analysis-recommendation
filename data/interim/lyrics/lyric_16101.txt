Yeah
You are so special to me
It's got me going crazy
You don't know how I feel about you
It makes me do the things I do, girl
That's the way I feel
It makes me feel so good inside
 So real
And that's the way love is
It can make you laugh 
It can make you cry 
Feels so good inside
That's the way love is
It can make you change 
There's no one to blame 
Makes you go insane
That's the way love is 
You gave me love, you game me joy
You were there through the thick and thin
I don't know what I'll do without you
You've been there for me, and I'll be there for you
That's the way I feel
It makes me feel so good inside
 So real
'Cause that's the way love is
It can make you laugh 
It can make you cry 
Feels so good inside
It can make you change 
There's no one to blame 
Makes you go insane

Baby, I'm a perfect match to attach

One hand washing the other and
You're not watching another man
And he's not watching some other woman
No need to let the tough times leave a frown
Erase your blue face now, baby, you're with the Brown
He's here to take care of you like your doctor
Don't sweat nothing, Bob, she got ya
