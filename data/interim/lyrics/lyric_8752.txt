America needs you, Harry Truman
Harry, could you please come home?
Things are looking bad
I know you would be mad
To see what kind of men
Prevail upon the land you love
America's wondering, "How we got here?"
Harry, all we get is lies
We're getting safer cars
Rocket ships to Mars
From men who'd sell us out
To get themselves a piece of power
We'd love to hear you speak your mind
In plain and simple ways
Call a spade a spade
Just like you did back in the days
When you would play piano
Each morning walk a mile
Speak of what was going down
With honesty and style
America's calling, Harry Truman
Harry, you know what to do
The world is turning round
And losing lots of ground
Oh, Harry, is there something we can do to save the land we love?
Oh, woah, woah, woah
America's calling, Harry Truman
Harry, you know what to do
The world is turning round
And losing lots of ground
So, Harry, is there something we can do to save the land we love?
Oh!
Harry, is there something we can do to save the land we love?
Harry!
Harry, is there something we can do to save the land we love?
