Ain't No Sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no Sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gonna to stay
Ain't No Sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I know I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know....
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
