Baby, oh, let me love you
Let me, let me, let me, let me, let me
Let me love you
I'm gonna take you back home with me
And I know you might be afraid, darling
I wouldn't hurt one pretty little strand in your hair
Now, settle down, and try to relax
Let me show you how a woman acts
When a man gets to feelin' that he's got to have a love affair
Don't tell your mama, oh, no, girl
Where you're going, oh, no, now
Don't tell your ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mama where you've been, girl
Have you thought how good it could be?
Nobody but you and me?
I'd like to show you all the things we could do, alright
I'd like to show you how to kiss my lips, now
I'd like to show you how to shake your hips
Those are all the things a pretty girl oughta know how to do, now
Now, now, now, now
Baby, ooh, let me love you
Oh, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me
Let me love you
I'm gonna take you back home with me
And I know you might be afraid, darling
I wouldn't hurt one pretty little strand in your hair
I'd like to show you how to kiss my lips, now
I'd like to show you how to shake your hips
Those are all the things a pretty girl oughta know how to do
Do, do, do, do
Don't tell your mama, aw naw, no
Don't tell your mama, mama, mama, mama
She might not understand
