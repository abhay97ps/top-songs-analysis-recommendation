You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
Love is made, made of many things
One of them is trust, but I can't trust you anymore
Things you say, followed by the things you do
They won't hurt me, no, they won't hurt me anymore
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
Love can make, make a stronger man
But you don't love me 
And I don't feel you're growing strong
The heart you break with your simple lies
You better watch out, baby, the next heart may be your own
I gave you my love, my life, my time
Mine was your own, though you stripped me to the bone
When I asked just how you feel, if our love was the deal
You said, "We got it goin' on," now I feel that love is gone
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
I won't waste your time, 'cause I'm satisfied
I won't waste your time because I'm satisfied
I won't waste your time, 'cause I'm satisfied
I won't waste your time because I'm satisfied
I gave you my love, my heart, and soul
You took my love, now you want to take control
When a good thing comes your way
Why can't you stay?
I can't go on another day
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You know I'm gonna be alright, you know I'm gonna be alright
You know I'm gonna be alright—Why? Why? Why?
You know I'm gonna be alright, you know that I'm satisfied
You know I'm gonna be alright
You don't have to worry—You don't have, you don't have to
You don't have to worry—You don't have, you don't have to
You don't have to worry—You don't have, you don't have to
You don't have to worry—You don't have, you don't have to
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
