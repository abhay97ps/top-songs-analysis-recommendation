I said hello to the man
That tried to win your hand
A long time ago
I tried to smile
As he talked of the days
When he was your beau
But I could see
He was a-shamin' me
When he talked of his wealth and fame
"Ruby Ann took the hand
Of this poor poor man
Ain't true love a funny thing?"
Big man
You got money in your hand
So what?
You're at a table for two
But still there's only you
Big shot!
Well your money can't buy
If your power can't hold
You can't romance your fame
Ruby Ann took the hand
Of this poor poor man
Ain't true love a funny thing?
