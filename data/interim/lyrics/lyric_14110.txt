We should be sleeping
I'm wide awake but I'm dead on my feet
We're never keeping
All of the promises we said we'd keep
Four in the morning
Still got the lights and the radio on
Don't worry baby
I'm gonna find out what's going on
We should be sleeping
Tables are turning, and it's breaking my heart
Things will get better
We'll end this nightmare before it can start
Don't say bye bye bye bye bye bye baby
Why should we break down and cry
Can't let the world drive you crazy
Don't say bye baby bye bye
We should be sleeping
I'm wide awake but I'm dead on my feet
We're never keeping
All of the promises we said we'd keep
No deposit, no return
Play with love, you're gonna burn
Cheat yourself, you cheat your heart
Don't say bye bye bye bye bye bye baby
Why should we break down and cry
Can't let the world drive you crazy
Don't say bye baby bye bye
Don't say bye bye bye bye bye bye baby
Why should we break down and cry
Can't let the world drive you crazy
Don't say bye baby bye bye
Don't say bye bye bye bye bye bye baby
Why should we break down and cry
Can't let the world drive you crazy
Don't say bye baby bye bye...
