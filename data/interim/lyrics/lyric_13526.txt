If you want to tell me something new
I might stick around
If you want to say that I trust you
I might stick around
If you disappear
Then nothing will be clear, ah
And if you go away
Then where am I to stay, ah
To stay, ah
If you say your love won't bring me down
I might stick around
If I kiss your lips just one more time
I could lose control
If you disappear
Then nothing will be clear, ah
And if you go away
Then where am I to stay, ah
To stay, ah
If I breathe your scent just one more time
I could be controlled
If you tempt me with your final sins
I could be controlled
If you disappear
Then nothing will be clear, ah
And if you go away
Then where am I to stay, ah
To stay, ah...
