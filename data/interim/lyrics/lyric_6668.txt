Everybody over there 
Everybody out there 
Everybody right there 
Everybody just
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on with your come on
Come on, come on
Everybody over there 
Everybody right there 
Everybody over here 
Get involved, get involved
Come on with your little come on
Everybody over there 
Everybody right there 
Everybody over here 
Get involved, get involved
Wait, wait
Don't wave your hand, doin' nothin'
And expect me, to say you're doing something
Don't wave your hand
Expect me to call you a man
Don't raise your hand
Expect me to say, "There goes my man"
Everybody over there 
Everybody right there 
Everybody over here 
Get involved, get involved
Wait, wait, wait, wait
You better become a part of the call
You gotta have patience or you won't be called
You gotta have patience or you don't have the call
Do it right
So you won't have to go back and do it at night
Do it one time, make it right
You got the will, you got the fight
Everybody over there 
Everybody right there 
Everybody over here 
Get involved, get involved
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Looka here, wait
Go on, go on, go on
I need a little help
Can't do it alone
Everybody over there 
Everybody right there 
Everybody over there 
Get in, get involved 
Say it one more time, Bobby
On the ones and twos
Get involved, get involved, get involved
Wait, everybody over there 
Everybody right there 
Everybody over here 
Get involved, get involved
Wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait
Fellas, I want you to hit me
Fellas, don't miss me
Fellas, I want you to hit me
Hit me, alright
Hit me, hey
