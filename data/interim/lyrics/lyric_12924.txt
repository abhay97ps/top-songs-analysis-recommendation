There's a light on in your window
There's a shadow on the street
Two silhouettes tell me it's over
The shadow knows that shadow's me
I won't crawl I caused you trouble
Well that's the last thing I'll ever do
But before I leave your life completely
Tell me who wears these shoes, darling
Lord knows the days just get longer
The nights grow cold with you on my mind
And I feel like an old jukebox
Playing the same song all the time
If these crazy dreams don't kill me
It's more than I can take from you
Not knowing where or when I'll see you
Not knowing darling who wears these shoes
My friends all say don't go to pieces
I say that's fine but if I lose
I want to know who's in my foot steps
I want to know who wears these shoes
My friends all think I must be crazy
I see the facts but if it's true
I want to know who's in my footsteps
I want to know who wears these shoes, darling
Ohh, and it's a chilling feeling
When I can't see him
What do I do
When I face the two of you
Ohh, and it's a chilling feeling
When I can't see him
What do I do
Darling, come on no I've got nothing to do
I want to know I want to know who wears my shoes
Come on no I've got nothing to do
I want to know I want to know who wears my shoes
I got to blue whether it's true
I got to blue whether it's true I want to know
Nothing to do I want to know I want to know
Who wears these shoes I got to blue
Whether it's true I got to blue
Whether it's true I want to know
Nothing to do I want to know I want to know
Who wears these shoes I got to blue
