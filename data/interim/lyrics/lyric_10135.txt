Love as always such an illusion
It brought me so much misery and pain
I was staying in a state of confusion
You know it almost drove me insane
I don't know how I kept hanging on
Love was always touch and gone
Now it's touch and gone
One day love had me flying
The next day  I was down on my knees
Till the day that I saw you smiling
When you put my poor heart at ease
I never knew what was going on
Love was always touch and gone
Now it's touch and gone
Touch and gone
Touch and gone
Yeah you touched me
And the feeling keeps on coming on
Touch and gone
Touch and gone
Yeah you touched me
And the feeling keeps on coming on
You touch me and I feel a fever
You touch me and I lose control
Yeah you touch me and I'm a believer
Love has touched me in my very soul
Now I know that love came be gone
Love was always touch and gone
Now it's touch and gone
Touch and gone
Touch and gone
Yeah you touched me
And the feeling keeps on coming on
Touch and gone
Touch and gone
Yeah you touched me
And the feeling keeps on coming on
Yeah now I know that love came be gone
Love was always touch and gone
Now it's touch and gone
Touch and gone
Touch and gone
Yeah you touched me
And the feeling keeps on coming on
Touch and gone
Touch and gone
Yeah you touched me
And the feeling keeps on coming on
Touch and gone
Touch and gone
Yeah you touched me
And the feeling keeps on coming on
Touch and gone
Touch and gone
