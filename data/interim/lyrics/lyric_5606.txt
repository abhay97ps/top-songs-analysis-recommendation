Thoughts of you stand sacredly
In  the hallways of my mind
Look  what you did to me, my darling
Cut me to the bone
At the height of loving you
You  left me all alone
Still,  you're a part of everything I do
And day after day, I find
Thoughts  of you stand sacredly
In the hallways of my mind
Hey, hey, hey, oh, yeah
Yeah, hey, oh, yeah
Oh,  so you're gone
And memories live on
In my mind, it's so real
Gentle things, living things
That I will always feel
I pray that you'll see
What you've done to me
And what you've left behind
Thoughts of you stand sacredly
In the hallways of my mind
Hey, hey, hey, oh, yeah
Yeah, hey, oh, yeah
Baby, baby, baby 
What am I gonna do
Night after night
I'm lonely 
Thinking of you 
Aching in my brain
It's an excruciating pain
I guess I'll never be the same
How can I ever explain
So you're gone
And memories live on
In my mind, it's so real
Gentle things, living things
That I will always feel
I pray you'll see
What you've done to me
And what you've left behind
Thoughts of you
They stick with me
In the hallways 
 In the
Hallways of my mind
