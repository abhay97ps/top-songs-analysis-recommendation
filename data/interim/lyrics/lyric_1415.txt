Just leave it to me
Don't ever be ashamed
Just give me a chance, yes
And I'll take care of everything
Your troubles, I'll share
Let me know and I'll be there
I'll stay close to you
Anyplace and anywhere
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Lord, shake a hand if you can
Be truthful to me
And I'll be truthful to you
I'm in love with you
And I don't know what to do
So, let's call it a day
I've said all I have to say
Except don't forget to pray
Yes, and shake a hand every day
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Yeah, shake a hand if you can
