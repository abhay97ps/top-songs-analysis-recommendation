Outside is cloudy, but I like that better 
Behind the wheel, but still ain't on my way
Some people say they want to live forever
That's way too long, I'll just get through today
Without any complications 
Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated? 
Well, I'm way too young to be gettin' old
And all I wanna do is look, but I can't see, baby
Who you talkin' to while you talkin' to me, baby?
Let me, let me know if I can see you later
We could make it easy
Inside my head is getting pretty cluttered 
I try, but can't clean up this mess I made
'Fore I start to think about the future
First, can I please get through a day?
Without any complications 
Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated? 
Well, I'm way too young to be gettin' old
Some people say they want to live forever
Without any complications 
Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated? 
Well, I'm way too young to be gettin' old
