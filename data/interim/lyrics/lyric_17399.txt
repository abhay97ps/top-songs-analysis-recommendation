Uh
Yeah
Phenomenon
Yeah
Mmm, ohhh, yeah
Baby, far from yours
Ohhh, yeah
Yo, time is most limited, I’m back on the scene
O replenishes potency like four or five Guinnesses
Hennessey’s flourishing, O.C. is nourishing
Performing miracles, ill and mad lyrical
What stands before your very eyes is a
One-man, stand-alone phenomenon
Microphone misery you’re suffering—taste my repertoire
In your face like a buck fifty done with the razor
I’m felt by Aztecs, felt by Asians
Portuguese, Lebanese, and even Caucasians
Every form of power, they respect my stats
Slapping five with foreign leader, drink Cognac with diplomat
Retard your whole brigade, cave in your brain waves
 making party people slaves
You hit reverse to rewind and defy my cause
He’s no average MC with a smile on his face
Though you try to bite his style, no one can duplicate
I be the Chosen One beyond the Moët and the Cristal
The son of king and a queen
Therefore, ability for song run in my genetics
I gave ideas to L. Ron Hubbard to write books on Dianetics
FedEx your info
If you wanna show the manager Mr. Dave
Make sure give us a good Payday too
I was assigned to Earth on a mission
To spread worldwide my glorious compositions
Notes are like B-sharps floating out of my mouth
From start to finish ‘til the song diminish
My lyrical energy bring out envy in most MC's
Who listen to O, you didn’t know me before?
Then you know who I are now, biting my style?
That’s a crime to be dealt with when we take it to trial
Verdict is in, the judge know my beef has cause
He’s no average MC with a smile on his face
And though you try to bite his style, no one can duplicate
He can flow any way you want, he can rhyme any time you say
And he’s never, ever, ever too far from tomorrow today
You may never find an MC well-orchestrated like a symphony
Some will go down in history, some in infamy
The infamy will be somewhat a mystery
As long as my name O.C. live on through infinity
My identity will ring bells in all vicinities
From fans to enemies, I’m the antidote and remedy
I’ma philosophize, analyze, no question
If I die, I’ma return like Jesus resurrection
I’m a blessing to the rap game, my claim to fame is when
I disappear and reappear, I put rappers to shame
Plain and simple, in common English, what I distinguish:
The meanest lyric flamethrower, your career’s over
Finesse a mic, Casanova, Don Juan, an MC
The people need a change, this rap shit is deranged
Yo, Raida, flip the fader, let ‘em know my cause
He’s no average MC with a smile on his face
And though you try to bite his style, no one can duplicate
He can flow any way you want, he can rhyme any time you say
And he’s never, ever, ever too far from tomorrow today
Never too far, never…
