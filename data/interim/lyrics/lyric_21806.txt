I know I may be young
But I've got feelings, too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So let me go and just listen
All you people look at me like I'm a little girl
Well, did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?
Always saying "Little girl don't step into the club"
Well, I'm just trying to find out why 'cause dancin's what I love, yeah 
Get it, get it, uh
Get it, get it, woah 
Get it, get it, oh 
Huh, huh, huh, huh
I know I may come off quiet, may come off shy
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy
What's practical is logical, what the hell who cares?
All I know is I'm so happy when you dancing there, yeah
I'm a slave for you
I cannot hold it
I cannot control it
I'm a slave for you
I won't deny hide it
I'm not trying to hide it
Baby, don't you wanna dance upon me 
To another time and place?
Oh, baby, don't you wanna dance upon me? 
Leaving behind my name and age 
Like that
You like it, yeah
Now watch me
Get it, get it, uh
Get it, get it, woah 
Get it, get it, oh 
Huh, huh, huh, huh
I really wanna dance tonight with you 
I really wanna do what you want me to 
I really wanna dance tonight with you 
I really wanna do what you want me to 
Baby, don't you wanna dance upon me 
To another time and place?
Oh, baby, don't you wanna dance upon me? 
Leaving behind my name and age
I'm a slave for you 
I cannot hold it
I cannot control it
I'm a slave for you 
I won't deny it
I'm not trying to hide it
Get it, get it, uh
Get it, get it, whoa
Get it, get it, oh
Huh, huh, huh, huh 
Get it, get it, uh

Yeah, like that?
