{Verse}
Let’s get in one more fight
Come on we can make it right
I don’t want to lose you tonight
I can’t see the stars when you aren’t right here by my side
Nobody knows where to go
When things get tough at the end of the road, no
Nobody knows
What to do when everything is left up to you
Please keep me up all night
Ill endure all these battles that tear at the walls inside my mind
People think it’s easier to break and say goodbye
But do they really know if the grass is greener on the other side
Nobody knows where to go
When things get tough at the end of the road, no
Nobody knows
What to do when everything is left up to you
-SOLO-
Don’t let me go, please don’t let me go 2X
Let’s get in one more fight
Come on we can make it right
I don’t want to lose you tonight
I can’t see the stars when you aren’t right here by my side
Nobody knows where to go
When things get tough at the end of the road, no
Nobody knows
What to do when everything is left up to you
Don’t let me go, please don’t let me go
