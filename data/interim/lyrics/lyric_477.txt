If I dance ev'ry dance with the guys who give me the eye
And let 'em hold me tight
Please don't mind, if I smile at the man who holds my hand
'neath the pale moonlight
I won't forget who's takin' me home and you should remember, too
That I'm savin' the last dance for you
Mm I know  that the music's  fine
Like sparklin'  wine but my mind's  on you 
I can tell  by the way  you look  at me
That you're thinking, too  
I won't forget that you're taking me home when the night is through
So I'm savin' the last dance for you
Baby, don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, ever let you go
I love you oh so much
It's my dance  and I'll carry on
Until the night  is gone and it's just for fun  
And you know  when it's time  to go
You'll be  the one to take  me home 
Don't want to give my goodnight kiss to anyone but you
So I'm savin' the last dance for you
Don't want to give my goodnight kiss to anyone but you
So I'm savin' the last dance for you
Hmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Savin' the last dance for you
