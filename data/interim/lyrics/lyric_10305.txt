Midnight sun, shining through my darkest night
Noonday shadow, blocking out my morning light
You don't even know what I'm talking about
It's what you do when you're just being you
How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time, oh, baby
How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time
Flaming candle, hey, burning me with sweet desire
Icy cold, hard to handle, back and forth from ice to fire
You don't even know what you're putting me through
With all these bittersweet things that you do
How can you be daylight and darkness, at the same time, oh...
How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time
Oh, baby, oh, baby
You don't even know what I'm talking about
It's just your way, baby, that's what you say
How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time
How can, how can you be daylight and darkness at the same time
Ah, daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
Ooh hoo, darkness, darkness, darkness
How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time
Same time, same time, my baby
Baby, at the same time
