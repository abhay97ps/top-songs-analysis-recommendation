Got out of town
On a boat, going to Southern islands
Sailing a reach
Before a following sea
She was making for the trades
On the outside
And the downhill run
To Papeete
Off the wind on this heading lie
The Marquesas
We got eighty feet of the waterline
Nicely making way
In a noisy bar in Avalon, I tried to call you
But on a midnight watch I realized
Why twice you ran away
Think about how many times I have fallen
Spirits are using me, larger voices calling
What heaven brought you and me
Cannot be forgotten
I have been around the world
Looking for that woman-girl
Who knows love can endure
And you know it will
When you see the Southern Cross
For the first time
You understand now why you came this way
Cause the truth you might be running from is so small
But it's as big as the promise
The promise of a coming day
So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a dying
And my love is an anchor tied to you
Tied with a silver chain
I have my ship
And all her flags are a flying
She is all that I have left
And music is her name
Think about how many times I have fallen
Spirits are using me, larger voices calling
What heaven brought you and me
Cannot be forgotten
I have been around the world
Looking for that woman-girl
Who knows love can endure
And you know it will
And you know it will
Yes
So we cheated and we lied
And we tested
And we never failed to fail
It was the easiest thing to do
You will survive being bested
Somebody fine
Will come along, make me forget about loving you
In the Southern Cross
