The last leaf clings to the bough
Just one leaf, that's all there is now
And my last hope live with that lonely leaf, lonely leaf
With the last leaf that clings to the bough
Last summer beneath this tree
My love said she'd come home to me
Before the leaves of autumn touched the ground, touched the ground
My love promised she's be homeward bound
Then one by one the leaves began to fall
And now that winter's come to call
The last leaf that clings to the bough
Just one leaf, that's all there is now
Will my last hope fall with that lonely leaf, lonely leaf
With the last leaf, the last leaf
With the last leaf that clings to the bough
Bough, bough, bough ...
