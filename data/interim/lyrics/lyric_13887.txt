They hung a sign out, sign out after seven
Down at the hive where you're such a busy bee
So sign in honey, sign up for heaven
Just you tonight, it's you and me
Come as you are, now come on
Come as you are, and we'll have a ball
Ain't gonna be no masquerade
Come as you are, or don't come at all
There'll be a high time, high time at the lakeside
Barry and the boys are going in for free
We'll jump the moon, take it for a joyride
I stuck it up there for you and me
Come as you are, now come on
Come as you are, and we'll have a ball
Ain't gonna be no masquerade
Come as you are, or don't come at all
I'm just a bluebird, bluebird at your window
And it's for sure, you're a pretty sight to see
But life's so short and I know what you're into
Come it's you and me
Come as you are, now come on
Come as you are, and we'll have a ball
Ain't gonna be no masquerade
Come as you are, or don't come at all
