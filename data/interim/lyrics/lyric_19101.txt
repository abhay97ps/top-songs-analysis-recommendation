I'm tired of spinning my wheels
I need to find a place where my heart can go to heal
I need to get there pretty quick
Hey mister what you got out on that lot you can sell me in a pinch
Maybe one of them souped up muscle cars
The kind that makes you think you're stronger than you are
Color don't matter no I don't need leather seats
All that really concerns me is
Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
And a whole lot of speed
I'd like to trade in this old truck
Cause it makes me think of her and that just slows me up
See, it's the first place we made love where we used to sit and talk
On the tailgate all night long but now she's gone
And I need to move on
So give me
Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
And a whole lot of speed
Throw me them keys so I can put some miles between us
Tear off that rearview mirror there's nothing left to see here
Let me lean on that gas
Oh she catches up fast
So give me
Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
And a whole lot of speed
That's what I need
I'm tired of spinning my wheels
