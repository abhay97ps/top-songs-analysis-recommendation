You better keep moving
Cause if you don’t, they have you by the throat
And have you on a boat

Hard press, hard to get hard when you hard up in stress
Shirtless poor til the last breath
Salavation Army shopping this weeks best
You better keep moving
Like a tapeworm violate the infirm
Stressin while im rhymin' like your writing mid terms
Keep moving
If you got one leg, wide eyed bed ridden
All you got is ears work, still in the rhythm
Frail like a match, can't fill me like a snack
Decimating  microphones
Ready like James black
The Oh no's back lyrical neck attack
Met this kid named Cracker Jack
From the outback no the comeback
Tryna make his life straight you can feel that
Anger under wraps now he laid back
Drowin in honies, hands fulla flapjacks
Didn’t watch his back like an almanac
Cats from his past, point, click & blast
Jack laid out, straight sprayed out, said what he get for the blabbermouth
Free as a bird, feeling absurd
Words can't describe like hard crosswords
Yo jack got ate up not keeping his weight up
