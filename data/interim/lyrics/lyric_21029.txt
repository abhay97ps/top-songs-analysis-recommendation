You think I'm so full of it, full of it
But I think I'm just fed up, baby
You think I can be so arrogant, arrogant
But I'm just tryna get keep my head up, baby
You think I procrastinate, baby
But I think I'm taking my time
You think you need to leave
But I think I disagree, but
If you believe you'll do best without me
I'll let it go, girl, it's over
But before we say goodbye
Let's give it a try
If you leave then baby I'll leave
I'll let it go, girl, it's over
But I have no doubt
We can work it out
Yeah, I think you're so full of it, full of it
You just don't know when to let up, baby
I think you're so arrogant, arrogant
Do you think you're so much better, baby
That I think it ain't healthy for me
To judge you by your flaws and that's why
I know I could criticize but I put that aside
To focus on you and I
But if you believe you'll do best without me
I'll let it go boy, it's over
But before we say goodbye
Let's give it a try
If you leave then, baby, I'll leave
I'll let it go, boy, it's over
But I have no doubt
We can work it out
Now if you wanna go
Baby, then I'll let you go
And even though I'm tryna hold on
I can't let you go
(If you leave me, you're gonna miss me
And I'm not saying that I'll be here waiting)
Since we here right now 
Let's work to reach the point that I know we can be
If you believe you'll do best without me
I'll let it go, girl, it's over
But before we say goodbye
Let's give it a try
If you leave, then baby I'll leave
I'll let it go girl, it's over
But I have no doubt
We can work it out
If you believe you'll do best without me
I'll let it go girl, it's over
But before we say goodbye
Let's give it a try
If you leave, then baby I'll leave
I'll let it go girl, Its over
But I have no doubt
