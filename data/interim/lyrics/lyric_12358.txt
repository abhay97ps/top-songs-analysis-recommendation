The closer you get, the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm falling faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, the further I fall
The things that you say to me
The look on your face
Brings out the man in me
Do I see a trace in your eyes of love
The closer you get, the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm falling faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, the further I fall
Could I be dreaming
Is this really real
Because there's something magic
The way that I feel in your arms tonight
The closer you get, oh yeah, the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm falling faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, mmhmm, the further I fall
Keep falling, oh, yeah, yeah, keep falling
Mmm falling, oh, yeah, yeah, I'm falling
Yes I'm falling 
Yes I'm falling 
Yes we're falling 
The closer you get, oh yeah, the further I fall, mmhmm
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm falling faster and faster and faster with no time to stall 
The closer you get, mmhmm, the further I fall
The closer you get, the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm falling faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get
