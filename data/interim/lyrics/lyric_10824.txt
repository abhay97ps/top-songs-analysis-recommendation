Come on operator gimme Rolene on my line
She knows what I need to ease a cravin' in my spine
A cheerleaders smile
Tijuana style
Your daddy might be judge
Sure know how to nudge
All right Rolene

Well, I've been livin' so white and clean
Jack, it's made me mean
I need Rolene's smooth, round thigh
It's like a rush to get me high
I give it my best shot
Honey, all I got
My name may not be Hud
But I'll show you I'm no dud
All right Rolene

You know my baby's love
Just like a sweet velvet glove
Honey, crack that whip
Ya make me bite my lip
All right Rolene
