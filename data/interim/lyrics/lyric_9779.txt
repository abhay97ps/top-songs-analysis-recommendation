Last December I met a girl
She took a likin' to me
Said she loved me
But she didn't know the meanin' of the word
She imagined love to be grand
Me holdin' her hand and
Whisperin' sweet things and
Cooin' softly like a song bird
Then one mornin' she came to me
With a tear in her eye
And a sigh on her breath
And Lord she said
"Hon, I'm heavy with child"
And I said "god damn girl can't you see
That I'm breakin' my back
Just tryin' to keep my head above water
And it's turnin' me wild"
"Cinderella can't you see
Don't want your company
You better leave this mornin', leave today
Take your love and your child away"
No no no no, no no no no
No no no no, no no no no
No no no no, no no no no
No no no no, no no no no
No no no no, no no no no
No no no no no
Woah woah, no
Woah woah, no
Woah woah, no
Woah woah, woah woah woah, no
Rockin' chair on my front porch
Well I'm thinkin' about all the things that I did
As a young man
Now that I'm old
And I remember her and the boy
Did he have all the toys and the joys
That a young man should have
Before he gets too old
Cinderella couldn't you see
I didn't want your company
You shoulda left that mornin', left that day
Took your love and your child away
