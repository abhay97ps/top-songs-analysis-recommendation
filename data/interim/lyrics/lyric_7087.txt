I was once out strolling one hot and summer day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I lay there in the sun and I
Felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep
I dreamed that I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
But there I was 
I was taken to the place 
The hall of the mountain king 
I stood high upon the mountaintop
Naked to the world
In front of me 
Ah yeah, was every kind of girl
There was long ones, tall ones
Short ones, brown ones
Black ones, round ones
Big crazy ones
Out of the middle
Came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Ooh, ooh, something crazy
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl
I thought to myself: What could this mean?
Am I going crazy or is it just a dream?
Now wait a minute
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
So it's all in my head
And then I heard
Somebody say
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl
I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
And in the other, a glass, good God
She poured some of that wine
From the bottle into the glass
And she raised it to her lip
And just before she drank it, she said
Spill that wine
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill, spill, spill, spill, spill that wine
Come on and take that pearl
Come on and spill that wine
Come on and take that pearl
Spill that wine
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill, spill, spill, spill, spill, spill, spill, spill, spill that wine
Come on and take that pearl, good God
Come on and take that pearl
Come on and spill that wine
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl 
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Come on and spill that wine
Come on and take that pearl
Come on, spill that wine
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine
Come on now, come on, take that pearl now
Spill that, spill that wine
