You were made for me 
Everybody tells me so
You were made for me 
Tell me then that you don't know
All the trees were made for little things that sing and fly
And the sun was made to burn so bright and light the sky-ee-y-ee-y
Pretty eyes were never made to cry, they were made to see
When I hold you in my arms I know that you were made for me
You were made for me 
Everybody tells me so
You were made for me 
Tell me then that you don't know
All the flowers in the field were made to please the bees
For the fishes swim to make the rivers run to the sea-ee-ee-ee-eas
Every hand was made to to hold another, tenderly
When I kissed you on your lips I knew that you were made for me
You were made for me 
Everybody tells me so
You were made for me 
Tell me then that you don't know
Da da daaa da da da da da daaa da daaa da daaaa
Da da daaa da da da da da daaa da daa de-da-de-da-de-da
You were made for me 
Everybody tells me so
You were made for me 
Tell me then that you don't know
Every hand was made to hold another, tenderly
When I kissed you on your lips I knew that
You were made
You were made
You were made for me
