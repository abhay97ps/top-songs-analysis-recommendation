Don't play it no more
Don't play it no more
Don't play it no more
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't play that song for me
It brings back memories
Of days that I once knew
The days I spent with you
Oh no, don't let it play
It fills my heart with pain
Please stop it right away
I remember just-a what it said
It said 
You know that you lied
You know that you lied
You know that you lied, you lied
You
I remember on our first date
You kissed me and you walked away
You were only seventeen
I never thought you'd act so mean
You said 
But, baby, you lied
Yes, baby, you lied
Mmm, you know you lied , oh
You know that you lied, darlin'
You know that you lied
You know that you lied , you lied 
You
Go on and hurt me, baby
Do what you will But baby you told me you loved me
You told me you cared
You said, "I'll go with you darling almost anywhere
But darling, you know that you lied, lied, lied, lied, lied
