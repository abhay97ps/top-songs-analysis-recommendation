You said you wanna showdown
But did I take your love too right?
Now here’s the lowdown
But I’ll keep telling you night after night
You’re my girl
You’re the only one
The only one
You’re my girl
You’re the only one
The only one
You know I poured my heart out
Stop playing with my sympathy
‘Cause baby, there’s no doubt
I thought of a plan to make you believe
You’re my girl
You’re the only one
The only one
You’re my girl
You’re the only one
The only one
Hold me tighter
Ooh, tighter and tighter
Never let you go of me, baby
‘Cause when we’re in harmony
You’re my girl
You’re the only one
The only one
You’re my girl
You’re the only one
The only one
You’re my girl
You’re the only one
The only one
You’re my girl
You’re the only one
Oh, come on, baby
Every night and every day
You’re my girl
Oh, girl
