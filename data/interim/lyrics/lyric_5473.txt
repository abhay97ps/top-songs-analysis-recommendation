You're sweeter than the honey that the bees make
Soul sister, you're brown sugar
Sweeter than the icing on the best cake
Soul sister, you're brown sugar
I was in the dark but now I see
What was always in front of me
I was always proud
But now I'm saying it loud
Keep on giving it to me
Love and affection to the bone, to the bone
Soul sister, you're brown sugar
Keep on socking it to me all night long
Soul sister, you're brown sugar
Girl, you're always there with your man
It's 'bout time he took your hand
I wanna show you 'cause I can't stand the blow
Keep on giving it to me
Somebody said, "What's in the dark
Will surely come to the light"
Now your days are brighter
And your burden's lighter
And the whole world knows you out of sight
Woo, Lord
Love and affection to the bone, to the bone
Soul sister, you're brown sugar
Keep on socking it to me all night long
Soul sister, you're brown sugar
Girl, you're always out there with your man
It's about time he took your hand
I wanna show you 'cause I can't stand the blow
Keep on giving it to me
Keep on giving me brown sugar
I just got to have brown sugar
I can't help but more brown sugar
Don't you know I need brown sugar
I just got to have brown sugar
I just got to have brown sugar
