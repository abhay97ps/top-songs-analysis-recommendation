Talking about those 
Always asking for favors
You always drop by around five
House and home
Soon as your back is turned
They try to get in your home 
They intrude on your privacy
Oh but they don't give a damn about your or me
What them smile in your company
While they try to cover up their jealousy
Talking about those 
Newsy neighbors
Always asking for favors
Newsy neighbors
Always asking for favors
They tell you how to live you life
When they can't even live their own
Minding everybody's affairs
Gossiping on the phone 
Borrow money from your cookie jar
But they hoping people come and repossess your car
They tell you what you can and can't afford
Lord instead of getting a caddy they say get a ford
Talking about those
