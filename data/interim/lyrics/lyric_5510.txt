When the morning sun
Streaks across my room
And I'm wakin' up
From another dream of you
Yes I'm on the road
Once again it seems
All I've left behind
Is a chain of broken dreams
But you know I love you
Yes, I love you
Whoa, I love you
How I wish that love
Was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have
'Cause I've got so much to give
And it seems so wrong
Deep inside my heart
That the dollar sign
Could be keeping us apart
And if only I could find
My way back to the time
When the problems of this life
Had not yet crossed our minds
All the answers could be found
In children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you
I'd come running back to you
But you know we can't
Live on dreams alone
And to pay the rent
I must leave you all alone
'Cause you know I made my choice
Many years ago
Now this traveling life
Is the only one I know
