You never let me get away
From all the memories that we made
I got rid of the triggers, burned the pictures
But somehow you find a way
I woke up this morning, not thinking about you
Like I've taught myself to do
But in the still of the silence
I'm reminded of you...
And just like that, it all comes back
Déjà vu
Oh...
Here I go again from the beginning
And, oh...
I watch us fall too fast, I can't escape the
Love we made, the fights we had
The slamming doors and broken glass
Just like that, it all comes back
It all comes back to...
You... Déjà vu
Déjà vu
I won't ever get used to watching me lose you
Over and over again
I've gotten good pretending that I'm okay
But up here in my head
I see you close on the carpet, your arms all around me
On the floor in the living room
And I almost believed that
I'm really here with you
And just like that, it all comes back
Déjà vu
Oh...
Here I go again from the beginning
And, oh...
I watch us fall too fast, I can't escape the
Love we made, the fights we had
The slamming doors and broken glass
Just like that, it all comes back
It all comes back to...
You and I were meant to be
But only in a memory
You're all I want
You're all I see
It all comes back
Oh...
Here I go again from the beginning
And, oh...
I watch us fall too fast, I can't escape the
Love we made, the fights we had
The slamming doors and broken glass
Just like that, it all comes back to you
And just like that, it all comes back to you
Déjà vu
