Early morning when I leave your side
Start my car and drive
Before the new day's dawning
You know I'll return
Apart we won't survive
If love doesn't mean enough 
Somebody invents another word
Oh, oh, oh, in the nature of love
I never can say goodbye
Time and time again
Seems like we're hitting our heads against the wall
Fighting, cursing, how can we stand by?
And let it all slip away
If love doesn't mean enough 
Somebody invents another word
If love doesn't mean enough 
Somebody invents another word
Goodbye, goodbye
Nature of love, never can say goodbye
Oh, oh, oh, I never can say goodbye
Never can say goodbye
Oh, oh, oh
Nature of, Nature of love
Oh, oh, oh
Nature of, Nature of love
Oh, oh, oh
Nature of, Nature of love
