She's a mixed-up, shook-up girl
Yes, she is
She's a mixed-up, shook-up girl
Yes, she is
Am I crying because I'm happy
Or am I crying because I'm blue without you?
My heart has blown away
Now you've gone and gone away
I'm a mixed-up, shook-up girl over you
Am I crying because you left me
Or am I crying because I don't know what to do?
One day you said you'd never part
Am I sad, or am I glad?
I'm a mixed-up, shook-up girl over you
One day you said you'd never part
Am I sad, or am I glad?
I'm a mixed-up, shook-up girl over you
Oh yeah, I'm a mixed-up, shook-up girl over you
Yeah, I'm a mixed-up, shook-up girl over you
