Football, baseball, basketball games
Drinkin' beer, kickin' ass and takin' down names
With the top down, get-a-round, shootin' the line
Summer is here and Johnny's feelin' fine
But Johnny can't read
Summer is over and he's gone to seed
Johnny can't read
He never learned nothin' that he'll ever need
Well, Johnny can dance and Johnny can love
Johnny can push and Johnny can shove
Johnny can hang out; Johnny can talk tough
Johnny can get down and Johnny can throw up
But Johnny can't read
Summer is over and he's gone to seed
, Johnny can't read
He never learned nothin' that he'll ever need
Well, is it Teacher's fault? Oh No!
Is it Mommy's fault? Oh No!
Is it society's fault? Oh No!
Well is it Johnny's fault? OhhHHH NooOOO!
Couple years later, Johnny's on the run
Johnny got confused and he bought himself a gun
Well, he went and did something that he shouldn't
Oughta done
F.B.I. on his tail
"Use A Gun-Go To Jail"
But Johnny can't read
Summer is over and he's gone to seed
, Johnny can't read
He never learned nothin' that he'll ever need
Well is is Teacher's fault? Oh No
Is it Mommie's fault? Oh No
Is it the President's fault? Oh No
Well is it Johnny's fault? OhhHHH NooOOO!
Johnny can dance and Johnny can love
Johnny can push and Johnny can shove
Johnny can pinball; Johnny can talk tough
Johnny can get down and Johnny can throw up
Well, recess is over
Recess is over!
Sitcoms, "T.&A."
Johnny's mind is blown away
Cop shows, horror flicks
Johnny's brain is full of bricks
Rock show, Video
Boob tube, Rubik's cube
Game fools, Sunday school
Gain fans, Gobble gangs
Wonka wonka wonka
There's a new kid in town...
