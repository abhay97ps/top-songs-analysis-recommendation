Come a little closer, baby
I feel like laying you down
On a bed sweet surrender
Where we can work it all out
There ain't nothing that love can't fix
Girl, it's right here at our fingertips
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like laying you down
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like letting go
Of everything that stands between us
And the love we used to know
I wanna touch you like a cleansing rain
Let it wash all the hurt away
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like laying you down
If there's still a chance
Then take my hand
And we'll steal away
Off into the night
'till we make things right
The suns gonna rise on a better day
Come a little closer baby
I feel like stripping it down
Back to the basics of you and me
And what makes the world go round
Every inch of you against my skin
I wanna be stronger than we've ever been
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like laying you down
Come a little bit closer baby
Just a little bit closer baby
Come a little bit closer baby
I feel like laying you down
