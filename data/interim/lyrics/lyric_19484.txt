Sometimes I feel like I need
To shake myself
To wake myself
I feel like I'm just sleepwalkin'
Through my life
It's like I'm swimmin' in
An ocean of emotion
But still somehow slowly
Goin' numb inside
I don't like who I'm becomin'
I know I've gotta do somethin'
Before my life passes right by
I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a
Beautiful mornin'
Sing to the Heavens like a
Church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go
Down swingin'
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be
Alone
Take everything that this
World has to give
I want to live
Sometimes I wonder
Why I work so hard to guard
My heart
Till I hardly feel anything at all
I've spent my whole life building
Up this ivory tower
And now that I'm in it, I keep
Wishin' it would fall
So I could feel the ground
Beneath me
Really taste this air I'm
Breathin'
And know that I'm alive
I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a
Beautiful mornin'
Sing to the Heavens like a
Church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go
Down swingin'
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be
Alone
Take everything that this
World has to give
I want to live
Somethin' deep inside
Keeps sayin'
Life is like a vapor
It's gone in just the
Twinklin' of an eye
I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a
Beautiful mornin'
Sing to the Heavens like a
Church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go
Down swingin'
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be
Alone
Take everything that this
World has to give
I want to live
I want to take every
Breath I can get
I want to live
Yeah, yeah
