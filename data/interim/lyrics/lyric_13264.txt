Oh yeah, I
Just wanna watch the girls, goin' by
It's like poetry in motion
Against a hot summer sky
I'm in love, yeah yeah
At least every minute or two
Until' the next time a girl walks by
I think I love her too
Oh I, I can't help myself
But I just lose my head
Every time you see 'em walkin' by
Summertime girls
Summertime girls
She's hot
I dig her wiggle and oh that shake
You can read that body language, yeah
A million miles away
Sometimes I, yeah yeah
Come on just a bit, a bit too strong
But I just like to pretend, yes
That I can have 'em all
No time, time to catch my breath
So easily impressed
It doesn't matter if it's day or night
Summertime girls
You make my whole world go around
Summertime girls
Come here girls
Summertime girls
Summertime girls
Summertime girls
Summertime girls
Summertime girls
Summertime girls
Summertime girls
