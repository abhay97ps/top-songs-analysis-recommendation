Everybody shut up! 
Everyone listen up!
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey 
If you can't write in the proper way 
If you don't know how to conjugate 
Hey, maybe you flunked that class 
And maybe now you find 
That people mock you online 
Okay, now here's the deal
I'll try to educate ya  
Gonna familiarize
You with the nomenclature  
You'll learn the definitions 
Of nouns and prepositions 
Literacy's your mission 
And that's why I think it's a good time 
To learn some grammar 
Now, did I stammer?
Work on that grammar 
You should know when
It's "less" or it's "fewer"  
Like people who were 
Never raised in a sewer
I hate these word crimes
Like "I could care less" 
That means you do care 
At least a little
Don't be a moron 
You'd better slow down
And use the right pronoun 
Show the world you're no clown
Say you've got an "i-t"
Followed by apostrophe "s" 
Now, what does that mean?
You would not use "it's" in this case 
As a possessive 
It's a contraction 
What's a contraction?
Well, it's the shortening of a word or a group of words
By omission of a sound or letter 
Okay, now here are some notes
Syntax you're always mangling 
No X in "espresso"
Your participle's danglin' 
But I don't want your drama  
If you really wanna  
Leave out that Oxford comma  
Just keep in mind that
"Be", "see", "are", "you"
Are words, not letters 
Get it together 
Use your spell checker
You should never
Write words using numbers  
Unless you're seven 
Or your name is Prince
I hate these word crimes 
You really need a  
Full-time proofreader 
You dumb mouth-breather 
Well, you should hire 
Some cunning linguist 
To help you distinguish
What is proper English
One thing I ask of you 
Time to learn your homophones is past due 
Learn to diagram a sentence, too
Always say "to whom", don't ever say "to who" 
And listen up when I tell you this
I hope you never use quotation marks for emphasis 
You finished second grade, I hope you can tell
If you're doing good or doing well 
You better figure out the difference
Irony is not coincidence 
And I thought that you'd gotten it through your skull
About what's figurative and what's literal 
Oh, but just now , you said 
You "literally" couldn't get out of bed  
That really makes me want to literally
Smack a crowbar upside your stupid head
I read your e-mail 
It's quite apparent 
Your grammar's errant
You're incoherent 
Saw your blog post 
It's really fantastic 
That was sarcastic 
'Cause you write like a spastic 
I hate these word crimes 
Your prose is dopey  
Think you should only 
Write in emoji 
Oh, you're a lost cause 
Go back to preschool 
Get out of the gene pool 
Try your best to not drool 
Never mind, I give up 
Really now, I give up 
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Go away!
