Perpendicular to anything you knew in particular
Giving you the extra curricular..
Spittin picture perfect ammunition faster then a vehicular
2 anybody in my parameter..
Simular to nothin that you heard of me im 1 OF A KIND
And so are YOU, you gotta stay on your GRIND..
Pay attention to your HEART when they start playin games wit ur MIND
And make your moves like you ain't got the TIME
Keep goin like a starving Ethiopian that still gotta LIVE
And give it back when you got it 2 give..
And ATTACK like a lion when u flyin of the TOP of the LID
Ill say it again, they call me the KID.. 
I already did a milli that you wouldn't BELIEVE
And me I'mma LIVE b4 I'mma leave..
Dont know about 2marrow but i promise wit the AIR that i BREATHE
That RIGHT NOW this is ALL THAT I NEED
EVERYBODY PUT YOUR HANDS UP..
Come on lemme see you STAND UP..
They won't never UNDERSTAND US..
In the school of HARD KNOCKZ we the ILLEST on the CAMPUS..
REACHIN levels that they CANT TOUCH
Feel the.. RUSH
When i spit it from the SPIRIT it E.. RUPTS
Everybody in the building goin.. NUTS
If you sittin in your seat I'mma START LEAVIN YOU IN THE DUST
In a minute every.. moment known 2 give it ALL I GOT
And I keep a mean DIDDY BOP.. on top of THAT
And it, never really matter where we @..
Put me ANYWHERE on the MAP
IM STILL SCREAMIN THAT..
2GETHER WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL
THE TIME OF MY LIFE, IM HAVING A BALL
#LETSGETIT
WE GON DO IT LIKE WE AINT NEVER DID IT B4
AND IF YOU WANT IT THEN WE READY 4 WAR
#UNAPOLOGETIC
We came to leave our LEGACY in the UNIVERSE
While holding down the planet EARTH, BEEN THRU THE WORST..
Hit so many times it don't even hurt
If all a FLOWER need is WATER and DIRT, then YOU CAN MAKE IT
Take it to the EXTREME, cause if you really wanna FOLLOW your DREAMS
You gotta be AWAKE, NAH MEAN? 
Try to tell em if you really wanna follow your dreams, YOU GOTTA BE AWAKE
EVERYBODY GET UP!!!!!!
)
Free your MIND.. and open your EYES
Cause baby 2NITE.. WE RIDE
Take your TIME.. and reach 4 the SKIES
Cause baby 2NITE.. WE RIDE
Said why we gotta go in DEBT just to pay TUITION
Thru the struggle use my BRAIN as the AMMUNITION
See i was tryna make a way in the same POSITION
HIGHER LEARNING still i feel i made a GREAT DECISION
All I wanted was to FOCUS on my EDUCATION
Not a bunch of TEXTBOOKS just for DECORATION
Just a TEACHER with the right MENTAL STIMULATION
And the TOOLS not a STUDENT LOAN INVITATION
No kids so I couldn't claim INDEPENDENT
Lose lose I did everything to PREVENT IT
Part time paper coming but I couldn't SPEND IT
Couldn't be a SLAVE caught up in the EPIDEMIC
When you HUNGRY it be hard 2 keep your CONCENTRATION
When you BUMMY dont no SHORTY want a CONVERSATION
When the MONEY comin in EVERYBODY HATING
When the MONEY lookin FUNNY EVERYBODY WAITING
Contemplating get you nowhere QUICK
If you ain't making every MOVE you were put here 2 get
If you ain't taking every CHANCE how you ever PREDICT
That you could really make it out of your PREDICAMENT
Meant to pick apart your cranium and cram it full of PHYSICAL THOUGHT
So you can WALK everything that you TALK
To give you KNOWLEDGE and the POWER to DEMINISH everything that you START
DESTROY your cubical and BREAK IT APART
DECLARING INDEPENDENT
EMANCIPATED every single sentence
They UNDERESTIMATED my PERCENTAGE
It didn't matter cause i knew that soon or later they would get the MESSAGE
That i was keeping busy BREAKING RECORDS
IMAGINATION taken to the EXTREME, cause if you really wanna FOLLOW your DREAMS
You gotta be AWAKE, NAH MEAN? 
Try to tell em if you really wanna follow your dreams, JUST LOOK AT ME YALL
EVERYBODY GET UP!!!!!!
