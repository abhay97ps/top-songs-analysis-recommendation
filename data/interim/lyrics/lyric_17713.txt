When the night has come
When the night has come and the land is dark
When the night has come
When the night has come and the land is dark 
And the moon is the only light 
And the moon is the only light 
And the moon is the only light - we will see
When the night 
Has come 
And the land is dark
And the moon 
Is the only 
Light we'll see
No I won't 
Be afraid 
Oh I 
Won't be afraid
Just as long 
As you stand 
Stand by me 
And darlin, darlin, stand by me
 stand by me
Just as long 
As you stand 
Stand by me 
If the sky 
That we look upon 
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain 
Should crumble 
To the sea 
I won't cry 
I won't cry 
No I  won't shed a tear
Just as long 
As you stand 
Stand by me 
And darlin, darlin, stand by me 
Stand by me just as long 
As you stand 
Stand by me 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Who a stand by me
Just as long as you 
Just as long as you 
Just as long as you stand by me
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Darlin, darlin, stand by me 
Stand by me
Just as long 
As you stand 
Stand by me 
Stand by me 
Stand by me
Just as long as you 
Just as long as you 
Just as long as you stand by me 
And darlin, darlin, stand by me 
Stand by me 
Just as long 
As you stand 
Stand by me
