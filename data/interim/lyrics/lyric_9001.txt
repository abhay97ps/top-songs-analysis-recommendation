What a diff'rence a day made
Twenty-four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers
Where there used to be rain
My yesterday was blue, dear
Today I'm part of you, dear
My lonely nights are through, dear
What a diff'rence a day makes
There's a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy
Since that moment of bliss, that thrilling kiss
What a diff'rence a day made
And the difference is you
Since that moment of bliss, that thrilling kiss
What a diff'rence a day made
And the difference is you
