Let's get it, shawty!
Oh, this that shit right here, nigga
What's up? Yeah! What's up?
103, a-yo! 
Nigga, 103 
When this shit drop in the club, nigga
A-yo! Yo
It go, it go...
Why y'all trip?  I'm just fine 
12:45 , bout that time 
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind 
Drink like a tank , lose my mind 
This shit crazy , way too bad 
Rosé, babe, waste two stacks 
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind 
I'm hearing voices in my head, think I'm schizophrenic 
I swear they saying, "Let's get it," from another planet 
Thirty-six a thousand times, I'm doing somersaults 
Do it right, and you can live your whole summer raw 
I'm out my mind, yeah, a nigga seeing double, y'all 
Tell me, what's the chance of Jizzle fucking both of y'all? 
She said, "Long as we can do it with your ice on" 
If that's the case, we might as well leave the lights on 
I'm out my mind, just blew a thousand Swisher Sweets 
In my black-and-orange Charger: call it Trick or Treat 
It ain't nothing to a boss: my goons got goons 
House stupid-dumb-big: my rooms got rooms 
Why y'all trip?  I'm just fine 
12:45 , bout that time 
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind 
Drink like a tank , lose my mind 
This shit crazy , way too bad 
Rosé, babe , waste two stacks 
Ayy, Young! This be rough, right?
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Goon Affiliated, baby!
Can't spell sober, lost my mind 
Ayy, ayy
Guess what my mama told me?  She hate my partners 
Guess why she hate em though  'Cause all of em robbing
Fuck the police , cause all of them problems 
White girls fun , 'cause all of them swallow 
Why I ain't fuck her at the house? 'Cause the bitch hollered 
And where the pill man at? She need a blue dolphin 
Old broke-ass nigga : stop cock-blocking 
Security, I need help cause the bitch stalking
A half fuckin' mil' , that's what the whip cost me 
100 dollars , that's what the pussy cost me 
And when the niggas start hating, that's when the nigga lost me 
"Fantástico," that's what the hoes call me
Why y'all trip?  I'm just fine 
12:45 , bout that time 
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind 
Drink like a tank , lose my mind 
This shit crazy , way too bad 
Rosé, babe, waste two stacks 
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind 
Drop the top, no bra, got the titties out 
Mention my name and bring the whole city out 
Doing what I do best: d-boy stuntin' 
New car, old money, d-boy stuntin' 
Step in cleaner than a new Glock-40 
My nickname in the A: "Strapped-Up Shawty" 
You know my nerves bad, trigger like a toothpick 
Line wrapped around the corner, boy, too big 
G-Code, black shades and my black chains 
Look, you wouldn't understand, it's a black thing 
You know we drink that Rosé til we black out 
Wake up, drink some more, pass back out 
Why y'all trip?  I'm just fine 
12:45 , bout that time 
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind 
Drink like a tank , lose my mind 
This shit crazy , way too bad 
Rosé, babe, waste two stacks 
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind 
What's up? 
103, yo! 
Nigga, 103 
Nigga, 103! 
It go, it go...
