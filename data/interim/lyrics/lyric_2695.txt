There's nothing I can say
There's nothing I can do
To make you care for me
The way I care for you
I'm so in love with you
I'll always be that way
If you don't feel it too
There's nothing I can do
There's nothing I can say
Except to pray
That there'll come a day
When love will start
A flame in your heart
To make you care for me
The way I care for you
That's all that I can say
That's all that I can do
I'm so in love with you
I'll always be that way
Until you feel it too
There's nothing I can do
There's nothing I can say
I'm so in love with you
There's nothing I can do
There's nothing I can say
