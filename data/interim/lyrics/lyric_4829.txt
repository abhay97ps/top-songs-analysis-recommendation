“January 14th”
Verse1:
This January 14th
And my feelings
Still feel conflicted
My personaitly is
Like fuck em
They ain't give no two fucks about us
I hate to see people hurt
But They ain’t wanna put no work in
Andif you dont grind
Then shit ain't gon work
A lotta money up on the table
Im saying  Fuck 12
Dont put me on probation
I fucked this bitch but see I got standerds
Was used to getting pussy
Then leaving
I fucked that bitch
I ain't gon keep her
Know it took too long
Im hearing figures
Bitch this far from youve been seeing
I been up since
Now Friday
Her and her friend
Prolly should slide now
Its still light
Gonna be dark soon
Dick em both down
No cap
Andd when I’m done
Shit
Right to rap
But when I'm  gone
Do you think you of me still
Maybe that shit dont last
Im going off now
How I  want to  be
Its Different stories
3  pathways
Lil nigga jugg
Hit the trap  way
Why she leave
Yeah
I want jer
Who would think  this ever  change
Now I'm fucking new bitches
Random women
Nah Ain't the same
Verse2:
Now If my  brains go  on the ceiling
Is that considered higher thinking
I got all the juice
I might as well just go ahead and send it
Whatchu thinking boo
This is only  what  I wanna do
I can't fuck up all theshit I have in store
An If a nigga try and take it
Ima  let the chopper run
I wanna be  here for forever bruh
No do not forget that
Said I decide when takeoff
Ima go up
Then keep going with it
Learned to Give no fucks bout what these niggas thinking of me lately
Ima make independent
But  label help
Would help too
Y'all want fancy cars
And nice clothes
But I want my own house
To be alone in
Speakers all throughout
Nigga More lit
Chorus:
Dont switch  on the gang
Dont switch  on the fam
Dont switch  on the real 
Who held you down from the start
Verse3:
Now its January 16th
Its Wednesday
I feel some type of way
My ego broke down
ProllyBout some months ago
Ive seen what really matters
Said most these people
Ain't got no clue of where they going
They living false lives
Go to college
To a degree but then what
Is you making a difference around you
Or you just living
Taking up space
You got a life now go and live it
Theres hella shit to see
Im running shit like diarehrae
These niggas hate you
And love you at the same time
Just stay focused
And hold it down
Lil nigga you gon be  just fine
Im in different league
More time
More bitches
Said more life
Who knew this what I need
I get it popping on my own time
Said most  these niggas lames
I dont owe em shit
They looking for some handouts
But its over with
Not about the status
But the message
Thats what og said
Id rather take them perks
But we ain't going through that shit again
I coulda murked some of these niggas
But I ain’t tryna throw my life away
So its fuck em till the day I die
Real shit

Dont switch  on the gang
Dont switch  on the fam
