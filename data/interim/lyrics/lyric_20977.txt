Have you ever seen
A dime-piece all alone at the bar?
Bar— Bar
Straight out of a magazine
And you just wanna let her know who you are
Are— Are
So you say, "Let me buy you a drink or a lil' conversation
If that's what you wanna do"
Do— Do
Then she says, "Club is about to end"
Then you say, "Why don't you come to my crib?"
Then she says, "I can't leave my friends"
Now, you've officially been chopped and screwed
Screwed— Screwed, chopped— chopped and screwed
You've officially been— and— and skrewed
And —ewed —ewed, chopped— screwed— screwed
You've officially been chopped and screwed
And— And— screwed, chopped— screwed— screwed
You've officially been screwed
Screwed, screwed— screwed, chopped— chopped and screwed
You've officially been— and— and skrewed
Shawty, don't chop me
Shawty, don't screw me 
Shawty— Shawty, don't chop me
Shawty, —ewed —ewed 
Shawty— Shawty, don't chop me
Shawty— Shawty, don't screw me
Shawty, don't chop me 
Don't— Don't screw me 
Have you ever been in the V.I.P. room
Of your favorite strip club?
Club— Club
And you got a shawty all on you, kissing on your neck
Makin you feel like she's so in love
Love— Love
Now you done got you a couple drinks
And you're feelin like it's 'bout that time to cuddle up, oh, ooh
Up— Up
Then you say, "Shawty, what's really up?"
She takes a big sip out your cup
Then, she says, "That'll be sixty bucks!"
Now, you've officially been chopped and screwed 
Screwed— Screwed, chopped— chopped and screwed
You've officially been— and— and skrewed
And —ewed —ewed, chopped— screwed— screwed 
You've officially been chopped— 
Now— Now— Now, shawty why you actin like that— like that?
Like, all you ever really wanna do is just doubt me 
Ludacris, can't— can't live without him
But even mo' I bet you really can't live without me 
You— You must've flipped your wig 
You gotta be out your mind 
I'll chop— chop— chop you, screw you— screw you
Out of your— Out of your spine 
Backbreaker , put you over my knee
Put you on punishment, woman, and I'll spank you 
Have you praisin the Lord like, "Thank you—
Thank you— Thank you— Lord, I wanna thank you!" 
But have you ever met a woman that'll lead you on
And steer you wrong instead of please you? 
Have you singing this song, 'cause all night long
She did nothing but flirt and tease you? 
Well, I gotta admit that I have 
Put one in the air, sit back, and I laugh 
Shawty, why you insist on doing me that bad? 
Probably 'cause of the amount of booty that I've grabbed 
Coming back to haunt me
So instead of being put into submission and subdued
 Guess what, dawg?
Hahaha! L—L—L—Luda!
Now, you've officially been chopped and screwed
Screwed— Screwed, chopped— chopped and screwed
You've officially been— and— and skrewed
And —ewed —ewed, chopped— screwed— screwed
You've officially been chopped and screwed
And— And— screwed, chopped— screwed— screwed
You've officially been screwed
Screwed, screwed— screwed, chopped— chopped and screwed
You've officially been— and— and skrewed

Shawty— Shawty, don't chop me
Shawty, —ewed —ewed 
Shawty— Shawty, don't chop me
Shawty— Shawty, don't screw me
