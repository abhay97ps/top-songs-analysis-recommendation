Arf-arf
Yeah, uh, yeah , yeah, uh 
Yeah, don't get it twisted
This rap shit is mine, motherfucker
It's not a fuckin' game
Fuck what you heard 
It's what you hearin' 
It's what you hearin' 
It's what you hearin' 
It's what you hearin' 
X gon' give it to ya 
Fuck waitin' for you to get it on your own, X gon' deliver to ya 
Knock-knock, open up the door, it's real
With the non-stop pop-pop from stainless steel
Go hard, gettin' busy with it 
But I got such a good heart that I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it 
Damn right, and I'll do it again 
'Cause I am light so I gots to win 
Break bread with the enemy 
No matter how many cats I break bread with, I'll break who you sendin' me 
You motherfuckers never wanted nothin' but your life saved 
Bitch, and that's on a light day 
I'm gettin' down  like a nigga said "Freeze" 
But won't be the one endin' up on his knees
Bitch please,  if the only thing you cats did
Was came out to play, stay out my way, motherfucker
First, we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go 
X gon' give it to ya , he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya , he gon' give it to ya
First, we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go
X gon' give it to ya , he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya , he gon' give it to ya
They ain't never gave nothin' to me 
But every time I turn around cats got they hands out wantin' somethin' from me 
I ain't got it, so you can't get it 
Let's leave it at that 'cause I ain't with it 
Hit it with full strength 
I'm a jail nigga, so I face the world like it's Earl in the bullpen
You against me, me against you 
Whatever, whenever, nigga, fuck you gon' do?
I'm a wolf in sheep's clothin' 
Only nigga that you know who can chill, come back and get the streets open
I've been doin' this for nineteen years 
Niggas wanna fight me? Fight these tears 
I put in work and it's all for the kids 
But these cats done forgot what work is 
They don't know who we be, lookin'
But they don't know who they see, nigga
First, we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go 
X gon' give it to ya , he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya , he gon' give it to ya 
First, we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go 
X gon' give it to ya , he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya , he gon' give it to ya
Ayo, where my niggas at?
I know I got 'em down in the streets, give 'em love and they give it back 
Talk too much for too long 
Don't give up, you're too strong 
Love to the wild, wild hunnids 
Shout out to niggas that done it 
And it ain't even about the dough 
It's about gettin' down for what you stand for, yo, for real
First, we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go 
X gon' give it to ya , he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya , he gon' give it to ya 
First, we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go 
X gon' give it to ya , he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya , he gon' give it to ya 
First, we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go 
X gon' give it to ya , he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya , he gon' give it to ya 
Come on
Uh, uh, come on
