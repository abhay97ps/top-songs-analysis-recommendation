When I was ten years old
I remember thinking how cool it would be
When we were goin' on an eight hour drive
If I could just watch TV
And I'd have given anything
To have my own PacMan game at home
I used to have to get a ride down to the arcade
Now I've got it on my phone
He-e-ey
Glory glory hallelujah
Welcome to the future
My grandpa was in World War II
He fought against the Japanese
He wrote a hundred letters to my grandma
Mailed 'em from his base in the Philippines
I wish they could see this now
The world they say has changed you know
'Cause I was on a video chat this morning
With a company in Tokyo
He-e-ey
Everyday's a revolution
Welcome to the future
He-e-ey
Look around it's all so clear
He-e-ey
Wherever we were going, well we're here
He-e-ey
So many things I never thought I'd see
Happening right in front of me
I had a friend in school
Running-back on a football team
They burned a cross in his front yard
For asking out the homecoming queen
I thought about him today
And everybody who's seen what he's seen
From a woman on a bus
To a man with a dream
He-e-ey
Wake up Martin Luther
Welcome to the future
He-e-ey
Glory glory hallelujah
Welcome to the future
