Ooh!
Why don't you believe me
When I say that I love you?
I'm crazy 'bout you
You wear the face that tells me
You think my loving ain't true
I'm all about you
You're my desire, I get higher
Every time I speak your name
All I do 
And the way that I can't sleep at night
Just proves what I go through
I'm crazy 'bout you
Now the first time that I saw you walkin' down the street so pretty
Go on with your bad self
Now you say that I don't love when it's giving my love pains
It's the hurt and the tension
Girl, it's drivin' me insane
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
Why don't you believe me
When I say that I am true?
I'm crazy 'bout you
I'm here to love and please you
I'll do what you want me to
I'm all about you
Living and hopin', but I'm copin'
With these things you put me through
All I do 
The way that I can't sleep at night
Just proves what I go through
I'm crazy 'bout you
Now the first time that I saw you walkin' down the street so pretty
Go on with your bad self
Now you say that I don't love when it's giving my love pains
It's the hurt and the tension
Girl, it's drivin' me insane
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
Oh, everything I do
You're the one I care, that’s all I'm askin' for
Love you hard, my baby, that’s all I wanna say
You're the one I care, that’s all I'm askin' for
Know you are my love
My lovely one, that’s all I'm askin' for
That’s all I'm askin' for, that’s all I'm askin' for
Love you hard, my girl, yeah
