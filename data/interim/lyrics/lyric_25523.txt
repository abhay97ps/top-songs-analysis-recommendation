We The Best Music
2019 we ain't taking no shorts unless we going on vacation
Big fish
Another one
Uh
DJ Khaled
Drop top gone 
Selling popcorn 
I went from list of most wanted to the top of the Forbes
Fucked up the trenches 
I weather the storm 
Young living legend, I be on that shit that these niggas ain't on 
I went to war with the system 
To give my son toys on Christmas 
Probably won't give me no Grammy 
Putting awards on wrists 
We had to kill just to make it out, shit, we puttin' rewards on niggas 
Live by the gun and we die about it, shit, I'm praying the sword don't kill us
Praying the Lord forgive us, we going to war with killers
They put a bounty all on my dawgs, want 'em dead by morning, nigga
We took risks to live like this, ain't doing consignment 
I brought my mama tears, and I turned 'em to VVS diamonds 
I know you see me on top of my game, ain't see me declining
Turned to a monster, the next time you saw me, you seen I was climbing 
They took my elevator, I said fuck it, I'm taking the steps 
Got me on bail, they want me in jail, they say I'm a threat 
Fighting for freedom 11 years, they been taking my breath 
Watching the feds taking pictures, it been making me stress 
Tapping my phone, taking my rights, and making 'em wrong
Deep in this shit, had to dance with the devil to make it back home, yeah
I got a call from one of the dawgs, say, "You been riding private"
He say I should tell the pilot to come and get him
And the crazy part about it, my nigga sitting in a prison
And the other crazy part about it, I really know that feeling, yeah
I can't put my trust inside the system
Gotta be here for my sisters
And my niece believe in Christmas
And her dad, somebody killed him
Some shit I don't remember
'Cause I left him in a box when they had me in them locks
I blame God for my convictions
Never give a judge that ammunition
Never had no codefendants
God gon' be my only witness
Never take it personal, it's whatever when we handling business
We been through the worst, them situations we can never mention
You gon' have your mom losing her mind if you get a conviction
Got some homies sitting in the feds, hope they get an eviction
Praying to his gun, he got his fire, he ain't got no religion
I heard Meek got 2 for a wheelie and I was in the kitchen serving Had me thinking is it all worth it?
Thinking 'bout the chances that I took to buy you purses
Thinking 'bout them licks that we went on and just go splurge it
Switched it up and everything been working
