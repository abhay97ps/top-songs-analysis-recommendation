I know there's a man who can sell time
I can take it away and say that it's mine
He smiles from a distance and lives in a tree
Holding out a welcome hand, just for you and me
Money is chocolate, wrapped in a silver cloud
Everybody would, but no one is allowed
There's no tomorrow, only today
When it rains, it rains lemonade
So come with me and meet a man
Whose job it is, it's selling all this time
Before he spreads his wings
And starts to flying 'round the sky
People are shadows, trapped in a golden well
And only children's eyes can break the spell
They live in a land where the clocks grow on trees
And words sound just like a cool summer breeze
I know that this man who does sell time
Is someone who's lying deep in my mind
It's all sad to think that there is such a man
When you're lonely you can join me in his hand
Come with me and meet a man
Whose job it is, it's selling all this time
Before he spreads his wings
And starts to flying 'round the sky
