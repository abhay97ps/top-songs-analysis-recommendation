Let me tell you bout Humphrey the Camel amblin' across the sands umm
All the Nomads givin' him a great big hand
He's a big ugly Mammal and he's very very hairy
All the Shieks know he's a swinging Dromedary uhhuh oh yeah
Talkin' bout Humphrey the Camel
In the middle of the night by the light of an Arab moon
They say that you can see him stompin' up and down the dunes
He's a big raunchy cat but he swings right along
Groovin' to the beat of a Nashville song uhhuh oh yeah
Talkin' bout Humphrey the Camel
Everybody digs Humphrey the Cammel come see Camel Humphrey the Camel
But he's a body jumper a real hip humper talkin' bout Humphrey the Camel
Down at the Oasis the Arabs were pickin' their dates
They're goin' to a party out at the Sultan's place
There's a camel named Camelia and Humphrey's gonna bring her
One big drink and he's a seven day swinger uhhuh oh yeah
Talkin' bout Humphrey the Camel
Everybody digs Humphrey the Cammel...
