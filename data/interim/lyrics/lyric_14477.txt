So many kinds, where can we start
We like them dumb and we like them smart
I like the ones with the pretty eyes
Well, I like all kinds of guys
Stop!
What happened?
How about the ones we especially like?
Which ones?
You know, the ones with the cars that go
I hear ya!
Hit it!
It was me and the posse with Bunny D
We were cruising in the Jags or the Lamborghinis
When lo and behold, there appeared a mirage
He was hooking up a car in his daddy's garage
We stopped short, did a double take
He was looking so fly I thought I wasn't awake
He was obviously hooking up bass I assumed
But then he turned the little button and the car went boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom
We like them short and we like them tall
We like them one and we like them all
They're always adding speakers when they find the room
'Cause they know we love the guys with the cars that go boom
And see my boyfriend really knows where it's at
He's got 50-inch woofers all along the back
He makes a comment on going to my room
But I'd rather stay out with his car that goes boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom
Now if your car ain't got it
Go out and get it
We like the boom
And don't you forget it
So turn down the treble
And flaunt your bass
So your car could be heard
Almost any place
Cause when you're in the street
You can't go far
Without hearing the boom
Pouring out your car
So if your speakers weak
Then please turn it off
Cause we like the cars
That sound so tough
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom
Everybody, just beep your horn if you hear us
Just beep your horn if you hear us
Just beep your horn
Now clap 
Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Beep! Come on, everybody! Beep! Beep!
Beep!
