Children, go where I send you
I'm gonna send you to that land
The land of a thousand dances
Got to know how to Pony
Like "Bony Maronie"
You got to know how to Twist
Goes like this
Mashed Potato
Do the Alligator
Twist, twister
Like your sister
Then you get your Yo-Yo
Say, hey, let's go-go
Get out on your knees
Do the Sweet Peas
Roll over on your back
Say, "I Like It Like That"
Do the Watusi
Do the Watusi
Then you do the Fly
With the Hand Jive
Then you do the Slop
The Chicken and the Bop
Then you do the Fish
Slow, slow Twist
Then you do the Flow
Got to move solo
Then you do the Tango
Takes two to Tango
Popeye, children
Popeye, children
Popeye, children
Come on, children
I wanna show you
This little place
'Cross the track
The name of this place
"I Like It Like That"
The name of the band
The Twistolettes
Come on, children
I wanna show you
I wanna show you
I wanna show you
Come on, children
