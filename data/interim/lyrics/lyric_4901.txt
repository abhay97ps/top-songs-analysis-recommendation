I get money from you
To tickle your whim
Or blow up your mind
Then I give money to you
And you pay me back in kind
Now, I gave money to Bill
He pays up my bills
And helps me make up my mind
And I give money to Bill
And he will be on my side
Then I gave money to Joe
'Cause Bill said he knows
He'll pay me back in time
And Bill's gettin' paid to know
If anyone's lyin'
Now, Bill said to give it to Hank
'Cause Hank owns a bank
And he can make it grow
Now, ain't those amazin' folks
That Bill is lucky to know
Somehow my finances will grow
With the interest I show
In the interest it gives me
And now a piece of paper from me
Won't seem half as flimsy
