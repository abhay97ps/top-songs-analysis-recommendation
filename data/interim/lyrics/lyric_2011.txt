Hey
There's a surfin' party at the shore tonight
Everybody's here
When I taught my baby and she's outta sight
Yes she disappears
I see them surfin', twistin, lovin', kissin'
Well I got nobody now to hold me tight
Where in the world is my little girl
Group Surf Party
Come on come on
Group Surf Party
Dawn till dawn
Everybody's groovin' and the mob is really movin'
At the Surfin' Party tonight
Hey
Hey
Well I started searchin' over land and sea
Where'd my baby go
And I know for certain that she's true to me
Cause she told me so
I see them surfin', twistin, lovin', kissin'
She's still flirtin' with Stagger Lee
Where in the world is my little girl
Everybody
Group Surf Party
Moon above
Group Surf Party
Dance for love
Everybody's groovin' and the mob is really movin'
At the Surfin' Party tonight
Chics
Look at them cats run
It started  like a  fish
And it looks like fun
I see them surfin', twistin, lovin', kissin'
The whole darn  havin' lots of kicks
Where in the world is my little girl
Group Surf Party
Come on come on
Group Surf Party
Dawn till dawn
Everybody's groovin' and the mob is really movin'
At the Surfin' Party tonight
One more time
Group Surf Party
Come on come on
Group Surf Party
Move it don't cha know it
Everybody's groovin' and the mob is really movin'
At the Surfin' Party tonight
At the Surfin' Party tonight
