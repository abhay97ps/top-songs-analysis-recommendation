Drinkin' all night, but we ain't done yet 
Waitin' on the plug, but he ain't come yet 
Still need somethin'? Put your bank on it 
Got a big bag with a Bape on it 
Party ain't over if they say somethin' 
No sleep 'til I've seen three suns 
Party gon' end with a threesome 
Raw dog, prolly have three sons
Chasin' the Perc' with some Buddy, that shit never lets me down 
They go to work for some money, we make it from actin' out 
Grrrrrah, we takin' shots right now 
Grrrrrah, yeah, we takin' shots right now 
See me in a 'Rari goin' vroom-vroom 
Sexy motherfucker in a cartoon
Saint Laurent, forty on a new suit
Sippin' Bud Light, that's a new cruise
Baby, bust it open like woo-hoo
The diamonds got cut like a boo-boo
Pockets so fat, rock a muu-muu
Me and Dre came for the pum pum
Drippin', drippin', drippin', women tryna take my millions
Help my bro with an assist I'm Jason Williams 
Heard that there's a party, I might pay a visit 
That's a moment, hopped out frog like ribbit, ribbit 
Drunk when I walked in the door, so fuckin' high like, "Hello"
I told her pour me some more, then she went right for the blow 
Thirty more girls wanna roll, let's get this bitch on the road 
Already losin' control, this is the life that we chose
Drinkin' all night, but we ain't done yet 
Waitin' on the plug, but he ain't come yet 
Still need somethin'? Put your bank on it 
Got a big bag with a Bape on it 
Party ain't over if they say somethin' 
No sleep 'til I've seen three suns 
Party gon' end with a threesome 
Raw dog, prolly have three sons
Chasin' the Perc' with some Buddy, that shit never lets me down 
They go to work for some money, we make it from actin' out 
Grrrrrah, we takin' shots right now 
Grrrrrah, yeah, we takin' shots right now 
Frontin' on me, but you love it 
Tryna act like you above it 
Dad bod know you wanna rub it 
Have you ever done it in public?
Sippin' all night, let it rotate
Baby, just for the night, you my soulmate
Mixin' vodka with the champagne
Tell me how much liquor can a man take
How many records have I sold?
I don't even know, can't keep count 
You know that I've been on a roll
Celebratin' life when I come around 
Sippin' all night, sippin' all day
Brought the beerbong out like a tailgate
Holdin' big words that I can't say
Got me speakin' drunkanese, can you translate?
Drunk when I walked in the door, so fuckin' high like, "Hello"
I told her pour me some more, then she went right for the blow 
Thirty more girls wanna roll, let's get this bitch on the road 
Already losin' control, this is the life that we chose
