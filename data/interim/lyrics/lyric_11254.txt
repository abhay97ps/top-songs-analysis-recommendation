Can't you see what I'm tryin' to do?
Could you spare a moment or two? Oh
I touch your head, feel your lips
I could kiss you with my fingertips, oh
All I want is your pretty face
All I need is your pretty face
All I gotta do is stop
And shiver and shake
I shiver and shake
I shiver and shake
I close your eyes and lookin' at you
All this beauty you're puttin' me through, oh
You overwhelm me with just a glance
To stare at you, I haven't a chance, oh
All I want is your pretty face
And all I need is your pretty face
So all I gotta do is stop
And shiver and shake
Make me shiver and shake
I start to shiver and shake
Girl, you make me shiver and shakе
I shiver and shake
Can't you see what I'm tryin' to do?
Could you spare a momеnt or two? Oh
I touch your head, I feel your lips
I could kiss you with my fingertips
All I want is your pretty face
And all I need is your pretty face
All I gotta do is stop
And shiver and shake
I shiver and shake
I start to shiver and shake
Make me shiver and shake
Girl, I start to shiver and shake, shake, shake
I shiver and shake, shake, shake
I shiver and shake
I said I shiver and I shake, shake, shake
When I shiver and shake, shake
Stop, shiver, and shake, shake, shake
