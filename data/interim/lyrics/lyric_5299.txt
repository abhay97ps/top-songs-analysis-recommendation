There's a new sun Rising up angry in the sky
And there's a new voice Saying we're not afraid to die
Let the old world make believe It's blind and deaf and dumb
But nothing can change the shape of things to come
There are changes Lying ahead in every road
And there are new thoughts Ready and waiting to explode
When tomorrow is today The bells may toll for some
But nothing can change the shape of things to come
The future's coming in, now Sweet and strong
Ain't no-one going to hold it back for long
There are new dreams Crowding out old realities
There's revolution Sweeping in like a fresh new breeze
Let the old world make believe It's blind and deaf and dumb
But nothing can change the shape of things
But nothing can change the shape of things
But nothing can change the shape of things
But nothing can change the shape of things to come
