Everyone is warm inside, their houses in the snow
The mercury is dropping down to minus ten below
Outside it's chilling but inside it's thrilling
With fireplaces burning and records that keep turning
Gone is the green grass the trees have turned brown
The sky has gone gray, it's now winter's day
The parks they are empty, no squeaks from the swings
No kids are at play, it's now winter's day
And here we are snuggled warm in each others arms
Listening to silent sound as the snow packs the ground
Perfumed hair that I smell, essence that I like so well
You are my winter, the days and the nights
In our hideaway, its now winter's day
Our love will grow stronger a minute has chilled
Inside we will play, it's now winter's day
And everyone is warm inside, their houses in the snow
The mercury is dropping down to minus ten below
Outside it's chilling but inside it's thrilling
With fireplaces burning and records that keep turning
