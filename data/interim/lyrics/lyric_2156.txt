Hey little girl
I watch you dance and you look so fine
Hey little girl
You do the monkey, right on time
A please let me have a chance with you
For I like to do the monkey too
And let's get together
Let's get together right now
Let's get together, I need your company
Well count on me, a little girl, a little girl
The way you move you just thrill me so
Hey little girl
I'm trying hard not to let myself go
But work out everything is all right
The way you move you just out of sight
And let's get together
Let's get together right now
Let's get together, I need your company
Well count on me, a little girl, a little girl
Can you do the twist
Goes something like this
Well how about the watusi yeah
Work out and hang loosely
A please let me have a chance with you
For I like to do the monkey too
And let's get together
Let's get together right now
Let's get together, I need your company
Well count on me, a little girl, a little girl
I said you look so fine
Well it's monkey time
A can you can do the bird
