What d'you see when you look at me?
You got somethin' you need to say
Your eyes are cryin' but your voice is still
Well don't wait for charity to pay your bill, now now
Stand up, the door is open wide
Stand up, it's time to turn your tide
Just once tell me what you keep behind those eyes
We all plead intentions but the devil's intentions aren't good, ya know
Everybody has got their cross
But you wear yours right across your face
You're damning me with your sainted eyes
Suffering our compromise, now now
Stand up, the door is open wide
Stand up, it's time to turn your tide
Just once tell me what you keep behind those eyes
We all plead intentions but the devil's intentions aren't good
Stand up, the door is open wide
Stand up, it's time to turn your tide
Just once tell me what you keep behind those eyes
We all plead intentions but the devil's intentions aren't good, ya know
Stand up, the door is open wide
Stand up, it's time to turn your tide
Just once tell me what you keep behind those eyes
We all plead intentions but the devil's intentions aren't good
