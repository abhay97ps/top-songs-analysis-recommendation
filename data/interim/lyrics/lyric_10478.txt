Hey, lover, I got a sugarcane
That I want to lose in you, baby can you stand the pain?
Hey, lover, sugar, don't you see?
There's so many things that you do to me
Ooh, baby!
All I want to see is the love in your eyes
And all I wanna hear is your sweet love sighs
All I wanna feel is a burning flame
Tell me, tell me, baby, that you feel the same
Tell me that you feel the same way I do
Tell me that you love me, girl
If this is lust, then I must confess I feel it every day
If this is wrong, then I long to be as far from right as I may
Soft and wet
Soft and wet
Soft and wet
Soft and wet
Every time I'm with you, you just love me to death
Ooh wee, baby, you leave me without breath
Oh, baby!
Ooh, yeah
You're just as soft as a lion tamed
You're just as wet as the evening rain
And I really dig it when you call my name
Your love is driving me, you're driving me insane
Crazy, baby, oh, girl
Crazy about your love!
Soft and wet 
You are soft and wet 
Your love is soft and wet
Ooh, soft and wet
