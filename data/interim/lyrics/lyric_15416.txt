It's getting harder to conceal, yeah
Do I fit in the life that you're living, boy?
Do you feel all the love I've been giving you?
Oh, when I come home
Do you care to see me?
Things ain't the way they used to be, baby

How bout you
But don't just send me away
To be alone
I don't think I can take it
Cause if you tell me to go

Don't ask me to stay
Don't do me wrong, yeah
Do I fit in the life that you're living, boy?
Do you feel all the love I've been giving you?

Do you care to see me?
Things ain't the way they used to be, baby

And you don't want to believe it
You can't take love and just walk away
With the guilt that you carry
You'll be back someday
