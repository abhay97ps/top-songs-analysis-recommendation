Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye
He'll never love you the way that I love you
'Cause if he did, no no, he wouldn't make you cry
He might be thrillin' baby, but a-my love 
So dog-gone willin', so kiss him
Go on and kiss him goodbye, now
Na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye
He's never near you to comfort and cheer you
When all those sad tears are fallin', baby, from your eyes
He might be thrillin' baby but a-my love 
So dog-gone willin', so kiss him
Go on and kiss him goodbye
Na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye
