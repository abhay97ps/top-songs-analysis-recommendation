You remember that baron flying high in the sky
When Snoopy shot him down with a gleam in his eye
But that German had leaped from his blood red plane
Just before it burst into a ball of flame
Snoopy circled back, checked his kill
Saw that bloody Red Baron standing high on a hill
Then he swooped down low, shouted, "Curse you, Red Baron!"
The German shook his fist. You could hear him swear
Hey, watch out, there, Snoopy. You're really in a mess
You thought you were through with that bloody Red Baron
But it looks like he's not down, yet
Then a cry went up all over the land
The bloody Red Baron would strike again
But, brave, little Snoopy said, "Never fear."
As he headed for his plane, all the people cheered
Hey, watch out, little Snoopy. You're really in a mess
You thought you were through with that bloody Red Baron
But it looks like he's not down, yet
Snoopy blazed a trail straight across the sea
Searching in vain for his enemy
Then he found that German trying to fix his plane;
A-sweatin' and a-flustered, about to go insane
Snoopy landed for a pistol duel
The Baron was worried; Snoopy was cool
He fired a shot, missed, started to run
Before Snoopy had a chance to raise his gun
Hey, watch out, Red Baron. Snoopy is on your trail
One of these days, he's gonna make you pay, and you'll go straight to
Well, watch out, Red Baron. Snoopy is on your trail
One of these days, he's gonna make you pay, and you'll go straight to...
