Baby, baby, baby, don't leave me
Oh, please don't leave me all by myself
I've got this burnin', burnin', yearnin' feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me and it hurts so bad
You came into my heart  so tenderly
With a burnin' love  that stings like a bee
Now that I surrender  so helplessly
You now wanna leave , ooh, you wanna leave me
Ooh, baby, baby, baby, where did our love go?
Oh, don't you want me , don't you want me no more?
Ooh, baby
INSTRUMENTAL INTERLUDE
Baby, baby, where did our love go?
And all your promises  of a love forever more?
I've got this burnin', burnin', yearnin' feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me  and it hurts so bad
Before you won my heart  you were a perfect guy
But now that you got me  you wanna leave me behind
Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't leave me
Oh, please don't leave me  all by myself
Ooh , baby, baby, where did our love go?
