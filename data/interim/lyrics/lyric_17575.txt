Bring it on, bring it on
Bring it on, bring it on {Break it down}
Bring it on, bring it on 
Bring it on, baby, just bring it on
It's two o'clock in the morning
This is the time when games begin
I feel your body shakin'
'Cause you know just what I'm thinkin'
Let's lie here on the floor
'Cause my bedroom's too far to go
I just wanna get into you
And I'll do anything that you wanna do, just
Bring it on, bring it on 
Bring it on, bring it on {Break it down}, oh, ho
Bring it on, bring it on 
Bring it on, baby, just bring it on
Let me know if this is okay
If my body's movin', movin' the right way
{If you like what I'm doing scream a little loud, louder}
'Cause it feels so good to me
Makin' love to you sets my body free, baby
{And I know you wanna get freaky}
Your sexy body makes me scream and you're on top so, girl, do your thing
I just wanna satisfy so I'll get on my knees 
To know I'm goin down 'cause, girl, I know you like it
So bring it on me
Bring it on, bring it on 
Bring it on , bring it on {Break it down}
Bring it on, bring it on 
Bring it on, baby, just bring it on 
Bring it on, bring it on 
Bring it on, bring it on 
Bring it on, bring it on 
Bring it on, baby, just bring it on
Oh...keep it comin' 'cause it feels so good
No one has ever loved me like this
Not even close, never before
Doin' me like I have never been done before
Oh...take your time
Let's make it last all night long
My main concern is just to turn you on, and on
Bring it on
Bring it on, bring it on 
Bring it on, bring it on 
Bring it on, bring it on 
Bring it on, baby, just bring it on 
Bring it on, bring it on 
Bring it on, bring it on 
Bring it on, bring it on 
Bring it on, baby, just bring it on
