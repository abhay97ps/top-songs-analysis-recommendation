Winter getting colder, summer getting warmer
Tidal wave coming 'cross the Mexican border
Why buy a gallon, it's cheaper by the barrel
Just don't get busted singing Christmas carols
That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burning
Funny how the world keeps turning
Look ma, no hands
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride
Momma gets her rocks off watching' Desperate Housewives
Daddy works his ass off paying' for the good life
Kids on the YouTube learning how to be cool
Living in a cruel world, pays to be a mean girl
That's us, That's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burning
Funny how the world keeps turning
Look ma, no hands
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride
Poor little infamous, America's town
She gained five pounds and lost her crown
Quick fix plastic surgical antidote
Got herself a record deal, can't even sing a note
Plasma getting bigger, Jesus getting smaller
Spill a cup of coffee, make a million dollars
Customs caught a thug with an aerosol can
If the shoe don't fit, fits gonna hit the shan
That's us, That's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burning
Funny how the world keeps turning
Hot dog, Hot damn
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride
Oh yeah
