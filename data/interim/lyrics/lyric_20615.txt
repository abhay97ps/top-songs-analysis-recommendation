We can go to the tropics , sip piña coladas, shorty, I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums, where killers get hung, shorty, I could take you there
You know I could take you 
I could take you 
Shorty, I could take you there
You know I could take you 
I could take you 
Shorty, I could take you there
Baby girl, I know it's rough, but come with me, we could take a trip to the hood
It's no problem, girl, it's my city, I could take you there 
Little kid with guns, only fifteen, roaming the streets, up to no good
When gun shots just bust, just run quickly, I could show you where 
As long you're with me, baby, you'll be alright 
I'm known in the ghetto, girl, just stay by my side 
Or we can leave the slums, go to paradise
Babe, it's up to you , it's whatever you like
We can go to the tropics, sip piña coladas, shorty, I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums, where killers get hung, shorty, I could take you there
You know I could take you 
I could take you 
Shorty, I could take you there
You know I could take you 
I could take you 
Shorty, I could take you there
Shorty, come with me, it's no worries, I know the bad mandem where I stay
Police fly past you in a hurry, this is no gun play 
Don't be scared, I know the West Indies, it's Jamaica, that's where I'm from
Might see something that you're not used to, welcome to the slums 
As long you're with me, baby, you'll be alright
I'm known in the ghetto, girl, just stay by my side
Or we can leave the slums, go to paradise
Babe, it's up to you, it's whatever you like
We can go to the tropics, sip piña coladas, shorty, I could take you there 
Or we can go to the slums, where killers get hung, shorty, I could take you there
You know I could take you 
I could take you 
Shorty, I could take you there
You know I could take you 
I could take you 
Shorty, I could take you there
Or we 
Can go 
To a place 
I know you gon' like 
The beach 
The breeze 
West Indies , I call it paradise
We can go to the tropics , sip piña coladas, shorty, I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums , where killers get hung , shorty, I could take you there
You know I could take you 
I could take you 
Shorty, I could take you there
You know I could take you 
I could take you 
Shorty, I could take you there
