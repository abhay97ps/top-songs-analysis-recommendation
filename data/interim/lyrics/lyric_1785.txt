Oom oppa mmm, oom oppa mm
Why do lovers break each others heart?
Oh, tell me why do lovers have to drift apart?
When we met, the world was right
Now I'm crying every night
Why do lovers break each others heart?
Why do lovers break each others heart?
Oh, tell me why can't lovers finish what they start?
A year ago, we were one
Now just look at what we've done
Why do lovers break each others heart?
Tell me, tell me
I don't understand
Why we always hurt
The ones we love
Tell, me, tell me
Where's the life we planned?
Where are the dreams that
We were dreaming of?
Why do lovers break each others heart?
Oh, tell me why do lovers have to drift apart?
When me met, the world was right
Now I'm crying every night
Why do lovers break each others heart?
When me met, the world was right
Now I'm crying every night
Why do lovers break each others heart
Oh, tell me why
Oh, tell me, tell me
Why, why, why, why
