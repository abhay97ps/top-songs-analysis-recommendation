Can't remember my first memory of you
You were always there
And now I know I never knew you well
But I was just a kid
And you were always there to pick me up everytime I fell
And you always warmed a blanket to wrap around my feet
When you tucked me into bed to say my prayers
And I'll bet I never thanked you among all the other things
That I took for granted cause you were always there
Yes, you were always there
So we never took the time
For you to tell me your dreams
And me to tell you mine
And we never took the time
To talk of love and happiness
And life and death and heartache
And pain and loneliness
Why I don't even know if you were happy
Or if you could have been
Or if you could have one wish what would it be
Or what would you do differently if you could live again
And were you glad that you gave life to me
And I'd give anything to tell you am
I glad that you were born
But you'll never hear the words I've learned to say
Cause before I got to know you died of loneliness
And they tell me I grew up and moved away
Yes, you were always there
So we never took the time
For you to tell me your dreams
And me to tell you mine
There were so many things that could have been
But now we'll never share
Cause kids don't know much
And you were always there
No, kids don't know much
And you were always there
