I woke up this morning
With this feeling inside me that I can't explain
Like a weight that I've carried been carried away, away
But I know something is coming
I don't know what it is, but I know it's amazing
You save me
My time is coming
And I'll find my way out of this longest drought
It feels like today, I know
I know it feels like today, I'm sure
It's the one thing that's missing
The one thing I'm wishing
The last sacred blessing, and hey
It feels like today
Feels like today
You treat life like a picture
But it's not a moment that's frozen in time
It's not gonna wait 'til you make up your mind, at all
So while this storm is breaking
While there's light at the end of the tunnel
Keep running towards it
Releasing the pressure, that's my heartache
Soon this dam will break
It feels like today, I know
I know it feels like today, I'm sure
It's the one thing that's missing
The one thing you're wishing
The last sacred blessing, and hey
It feels like today
Feels like today
Oh, oh, oh oh oh
It feels like today, I know
I know it feels like today, I'm sure
It's the one thing that's missing
The one thing I'm wishing
The last sacred blessing, and hey
It feels like today 
Feels like today 
It's the one thing that's missing
The one thing you're wishing
The last sacred blessing
Feels like today
Feels like
Feels like your life changes
Feels like
Feels like your life changes
