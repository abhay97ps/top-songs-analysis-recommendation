She's got a foxy smile
But I better warn ya
She's the straightest lady
In the state of California
They raised her by the book
And reads on page one
"Senoritas, they don't make love for fun"
It just ain't done
Let me tell you 'bout
Ma-ma-ma-mamacita
She'll break your heart when you meet her
She's so sweet you could eat her
Ma-ma-ma-mamacita
I dream about those cherry lips
That never been tasted
And it just tears me apart
To think how they've been wasted
She's savin' all her love
Ain't givin' none away
Senoritas, they never shout "Olé"
'Til their weddin' day
Come and help me now
Ma-ma-ma-mamacita
She'll break your heart when you meet her
She's so sweet you could eat her
Ma-ma-ma-mamacita
I'm gonna say "I do"
And when we get it done
We gonna watch the kids
Come one by one by one by one by one by one by one
Two, three, four
Ma-ma-ma-mamacita
She'll break your heart when you meet her
She's so sweet you could eat her
Ma-ma-ma-mamacita
Yes, she's ma-ma-ma-mamacita
She'll break your heart when you meet her
So sweet you could eat her
Ma-ma-ma-mamacita
Ma-ma-ma-mamacita
