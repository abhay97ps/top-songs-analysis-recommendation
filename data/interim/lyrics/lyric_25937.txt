 Ooh
So I never really knew you
God, I really tried to
Blindsided, addicted
Thought we could really do this
But really, I was foolish
Hindsight, it's obvious
Talking with my lawyer
She said, "Where'd you find this guy?"
I said, "Young people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes"
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe
It's funny how a memory
Turns into a bad dream
And running wild turns volatile
It's not funny how it changes
Ended up like strangers
And we burned down our paper house
Talking with your father
He said that you could be mine
But some people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe
They say it's better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all
That could be a load of shit
But I just need to tell you all
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just engaged
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe
 You can think that you're in love
 Oh, that's the moral of the story, that's the moral
