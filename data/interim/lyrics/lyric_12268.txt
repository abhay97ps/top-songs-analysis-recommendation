Let me tell you 'bout the girl I know
She's been to Paris, France
And she can really dance
Like a spinning top
She's got no stop
She picks you up and then
She lets you drop
Listen
Ooh
Let me tell you 'bout the girl I know
'Cause she's really hip
And she can go, go, go
Like a straight shooter she's got hers down
Won't hesitate to put you on the ground
She's been with The Rolling Stones
On their tours
And in their homes
Won't tell you where she's bound
'Cause she ain't lost and don't want to be found
But
Ooh, maybe tonight
Yeah, she'll find the time
To give me her phone
So I can call her at home
But she's so whirly
Whirly, whirly, whirly, whirly girl 
Whirly girl  whirly girl
Whirly, whirly, whirly, whirly girl
Whirly girl, whirly girl
Let me tell you 'bout the girl I know
She's been to Paris, France
And she can really dance
Like a spin top
She's got no stop
She picks you up and then
She lets you drop
This girl just combs her hair
And takes her tea
With millionaires
She's sitting in the latest styles
With open legs
And mysterious smiles
Ooh, maybe tonight
Yeah, she'll find the time
To give me her phone
So I can call her at home
Hey
Ooh-ooh
Whirly, whirly, whirly, whirly girl
Whirly girl, whirly girl
Whirly, whirly, whirly, whirly girl
Whirly girl, whirly girl
Whirly, whirly, whirly, whirly girl
Ooo, whirly, whirly
Ooo, whirly, whirly
Whirly, whirly, whirly, whirly girl
Whirly girl
Watch her go, go, go
Watch her go, go, go, oh
Watch her go, go, go
Watch her go, go, go, oh
Watch her go, go, go, oh
