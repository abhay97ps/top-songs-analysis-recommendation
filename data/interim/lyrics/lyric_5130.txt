Rays from the sunlight
Poured through his bedroom
Waking his mind and his heart to his new day
And then he connected to light
A symphony of light
A symphony
A symphony of light
Thoughts of tomorrows
Mystical circles
Knowing all knowledge and lover of deity's
Thousands of birds see his light
They fly into his light
His symphony
His symphony of light
No man here on earth
Knew it's real worth
One so wise
Golden eagle fly's bold
Glimpse of the unreal
Paled as it revealed
Certain plans
Great secrets will be told
Mastered all that he found
Mixing color with sound
Energized then distracted by war
Visionary works
Chariots unfurled
Change of plans
Radiant scenes on hold
Water is to life
Fingers to the sky
Signs that say
A new world will unfold
Spirit flowed through his reins
In enlightenments praise
Loving life and admired by all
Messenger for mankind
Profess love far and wide
God summoned all angels to fly
And then he connected to light
A symphony of light
A symphony
A symphony of light
