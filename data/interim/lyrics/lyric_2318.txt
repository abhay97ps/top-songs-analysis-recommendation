Oh, my baby's
Coming home tomorrow
Ain't that good news
Man, ain't that news
My baby's coming home tomorrow
Ain't that news
Man, ain't that news
I got a letter just the other day
Telling me that she was on her way
And she wants me to
Meet her at the station
Ain't that good news
Man, ain't that news
In the letter
She told me she still loved me
Ain't that good news
Man, ain't that news
In the letter
She told me that she loved me
Ain't that news
Man, ain't that news
She said she's sorry that she left
Found out she don't want nobody else
She said she wants me all to himself
Ain't that good news
Man, ain't that news
Ain't that news
Ain't that good news
Man, I know that's good news
My baby's coming home tomorrow
Ain't that good news
Man, ain't that news
I'm gonna have her
A party at the station
Ain't that good news
Man, ain't that news
Have a party at the station
Ain't that news
Man, ain't that news
And I can't wait to get her home
Where we can finally be alone
Disconnect my telephone
Ain't that good news
Man, ain't that news
Ain't that news
Ain't that good news
Man, man, ain't that news
My baby's coming home tomorrow
Ain't that good news
Man, ain't that news
Good news, good news...
