Sailor boy 
Sailor boy 
Hurry home to me
When shadows fall
I sit alone
And as my eyes get misty
I still recall how much
I love the way
You used to kiss me
Though you're away
I love you still
I always will
Sailor boy
Oh, sailor boy
My thoughts drift back
To those last days
When we were still together
And once again
I hear you say
That you'll be mine forever
I hope and pray
Those words were true
I wish I knew
Sailor boy, sailor boy
Oh, my sailor boy
I'll never mind the waving
That's one thing I'll be resigned to
As long as I know you still
Want the girl you left behind you
When you come home
Across the sea
Come home to me
Sailor boy, sailor boy
Oh, my sailor boy
Sailor boy 
Sailor boy 
Hurry home to me
