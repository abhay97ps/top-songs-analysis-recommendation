As A Young Girl I Dreamed Of This Day
Each Night I Would Kneel Down And Pray
For Someone Like You, To Give All My Love To
I Know Your The One God Gave To Me
So I'll Cherish This Moment Always
I Want To Spend The Rest Of My Life With You
Cause Your The Answer To My Prayers, Every Dream Come True
Everything i Wanted God Only Knew
As I Look Into Your Eyes There's Not
A Love That Compares To Yours And Mine
Your The Answer To My Prayers
As A Young Man I Prayed For God's Will And Though The Way That
My Heart Feels, Lets Me Know Its You, So I'm Ready To Say I Do
I've Never Seen An Angel Till Now And I've Never Known A
Love So Real I Want To Spend The Rest Of My Life With You
As A Young Girl I Dreamed Of This Day
Each Night I Would Kneel Down And Pray
For Someone Like You, To Give All My Love To
I Know Your The One God Gave To Me
