Yeah, ooh
We gon' whack yo' dog about that cash, huh 
Play I'll put them demons on yo' ass, huh
I got too much power, don't make me mad, huh 
I'm too rich to send a hit, you better be glad, huh 
Deep down in them trenches, started up in extensions, 
Touch down in the clearport, now we back in business 
Pull up in my hood, these niggas be actin' different 
They gon' keep it cool 'cause we'll whack them niggas
Huh, livin' to die, nigga, we dyin' to live 
Had to sacrifice my life just for my mom and kids 
Beefin' with some real killers, they at my momma crib
Turn me to a monster, gotta show you niggas what time it is, huh
I got a rush from knowing these niggas wanna hit me up 
I was taught, you kill a real killer, and it'll give you luck 
Feds gave my nigga thirty years and he stuck 
Still prayin' he don't give me up, huh
We gon' whack yo' dog about that cash, huh 
Send a message to 'em with no mask, huh 
You don't wanna see my lil' nigga in yo' grass, huh 
Hangin' all out the window, swingin' that Mac, huh 
Pay you back, nigga gon' pay you back  
Leave 'em with some real rich niggas that'll get you wet 
We ain't ever fittin' with no nigga with like, "Where you at?" 
Pay you back, niggas gon' pay you back
I can't lie, I feel like John Wick with a stick 
Bought a trap phone just to greenlight hits 
All that talkin' make that chopper give you lip filler 
I come from the six, where they kill killers 
This AK got so many bodies I call it Charles Manson 
We was tryna find a lick, y'all niggas was somewhere dancing 
Them young niggas still had respect when they was broke, huh 
The whole city know that 21 gang will smoke sumn
If you want 'em whacked, it's gon' cost ten nickels 
Bring a hundred racks, it could get done quicker 
Desert Eagle bullets same size as a pickle 
We kill all the opps and then we fuck all they sisters 
All the guns I own got hollow tips in 'em 
Nigga pick a side or you gon' die in the middle 
Dreamchasers shoot 'em wit' the .38 through the pillow
Wish I rapped in the 90s 'cause this 2k shit full of weirdos 
We gon' whack yo' dog about that cash, huh 
Send a message to 'em with no mask, huh 
You don't wanna see my lil' nigga in yo' grass, huh 
Hangin' all out the window, swingin' that Mac, huh
Pay you back, nigga gon' pay you back 
Leave 'em with some real rich niggas that'll get you wet 
We ain't ever fittin' with no nigga with like, "Where you at?" 
Pay you back, niggas gon' pay you back, huh
I'm like free all my young niggas that's incarcerated 
See 20 mil by 32, I feel obligated 
I say nigga don't want no smoke, you ain't no carburetor 
Try to kill me, I come right back, Arnold Schwarzenegger 
AP terminator , gon' make me burn a hater 
Know a bitch shitted on me back then, I had to return the favor 
I fucked first night, I ain't hit her back, I don't wanna fight
You can get it back, I ain't beefin' 'bout no dog hoe
Can't find a bitch like Waldo
'Cause she was tryna buy the bitch Aldo
Nigga this that Chanel money
This that "so much work, if you get caught, you better not tell" money
This that out yo' league, I smell like Creed, walk by and smell money
Fly them bales in, right to your doorstep, that's mail money
Young bull did his first hit and he turnt up, huh
If gettin' money was a sin nigga, I'd be burnt up, huh
If you know a nigga from back then, know I was fucked up, huh
Get to pointin' fingers and they swingin' through like a nunchuck 
We gon' whack yo' dog about that cash, huh 
Send a message to 'em with no mask, huh 
You don't wanna see my lil' nigga in yo' grass, huh 
Hangin' all out the window, swingin' that Mac, huh 
Pay you back, nigga gon' pay you back 
Leave 'em with some real rich niggas that'll get you wet 
We ain't ever fittin' no nigga with like, "Where you at?" 
Pay you back, niggas gon' pay you back, ho
