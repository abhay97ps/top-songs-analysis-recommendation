Yeah
Jeez, jeez
Back home, smokin' legal 
I got more slaps than The Beatles 
Foreign shit runnin' on diesel, dawg
Playin' with my name, that shit is lethal, dawg 
Don Corleone
Trust me, at the top it isn't lonely 
Everybody actin' like they know me, dawg
Don't just say you're down, you gotta show me 
Bring the clip back empty 
You asked to see the boss, so they sent me, dawg 
I just broke her off with a 10-piece, dawg 
That ain't nothin', I'm just bein' friendly, dawg
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day
Yeah, lot of Murakami in the hallway 
Got a sticky and I keep it at my dawg's place
Girl, I left your love at Magic, now it's all shade
Still goin' bad on you anyway
Woah, woah, ooh, woah
Woah, woah, ah
I could fit like 80 racks in my Amiris 
Me and Drizzy back-to-back, it's gettin' scary 
If you fuckin' with my opps, just don't come near me 
Put some bands all on your head like Jason Terry 
Richard Mille cost a Lambo 
Known to keep the baddest bitches on commando 
Every time I'm in my trap, I move like Rambo 
Ain't a neighborhood in Philly that I can't go 
For real
She said, "Oh, you rich rich?" 
Bitch, I graduated, call me "Big Fish" 
I got Lori Harvey on my wish list 
That's the only thing I want for Christmas 
I've been had my way out here, yeah, know that's facts 
You ain't livin' that shit you say, yeah, we know that's cap 
You ain't got to ask me when you see me, know I'm strapped 
DC, OVO, we back again, we goin' plat' 
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day
Wheezy outta here
