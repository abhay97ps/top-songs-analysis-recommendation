So what you see is only half the story
There's another side of me 
I'm the girl you know, but I'm someone else too
If you only knew
It's a crazy life 
But I'm alright
I got everything I've always wanted
Livin' the dream
So yeah, everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl whose dreams came true
But underneath it all, I'm just like you
Don't wanna be treated differently
I wanna keep it all inside
Half the time, I've got my name in lights
The other half, I'm by your side
It's a crazy life 
But I'm just fine
I got everything I've always wanted
Livin' the dream
So yeah, everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl whose dreams came true
But underneath it all, I'm just like you
Yeah, yeah
Can't you see I'm just an ordinary girl? 
Livin' in an extraordinary world
Tryin' to live 
Tryin' to learn 
Tryin' to just be who I am
Who I am
I got everything I've always wanted
Livin' the dream 
So yeah, everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl whose dreams came true
But underneath it all, I'm just like you
I got everything I've always wanted
Livin' the dream 
So yeah, everything I've always wanted 
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl 
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all, I'm just like you
