Oh-oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah 
I get a feeling that I never, never, never
Never had before, no, no 
I just wanna tell you right now that I 
I believe, I really do believe that
Something’s got a hold on me, yeah
Oh, something’s got a hold on me right now, child
Let me tell you now
I got a feeling, I feel so strange
Everything about me seems to have changed
Step by step, I got a brand new walk
I even sound sweeter when I talk
I said, oh , oh , oh , oh 
Hey, oh, oh, it must be love
Let me tell you now
Something’s got a hold on me, yeah
Oh, something’s got a hold on me right now, child
Let me tell you now
I never felt like this before
Something’s got a hold on me that won’t let go
I believe I’d die if I only could
I feel strange, but it sure feels good
I said, oh , oh , oh 
Hey hey, oh, it must be love
Let me tell you now
My heart feels heavy, my feet feel light
I shake all over, but I feel alright
I never felt like this before
Something’s got a hold on me that won’t let go
I never thought it could happen to me
Got me heavy without the misery
I never thought it could be this way
Love’s sure gonna put a hurting on me
I said, oh , oh , oh , oh 
Hey hey, yeah, it must be love
You know he walks like love
You know he talks like love
Makes me feel alright
In the middle of the night
La, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la
