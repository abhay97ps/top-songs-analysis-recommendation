It seems like only yesterday that we rode the range together
The prairie skies and tumbleweeds just as far as we could see
Then, you grew up and drifted on, but I know that you remember
When you were a saddle pal to Hoppy, Gene and Me
Freckle faced and skinned up knees
You helped us trap the bad guys
With a five cent bag of popcorn
And a cap gun by your side
You know, time has a way of changin' things
Soon, there was your first love
You thought it would last forever
But when she left, you cried
But Hoppy, Gene and Me
We taught you how to shoot straight
And a cowboy's never cryin'
That's how it had to be
Yes, stories from the silver screen
Now most of them forgotten
Double feature Saturdays
With Hoppy, Gene and Me
At last you found your real true love
And now you look so happy
Is that your little cowpoke
You're bouncin' on your knee
Well the prairie sky is just as blue
And life's like a rainbow
Just like you, he'll be a saddle pal
To Hoppy, Gene and Me
Hoppy, Gene and Me
We taught you how to shoot straight
You were going to be a cowboy
That's how it had to be
Your stories from the silver screen
Now most of them forgotten
Double feature Saturday's
With Hoppy, Gene and Me
