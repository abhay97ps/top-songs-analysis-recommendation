I got excited when I first heard that you
Wanted to meet me
How could I refuse?
The way you shake your hips, ooh
Just drives me wild
I was leavin', but I can't leave right now
Can you come with me?
Can you?
There's always a chance
We'll surely find romance
Can we baby?
Have you been through this
Every night a different kiss?
No, until I met you
Take me  
Ooh, baby, I can't forget
The way you smiled when we met
Yeah, the way you shake your hips
Ooh, just drove me wild
I was leavin', guess I'm gonna be here a while
When I go, can you come with me, baby?
When I go, can you come
Have you been through this
Every night a different kiss
Not until I met you
You can take me
