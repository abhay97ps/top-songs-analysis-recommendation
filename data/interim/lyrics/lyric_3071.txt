I'm gonna have to put you down
Youve been treatin me like a clown
You know youve hurt me once before
You'll never hurt me anymore
Shoo-wee, you hurt me like a bee
A bumble bee, an evil bumble bee
I gave you love as sweet as honey
My life, my soul and all my money
You didn't seem to realize
You had a home in paradise
Shoo-wee, you hurt me like a bee
A bumble bee, an evil bumble bee
Don't you know I cry
Night after night
Just one kiss before you go
Don't ever come back no more
Now baby there's no need of cryin
I'm sick and tired of all your lyin
You know youve hurt my heart again
I'm sorry baby it's the end
Shoo-wee, you hurt me like a bee
A bumble bee, an evil bumble bee
Don't you know I cry
Night after night
Just one kiss before you go
Don't ever come back no more
Now baby there's no need of cryin
I'm sick and tired of all your lyin
You know youve hurt my heart again
I'm sorry baby it's the end
Shoo-wee, you hurt me like a bee
A bumble bee, an evil bumble bee
