Here and there, everywhere
The places that i go people stop and they stare
I'm beautiful, that I know
I am quite a sight to behold
Hey now, hey now now
I want you to remember me being who i wanna be
Hey now, hey now now
Turn it on, then you'll see everybody look at me
Snapshot

Let me show what I got
Red hot
Take my picture red hot
Take it over the top
Photograph, video
Catch me while you can cause I gotta go
Hollywood, Sunset Strip
Living in the spotlight can be such a trip
Hey now, hey now now
Take it on my good side, don't wanna be on my bad side
Hey now, hey now now
I ain't never been shy, ain't got nothin' to hide
Snapshot
