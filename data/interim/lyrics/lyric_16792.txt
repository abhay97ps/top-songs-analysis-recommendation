Mind blowin', mind blowin'
Mind blowin' , mind blowin'
Here he comes in his drop top Benz 
Kickin' it with his friends, about to spend a few ends
Straight kickin' it, finger lickin' it
Not comin' too quick, but you know you wanna get with this
Baby don't ignore me, just do as I like
And we can freak it all night, uh
Soft and wet, how deep you wanna get on your tip
I can grip so baby don't trip
I wanna hear you go "Uh, ah, yeah" and when I'm done
You'll be fiendin' for my next come
I give a run for your money, honey dip
You a trip on the flavor of my lips
Layin' back, the Female Mac
Flavor so damn smooth just freakin' all night long
'Cause I got the bone
Round and round, up and down
Give it to me like you really know you should
It's finger lickin' good
Mind blowin' 
You know it's on 'cause I got the bone
Let me tell you that you don't want none
Unless you wanna get sprung
Mind blowin' 
You know it's on 'cause I got the bone
Let me tell you that you don't want none
Unless you wanna get sprung
I put a bend in my back so it won't break
Movin' it all around you wanna see how much the woman can take Meet me at the spot when the time is right
Turn down the lights come and give it to me right
Throw on my pumps to put the rise in the rump
Not the grind and the bump, just tell me what you want
I love me a honey, even a summer bunny
I won't tell yo, if you won't tell yo
First step, I light a candle, lick you from head to toe
Front and back, side to side, let the jimmy unwind
While I freak it to your mind
Layin' back, the Female Mac
Flavor so damn smooth just freakin' all night long
'Cause I got the bone
Round and round, up and down
Give it to me like you really know you should
It's finger lickin' good
Smooth
