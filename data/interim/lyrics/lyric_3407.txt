Run, run, baby, run
Run, baby, run
Run, baby, run
Run, baby, run
Oh, come back to me
Run, baby, run
Bring your kisses to me
Run, baby, run
Back into my arms
Run, baby, run
I need you, baby
Run, baby, run
I don't mean maybe
Run, baby, run
Back into my arms
And even though you hurt me
I still love you, it's true
Even though I know that
You will hurt me again
I will love you
As I did then, so
Run, baby, run
If you love me
Run, baby, run
I still want you only
Run, baby, run
Back into my arms
Run, run, baby, run
Run, baby, run
Run, baby, run
Back into my arms
I'm not the kind of guy
Who'll ever hurt you
Or let you down
So if that guy you're seeing
Ever makes you cry, leave him
Tell him goodbye
Run, baby, run
Oh, hurry, baby
Run, baby, run
I'll be waiting for you
Run, baby, run
Back into my arms
Run, run, baby, run
Come on, come on, baby
Run, baby, run
I'm waiting for you
Run, baby, run
Bring your kisses to me
Run, baby, run
