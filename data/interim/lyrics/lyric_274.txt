You keep goin' your way - I'll keep goin' my way 
River, stay 'way from the door
I just got  a cabin - you don't need my  cabin
River, stay 'way from the door
Don't  come up any higher - I'm so all alone
Leave the bed and the fire - that is all I own 
I ain't breakin' your heart - don't  start breakin' my heart
River, stay 'way from the door
