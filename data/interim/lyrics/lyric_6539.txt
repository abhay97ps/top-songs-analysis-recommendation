Back in my day, boy, I feel like I made it
Anyone talking, I said they could save it
Yeah, yeah
Vroom, vroom
Yuh, yuh
Back in my day, boy, I feel like I made it
Anyone talking, I said they could save it
Yeah, I know I got a gift and I know I ain't make it
Any-who, yah, who are you, yuh?
Man, it don't matter
All you need to know is I'm better than all these fools, yuh
Shoot, I ain't even gotta try
I'm sitting on top of the world
I ain't never gon' die
The whole world on my shoulders
I ain't even gon' lie
But I'm going through it by myself with no one on my side
I know my mama gon' cry
'Cause she know I'm the greatest
Know when one day ima fly
But these days I'm feeling stable
Maybe one day, maybe one day
I'll be your favorite
But today I'm sitting on my throne just waiting on my David
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Plenty, plenty
Stacking up pretty pennies
Thinking I'm righteous
'Cause I stopped hanging with Mary and Henny
So tie my tennies
Fill up the plate and don it like Benny's
But is it really legit
Or for the net like bad tennis?
I'm really dope
Followers give me those
I'm feeling like the man, keep it tho
I'm the billygoat and I'm skipping boi
My team gon' be alright
'Cause we all night chill
Up to the butt-crack of dawn so we can rise all year
I'm
Assuming that with the plan, I'll sit at the top 
I need my numbers to match my vision, I got a lot
I'm winning hearts
To kids, they singing along 
So why can't I shake this feeling I might be failing God?
Failing God
I might be failing God 
Failing God
Failing God
I might be failing God
Failing God
I can't seem to get it right
Ay
I can't seem to get it right
Ay
Yuh, it really feel personal, don't it?
I picked up some demons on the way up
But I never picked up on it
And I got some deep, down iss-
Thought I left that buried down in the ocean
Sleeping with fishes
Lies are delicious
And I don't do dishes
You gotta be kidding me
I know my enemies well
Spent two months time going through hell
Share your secrets, I do not tell
I got my own, put 'em in jail
Keep it on lock, set up in cells
They can't touch, screw my health
Just give 'em rap, that's what sells
Eat with the bros, share the wealth 
Satan said to keep dancing
Rock the house until the ceiling come down
Tell me, what you even asking?
Why you talking about the real me now?
I just got up out the casket
Red in face, couldn't let it waste
Tried to shoot it, make it in the basket
Let me know where the stash is
I might be failing God
Ay, yeah
I think that I might be failing God
Failing God
