Put your sweet lips
A little closer to the phone
Let's pretend we're together
All alone
I'll tell the man to turn
The juke box way down low
And you can tell your friend
There with you, he'll have to go
Whisper to me, tell me
Do you love me true
Or is he holding you
The way I do
Though love is blind
Make up your mind
I've got to know
Should I hang up or
Will you tell him
He'll have to go
You can't say the words
I want to hear
While you're with another man
If you want me, answer yes or no
Darling, I will understand
Put your sweet lips
A little closer to the phone
Let's pretend we're together
All alone
I'll tell the man to turn
The juke box way down
Low, low, low, low
And you can tell
Your friend there with you
He's gonna have to go
Let him go
Why don't you just let him go
