Well, wake up in the morning, brush my teeth and comb my hair
Well, I wake up in the morning, I brush my teeth and comb my hair
There's a big black cadillac parked on the street over there
Well it's the finest lookin' car, that ever rolled of the line
Any other car would just be wasting your time
Ooh one fine day I'm gonna make a cadillac mine
I gotta get a cadillac
Look at that cadillac, look at that
Look at that cadillac, look at that
Rolling down the avenue, I'm gonna get me a cadillac too
If it's the last thing I do
Well I got a job, down at the liquor store
Well I got me a job down at the liquor store
Oooh I ain't lazy but I don't wanna work no more
When I get my paycheck I put it right in the bank
I'm putting all my money straight right in the bank
Well I'm halfway to get my big black cadillac tank
I gotta get a cadillac
Look at that cadillac, look at that
Look at that cadillac, look at that
Rolling down the avenue, I'm gonna get me a cadillac too
If it's the last thing I do
Sittin' in a bar knockin' 'm back
Up pulls a big black cadillac
Out steps a kitten, stand back cats
Away I go in that cadillac
Look at that cadillac, look at that
Look at that cadillac, look at that
Rolling down the avenue, I'm gonna get me a cadillac too
If it's the last thing I do
I gotta get a cadillac
Look at that cadillac, look at that
Look at that cadillac, look at that
Rock and rolling down the avenue, I'm gonna get me a cadillac too
If it's the last thing I do
