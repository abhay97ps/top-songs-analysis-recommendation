Oh-oooh-oh
You so fly, lady
You look so fly
So cool
Tell me girl, can I talk to you?
I'm only in town
For one night
Let me know if you down to ride
So fly, so cool
Tell me girl, can I talk to you?
I'm only in town
For one night
Let me know if you down to ride
If you think you're lonely now
Just wait until tonight
Girl
I know, I been on the road and away from home
But I been fiendin' for you
Dreaming of you
And what I'm gonna do
When I have you alone
You heard the message
On your cellphone, he sayin'
"Daddy's home"
I'm about to put it down, got you
Runnin' around
Half-naked around the house
And this isn't just fast sex
We makin' love until we both climax
I know you miss me
I can tell by the way
You kiss me
There's no other place
You rather be but here in ecstacy
With me
Im that someone who's gonna love you right
Even if I'm home for just one night
You know it's alright
It's me and you, Zig Zag and Mary Jane
Your lovin's got me never wanting to leave, again
You look so fly
So cool
Tell me girl, can I talk to you?
I'm only in town
For one night
Let me know if you down to ride
So fly, so cool
Tell me girl, can I talk to you?
I'm only in town
For one night
Let me know if you down to ride
The way you move that body
Twist those hips
I just wanna know, can I tell you this
That you're the type of girl I wanna roll with me tonight
I'm at the Double Tree, I got an early flight
But nothin'
Could be better than to kick it with you
I'm talkin' more than a one-night rendez-vous
You can call it what you want, but I'm a treat you right
It's like a fantasy, girl, close your eyes
Take my time when I touch that body
Get you so hot
You wanna top naughty
Oooh
Suga Suga
How you'd get so fly
I'm down for yours, if you down for mine
Uh
Mamacita, chula sexy chica
Meet me in the room, I'm in 602
Cause all I wanna do
Is have a party for two
Baby girl, tonight, it's me and you
Whoo!
The way you movin' that body and twistin' those hips
Working those eyes and licking those lips
Oh, my
So fly 
The way you movin' that body and twistin' those hips
Working those eyes and licking those lips
Oh, my
So fly 
Tell me somethin' girl
Tell me somethin' girl
You down to make it hot
It's that freaky-deeky rider sexin' you, non-stop
Love the way I touch you, I'm breakin' you down
You say you shouldn't do this
You still goin' down
Now we on the floor
You moan and you groan
Holding me so tight
Telling me, you want more?
I see you feeling freaky, we're on another level
Got me serving you now
On a dinner table
How do you want it?
How does it feel?
The way you lick your lips, girl, you know I'm diggin' this
Your body keeps calling, no temperature's falling
The heat keeps rising, got you mesmerizin'
Tonight's the night we'll remember, forever
If I'm ever in your spot, I know you're down for whatever
You look so fly
So cool
Tell me girl, can I talk to you?
I'm only in town
For one night
Let me know if you down to ride
So fly, so cool
Tell me girl, can I talk to you?
I'm only in town
For one night
Let me know if you down to ride
