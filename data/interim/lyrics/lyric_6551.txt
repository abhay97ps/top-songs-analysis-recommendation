Have you been listening, 
Have you been sleeping 
 heed the call
The magic in the music
The message in the music
 heed the call
Listen to the music, Listen to the music
 heed the call
 heed the call
Heed the call of the music
Heed the call of the music
Heed the call of the music
Heed the call of the music
There's still time for singing
Let's not waste our morning
Join in the singing
The outlaw of the midnight
He all too soon comes winging
 heed the call
  yeah
  oh oh
 oh oh oh
