Oh baby, talk to me
How can I understand if you don't talk to me
And tell me what you're feeling
Talk to me
Just give it to me straight, baby, now
Before it gets too late
You've got me thinking things
I've never thought before
You've got me feeling things
I wanna feel some more
Now I want to know
'Cause I've given it time
I'm not afraid of waiting if it has to be
Oh baby, talk to me
How can I understand if you don't talk to me
And tell me what you're feeling
Talk to me
Just give it to me straight, baby, now
Before it gets too late
You've got me any way you want me
You're playing me right
I'm looking for the answers
But there's nothing in sight
I'm tired of using silence
As a sign of my strength
I wanna hear your voice
I want to desperately
Oh baby, talk to me
How can I understand if you don't talk to me
And tell me what you're feeling
Talk to me
Just give it to me straight, baby, now
Before it gets too late
I'm acting seventeen inside
You know I tried to keep the situation
From getting out of line
Now I want to know
'Cause I've given it time
I'm not afraid of waiting if it has to be
Oh baby, talk to me
How can I understand if you don't talk to me
And tell me what you're feeling
Talk to me
Just give it to me straight
Before it gets too late
Give it to me straight
Talk to me
