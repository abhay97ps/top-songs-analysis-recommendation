That old Bilbao moon, I won't forget it soon
That old Bilbao moon, just like a big balloon
That old Bilbao moon would rise above the dune
While Tony's Beach Saloon rocked with an old-time tune
We'd sing a song the whole night long and I can still recall
Those were the greatest 
Those were the greatest 
Those were the greatest nights of them all
No paint was on the door 
The grass grew through the floor 
Of Tony's Two By Four 
On the Bilbao shore 
But there were friends galore 
And there was beer to pour 
And moonlight on the shore 
That old Bilbao shore 
We'd sing all night with all our might and I can still recall
Those were the greatest 
Those were the greatest 
Those were the greatest nights of them all
That old Bilbao moon, I won't forget it soon
That old Bilbao moon, just like a big balloon
That old Bilbao moon would rise above the dune
While Tony's Beach Saloon rocked with an old-time tune
We'd sing all night with all our might and I can still recall
Those were the greatest 
Those were the greatest 
Those were the greatest nights of them all
