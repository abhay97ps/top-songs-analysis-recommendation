You know it's so hard to be in love with someone
It's so hard to be in love with someone that don't love you
And it carries a heavy burden on your heart
To know that the someone they love
Is your very best friend
I tell you, when somebody else
Is rocking your cradle
Better than you can rock your cradle yourself
There's only one thing left
In this world for you to do
Pack your clothes, turn around
Walk slowly out the door
Look over your left shoulder
Hang your head and say
If you ever think about me
If I ever cross your mind
Girl, girl
If you ever think about me pretty baby
If I ever cross your mind
Whoa, yeah, well, you know
You know I'm yours
I know, I know your mine
After you can't stand it no more
You go on downtown to the pawn shop
And get yourself a pistol and then you make it
Back up on the scene where your loved one and your
Best friend are now together
You go right in and bust down the door and shoot him
You can't shoot her, because you know if you shoot her
All of your love and your long lifetime will be gone forever
And just as you make it up in your mind to forgive her
Here come another one of your best friends through the door
This really makes you blow your top
And you go right ahead and go in person
To your heart and shoot her
And realizing what you've done
You say "Baby, please forgive me, I'm sorry"
And with her last dying breath
She looks up at you and say
Do do do do, whoa, oh
Do do do do, whoa, oh
