He loved to bring her flowers
But she, she never understood, oh, no
He never took advantage of her
But she, she always wished he would
And while all the love builds up
Deep inside of them
Their hearts afire
Burn with one desire
Oh, sometimes they pulled away
But they keep coming back
Crazy how lovers act
Opposites do attract
One day, you know he
He finally made his mind up, yeah
That he, he waited
Waited much too long
And then he left home to
Find the girl and rescue her
And their hearts afire
Burn with one desire
Oh, sometimes they pulled away
But they keep coming back
Crazy how lovers act
Opposites do attract
Oh, sometimes they pulled away
But they keep coming back
Crazy how lovers act
Opposites do attract
Oh, sometimes they pulled away
But they keep coming back
Crazy how lovers act
Opposites do attract
Oh, sometimes they pulled away
But they keep coming back
Crazy how lovers act
Opposites do attract
