Fly by night 
Please pity me 
I fall in love so easily
Oh, fly by night 
Don't fly away 
Take my heart 
It's yours alone 
Forever more to have and own
Oh, fly by night 
Don't fly away 
Be my angel true
Not my butterfly
For though they both have wings
Angels don't say goodbye
In my arms 
There's love for you 
So, please say you love me true
Oh, fly by night 
Don't fly away 
Oh, fly by night 
Don't fly away 
Oh, fly by night
