Bon doo wah bon doo wah bon doo wah
Bon doo wah, baby I don't know
You're treating me like a plaything
You're treating me like a toy
That's why I call you a bon doo wah
It means you're a big bad boy 
I give you lovin' 
I give you kissin' 
Well, you give me nothin' but trouble
You give me nothin' but shame
I'm gonna put you in misery
You're scandalizin' my name
I give you lovin' 
I give you kissin' 
 Bon doo wah bon doo wah bon doo wah
Bon doo wah, say you'll love me so
