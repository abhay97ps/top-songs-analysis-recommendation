Three, six, nine
The goose drank wine
The monkey chew tobacco on the street car line
The line broke
The monkey got choked
And they all went to heaven in a little row boat
Clap Pat
Clap Pat
Clap Pat
Clap Slap!
Clap Pat!
Clap your hand
Pat it on your partner's hand
Right hand
Clap Pat!
Clap your hand
Cross it with your left arm
Pat your partner's leff palm
Clap Pat!
Clap your hand
Pat your partner's right palm
With your right palm again
Clap Slap!
Clap your hand
Slap your thighs and sing a little song
My mama told me if I was goody
That she would buy me a rubber dolly
My Aunty told her I kissed a soldier
Now she won't buy me a rubber dolly
Three-six-nine
The goose drank wine
Clap Clap!
Clap your hands and prepare to pat
Pat!
Take your right arm
Put your partners right palm with your right palm
Clap!
Take your hand back and clap
Pat!
Take your right arm
Cross your right ann with your left arm
Pat your partner's left palm with your left palm
Clap!
Now back with a clap
Slap
Take the pats of your palms and slap your thighs
And watch the fun materialize
As you sing this little song
My mama told me if I was goody
Three, six, nine
The goose drank wine
Clap Clap
My mama told me if I was goody
