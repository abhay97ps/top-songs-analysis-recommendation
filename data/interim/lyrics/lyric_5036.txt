He will walk into the room
And look at me
And I'll melt away
He will smile his little smile
And he will see
How I melt away
But all the while
She'll be there
And I can't get
Him to forget her
She'll be there
And I can't get
Him to forget her
The love he lost long ago
He will take me in his arms
And in his arms
I will melt away
He will press his lips to mine
Let him be mine
I will softly pray
And all the while
She'll be there
And I can't get
Him to forget her
She'll be there
And I can't get
Him to forget her
The love he once used to know
Why couldn't I have
Been first in his life
How happy we two could be
Why must there be
Such a thirst in his life
For a memory instead of me
But I love him
Oh, so much, so very much
I can't let him go
So I'll take the love he gives
What love he gives
But I'll always know
Deep in his heart
She'll be there
And I can't get
Him to forget her
She'll be there
And he never will forget her
She'll be there
And I can't get
Him to forget her
