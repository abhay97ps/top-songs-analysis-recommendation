HERE COMES THE RAIN BABY
Â« Â© '67 Acuff-Rose Music Â»
Here comes the rain baby guess it's goodbye again baby
For a while it was fun we could walk in the sun
But you never could stand the rain could you baby
See the rain in my eyes baby I never could stand goodbyes baby
For a while you were mine but the sun can't always shine
And you never could stand the rain could you baby
For a while you were mine...
