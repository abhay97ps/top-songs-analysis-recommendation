Sweetheart, I've been trying so hard to get over you, just simply can't
'Cause the love we shared through the years meant so much to me
All I'm lookin' for is just a serious relationship
Someone I can hold all my life
Why don't you give me that commitment?
Let's settle down, let's chill
Don't be afraid of me, I know my love is scaring you
But I promise everything will be alright
Come closer
Let me talk to you
Let's chill
Oh, oh, baby, hey, hey
Let's chill
Let's chill, baby
From the first time I saw your face
Girl, I knew I had to have you
I wanted to wrap you with my warm embrace
Visions of your lovely face
All my love is for you
Whatever you want, I will do
You're the only one I want in my life
For you, I'll make that sacrifice, oh
 That's what I wanna do
Just me and you 
Baby
 Let's chill
 Come here, baby
 That's all
 That's all
I'm so happy to have you here, standing right by my side
Is it a dream  or reality? 
If it's a fantasy, please don't wake me
All my love is for you
Whatever you want, I will do
You're the only one I want in my life
For you, I'll make that sacrifice, so, baby, let's
 Let's chill
 Settle down, baby
 That's what I want to do
 Oh
 Let's chill, baby
 Oh-oh, oh-oh
 I want to do
Come here, baby
Come lay next to me
Let's forget about the past and think about the future
Let's get together baby
Let's stay together
Oh, oh
Let's chill, baby
 Settle down
 All in my mind
 To do with you, baby
 So, let's chill
 Come on, baby
 That's all I want to do with you
Forever and ever
Ever and ever
Ever and ever, always
Forever and ever
Ever and ever
Ever and ever, always
