Need a helping hand of all the people in the world
I hoped you'd understand
You and me have grown so far apart
Don't show me faded photographs, just tell it from the heart
And after all that we've been through
Don't you know I feel for you
We've got nothing in common
So much to lose, yeah yeah yeah
You say that boys must never cry if we keep our feelings to ourselves
We'll be boys until we die, oh yeah
Inside this velvet glove, there's always been an iron fist
Destroying all we love
And after all that we've been through
Don't you know I feel for you
We've got nothing in common
So much to lose, yeah yeah yeah
And after all that we've been through
Don't you know I feel for you
We've got nothing in common
So much to lose, yeah yeah yeah
Oh, now there were times I wanted to shake you
Break you, bring you to your knees
Oh, now there were times I wanted to touch you
Hold you, help me, help me please
Whoa, o-whoa, such a crying shame
You know I loved you then
You know I love you now
And nothing else has changed
And after all that we've been through
Don't you know I feel for you
We've got nothing in common
So much to lose, yeah yeah yeah
After all that we've been through
Don't you know I feel for you
We've got nothing in common
So much to lose
After all that we've been through
Don't you know I feel for you
We've got nothing in common
So much to lose
