Don't stop the music
We just gotta move
We missed a few cities, now
We gotta put 'em in the groove
Home in Chicago
Whoa, you're really jumpin'
Down in Baltimore
Tell me you're foot stompin'
People are really rockin' 
In Nashville, Tennessee
You wanna be in the groove, boy
You gotta come on with me
Clarksville, Mississippi
Into Kansas City, town
Get them hip shakin', now
Yeah!
And what they're puttin' down
Hey!
You oughta see 'em, huh
They move it
You oughta be with 'em
They groove it
You don't feel a thing
In your feet
You gotta move your hips
With that beat
You gotta feel it, now
Ay-yeah-yeah!
You gotta Fly high
Ooo, ah-ah-ah
You-ah-ah-ah
Ooo-ah-hey!
I wanna say it now
Hey, bring it on back, now
Yeah, we gotta move, St. Lou
Chicks down there, now
They got the Boog-a-Loo
Now, when it comes to dancin'
Marv, just had it wrong
New York, Hip City
Is the King of 'em all
A-look-a-here:
Don't put Detroit down
It's the home of the Motown Sound
You've gotta feel it
You've gotta groove
Gotta move it, now
Feel it in your bones, boy
Gotta blow my horn
