Murda on the beat, that's not nice, man
Real nigga, I
Get high, touch the sky
Right hand in the air
Left hand in the pot
Real nigga, I
We see eye to eye
Real nigga, I
We see eye to eye
Yeah yeah 
I see green in your eyes, it don't lie 
Blue dollar bills in them hills to the sky 
We put the floor on dash
Know all my hoes they go and cash
Over that bag, they mad
I know the problem, yeah yeah
Eye to eye 
Trips to Dubai 
I could see that they jealous, don't know why 
Is it 'cause we lit at 4 AM at the spot?
Put that on your tongue, wait for the swag to unlock 
If you searchin', come look for us , over the border 
We import 'em , just don't record us 
Poppin' at the crib, the livin' room look like The Forum
Roll the dice at night, I take the chance in the mornin'
Know what I mean?
We ain't really with that camera shit
Nah
We fuck up for real, for real, for real
We fuck up the check for real 
We havin' the lean, exotics, and percs, she havin' the X pill 
We know how to flex for real
We hop on the jet, the time we kill 
These niggas be wildin', chasin' money
While I'm signin' deals 
I got a 'Tek Philippe 
And I bought a skeleton 
I'm a deadly weapon 
I'm about to go off in a second 
Moving bricks and medicine 
She like to fly, pelican 
Touch the sky, heavenly 
Designer belt from the Netherlands 
Real nigga, I
Get high, touch the sky
Right hand in the air
Left hand in the pot
Real nigga, I
We see eye to eye
Real nigga, I
We see eye to eye
Yeah, yeah
I see green in your eyes, it don't lie 
Blue dolla' bills send them heels to the sky 
We put the floor on dash 
All of my hoes they go and cash 
Over that bag, they mad
I know the problem, yeah yeah
Real nigga, I , pop a perc' and fly 
Crack that seal and take a whiff and I come back alive 
Niggas commit suicide when they don't got mob ties
Flip it like it's Five Guys, I'm 2Pac, get all eyes 
Look at the bitch, she a dime
So many watches, a nigga can't run out of time
They get out of line
The gang in your yard with the strap like the Uber driver with the sign 
I've been known to tell the truth in my raps but these other rapper tell lies 
Real niggas keep the trap alive
Ain't no fabrication on the vine 
Real nigga, I
Get high, touch the sky
Right hand in the air
Left hand in the pot
Real nigga, I
We see eye to eye
Real nigga, I
We see eye to eye
Yeah, yeah
I see green in your eyes, it don't lie 
Blue dollar bills in them hills to the sky 
We put the floor on dash 
All of my hoes they go and cash 
Over that bag, they mad
I know the problem, yeah, yeah 
Skrrt-skrrt, skrrt -skrrt
