Ready for whatever
Clever as it get
Do I really gotta explain myself?
Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-William
Weigh the dope up, cook the coke up
Might as well just give your ho up
I got local ho, but I shipped her out the country though
Ain't no givin' up, you already know how I give it up
Sippin' out the coffee cup, my Presidential face a hockey puck
Feed me dope, I get wavy like a boat
Feed me dope, and I start seeing ghosts
I'm off the porch, I'm skippin' court 
Skip to my lou , trappin' a sport 
Okay, fish butter, chicken cutter 
Maserati, we get mozzarella, yeah 
Go'n, you doin' that wrong , Al Capone 
Don't talk on phones 'cause we gettin' dope money all night long 
I need, Chinese molly, Hong Kong 
I need, good drank, big strong 
Durdo call me Big Papi, I get big cocky 
Uh-oh, big molly, got my wrist rocky 
Uh-oh, bring the money on a big dolly 
They know, I'm a millionaire from freestyling
Uh-oh, good dope make my wrist talk 
Coco, watch me hit her with a big fork 
Toto, keep the receipt, I'm a bad boy 
Thirty round drip, ooh, he a mad boy 
All of my diamonds clear, ooh, that's a Jag, boy 
I see Hermes spelt out on my tag, boy 
I was hustlin' in the field with all I had, boy 
My mama shed a few tears but I wasn't sad, boy 
Tried to explain to her for years, she had a cash boy 
I took a pill and a half today, that ain't my last, boy 
The one with the wings on it, I'm takin' off like Elroy
I took a P on the head, hey, I got the B on my head
I'm livin' close to the edge, I gotta stay with some lead
I wanna hit me a lick, just so I can sleep on the bed
Weigh the dope up, cook the coke up
Might as well just give your ho up
