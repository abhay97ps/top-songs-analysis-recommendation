I'd spend a lot more time in the pouring rain
Without an umbrella
Covering my head
And I'd stood up to that bully when he pushed
And called me names
But I was too afraid
And I'd a gone on and saw Elvis that night he came to town
But mama said I couldn't
And I'd a-went skinny dipping with Jenny Carson
That time she dared me to
But I didn't
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different
I wished I'd a spent more time with my dad
When he was alive
Now I don't have the chance
I wish I had told my brother how much I loved him
Before he went off to war
But I just shook his hand
And I wish I had gone to church on Sunday morning
When my grandma begged me too
But I was afraid of God
And I wish I would've listened when they said Boy
You're going to wish you hadn't
But I wouldn't
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different
People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could
Oh, but I would
There was this red dress she wanted one time so bad
She could taste it
And I should have bought it'
But I didn't
She wanted to paint our bedroom yellow and trim it
Blues and greens
But I wouldn't let her, wouldn't a-hurt nothing
She loved to be held and kissed and touched but I didn't do it
Not nearly enough
And if I'd a known that dance was going to be our last dance
I'd a asked that band to play on and on and on
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different
People say they wouldn't change a thing, even if they could
Oh but I would
Oh whoa, Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things
I think we'd all done a lot of things different
