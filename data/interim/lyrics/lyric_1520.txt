Oh love is sometimes failure
But it’s our pride that keeps on
Fooling us
Saying we won’t get caught
Someone tell me
Why do the stars seem so close
Yet they’re light years away
And it's funny how the broken heart still beats
I thought I was bulletproof
But the marks on my chest prove me wrong
Oh bulletproof, yeah yeah
I was so wrong
I still remember
The first time we got together
You and me
In the back seat of your fiesta
Sharing dreams, sharing fears
But it ain’t working anymore
I’m just trying to buy some time
While my heart lays shattered on the floor
I thought I was bulletproof
But the marks on my chest prove me wrong
Oh bulletproof, yeah yeah
I was so wrong
Your touch pauses my mind from thinking
Looking into your blue eyes
I heard tomorrow your leaving
I don’t want to risk another goodbye
So please help me
Help you change your mind
What do I gotta do to make you stay
Please help me change your mind
I heard love goes around
It’ll maybe come by again
I’ll bow my head if it’s what you want
But don’t tell me we can still be friends
I thought I was bulletproof
But the marks on my chest prove me wrong
Oh bulletproof, yeah yeah
I was so wrong
