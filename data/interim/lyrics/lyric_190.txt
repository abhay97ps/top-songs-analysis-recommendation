If I am dreaming you've got your arms around me
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over, not before
And if I'm dreaming that love at last has found me
Let me go on dreaming
Wake me when it's over and then let me go to sleep, mm, again
It's hard to believe, my dear, that you're here at all
Incredible, I pinch myself, you don't disappear at all
So if I'm hearing you tell some small-town justice you will not forsake me
Takin' vows to make me yours ever more
Then darling, wake me when it's over, and not before
Ooh, wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over and then back to sleep again
It's hard to believe, my dear, that you're here at all
Incradieable, you don't disappear at all
So, tell that small-town justice you'll take me
Tell 'im you'll make me yours ever more
Then darling, wake me when it's over, not before!
