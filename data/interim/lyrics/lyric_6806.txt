Deep in the darkest hour of a very heavy week
Three Earthmen did confront me, and I could hardly speak
They met me in a hurry, they left me tired and sore
And when I'm fit for wishing, I hope they'll come no more
When I'm wishing, I hope they'll come no more
Standing by the exit, with one eye on the door
I listened to them argue. I asked them 'Why? What for?'
They showed me 19 terrors, and each one struck my soul
They threw me 13 questions, each one an endless hole
Thirteen questions, each an endless hole
Did you see the moon last night
Hung like a Chinese ball?
You should have seen the moon last night
At the party of us all
Deep in the darkest hour of a very heavy week
Three Earthmen did confront me, and I could hardly speak
They showed me 19 terrors, and each one struck my soul
They threw me 13 questions, each one an endless hole
Thirteen questions, each an endless hole
