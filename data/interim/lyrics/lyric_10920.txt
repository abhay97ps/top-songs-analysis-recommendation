You can find me
When you need me
I'll be around
You're still on my mind
But I guess until
This feeling leaves me
I'm all alone
On the other side
Well I still have dreams
Where you still love me
That probably comes
As a surprise
But those dreams
Seem so foolish
When I remember the day
You walked right by
Is this good-bye
I'll never know why
We never talked
At all about it
I don't know why
Don't know whose fault
Soon I'll be gone
And for a long time
And too far gone
To work it all out
Well I still have dreams
Where you still love me
That probably comes
As a surprise
But those dreams
Seem so foolish
When I remember the day
You walked right by
When I remember the day
You walked right by
