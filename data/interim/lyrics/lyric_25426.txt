I want it, I want it, I want it-it-it-it
Chilly, chilly, chilly, chilly 
Wake up, Count Chilly 
I'm up, Count Chilly 
Tell my mama I hit a lick
Tell my mama I hit a lick 
Huh, mama, I hit a lick
Mama, I hit a lick
I’m comin', baby, send the address
Progress, never digress 
Your last one didn't pass the fly test 
I eat rappers, no digest
Fuck a piece, I want the whole pie graph 
Money taller than a giraffe 
Feng shui by the mic stand
Have you ever had two one-night stands? 
I’m a emperor, very sinister
Somewhere smokin' on indica 
Fox on me like Vivica 
I pray for before meals, spiritual
Wack ace, bet a big face 
They want my spot, they wanna switch place 
They want the gas, wanna sip Ace 
Baow, baow, straight to the face 
I'm takin' my lawyer the whole briefcase 
Makin' a play in the police face
They was like, "Man, he fresh"
I was like, "Go, DJ" 
When they played your new shit
I was like, "No, DJ" 
You can go on and skip that
I buy a house and flip that
Chilly, chilly , chilly , chilly 
Wake up, Count Chilly
I'm up, Count Chilly
Tell my mama I hit a lick 
Tell my mama I hit a lick
Huh, mama, I hit a lick 
Mama, I hit a lick
Fall off in this bitch, I ball off in this bitch
My commas hit the floor, you crawl off in this bitch
I threw a hundred more, you stall off in this bitch
And then I vámonos, applaud me in this bitch
C-notes, B-notes, P-notes all up in this bitch
Man, y'all not in this bitch, y'all are not familiar
Y’all are immigrants, the law not in this bitch, I
Fuck the opp, no competitor
Got into it with my bitch last night
She was right, but I had to get at her
Two popped bands and they dance on my waist
Hit the face, that’s the editor
I don't take pics on a jet, lil nigga
This shit regular, G5s all in my backyard
Sit you roody-poos in the nosebleed
Now my pockets holding big protein
Big, big protein 
I leveled up past Fab Five
Your favorite rapper Desperate Housewives
Playin’ with me get you chastised
Milk 'em all 'til I'm satisfied
They didn’t fall for it, strategize
Switch the flow 'cause they know niggas like identity theft
Oh, you got like me? 
Oh, you pop like me? 
Mask keep a nigga 
Huh, swag keep a nigga 
Huh, tags on my wall 
Huh, played the underdog, now flex 
Chilly , chilly , chilly , chilly 
Wake up, Count Chilly
I'm up, Count Chilly
Tell my mama I hit a lick 
Tell my mama I hit a lick
Mama, I hit a lick
Mama, I hit a lick
Mama, I hit a lick
Mama, I hit a lick
