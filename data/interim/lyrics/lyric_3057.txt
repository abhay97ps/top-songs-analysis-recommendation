Well, this is it
That day is here
The day I knew would come
When you would leave me dear
Well, here I sit
While teardrops fall
And wonder why I care
When you don't care at all
But I'm a fool that way
From a-way back when
A fool who'd take you back
If you'd come back again
But, this is it
You're gone, you're free
You'll find another love
But this is it for me
Well, this is it
That day is here
It's no surprise and yet
I can't hold back the tears
Well, here I sit
And try to guess
How such an empty room
So full of loneliness
Well, even the clock has stopped
Somehow I guess it knew
That time's run out of me
It's over it's all through
Yes, this is it
You're gone, you're free
You'll find another love
But this is it for me...
