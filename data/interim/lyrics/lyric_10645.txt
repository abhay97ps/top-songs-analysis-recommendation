All the leaves are brown
And the sky is grey
I went for a walk
On a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in L.A
California dreamin'
On such a winter's day
I stopped into a church 
I passed along the way 
You know, I got down on my knees 
And I pretend to pray 
Oh, the preacher likes the cold 
He knows I'm gonna stay 
Oh, California dreamin' 
On such a winter's day
All the leaves are brown 
And the sky is grey 
I went for a walk 
On a winter's day 
If I didn't tell her 
I could leave today 
Oh, California dreamin' 
On such a winter's day 
On such a winter's day 
On such a winter's day 
On such a winter's day
