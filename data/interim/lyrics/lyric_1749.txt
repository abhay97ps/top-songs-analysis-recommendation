I'm goin' down that highway, goin' to another town
Baby when I find what I'm looking for, well then maybe I'll settle down
Why don't you help me brother, I'm a stranger in your town
Why don't you help me sister, and then maybe I'll settle down
Why don't you help me brother, I'm a stranger in your town
Why don't you help me sister, and then maybe I'll settle down
I worked my way from Boston to that San Francisco Bay
Baby what I was looking for, I couldn't find along the way
Why don't you help me brother, I'm a stranger in your town
Why don't you help me sister, and then maybe I'll settle down
Why don't you help me brother, I'm a stranger in your town
Why don't you help me sister, and then maybe I'll settle down
Never been contented no matter where I roam
It ain't no fun to see a settin' sun when you're far away from home
Why don't you help me brother, I'm a stranger in your town
Why don't you help me sister, and then maybe I'll settle down
Why don't you help me brother, I'm a stranger in your town
Why don't you help me sister, and then maybe I'll settle down
I've worked in the mills of Pittsburgh, in the hills of Tennessee
Baby all I want is to find a job that will set my mind at ease
Why don't you help me brother, I'm a stranger in your town
Why don't you help me sister, and then maybe I'll settle down
Why don't you help me brother, I'm a stranger in your town
Why don't you help me sister, and then maybe I'll settle down
Why don't you help me brother, I'm a stranger in your town
Why don't you help me sister, and then maybe I'll settle down
Why don't you help me brother, I'm a stranger in your town
Why don't you help me sister, and then maybe I'll settle down
