The magic of your kiss
Is holding you like this
Is ecstasy 
The love that you have given
Makes this life I'm livin'
Ecstasy 
Never let me go
Let that love light show
Ah, take me by the hand a
And lead me to the land
Of ecstasy 
The first time that I saw you
You showed me the door
To ecstasy 
Now I just keep prayin'
That you're always thinkin'
Ecstasy 
Oh, but don't you go away
For a single day
Come on and take me by the hand
And lead me to the land
Of ecstasy 
Travel up and down
Much never have I found
Such ecstasy 
Now dear that I know
You everywhere I go
Through ecstasy 
Kiss me dear and then
Oh, kiss me once again
Come on and take me by the hand
And lead me to the land
Of ecstasy 
Ecstasy
Ecstasy
Baby, baby, baby
