I don't want a friend 
I want my life in two 
Please one more night
Waiting to get there
Waiting for you 
Just one more night
I'm done fighting all night
When I'm around slow dancing in the dark
Don't follow me, you'll end up in my arms
You done made up your mind
I don't need no more signs
Can you?
Can you?
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see? 
I don't wanna slow dance 
In the dark, dark
When you gotta run
Just hear my voice in you 
Shutting me out you 
Doing so great 
You
Used to be the one to hold you when you fall
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
I don't fuck with your tone 
I don't wanna go home 
Can it be one night?
Can you?
Can you?
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see?
I don't wanna slow dance 
In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark
