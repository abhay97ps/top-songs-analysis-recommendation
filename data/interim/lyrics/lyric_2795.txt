All alone
Standing here by myself
And my girl is walking
Right down the street
With someone else
There's not a place
Where I can run
In a town this size
So I just better
Look away 
I said I better
Look away 
I said better look away
Before she sees the
Tears in my eyes
She's so close
The girl that I knew so well
With the eyes and the lips
And the skin that
I know so well
I know they're both
Gonna look at me
And if I smile
That's a poor disguise
So I just better
Look away 
I think I better
Look away 
I said better look away
Before she sees the
Tears in my eyes
There they go and
I wonder if either
One of them was wise
But when I
Look away 
I said now when I
Look away 
When I look away
Did she see the
Tears in my eyes
I said now when
I look away 
I wonder did she see
When I look away
