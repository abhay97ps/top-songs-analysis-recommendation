Do you remember once upon a time
When you were mine
The stars above were bright and new
I pulled them down for you, just when I fell in love again
You said that all good things must end
Baby, that's just the way it is baby
Baby, that's just the way it is baby
I've never had a hand for solitaire
It's so unfair
That I should have my chance and lose
I feel like I've been used to help you through another night
You spelled it out in black and white
The tides that once had carried you away
They bring you back today
The time has washed away my pain
I find that things have changed and disappeared without a trace
You can't get back what you've erased
And I say
