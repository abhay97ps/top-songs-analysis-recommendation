Your love is strong, and you're so sweet
You make me hard, you make me weak
Love is strong, and you're so sweet
And some day, babe, we got to meet
A glimpse of you was all it took
A stranger's glance, it got me hooked
And I'll follow you across the stars
I'll look for you in seedy bars
What are you scared of, baby?
It's more than just a dream
I need some time
We make a beautiful team
A beautiful team
We're not strong, and you're so sweet 
And some day, babe, we got to meet 
Just anywhere, out in the park
Out on the street, and in the dark
And I'll follow you through swirling seas
Down darkened woods with silent trees
Your love is strong, and youâ€™re so sweet 
You make me hard, you make me weak
What are you scared of, baby?
It's more than just a dream
I need some time
We make a beautiful team
Beautiful
I'll wait for you until the dawn
My mind is ripped, my heart is torn
Your love is strong, and you're so sweet
Your love is bitter, and taken neat
Your love is strong, yeah, you're so sweet 
Your love is strong, yeah 
You're so sweet, yeah
Your love is strong, yeah 
Come on, baby, come on, baby 
Whoa yeah
