You can look, but you can't touch
You keep dreaming on the stars above
Something in your eyes, lets me see right through you
There's no mystery what's on your mind
Something in the way, I always make you crazy
It's a mystery. I don't know why
Get out your best line
Take your best shot, baby
You can bet I've heard 'em all before
Dont' take it hard
When you fall flat on your face
You won't be all alone, down there on the floor
Ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooooooooooh
Cause you can look, but you can't touch
You keep dreaming on the stars above
I can see that you want me so much
But there's just no way that you can call this love
Everywhere I go, I feel your eyes behind me
Trying to see the things that you can't get
I can feel your heat like an X-Ray through me
I can feel your close, but you're not in yet
Keep your distance
Now, don't come closer
Stay behind the ropes there, where you belong
You can see the garden
But you can't come in the house, babe
You're getting all excited, when you need to say come
Ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooooooooooh
Cause you can look, but you can't touch
You keep dreaming on the stars above
I can see that you want me so much
But there's just no way that you can call this love
This is an infatuation
This is an obsession
This is not the time
It's all about possession
When you talk about heat, I know what you're speaking of
But there's just no way that you can call this love
You never see that
I never look your way
When I see you looking at me
The way that you do
When you can't turn away
When you're looking all nervous
With nothing to say
Ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooooooooooh
Cause you can look, but you can't touch
You keep dreaming on the stars above
I can see that you want me so much
But there's just no way that you can call this love
Cause you can look, but you can't touch
You keep dreaming on the stars above
I can see that you want me so much
But there's just no way that you can call this love
Cause you can look, but you can't touch
You keep dreaming on the stars above
I can see that you want me so much
But there's just no way that you can call this love
Cause you can look, but you can't touch
