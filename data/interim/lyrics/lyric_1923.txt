Hey gypsy woman
Look in your crystal ball
And tell me where my baby's gone
Hey gypsy woman
Look in your crystal ball
And tell me if my baby's coming home
She left one night like the wind she was gone
I don't know why, but I know that I'm alone
If it was me that made her leave I wanna know
Just lead the way gypsy woman and I'll go
Hey gypsy woman
Look in your crystal ball
And tell me what my future will be
Hey gypsy woman
Look in your crystal ball
And tell me if you see her with me
She left one night like the wind she was gone
I don't know why, but I know that I'm alone
If it was me that made her leave I wanna know
Just lead the way gypsy woman and I'll go
Hey hey hey gypsy woman
Look in your crystal ball
And tell me what my future will be
Hey hey hey hey gypsy woman
Look in your crystal ball
And tell me if you see her with me
Hey hey hey hey gypsy woman
