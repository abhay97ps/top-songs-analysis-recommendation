Hammerstein-Rodgers
I have dreamed that your arms are lovely
I ahve dreamed what a joy tyou'll be
I have dreamed every word you'll whisper
When you're close, so close to me
How you look in the glow of evening
I have dreamed and enjoyed the view
In these dreams I've loved you so
That by now I think I know
What it's like to be loved by you
I will love being loved by you
In these dreams I've loved you so
That by now I think I know
What it's like to be loved by you
I will love being loved by you
