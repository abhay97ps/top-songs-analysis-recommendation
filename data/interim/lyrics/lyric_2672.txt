When you loved me
You took the stars
Down from the skies
Then you put them
In my eyes, when you loved me
When you loved me
I knew I never can explain
Darling I heard
The angels sing, when you loved me
But now all the stars
Are back in the skies
I sent you away
And I made the angels cry
When you loved me
I was a fool too blind to see
You made the world
Turn just for me
When you loved me, when you loved me
