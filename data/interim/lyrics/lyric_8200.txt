I guess there's no good reason, for livin'
But I'll keep on livin' for you, baby
There's nothing else to do, babe
But spend my life holding you and lovin' you
Oh
If I ask you more than one million times to forgive me
You think of a reason why
That you should make me cry 
Walk out and say goodbye away from me
Oh
I'm tired of the bright ideas about leavin' me
When you know you're not goin' nowhere
But here with me
Here with me
Let me tell you a thing
Stop and think of just how good I've been to you baby, please
I'm causin' no trouble for you baby
This story just can't be true, baby
How can I convince you, baby
But just tell you the truth
I'm livin' for you, givin' for you, waitin' for you
I'm layin' for you, prayin' for you, workin' for you
I'm livin' for you, givin' for you, givin' for you
Layin' for you, prayin' for you, workin' for you
Do with you  do with you
Do with you
That's why I keep on saying, livin' for you
