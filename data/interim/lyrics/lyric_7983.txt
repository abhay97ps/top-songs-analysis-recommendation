That's not a street that you can walk
You gotta watch just who you're talking to
They're out to getcha!
Can't turn your back on a smiling face
Next thing you know, there ain't no trace, of you
And this I betcha, some people lose and some folks win
It's a matter of what they do
Are you man enough, big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot you down?
When the evil flies and your brother cries
Are you gonna be around?
Someone needs a friend, just around the bend
Don't you think you should be there?
Are you man enough when the going's rough?
Is it in your heart to care?
There's no pretending it goes away
With every step that you take, you pay your dues
And I ain't lying!
You got to struggle to see the light
'Cause someone's looking to steal your right to choose
And they don't stop trying!
It's like a jungle outside the door and it's keeping you so confused
Are you man enough, big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot you down?
When the evil flies and your brother cries
Are you gonna be around?
Gotta keep your eye on the passers-by, better watch your step
'Cause you never know where the knife will go
And they ain't missed yet
The strong survive, they stay alive, they always cool
But that they never teach you in school
Are you man enough, big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot you down?
When the evil flies, and your brother cries
Are you gonna be around?
Someone needs a friend, just around the bend
Don't you think you should be there?
Are you man enough when the going gets rough?
Is it in your heart to care?
Are you man enough, big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot ya down?
