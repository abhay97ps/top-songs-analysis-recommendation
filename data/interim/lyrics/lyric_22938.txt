I thank you for the autographs and the cheers over the years
You stood by me, you didn't doubt me 
I think you want some more 
I do more than sing
I model now, acting now 
Plus I got my own movie now
After all the awards that they gave me, you stood by me
You didn't play me, you didn't doubt me
I think you want some more 
I truly believe that if it wasn't all for you
I don't know what I would do 
Oh-whoa
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
