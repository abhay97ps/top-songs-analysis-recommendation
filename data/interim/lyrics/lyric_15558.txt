Broke dick dog
My head slung low
Tail knocked in the dirt
Time and time of being told
Trash is all I'm worth
When I was just a young boy
Had to take a little grief
Now that I'm much older
Don't put your shit on me
Grab it and shake it
Reach down scrape it
You just got to
Scream and shout
Rip that mother out
You just gotta say "hey"
Primal scream and shout
Oooh tear it out
You just got to say
Janou said
Meters are red
Blow a neurotic fuse
Show a little
A little pain
Unlock a lot to truth
When daddy was a young man
His home was living hell
Mama tried to be so perfect
Now her mind's a padded cell, ya
Grab it and shake it
Reach down scrape it
You just got to
Scream and shout
Tear that sucker down
You just gotta say "hey" alright
Primal scream and shout
Suck that terror down
You just got to say
Kick it
Hey man, get out of my face
I deal with my problems at my own pace
With your screwed-down, anti-human views
Deal with the pressures by playing the blues
If you wanna live life on your own terms
You got to be willing to crash and burn
Primal scream and shout
Tear that sucker down
You just gotta say "hey"
Primal scream and shout
Suck that terror down
You just gotta say
Kick it
Scream, shout 
Come on come on come on
Scream, shout
