I think that it’s time that
I should just let you go 
So I'll tell it to your face
Instead of tellin’ it to you on the phone 
You see, I thought that you were special, baby
Something unique
But lately I've come to find
That you’re not really interested in my heart or mind 
That's alright
That’s okay
You never loved me anyway
And I think it's time for you to just move on
That's alright 
That's okay 
I bet you never thought you'd hear me say
That I think it's time for you to find another dumb blonde
'Cause it's not me, no, no
'Cause it's not me, no, no, oh no
Last night I went to a party hoping I'd see you there
And sure enough, you were hanging on some other girl
Playin’ with her hair
And I overheard you tellin’ her the very same thing
You said to me that night before
Hook, line, and sinker
You were walking with her out the door
That's alright
That’s okay
You never loved me anyway
And I think it's time for you to just move on
That's alright 
That's okay 
I bet you never thought you'd hear me say
That I think it's time for you to find another dumb blonde
'Cause it's not me, no, no
'Come on, just a little trophy
Hanging on your arm
So all your friends are seein’ you got it goin’ on
When I see what you are so clearly
But baby, baby, that's not alright with me
That's alright
That's ok
I never loved you anyway
That's alright that's okay
You never loved me anyway
You never loved me
Then it's alright 
Then it's alright 
Yeah
I said yeah
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
Go ahead and find whatcha need
That's alright
That's ok
'Cause it's alright with me
You never loved me anyway
That's alright
That's ok
I bet you never thought you'd hear me say
