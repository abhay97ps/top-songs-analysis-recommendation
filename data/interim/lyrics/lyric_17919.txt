Yesterday was not just another day
Not like before
Yesterday I saw your smiling  face
Love walked through my door
One precious moment
Changed my life
One tender kiss
Made everything right
One touch from you
And this world was mine
It was in your arms where I found forever
Cried my first tears of joy last night
Heaven shined a light
All my dreams came true
My first night with you
I felt the sun
Shine so bright on me
Chased the rain from my heart
Through the storm
Through the darkest night
I found my brightest star
One precious moment
Changed my life
One tender kiss
Made everything right
One touch from you
And this world was mine
It was in your arms where I found forever
Cried my first tears of joy last night
Heaven shined a light
All my dreams came true
My first night with you
One touch from you
And this world was mine
It was in your arms babe
Where I found forever and ever
Cried my first tears of joy, last night
Heaven shined a light 
All my dreams came true
My first night with you
