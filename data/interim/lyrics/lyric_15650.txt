Where do you go
When there's a need to be loved like you need to be loved
Oh, I'll let you know
Just what to do and where to go
Hey, welcome to the comfort zone
When you need to be loved like you need to be
Welcome to the comfort zone
Do whatever feels right and turns you on
After a hard day at work
There's one thing to be certain of, this old familiar love, oh
It's not unusual to find that a sensual hold
Is all you need to let go
There's no need to fight or compromise
Or settle for another outside of my love
The thing to do when you get through
Heed the message seek the comfort of my zone
Comfort zone, oh
When you need to be loved like you need to be
Welcome to the comfort zone
Do whatever feels right and turns you on
Hey, welcome to the comfort zone, ooh
When you need to be loved like you need to be
Welcome to the comfort zone
No one ever has to know what turns you on
And on and on and on and on and on
Hey, welcome to the comfort zone
When you need to be loved like you need to be
Welcome to the comfort zone
Do whatever feels right and turns you on
Hey, welcome to the comfort zone, ooh
When you need to be loved like you need to be
Welcome to the comfort zone
No one ever has to know what turns you on
Hey, let me make you comfortable, let me take control
And give your mind a break from the day you made
Let's turn the lights down low and oh, the rest you know
I'll be here for you 'cause you just stepped into the comfort zone
