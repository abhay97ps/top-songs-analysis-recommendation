Smile for me, my Diane
I'm in heaven when I see you smile 
Smile for me, my Diane 
And though everything's dark, all the while
I can see you, Diane 
You have lighted the road leading home
Oh, pray for me, when you can 
But no matter wherever I roam
Smile for me, my Diane
I'm in heaven when I see you smile 
Smile for me, my Diane 
And though everything's dark, all the while
I can see you, Diane 
You have lighted the road leading home
Oh, pray for me, when you can 
But no matter wherever I roam
Smile for me, my Diane
My Diane
