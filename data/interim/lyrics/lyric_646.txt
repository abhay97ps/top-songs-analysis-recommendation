Wah, wah-a Watusi
C'mon and take a chance and get-a with this dance
Wah, wah-a Watusi
Oh, baby, it's the dance made-a for romance 
Baby, baby, when you do The Twist
Never, never do you get yourself kissed
'cause you're always dancin' far apart
The Watusi, girl, is-a really smart
Wah-a, wah, wah-a Watusi
C'mon and take a chance and get-a with this dance 
Baby, baby, when you do The Fly
Your arms are wasted wavin' in the sky
Come on and hold me like a lover should
The Watusi makes you feel so good
Wah-a, wah, wah-a Watusi
Oh, baby, it's the dance made-a for romance
Yay!!
Baby, baby, that's the way it goes
Nothing happens when you Mash Potatoes
I just gotta fall in love with you
Watusi is the dance to do
Wah-a, wah, wah-a Watusi
C'mon and take a chance and get-a with this dance
Wah, wah-a Watusi
Fade
Oh, baby, it's the dance made-a for romance
