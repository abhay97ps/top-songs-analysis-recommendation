Well you're showing me a different side
Even asked if the flame has died
You're getting used to me baby
But you just wait and see lady
'Cause I've been in love before
And I love you a whole lot more
If you want it to be real good to you
When I'm layin' here making love to you
Listen real close to me lady
I want to get it straight right now oh baby
'Cause I'm lovin' you more and more and more
Lady blue
Sad baby, blue lady sing me your love song
I just want you to know
That I love you more and more and more
So if you want it to be real good to you
When I'm layin' here makin' love to you
Listen real close to me baby
You just wait and see lady
I've got a lot of love to give you
I've got a whole life to spend if you'll just let me
Sing a sweet love songs
Lady blue, oh sing a love song
Lady blue
