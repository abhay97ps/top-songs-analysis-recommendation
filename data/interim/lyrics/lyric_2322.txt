(Vaya con dios, my darlin'
Vaya con dios, vaya con dios, my love)
Now the hacienda is so dark, the town is sleeping
Now the time has come to part, the time for weeping
(Vaya con dios, my darlin'
Vaya con dios, vaya con dios, my love)
Now the village mission bell's softly ringing
And if you listen with your heart, you'll hear them singing
Singin' (Vaya con dios, my darlin'
Vaya con dios, vaya con dios, my love)
Wherever you may be, I'll be beside you, whoa, yes I will
Although you're many million dreams away
Each night I'll say a prayer, a prayer to guide you, oh, yes I will
To hasten every lonely hour of every long, lonely day
Well, now the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow
But the memories that we share are still there to borrow
Oh, 
Whoa 
Whoa, whoa, whoa 
Whoa ...
