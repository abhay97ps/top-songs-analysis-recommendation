//Chorus 1:
I'm beginning to feel like a rap god
All my people from the back to the front pod
So high in the sky, it's like I smoke pot
Snap back to reality, I don't smoke pot
//Verse 1:
Rapping ain't in my genes, but I got a notebook in my front pocket
A patch on my right eye socket, my popularity will skyrocket
Make a living and a killing off this
Ever since Rahm first stepped into office
With everybody hating on my rhyming  I'm an MC who always honest
But as mean as hell to all these haters and with my skills I kill em all with
This badass and newly made hip hop
You don't really want to get into a rhyming match with me, it'll be a tragedy
And after all, you should realize that I kill players with rhymes that'll murder for eternity
And,just like the others, this'll be a breeze
During this, you'll get so sick that all you'll do is sneeze
And like a felon, I'll trick your motherfucking melons into thinking that y'all never belonged on this planet
Only realized it was ironic I began to rap just before the fact
How could I not flow? I go kamikaze
So many methods of attack
Rappers can't even keep up with me
They always fail when they go against me
And now I'm going in for the kill just like Kendrick and B.I.G
//Chorus 2:
I'm beginning to feel like a rap god
All my people from the back to the front pod
Now who thinks their legs are strong enough to kick box
I'll show you that killing these beats ain't that hard
//Verse 2:
To be truthful, this rap game's simply fucked when they call my name
But I don't really do it for fame, took the earth by storm like a comet
And stayed true since
MCs be getting burned by this music cause I use it
As leeway to burn them down
Now these players better follow the leader
Me, I'm a product of Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Drake
Eminem ,No-torious B.I.G. , 2Pac yeah you think they got me
Hyped up enough to go in for the kill and be in this position
I'm doing so good I should in the motherfucking Rock n Roll hall of fame
Even though I walked into this one like the Geico pig
Only hall of fame i'll be selected to is the killers hall of fame
On the brick of shame
You players know this ain't no game
When I come and erase your fame
Don't be hating
Tell me why in the hell were you sleeping?
Don't pout hater boys
All I know is when I'm gone I will be mourned hater boys
You witnessing the #1 killer and your self-esteem will be torn hater boys
Oy vey, I don't play, that's all I'm saying hater boys
You're saying that crap that other rappers can't even attempt to say hater boys
Hey hater boys, whatcha say hater boys?
I get approval from Em hater boys
Imma work for everything I'm ever planning to do and say hater boys
Face at me boys
You ain't ever gonna be able to keep up with my pace hater boys cause
//Chorus 3:
I'm beginning to feel like a rap god
All my people from the back to the front pod
The way I'm riding round this track call me beetle
Y'all players can't even do shit to hurt my ego
//Verse 3:
Man you be sleeping on me
I'll be running over your ass with these rhymes just like a boulder
Immediately my flow gets sicker
And I will never lose, I'm Don Shula in this bitch
After this I'll have to put my foot up in your ass
I be eating Wheaties, I'm the champion of rap
I'll leave you shaking with my rhymes, your bones will crack in half
You see, I commit verbal murder
But it'll go for not if I don't ride this wave like a surfer
For at least once in my life I get to get this shit off my chest and now y'all are broke
It's crunch time, and now I gotta be extra clutch with these rhymes
Cause right now these are tough times
It's just sad cause even these gangster rappers are looking at me l
Ike it's fight time
I know there was a time where once I
Was struggling with autism and CP and I had trouble getting by
Now I wave bye to all these fake people who try and hate on my style
I got too big and now they come trying to
Put me down like that one time a couple months ago
My haters they all tried to say, "You'll never make it big time!"
I put em all in a line and verbally smack em in the face just one last time
See if I get away with this now that I'm widely known in this earth
Cause I've turned to an almighty god like Jim Carrey
And all you haters are stuck in the past and
I don't know why the fuck y'all were born
Y'all are pointless as Snoop Dogg and fucking Khalifa
To all my haters, fuck all your feelings
And I just bought a new drum kit from a DJ just to come and school y'all
Like what Jay-Z had done to Nas
It had all went back and forth like Newton's cradle up until they finally made up
'Man oh man this shit gonna live on forever' I said to myself
So I headed straight to my cousin's studio that one day, "Hey yo, imma kill this!"
Ah sama lama duma lama, y'all are thinking I'm inhuman
What I gotta do to get this in your heads, I'm more than human
Devastating, and I'm made of metal, so that anything you say is bouncing off of me
And it'll never get to me
Intimidating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfucking audience a feeling like their bones are shaking
Never dying, and I know the haters are forever trying
To knock me out of the earth and if they did, they'd be hella crying
Cause I know the ways to get em motivated, I make levitating music
You make restaurant music
"Oh he's too cocky!" Well that's what they say when they hate they confuse me
"This ain't your rap, it's crap!" "You better find a hella way to prove it!
If you can't, then you shall scram!" That shit just makes me wanna lose it
Let me know when it all comes to y'all that I will never bow down to y'all
This shit's levels
I've unintentionally murdered y'all and how many times I gotta tell y'all
I've proved that I'm good enough to survive in this game
And y'all are worthless too 
I've said this once before, but I'll say it anyway
When I step up to the mic, I kill shit everyday
I push myself to the limit yeah I'm a real hungry dude
This rap gon be the death of me, this shit gon' be my legacy
To all my haters, well fuck y'all
I'm loving this, so please don't kill my vibe
If you do, me and crew will rough up you and your boys
But, verbally, not physically
And straight ahead there's something that's all coming your way
Don't you verbally fight with me cause here's what is to happen
I'm gonna ask you to eliminate all of your hate
Plus, if you take into consideration the bitter fire I have
Then you may be a little nicer and more sympathetic to what I've gone through
Otherwise imma have to kill you
But fuck it, I'll retire undefeated
Nope I'm still going, but if I can't shatter the bad stuff
How the fuck am I supposed to move on from it then?
Don't think I'm satan, it's a fatal mistake
You'd think I need to move out this world, and take a road trip
Nope, you're wrong
Em said this best, but I think it goes for me too
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king, when you can be a god?
