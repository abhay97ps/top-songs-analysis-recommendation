It's hard to get along
It's hard to get along
It's hard to get along
We just can't hardly, no no 
I think I want to say it again for you children
I don't mind if you sing along with me tonight
I just want you to feel it
Oh yeah
Let me tell you why I say that
I got off off of my job
I took it on home like 
I knew my baby would be waiting at the door
But that was my clothes in the middle of the floor
If I tell you that I didn't cry
I would be telling, telling a lie
I was the kind that never stayed out all night
Always tried to keep my finger tight
No matter how you fight to be true
Somebody sure gonna make a fool out of you
I tell you children
No matter what you do
Oh oh
I want to hear everybody sing it with me tonight
Do you feel it baby
Oh yeah
Oh oh
No no no no no no
I want to know, can you feel it baby
Oh can you feel it
I got to heal it
I got that soulful feeling
Alright alright
You know I treat everybody right
I try so hard to get along
Oh I don't know what's wrong
I gotta say it again
I tell you It's hard
Baby
Oh oh
No no no no
I think I want to sing it for you one more time tonight
I tell you It's hard
No matter what you do
Oh oh
We just can't hardly get along now
I don't know what's wrong with the world today
Sure wish the world would get together yeah
I think we need a little more love now
What the world needs is love love love
