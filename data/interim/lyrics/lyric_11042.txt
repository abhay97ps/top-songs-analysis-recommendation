I want a world where kids can play
And there's plenty of food to eat
I want a world where I can speak
And know that I'll be free
I want a world that's full of love
Where kids are taught that God's above
I want a world that doesn't waste
So when we're moms and dads it's still a beautiful place
I want a world just like America
Like the USA
Cause even though perfect it's not
It's the best thing this world's got
Oh we're the voice of Freedom
We're the voice of America
And we're only people
But we're united again
Then you can say
We're conceited
You can say
We're too proud
But a lot of our friends have died
For what we have
I want a land
American pride
American side
American
I want to be All American
I want to eat
American
I want to sleep
American
I want to we American
I want to be All American
Oh we're the voice of Freedom
We're the voice of America
And we're only people
But we're united again
Then you can say
We're conceited
You can say
We're too proud
But a lot of our friends have died
For what we have
I want a world
Where kids can play
And there's plenty of food to eat
I want a world where I can speak
And know that I'll be free
I want a world that's full of love
Where kids are taught that God's above
I want a world that doesn't waste
So when we're moms and dads its still a beautiful place
I want a world just like America
Like the USA
Cause even though perfect it's not
It's the best thing this world's got
Cause even though perfect it's not
It's the best thing this world's got
