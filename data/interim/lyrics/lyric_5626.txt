Everyone, we got to get together, now
Oh, yeah, love's the only thing that matters anyhow
And the beauty of life can only survive
If we love one another
Oh, yeah, yesterday my friends were marching out to war
Oh, yeah, listen, now, we ain't a-marching anymore
No, we ain't going to fight, only God has the right
To decide who's to live and die
He gave us sweet cherry wine
So very fine
We'll drink it right down
Pass it all around
So stimulating, so intoxicating
Sweet cherry wine
And everybody's gonna feel so fine
Drinking sweet cherry wine
Yes, they will
Watch the mountain turn to dust and blow away
Oh, Lord, you know there's got to be a better way
And the old masquerade is a no soul parade
Marching through the ruins of time
To save us, he gave us
Sweet cherry wine, so very fine
We'll drink it right down
Pass it all around
So stimulating, so intoxicating
Sweet cherry wine
Everybody's gonna feel so fine
Drinking sweet cherry wine
Oh, sweet cherry wine
So very fine
We'll drink it right down
Pass it all around
So stimulating, so intoxicating
Sweet cherry wine
C'mon, drink it with your brother
Trust in one another
Yeah, yeah, we need each other
Sweet cherry wine
So very fine
Drink it right now
Pass it all around
People, don't you know
The cup is running over?
