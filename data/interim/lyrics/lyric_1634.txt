Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do 
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do 
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do
I, I live in dreams
Strange as it seems
Love came to me
When I, I opened my eyes
I realized
Love came to me
Only this time for real
A-sing it now:
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do 
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do 
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do 
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do
I tell ya now
Love makes me-ah, makes me feel so good 
Just like I, I dreamed it would
And I'm glad that-ah, I found you
'Cause-ah love is a gas and I know it will last
And I -
I feel so good
And knock knock knock on wood
Yeah, I'm in a whirl
I just love that girl
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do 
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do 
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do 
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do 
No-ow love makes me, makes me feel so good
Just like I, I dreamed it would
And I'm so glad that-ah, I found you
'Cause - ah-ah - love is a gas and I know it will last
And I -
I feel so good
And knock knock on wood
I-I'm in a whirl
I just love that little girl now
Sing it:
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do 
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do 
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do 
Shad doy-ya-do, doy doy doy-do
