Chun-Li
You can call me artist 
You can call me idol 
Or any other something you come up with
I don't care
I'm proud of it 
I'm free 
No more irony 
For I was always myself
Point your fingers, I couldn't care less
No matter what your reason to blame me is
I know what I am 
I know what I want 
I never gon' change 
I never gon' trade
What you keep babbling about
I do what I do, so mind your own business
You can't stop me lovin' myself
 Ursoo it's awesome
You can't stop me lovin' myself
 Hooray it's so awesome
You can't stop me lovin' myself
Oh-oh-owoah 
Oh-oh-owoah-owoah
Oh-oh-owoah
Bum badum bum brrrrumble
Ursoo
Oh-oh-owoah 
Oh-oh-owoah-owoah
Oh-oh-owoah
Bum badum bum brrrrumble

FACE OFF, just like John Woo, ay
Top star with that spotlight, ay
Sometimes become a superhero
Spin it your Anpanman
Woah, 24 hours isn't enough
Canâ€™t afford to be confused 
I do my thang 
I love myself
I love myself , I love my fans
Love my dance, and my what
There are tens and hundreds of myself in me
I welcome another me today
After all, all of them is me
I just go at it rather than to sit on it
Runnin' man
Runnin' man
Runnin' man
What you keep babbling about
I do what I do, so mind your own business
You can't stop me lovin' myself
 Ursoo it's awesome
You can't stop me lovin' myself
 Hooray it's so awesome
You can't stop me lovin' myself
Oh-oh-owoah 
Oh-oh-owoah-owoah
Oh-oh-owoah
Bum badum bum brrrrumble
Ursoo
Oh-oh-owoah 
Oh-oh-owoah-owoah
Oh-oh-owoah
Bum badum bum brrrrumble

I'm so fine wherever I go 
Sometimes I find the longest way to go around, oh
It's okay, I'm in love with my-my myself
It's okay, I'm happy in this moment
Uh! What's good, Korea?
You know I've been a boss for my whole career
I'm 'bout to Jet in the lear
And put more than my hands in the air
Hands in the air, put your hands in the air
If you getting money, rubber bands in the air
Never gave an eff, they can cancel my care
'Cause if he look good, throw my pants in the air
I'm here word to John Mayer
My body's a wonderland, my face is top tier
I swear watch the ice glare
They be like I'm Gucci but don't shop there
One time, press rewind
Tryna come up off Nicki name press decline
So much power in the mind, yes divine
Take your change you'll never be next in line 
You can't stop me lovin' myself
 Ursoo it's awesome
You can't stop me lovin' myself
 Hooray it's so awesome
You can't stop me lovin' myself
Oh-oh-owoah 
Oh-oh-owoah-owoah

Bum badum bum brrrrumble
Ursoo
Oh-oh-owoah 
Oh-oh-owoah-owoah
Oh-oh-owoah
