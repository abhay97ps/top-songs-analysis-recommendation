Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Now I know how to get down on the floor 
Experienced in moves you can't ignore 
But something 'bout this beat that's got me hooked 
Come over here and take a closer look 
'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now 
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
I do this just for kicks, just for the thrill 
I got this high without takin' a pill 
This groove has got me way over the sun 
I'm dancin' like I am the only one 
'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now
It's taking me higher, higher 
Higher off the ground 
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
I got my feet in the air and my head on the ground
And the rest of my body somewhere in the clouds
I'm coming down no time soon
Like I'm tied to a couple hundred helium balloons
Looks like I'ma be up for a minute 
Such a beautiful feeling, 'idn't it?
Yup, when your body is so plateau
On a level that just feels so infinite
The music's got me going higher
I feel like I can touch the sky
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
It's your boy Travie McCoy
