You think you're slick in every way
Changin' up the calls on your phone every day
Is there somethin' that you're trying to hide from me?
I never gave you reason to
Run and take your calls in the other room
Am I the only one, or is somebody else getting at you?
Is it my imagination?
Things ain't always what they seem
'Cause I don't wanna be
Just another name in your little black book
Just another face in the crowd
And it's got me shook
I gotta mean a little more to you
Than a space in your list of your things to do 
Another G-shock gun in your Benz 
Another dime piece that you can show all your friends 
You can call me crazy, say I'm insecure
But I don't wanna be
Just another girl
It's strange 
How you claim to tell the truth
When the passenger seat in your car's been moved
And you swore that there was no one else but you, you
And somethin' else you can't explain
Why'd you call me by somebody else's name?
You say it's history, your player days are through
Or so you say
Is it my imagination?
Things ain't always what they seem
'Cause I don't wanna be
Just another name in your little black book 
Just another face in the crowd
And it's got me shook
 I gotta mean a little more to you
Than a space in your list of your things to do
Another G-shock gun in your Benz 
Another dime piece that you can show all your friends
You can call me crazy, say I'm insecure
But I don't wanna be
Just another girl
Tell me, are you lying?
Or is it my suspicious mind? 
I gotta know the truth if I am
Just another girl you're treatin' wrong
Another one you string along
Is it you and me?
Is it two or three?
'Cause I don't wanna be
Just another name in your little black book 
Just another face in the crowd 
And it's got me shook
I gotta mean a little more to you 
Than a space in your list of your things to do 
Another G-shock gun in your Benz 
Another dime piece that you can show all your friends
You can call me crazy, say I'm insecure 
But I don't wanna be 
Just another girl
Just another name in your little black book 
Just another face in the crowd
And it's got me shook 
I gotta mean a little more to you
Than a space in your list of your things to do
Another G-shock gun in your Benz 
Another dime piece that you can show all your friends 
You can call me crazy, say I'm insecure 
But I don't wanna be
Just another girl
Just another name in your little black book 
Just another face in the crowd
And it's got me shook 
I gotta mean a little more to you 
Than a space in your list of your things to do 
Another G-shock gun in your Benz 
Another dime piece that you can show all your friends 
You can call me crazy, say I'm insecure 
But I don't wanna be
Just another girl
