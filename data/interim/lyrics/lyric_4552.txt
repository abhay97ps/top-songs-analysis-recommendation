THE MASS THE MASS THE INFINITE MASS
If you hear any noise, it's just me and mah boyz
If you hear any noise, it's just me and mah boyz
If you hear any noise, it's just me and mah boyz
If you hear any noise, it's just me and mah boyz
Funkin' it up
Hey yeah... and me and my boyz
Gettin' funky only
Infinite Mass
Runin' down the street
Me and Mah Boyz
Come on
Right from beach back into the hood
Infinite mass got the bottle
Closer than a groupie and I
Look for BD BD BD dove high
I'm sending you a bud
Of the money to the chevy
And from the old to the heavywight school
Fresh round fool
{The Mass}
The choice of the G-funk generation that is
{whaaat}
A group of domination so
Fifth year I never neglect
The boyz who branch here triple X
The plot thickens
A bunch of set of homiez
Face to the ghetto
Dirt of '76
Even it does
The pets and the mix
In the summertime rolling in the park
Bad women in the light and OG's in the dark
{what's up}
And I don't give a damn too
I'm straight up phat because my homiez got my back
Within the years I'm donin' in here
Act'em fools who thought they could fade me
HUH
They try to couple the move to sweep mah ba-back
But I picture that
Coz every fool who style is tired
A dove to mah boyz coz they love me right
Chorus
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
Quick
Break 'em off with a freaky tail
About a clique who's deep as hell
Chamdin
Alwayz been
True to the M-A-double S
The group you don't test
We come like G's we dress like G's
We cool like G's we get all the Ladies
While I nod my head to the gangsta groove
Real smooth
{yep}
We're now into groove
{so}
Honeyz step to me
I never step to 'em
Tell'em it's my homiez
We share all ins
See us in the joint
Get the point it's me and Mah Boyz
Playin' with dogs
Baby baby
It's the P O L A R
{what?}
Yeah the B to the E A R
{what?}
With effect and from the funk coast
Californi-a USA
{Hey}
Well I be chillin in my homiez Jacuzzi
Or playin' world wild funk like Bootsy
Straight from LA to swe-sh-ville
Across the ocean in my
Coup De Ville Cadillac
Back and forth like Aaliyah
I'm livin PHAT I'm livin' like a playa
But I won't switch you on my roots
Chorus
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
THE MASS THE MASS
THE INFINITE MASS
THE MASS THE MASS
{The Infinite Mass}
THE MASS THE MASS
THE INFINITE MASS
THE MASS THE MASS
{The Infinite Mass}
THE MASS THE MASS
THE INFINITE MASS
THE MASS THE MASS
{The Infinite Mass}
THE MASS THE MASS
THE INFINITE MASS
THE MASS THE MASS THE MASS
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
