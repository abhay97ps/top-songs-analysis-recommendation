In heaven there is no beer
That's why we drink it here
And when we're gone from here
Well, our friends will be drinking all the beer
Everybody, sing!
In heaven there is no beer
That's why we drink it here
And when we're gone from here
Well, our friends will be drinking all the beer
La la, la-la-la-la
La la, la-la-la-la
La la, la-la-la
La la, la-la-la, la-la-la
Piano solo!
In heaven there is no beer
That's why we drink it here
And when we're gone from here
Well, our friends will be drinking all the beer
In heaven there is no beer
That's why we drink it here
And when we're gone from here
Well, our friends will be drinking all the beer
La la, la-la-la-la
La la, la-la-la-la
La la, la-la
La la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La la, la-la-la-la
La la, la-la-la-la...
