Yo, I need a night away, my day to day in paper chase
Is overpopulated, with the talkin' by the haters say
Haters they, rendered obsolete just like the pager
I run for city council, but might just make the mayor brink
Lay your hands Jerry Rice, better know I got it
The worlds up in my palm and know Stephan will never drop it
I push it and I cop it, I try to make a profit
But I'm tired of distressing when collecting is the object
Of affection, say you disagree with my direction
I say I'm trying to dodge the felony and not the sentence
I write down, right now, I might just take a flight now
Or maybe take a step or two, I might just take a flight now
When the floor up, on a tour bus
With a bad bitch bitch when I pour up
But I'm bored, I'm bored
I guess it ain't the life for me
Until the day I pass away, I may be more than likely
Just slept on, but I kept on
One shot but he guessed wrong
Wish Trayvon had a vest on
Damn!
Lets just pledge allegiance to the land of the free
In a country filled with bullshit that was branded by greed
The innocence with no sense, that just demanded to bleed
Plant it to seed and then they profit off and stepped in disease
And you want me to quit rapping, and work for your industries
And go to war on drugs for the drugs that you put in the streets
You ever think, that you get within reach of my inner piece?
And I take some I wish you would put it into peace
Now learn from your lesson, or find out the harder way
They say "Love should be destined," but it burns your heart away
I give you pennies for your thoughts, and I ain't talking Hardaway
I'm so tired of this ten dollar an hour starter pay
But I'm all that, I'm on my Kenan and Kel thing
You been getting saved by the bell, Mr. Belding
Mad because your girlfriend, wanna make my cell ring
Championship team, and all we do is sell rings
Schooling these rappers, every verse is like a campus I'm screaming
Fuck the road, having an orgy with the cameras
My  to be the best, doing what ain't been accomplished yet
The story of a man that was damaged ever since my father left
My mama left me too, felt like I was being careless
So mothers they so embarrassed cus' I ain't close to my parents
The product of a broken home, and home is where the heart is
Maybe that's the reason I'm broken hearted, flow retarded
They said I would never be nothing as funny, just look at me now, Dolo
Started from the bottom, came up, go go
Tried to battle, get ate, Ocho
I'm from the 510 where killa's is only a block away
Who let their choppas spray, cock back, a blaka blaka away
Knock your block away like Tetris, don't give a shit about critics
Eat up these wack cats, shit out gimmicks, spit out lyrics
Plus I'm spitting like there's no tomorrow
Putting family first and "Love God" is the motto
K-O
Four years ago I went to Rock the Bells, sitting on the lawn
Kicking freestyles, drinking with the kid I brought along
Looking at the stage, could that be within our parameter
Now I'm here on the microphone and he's behind the camera
That's Mike Lee
But I've been doing this since I was like three
That's why these people put me on like Nike's on a hype beast
In the VIP now, so I should be taking a dime piece
And telling that girl to give me head twice like a Siamese
I been a fool since I was introduced
Never gonna get a job because I'm wearing tennis shoes to all my interviews
So what, I'm on my Annie shit, I'll never grow up
And it's like I'm the cookie monster because I can never get my dough up
You even know me from the cyphers on the A's song
I was putting on for Oakland harder than Kreayshawn
But I'm from the city where they get their wine taste on
 baby, wanna party all we  Eleison
