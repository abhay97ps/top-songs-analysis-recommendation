I know, you don't love me no more
No more, no, no more
And I don't want to be hurt anymore
Anymore
Yeah, yeah, I have loved so hard
Everything I did was no 
If I can't love you right, baby
I don't have to love you at all
I know, you don't want me no more
No more, no, no more
And it has to be someone else loving you more
Loving you more
Ain't no use in me crying now
If not for you, I wouldn't be down
Don't want me no more, baby
Ain't no use in you hanging 'round
I know, no more, no more
No more, no more
I know, you don't want me no more
No more, no, no more
And it has to be someone else loving you more
Loving you more
Ain't no use in me crying now
If not for you, I wouldn't be down
Don't want me no more, baby
Ain't no use in you hanging 'round
I know, I know
