She was a-seaside sittin'
Just a-smokin' and a-drinkin' on ringside
On top of the world
Oh, yeah
She had her drink in her hand
She had her toes in the sand
And, whoa, what a beautiful girl!
Ah, yeah
Creature from the sea with the looks to me
Like she'd like to fool around
What a snappy little mammy
Gonna keep a pappy happy
And accompany me, huh
To the ends of the earth
Ah, yeah
That's why I said
All I need is a beautiful girl
Ah, yeah!
Come here, honey, come here, come on
Well, I'm a bum in the sun
And I'm having fun
And I know you know
I got no special plans 
All the bills are paid
I got it made in the shade
And all I n-n-need is the woman 
Creature from the sea with the looks to me
Like she'd like to fool around
All I need is a beautiful girl
Ah, yeah!
Beautiful girls
Ahh, come this way, baby
Sit down right here
Ooh, la-la
Think I got it now
Now, I'm a-seaside sittin'
Just a-smokin' and a-drinkin' on ringside
On top of the world 
I got a drink in my hand
I got my toes in the sand
All I need is a beautiful girl 
Oh yeah!
All I need is a beautiful girl
Ah, yeah!
Ow, I ain't lyin' to you
Nothin' else I need
Sit yourself on down
Ow!
Ow!
Whoo, come here, baby, come here!
Whoa!
What's your name, honey, what's your⁠—hey, hey, where you goin'?
Hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, this way! Oh!
I love 'em, I need 'em
Can't do without 'em, no
Ow! Ow! Ow, ow!
