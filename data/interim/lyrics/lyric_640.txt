Oh, Cherie
Baby, don't you worry
For I love only you
Oh, Cherie
I'm half crazy
With the love so true
Yes, my love is love
Forever, ever, ever true
Never fear, love is here to stay
Cherie, hurry, hurry, hurry
Let me kiss your worries away
Cherie
A thousand stars in the skys
They all know that
I'm not telling a lie
Angel baby, believe what I say
I'll still love you tomorrow
Even more than I love you today
I'm yours, come what may
Yes, my love is love
Forever, ever, ever true
Never fear, love is here to stay
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Cherie, hurry, hurry, hurry
Let me kiss your worries away
Cherie
