Ayo rest in peace Juice
You inspired me to speak my feelings
So here it is
Shawty took my heart and broke it
That shit fuck me up
Went and found another man to hold before the week was up
Should've never left the crib on Monday
Hoes were down to fuck
Who would ever want a man with damage? Girl just want some fun
Treated you like you were someone's daughter
And I always put respect up on your mother 
Yeah I know that I was awkward with your fathеr 
But I never put your sakе before no other 
But you threw away my feelings that ain't right 
And I always wanted you to speak your mind 
It was easier for you to say goodbye 
Yea imagine how I looked when I knew why
Shawty took my heart and broke it
That shit fuck me up
Went and found another man to hold before the week was up
Should've never left the crib on Monday
Hoes were down to fuck
Who would ever want a man with damage? Girl just want some fun
Drown myself in bottles and I
Gave myself a challenge why don't
I inflict some damage getting
High before the lights all vanish
Down another bottle going
Deeper than that rabbit and I'm
Creeping in that phantom while I'm
Drowning in the panic
Your body left me famished baby
Getting support from the sink
While that bit gimmie the loose 
Colors I peek out the tint 
Only see grey like the goose 
She had me kneel at a wink 
Now I kneel after the booze 
Don't got the headspace to overthink
But I can't help it my right to assume and I'm 
High at the spot and my whole body peaking but
Something ain't right but I gotta keep tweaking like
I had enough of that shagging and dragging and
Fuck all that fucking I wanna be geeking with 
Someone I love not a rando at 2 AM 
Stop with the bandos and get out the DMs
I wish I were whole and I spend that per diem but
She left me broken and I had to break me in
Me dejas de sin saber
No quería a creer
Tu quieras a romper
El amor de nosotros a cual que
Shawty took my heart and broke it
That shit fuck me up
Went and found another man to hold before the week was up
