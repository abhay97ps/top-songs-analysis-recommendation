Greetings, this is Uncle Sam
I want to take you to a far off land
I need you, oh, I need you
Yes, I need you to lend a helping hand
Said goodbye to all my buddies
Say hello to your new friends
'Cause you're in the army now
And your new life has just begun
I need you
Oh, I need you
Yes, I need you
To lend a helping hand
I can just see me now, huh
With a rifle in my hand
I'm gonna have to say
Goodbye to my girl
And I hope she doesn't
Find another man
And baby, baby, while I'm away
Please, please write everyday
Oh no, no
Please don't take me, Uncle Sam
Goodbye, baby, so long friends
Goodbye, baby, I hope to see you again
I need you
Oh, I need you
Yes, I need you
To lend a helping hand
