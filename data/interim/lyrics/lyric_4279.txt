Feel so bad
Feel like a ballgame on a rainy day
I tell you I feel so bad
Feel like a ballgame on a rainy day
Since I lost my baby
I shake my head and walk away 
Sometime I want to stay here
Then again I want to leave
Sometime I want to leave here
Then again I want to stay
I just can't make my mind up
I shake my head and walk away 
I'm trying to tell you people
Tell you just how I feel
I'm trying to tell you people
Trying to tell you just how I feel
I feel so bad 
My baby gave me a dirty deal
Oh I feel so bad
Feel like a ballgame on a rainy day 
I feel so bad
Feel like a ballgame on a rainy rainy rainy day
Since I lost my baby
I shake my head and walk away 
Sometime I want to stay here
Then again I want to leave 
Sometime I want to leave here
Then again I want to stay 
Well since I've got my clothes packed
I'll catch a train and ride away 
I'm gonna ride away
I'm gonna leave her
I'm so lonely
I feel so bad
I'm gonna leave this town
Oh yeah
I can't stay no longer
Feel so bad
