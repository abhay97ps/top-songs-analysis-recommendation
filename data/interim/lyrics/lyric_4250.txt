I don't care what they say
I'm gonna keep it anyway
I won't let them stretch their necks
To see my little black egg with the little white specks
I found it in a tree
Just the other day
And now, it's mine, all mine
They won't take it away
Here comes Mary, here comes Lee
I'll bet what they want to see
I won't let them stretch their necks
To see my little black egg with the little white specks
I found it in a tree
Just the other day
And now, it's mine, all mine
They won't take it away
Oh goldurn, what can I do?
Your little black egg's gonna tell on you
I won't let them stretch their necks
To see my little black egg with the little white specks
I found it in a tree
Just the other day
And now, it's mine, all mine
They won't take it away
My little black egg
My little black egg
My little black egg
My little black egg
