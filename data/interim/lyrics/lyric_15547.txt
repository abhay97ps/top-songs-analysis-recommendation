Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Why can't you come home?
Why can't you come home?
Home, home
Why can't you come home?
Home to my love
Why can't you come home?
You're treating me like a limousine
And you driving me out of my mind, yeah
Why you wanna do that to me, baby?
You telling my friends to cause a scene
And embarassed me all the time, yeah
But what am I supposed to say
What am I supposed to do
When I love someone
I've got to be loving you, oh
You stay out every night
And that just ain't right
You must take me for a fool, yeah
Don't treat me wrong too long
Baby, I just can't not hang on
If you love me like I love you
Why can't you come home?
Why can't you come home?
Home to my love
Why can't you come home?
Home, home

Home to my love
Why can't you come, come ho-o-o-ome?
Yo, check this out
I stay up from night to day
Hoping that you would get home, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
You stay in bed like that's OK 
One day, you'll gonna be alone, yeah
But what am I suppose to say?
What am I suppose to do?
When there's love
But I can't find you
You stay out every night
And that just ain't right
You got me singing the blues
Don't treat me wrong too long
Baby, I just may not hang on
If you love me like I love you
Baby
Oh, yeah, yeah
Why can't you come home?
Why can't you come home?
Home to my love

Home to my love
Why can't you come, come ho-o-o-ome?
Oh
Oh
I wash your clothes
I cook your food
But you treat me so damn cruel
Oh
Tisha X on the flex
But not vex
The only time I see you is only when you want sex
Leave me alone
If you can't come home
Or you might catch a frying pan straight to the dome
You know what I'm saying?
'Cause the E-X-Girlfriend ain't playing
Oh, yeah, yeah
Don't treat me wrong too long
Baby, I just may not hang on
If you love me like I love you
Why you wanna do that to me, baby?
Yo, why is you got to be?
Yo, why is you got to be?
Yo-yo-yo
Why is you got to be?
Word
So damn tough?
Oh, yeah, yeah
Why can't you come home?
Home to my love
Why can't you come home?
Home, home
Why can't you come home?
Come home
