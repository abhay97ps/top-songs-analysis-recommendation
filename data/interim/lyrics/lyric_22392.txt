At first I was afraid
I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live
Without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights
Thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face
I should've changed that stupid lock
I should've made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me
Oh, now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one
Who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
You think I'd crumble?
You think I'd lay down and die?
I'm a survivor 
I'm not gon' give up 
I'm not gon' stop 
I'm gon' work harder 
I'm a survivor 
I'm gonna make it 
I will survive 
Keep on survivin' 
It took all the strength I had
Not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high
I'm a survivor 
I'm not gon' give up 
I'm not gon' stop 
I'm gon' work harder 
I'm a survivor 
I'm gonna make it 
I will survive 
Keep on survivin' 
Yeahhhh!
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah-eah!
Thought I couldn't  breathe without you
I'm  inhalin'
You thought I couldn't  see without you
Perfect  vision
You thought I couldn't  last without you
But I'm  lastin'
You thought that I would  die without you
But I'm  livin'
Thought that I would  fail without you
But I'm  on top
Thought it would be  over by now
But it  won't stop
Thought that I would  self-destruct
But I'm  still here
Even in my  years to come
I'm still gon' be here!
I'm a survivor  {Yeahh!}
I'm not gon' give up 
I'm not gon' stop 
I'm gon' work harder 
I'm a survivor 
I'm gonna make it 
I will survive 
And keep on survivin' 
I'm a survivor! 
I'm not gon' give up  {Yeah, yeah!}
I'm not gon' stop 
I'm gon' work harder  {Ain't gon' stop me now!}
I'm a survivor 
I'm gonna make it 
I will survive 
Keep on survivin'  {Survivin', yeah!}
Oh no, not I!
I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
 I've got all my love to give
 And I'll survive
 I will survive 
Heyyy!
I'm a survivor 
I'm not gon' give up  {Oh!}
I'm not gon' stop 
I'm gon' work harder 
I'm a survivor  {Yeah!}
I'm gonna make it  {Eh-whoaa!}
I will survive 
Keep on survivin' 
I will survive!
