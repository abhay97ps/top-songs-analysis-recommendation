In the bible
One thousand years B.C
There's a story
Of ancient history
Bout a fella
Who was strong as he could be
Tell he met a cheating gal who brought him tragedy
Oh, run Samson run
Delilah's on her way
Run Samson run
You ain't got time to stay
Run Samson run
On your mark you better start
I'd sooner trust a hungry lion than a gal with a cheating heart
She was a demon 
A devil in disguise
He was taken 
By the angel in her eyes
That lady barber 
Was very well equipped
You can bet your bottom dollar he was gonna get clipped
Oh, run Samson run
Delilah's on her way
Run Samson run
You ain't got time to stay
Run Samson run
On your mark you better start
I'd sooner trust a hungry lion than a gal with a cheating heart
Oh, Delilah 
Made Sammy's life a sin
And he perished 
When the roof fell in
There's a moral 
So listen to me pal
There's a little of Delilah in each and every gal
So, run Samson run
Delilah's on her way
Run Samson run
You ain't got time to stay
Run Samson run
On your mark you better start
I'd sooner trust a hungry lion than a gal with a cheating heart
I'd sooner trust a hungry lion than a gal with a cheating heart
