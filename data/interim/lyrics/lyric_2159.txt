Can't help it if I wonder, wonder what she's doin'
Can't help it if I wonder what she's doin' tonight
 oh where can she be? 
As I sit alone I just can't help but wonder
If she still thinks of me
Can't help it if I wonder, wonder what she's doin' tonight
 oh I wish I knew 
Is she in somebody's arms and is he holding her
The way I used to do?
Can't help it if I wonder what she's doin' tonight
I thought that I could do without her
Thought that I could get along just fine
But I was wrong
For ever since we said goodbye
I just can't seem to get her off my mind
Can't help it if I wonder what she's doin' tonight
 if she only knew 
That I'm sorry and I'm still so much in love with her
I wonder what she'd do
Can't help it if I wonder, wonder what she's doin' tonight
