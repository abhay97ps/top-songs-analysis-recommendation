What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?
Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, I'm still wit' you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you and that's just being real wit' you
You see, the truth is everybody wanna know
How close me and Snoop is and who I'm still cool with
Then I got these crab-ass niggas I first drew with
Claimin' they non-violent, talkin' like they Ruthless
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name outta your mouth and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference
What's the difference between me and you? 
You talk a good one , but you don't do what you supposed to do 
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you? 
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
The difference is: I don't care
Can't you tell it by my rigid stare?
I'm legendary, get you open like a Frigidaire
More despair, your style's dead as Fred Astaire
You need medicare, security blanket and a fuckin' teddy bear
"Awh yeah, awh yeah"
Is your expression when you eyewitness a session
Vocal pitch makin' impressions like Jerry Butler
Stupid fucker, I will cut ya
Doin' a sucka's such a tragedy, I'll run you raggedy like Ann
You'll kick the pink can like a faggoty man
New styles, I usually keep clandestine
Like files of semen found in J. Edgar Hoover's intestines
No question
But keep that on the low low, Falana slow mo
When puffin' marijuana couldn't get the time of day
Now I'm fuckin' nigga's Mommas
Drama's still part of my dietary
Hit hard like Singletary
Kill your daughter, bust her cherry
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
A'ight, hold up, hold up!
Stop the beat a minute, I got somethin' to say, Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me 
I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back , just know this shit
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga, let's blow this bitch
I mean it dog, you ever need somebody offed: "Whose throat is it?"
Well, if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people , then drop her off on the corner
At the police station and drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed-off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin' to talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, "I just don't give a fuck" and see who means it
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
