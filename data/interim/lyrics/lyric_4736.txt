Now the golden sun can see us kiss
Every summer day we'll love like this
When the snow is on the roses
When the bluebird's flown away
In my arms we'll both remember
All the love we shared today
As we walk along the silvery shore
Vows we make will last forever more
When the snow is on the roses
When the summer stars are gone
One more summеr will be over
But our love will still go on
Whеn the snow is on the roses
When the bluebird's flown away
In my arms we'll both remember
All the love we shared today
All the love we shared today
