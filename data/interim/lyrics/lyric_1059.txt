A-one, a-two
A-one, two, three, four
Now I'm so glad
That school is in
Now I can see my old
Classmates again
I worked and slaved
The summer through
Doing the things
My mother told me to do
I washed the dishes
And scrubbed the floor
And taught the baby
How to count to four
I made the beds
And cut the grass
I'm glad that school
Is in at last
Don't you know it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't forget it
I'm a witness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now vacation time
Has come to an end
Now I got to get back
To my studies again
And make the grades
So I can pass
I'm glad that school
Is in at last
Blow, Daddy
Blow, Daddy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, you sound
So good now, oh, yeah
Now you may think I'm nutty
And telling you lies
But I'm going out now
To buy my school supplies
This semester's gonna be a gas
Cause school is in at last
 til end
