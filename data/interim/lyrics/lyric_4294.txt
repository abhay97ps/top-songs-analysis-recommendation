Now, things was looking rosy, baby
Everything was fine
You never made no sign
That you had changed your mind
I guess I was mistaken, girl
Counting so on you
What else could I do?
Time to pay my dues
Well, girl, I've been torn up before
But I can't handle that once more
Well I've been down for a long, long time
And now it's time to ease my mind
There's lots of pain upon this earth
Girl, I've had my money's worth
I have had my ups and downs and all around
Girl, I've tried to change your way of thinkin'
Tried to make you see
Well, that livin' here with me
Is where you ought to be
But it didn't seem to make no difference
It never changed your world
Or stopped your social twirl
You're still the same old girl
And now I've been torn up before
But I can't handle that once more
I've been down for a long long time
But now it's time to ease my mind
'Cause there's lots of pain upon this earth
And girl, I've had my money's worth
I have had my ups and downs and all around
I've been up, down
All around, now, baby 
I've been up, I've been down
I've been all around, now, baby 
Yeah, we've both been up and down
And all around, now, baby 
You go up, go on down
We go all around, now, baby 
Yes, now I'm up, I'm down
All around, now, baby ...
