All the commas
Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Ooh, hmm
For this life, I cannot change 
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main 
M&M's, sweet like candy cane 
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang 
For this life, I cannot change 
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main 
M&M's, sweet like candy cane 
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang 
Drop the top, play hide and seek 
Jump inside, jump straight to the league 
Take a sip, feel just how I be 
On Freeway, but no, ain't nothin' free 
Bend laws, bend lanes 
Been bustin' bills, but still, ain't nothin' change 
You in the mob soon as you rock the chain 
She caught the waves, just thumbin' through my braids 
Heatin' up, baby, I'm just heatin' up 
Need your love, not a need, it is a must 
Feelin' stuck, you know how to keep me up 
Icy love, icy like a hockey puck 
For this life, I cannot change 
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main 
M&M's, sweet like candy cane 
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang 
For this life, I cannot change
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main 
M&M's, sweet like candy cane 
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang
All the ones, all the chains piled on the mantle 
All the dawgs, all the dawgs low creep right behind me in the Phantom 
Yeah, never go, never go dip on the set, stayed Santana
Yeah, run it back, turn the lights on when I hit up Green Lantern 
Yeah, fly the broads, fly the dawgs down to Atlanta
Yeah, in the cut in Medusa, lay low, yeah, I might be
Yeah, roll up, help me calm down when I'm movin' high speed
Yeah, if I send one, need to text back 'cause you know what I need 
Oh, please , oh, me , oh, my 
We been movin', we been movin' for some time 
Flexin', flexin', try to exercise
Exercise , exercise , exercise , exercise 
For this life, I cannot change 
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main 
M&M's, sweet like candy cane 
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang 
For this life, I cannot change
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main
M&M's, sweet like candy cane 
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang
