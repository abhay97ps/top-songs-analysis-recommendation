Oh-we-oh, my love say no, may you can let me in
Oh-we-oh, my love say no, may you can let me in
Oh, oh
Driving through the city as I look out through the window
Wondering what it's like to be sleeping on the outside
Watch me take a picture of the place that I grew up in
Sorry, mister, thought you looked like someone I remember
Someone I remember 
Look at her still walking like she knows somebody's watchin'
If I try to talk to her, I wonder if she'll know me
C'mon, say, "Hey baby", won't you take a ride in my car?
Maybe you can show me how we lost what we believe in
Just let me stay here
I'm running from I don't know
Just let me stay here tonight
Hey oh 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey oh 
I know it's been a while and the years have been unfaithful
Is there nothing left of me that even looks familiar?
Everything was easy when we thought we had the answers
Why you lookin' at me like I'm from another planet?
Just let me stay here
I'm running from I don't know 
Just let me stay here tonight
Just let me stay here tonight, now
I won't hurt you, don't stop me
Just let me stay a while 
Just let me stay here tonight
Just let me stay here tonight
Oh-we-oh, my love say no, may you can let me in
Oh-we-oh, my love say no, may you can let me in
Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah, now
Just let me stay here
I'm running from I don't know 
Just let me stay here tonight
I wanna stay here tonight, now
I won't hurt you, don't stop me 
Just let me stay a while 
Just let me stay here tonight
Please let me, yeah
Oh-we-oh, my love say no, may you can let me in
Oh-we-oh, my love say no, may you can let me in
Oh-we-oh, my love say no, may you can let me in
Oh-we-oh, my love say no, may you can let me in
Oh-we-oh, my love say no, may you can let me in
Oh-we-oh, my love say no, may you can let me in
