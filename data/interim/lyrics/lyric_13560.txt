Some habits are too hard to break
You give in
Then you're hooked on what you take
Why don't you come close?
I need an overdose
Because you've got me
You got me
Under the influence
Of a four-letter word on my mind
You got me
Under the influence
And I'll do anything anytime
My empty nights, you fill them up
I don't know when to say I've had enough
Intoxicate me
With every kiss you've got
I know I must be
I must be under the influence
Of a four-letter word on my mind
You got me under the influence
And I'll do anything anytime
I must be under the influence
Of a love that is sweeter than wine
You got me under the influence
And my willpower's so hard to find
I must be under the influence
Of a four-letter word on my mind
You got me under the influence
And I'll do anything anytime
I must be under the influence
Of a love that gets sweeter than wine
You got me under the influence
And my willpower's so hard to find
