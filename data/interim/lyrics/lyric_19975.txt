We belong together
Like the open seas and shores
Wedded by the planet force
We've all been spoken for
The hammer may strike, be dead on the ground
A net to my hand, a cross on his crown
We're done if, who we're undone
Finished if who we are incomplete
As one, we are everything
We are everything we need
We belong together
Like the open seas and shores
Wedded by the planet force
We've all been spoken for
What good is a life
With no one to share?
The light of the moon
The honor of a swear
We can try to live the way of which you speak
Taste the milk of your mother Earth's love
Spread the word of consciousness you see
We are everything we need
We belong together
Like the open seas and shores
Wedded by the planet force
We've all been spoken for
All this indecision
All this independent strength
Still
We've got our hearts on safe
We've got our hearts on safe
Someday when you're lonely
Sometime after all this bliss
Somewhere lost in emptiness
I hope you find this gift
I hope you find this gift
I hope you find this gift
