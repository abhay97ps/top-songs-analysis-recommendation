Our houses are protected by the good Lord and a gun
And you might meet 'em both if you show up here not welcome son
Our necks are burnt, the roads are dirt and our trucks ain't clean
The dogs run loose, we smoke, we chew and fry everything
Out Here, Way out here
We won't take a dime if we ain't earned it
When it comes to weight, brother we pull our own
If it's all backwoods where you live and you're concerned with
Well you can leave us alone
Just worry about John Wayne, Johnny Cash and John Deere
Way out here
We've got a fighting side a mile wide but we pray for peace
Cause it's mostly us that end up serving over seas
Hell if it was up to me I'd love to see this Country run
Like it used to be, like it ought to be and just like it's done
Out here, way out here
Cause we won't take a dime if we ain't earned it
When it comes to weight, brother we pull our own
If it's all backwoods where you live and you're concerned with
Well you can leave us alone
Just worry about John Wayne, Johnny Cash and John Deere
Way out here
Our houses are protected by the good Lord and a gun
And you might meet 'em both if you show up here not welcome son
