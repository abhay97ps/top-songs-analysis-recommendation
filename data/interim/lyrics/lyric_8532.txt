I’m sitting on the bed again
Waiting for the phone to ring
Trying not to step on the toes that brought me to this place again
Wonder bout the bag I packed up is it safe yet to pull the cord
Is there ever a good time to jump off these high waves
I’ve already told you sweet dreams honey oh sweet dreams
Sweet dreams honey oh sweet dreams
I’m dizzy in the head again
One day waiting on the sky to fall
Tryna dig out of the bitter cream pie
That’s been poisoning us all
And I start to fall back on our memory
But they move fast and soon be gone
I will be here with a note that sound
When the cure is just moving on
Sweet dreams honey oh sweet dreams
Sweet dreams sweet dreams
Sweet dreams honey oh sweet dreams
Sweet dreams sweet dreams
