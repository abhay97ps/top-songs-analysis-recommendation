Yi-yi, yi-yi-yi, yi-yi
When you're on the top
There's no place you can really go but down, down, down
People on the street congratulate you
They say they love the way you sound
Where...when you're on the low
No one wants to chit or chat or even know your name
Your agent's never there
Your manager has ripped you off and gone somewhere
Standing on the top
Standing on the top...top
On the top getting down, yeah
Standing on the top ...top
On the top getting down, Temptations sing
Standing on the top
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Standing on the top
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
When you're on the top
Everyone you meet they wanna be your long lost friend
They say how great you are, a superstar
But do you have any money to lend
When you're on the low
Where do all the freaks and fancy people go?
 I don't know
People sit and stare
Asking crazy questions: "Do you braid your hair?" and "What's L-7 Square?"
Standing on the top...top
On the top getting down, yeah
Standing on the top...top
On the top getting down, down, down, down
Can you understand it what I'm talkin' about
When I say that funk is here to stay
Can you understand it what I'm talkin' about
The funk is here to stay, oh 
If you understand it, say "Yeah" 
When I say that funk is here to stay
The funk is here to stay
We want the funk
(We want the funk and nothing else will do
Nothing else will do, no)
We want the funk
We want the funk
We want the funk 
We want the funk
We want the funk and nothing else will do
We want the funk and nothing else will do
 We want the funk
We want the funk and nothing else will do
We want the funk and nothing else will do
 We want the funk
We want the funk and nothing else will do...
