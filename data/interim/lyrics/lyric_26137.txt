Niggas sayin' they the G.O.A.T., but I can't buy into the hype
I dig deep into my spirit when I spit into the mic
All them sit-downs in that county made me think about my life
Went through some tragedies, I made it out to make it right 
I was doin' drugs just to get me through the night
They weren't with me through my struggles, all this shit I sacrificed
I climbed out the darkness, now my Patek shinin' bright
I been ballin' just for you, I put y'all faces in my ice
I got a problem, it's no problem, my lil' brother gon' get him
Before he hopped up off that porch, we always knew it was in him
Don't give no fuck, the twins gone, and he wish he was with him
He say them niggas ain't been slidin' and his crown don't fit him
He want all them niggas dead, it's sad to say, but I feel him
If I ain't had so much to lose, I'd be riskin' it with him
Always rap about the guys 'cause I genuinely miss 'em
Five years later, thousand tears later, still feel like the day when they hit 'em
Make sure I always say y'all name so ain't no way they forget 'em
Gon' always feel like fuck the opps 'cause nigga, I can't forgive 'em
I got that shit up out the mud, I spent 10K on my denims
Snakes in disguise, they try to love you with a heart full of venom
Niggas sayin' they the G.O.A.T., but I can't buy into the hype
I dig deep into my spirit when I spit into the mic
All them sit-downs in that county made me think about my life
Went through some tragedies, I made it out to make it right
I was doin' drugs just to get me through the night
They weren't with me through my struggles, all this shit I sacrificed
I climbed out the darkness, now my Patek shinin' bright
I been ballin' just for you, I put y'all faces in my ice
With clips, we pop out, taper shit like who need a trim?
Inherit hate, it got me wonderin' can we forgive?
Everybody got they input on how we should live, oh
Life on the road, I barely see the crib
FaceTime the fam, my son smilin' every time I call
Back then, I slipped up, I got artwork on them county walls
I signed a contract, like Carmelo, I'm just tryna ball
Matter of time before we blitz him, he been tryna stall
Got smoke for hoppin' in this shit, he shouldn't have got involved
Them R.I.P.s put him to sleep like he off Tylenol
Hot 'nem gon' tweak, them boys crazy, they ain't got it all
You know my pain and you my brother, I'm gon' ride for y'all
Niggas sayin' they the G.O.A.T., but I can't buy into the hype
I dig deep into my spirit when I spit into the mic
All them sit-downs in that county made me think about my life
Went through some tragedies, I made it out to make it right
I was doin' drugs just to get me through the night
They weren't with me through my struggles, all this shit I sacrificed
I climbed out the darkness, now my Patek shinin' bright
I been ballin' just for you, I put y'all faces in my ice, oh, oh, oh
