Everybody groove to the music
Everybody jam, oh
Ah-oh, hey
We've been waiting so long
Just can't hold it back no more
Creepin' up and down now
It's time for me to let it go, ah!
If you really wanna see
What we can do for you, ah
Send the crazy wildin' static
Sing it
Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it
Come on now everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it
Come on now everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
Ah-ah, hey
We've got it goin' on for years
Oh baby, yeah
We've got it goin' on for years
Well I’m creepin’ up on your left
Straight up funky when I get with ya
Keep it ruthless when I get wet
Keep the party packed in my corner
Tough like granite to keep the crowd hype
Get up on this just to get right
What you want it what you gonna get
Backstreet’s got the special effects
If you really wanna see
What we can do for you, ah
Send the crazy wildin' static
Sing it
Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it
Come on now everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it
Come on now everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
Ah-ah, hey
We've got it goin' on for years
Yeah-hey-hey-yeah
We've got it goin' on for years
We've been waiting so long
Just can't hold in back no more
Creepin' up and down now
It's time for me to let it go
Time for me to let it go!
Everybody groove to the music

Everybody groove to the music
Everybody jam
Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it
