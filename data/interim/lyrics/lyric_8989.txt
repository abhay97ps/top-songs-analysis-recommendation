For your love I would do anything
I would do anything for your love
For your kiss I would go anywhere
I would go anywhere for your kiss
How foolish I grow with each heart beat
But we are the foolish and that's why
I repeat
For your love I would do anything
I would do anything for your love
For your kiss I would go anywhere
I would go anywhere for your kiss
For your love. For your love
For your love. For your love
