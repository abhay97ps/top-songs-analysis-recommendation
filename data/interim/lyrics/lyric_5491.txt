Lately things have been so stressed for you
It seems like life is trying to mess with you and pester you
You thought you knew exactly what to best pursue
You working hard on those things that you set to do
But you confess it's true that your success is few
And your folks are only helping in depressing you
You try to do the Deen but they be stressing you
And it gets to you but you suppress that too
An exam, you go and study day and night
You pray and write, hope for a grade you like
But when you get the test you're in dismay and fright
There's no A in sight and only 8 were right, wow!
And what about the sister you enquired about
She's so pious, devout that it required a scout
But then you get the news her Wali fired you out
They were wired, no doubt, to someone higher in clout
Lately its seems that your calling in life
Is just you falling in strife
The word appalling is right
And you notice you've been feeling sick, why who knows
So you call upon the doctor she can eye it close
She tells you I suppose, that you won't be very happy when I diagnose
Although you try your hardest not to cry it shows
It's a monster load, and your strength is sinking
You start wondering and thinking
What's going on? it seems all wrong, why am I the one struggling along?
I don't know why I'm hurting, I never hurt nobody
My life I'm living right, but it's crumbling around me
How strong is my faith this time? 
Will my solution include Haram? 
I gotta be strong during times like these, 
I know after hardship there goes ease! 
It's a test, , a test , it's a test , gotta realize it's a test 
Folks used to say you were smarty kid
Others made mistakes but you hardly did
Since then man, life has just been marvelous
You stand tall like an obelisk
It's obvious
Your high paying job is never arduous
Your living in your crib and you got marble this and marble that
Others dream to rival that
And your blessed to never draw major debt
Because success is your motto nothing keeps you down
Passing peeps in town, yo by leaps and bounds
People clapping when you talk because of deep renown
You drive Hummers and top model jeeps around
You know its bad and haram to be a miser and boast
But your healthier and wealthier and wiser than most
You gotta an adviser to those, who try to propose
Cause there's so many potentials that they line up in rows
You got it all, the power the money the wealth
Your thinking God's gotta love you more than anyone else
But wait Whoa wait a second, this isn't what your thinking
You gotta stop and think why you getting all the blessings
Don't want to let it shake ya, or let the devil make ya
Forget to praise Allah and then fail the test your taken
No doubt you're gonna try your best
Gotta be thankful and pray no less
Already gotta head up above the rest
Cause you realize this is just a test
So face it, in life, you'll be tested at times
The devil, he's bright, don't let him mess with your mind
Yo, we're blessed, the Divine, which is the best for mankind
So He  gives us exams so don't get stressed out and whine
Even the best of all humanity was tested Himself
Allah can test us with calamity or test us with wealth
Can you hold back from profanity and focus yourself
Or maybe keep away from vanity and function in stealth
It's tough, trust me I know that it's rough
But after pain comes ease and you'll be blessed from above
I hope when the time for my test comes along I will cope and I'll find I'll be blessed when I'm strong
So my people, when life is a mess
You gotta focus and realize, this could be your test
