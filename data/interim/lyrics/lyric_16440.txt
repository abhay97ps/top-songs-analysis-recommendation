You've done me wrong
Your time is up
You took a sip 
From the devil's cup
You broke my heart
There's no way back
Move right outta here baby
Go on pack your bags
Just who do you think you are
Stop acting like some kinda star
Just who do you think you are
Take it like a man baby if that's what you are
Cause I'm moving on up
You're moving on out
Moving on up
Nothing can stop me
I'm moving on up
You're moving on out
Time to break free
Nothing can stop me
They brag a man has walked in space
But you can't evenfind my place
Mm there ain't nothing 
You can do
Cause I've had enough of me baby
Being part of you
Just who do you think you are
This time you've gone too far
Just who do you think you are
Take it like a man baby if that's what you are
Cause I'm moving on up
You're moving on out
Moving on up
Nothing can stop me
I'm moving on up
You're moving on out
Time to break free
Nothing can stop me
Moving on up
You're moving on out
Moving on up
Nothing can stop me
I'm moving on up
You're moving on out
Time to break free
Nothing can stop me
Nothing can stop me
Time to break free
Nothing can stop me
