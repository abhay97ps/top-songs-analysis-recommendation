808 Mafia!
What they gon' do?
What they gon' do?
What they gon' do?
My wrist on ooh 
My wrist on, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah 
Southside on the track, yeah
Put blindsides on my eyes young nigga, I can feel the money 
I got some young niggas pull on the opps, and they kill for money 
You ever felt a zombie? 
Yo' body gon' smell like vomit 
I done went bad 
Ever since I got checks I don't run and get mad, that's not how I react 
But she throwin' it back, I done threw it right back
I spent 40K flat 
Don't worry my nigga, get part of the clip so I got it right back 
By the way, way it's going down, it's been going up
I can't hold nothing back, I won't hold you up
I can't fit all my pain in this styro' cup
Always talk to myself 'cause it's only us
Always deep in my mind, don't know who to trust
I been rolling 'round town feeling woozy
Tryna ride on my side, I get choosy
I don't know who is trying to use me
Pimpin' ain't easy , hoppin' out the 'Ghini 
All my wishes came true like a genie 
All my money comin' blue when they print it
That nigga Offset  fuck you in a sentence 
See you in a minute 
I see you in a Rolls and it's rented 
Nigga tried to try me like I was a gimmick 
Now I got a number one and they hear me
You heard that? I was trappin' and I had to take a bird bath 
Guns on me, I was going down the wrong path
I'm humble with the money and I don't cry
Beat me at the game, I'ma grab it 
I stock out my pints in the cabinet 
Drippin' too clean like a napkin 
She was on a bean with her rack out 
Money to the racks so I lap 'em 
Don't give 'em a formula, I cap 'em 
I'm from the jungle, I'm an animal 
You bitches ain't shit, they scandalous 
Knock his head off, I commanded him 
I'm from the bando, my daddy had abandoned me 
Momma tried to cover up and bandage me 
I'm the first one to lead the whole legacy 
Put blindsides on my eye, young nigga, I can feel the money 
I got some young niggas pull on the opps, and they kill for money 
You ever felt a zombie?  Yo' body gon' smell like vomit 
They thought I would fail, I conquer 
I swim with the sharks, piranhas 
You tattletale, informant 
I move like a boss, I'm important 
I fuel up the Rari, performance 
I been left out the streets like an orphan 
I was strong but I wanted to forfeit 
I got famous and rich, now I'm corporate 
By the way, way it's going down, it's been going up
I can't hold nothing back, I won't hold you up
I can't fit all my pain in this styro cup
Always talk to myself 'cause it's only us
Always deep in my mind, I don't know who to trust
I been rolling 'round town feeling woozy
Tryna ride on my side, I get choosy
I don't know who is trying to use me
Them shooters gon' slide and it's quiet, ain't nobody here 
I nut on her titties and booty, she cleanin' up the residue with her lip 
Every nigga cross me, dawg, on God, I'ma catch him, I don't care if it's in ten years 
Lost my bruddas to the street, we gon' slide, kill some, go home and shed tears 
When it's time to ride 
Catch me in the 6 with a blicky 
Nigga took the stand, he a Mickey 
Niggas get to tellin' when it's sticky 
Can't believe you niggas tryna diss me 
Show you how fast I'ma get him 
Then I find his body by 3 Mississippi 
Richard Mille on me cost half a ticket, dawg 
Need to open up a bunny ranch 'cause I got all the bitches, dawg 
Why you in the car if you ain't gon' shoot?
You another witness, dawg 
Them big ass, cheap ass veneers
Yâ€™all need to see another dentist dog 
Been fuckin' with 'Set like way back, dawg
This shit go way back 
Disrespect, we don't play that
You can get shot in your wave cap 
You was in the house playin' 'Tendo
I was on the block where the J's at 
I'ma stand on it if I say that
Say it with your chest when you say that , nigga 
Put blindsides on my eye, young nigga, I can feel the money 
I got some young niggas pull on the opps, and they kill for money 
You ever felt a zombie? 
Yo' body gon' smell like vomit 
They thought I would fail, I conquer 
I swim with the sharks, piranhas 
You tattletale, informants 
I move like a boss, I'm important 
I fuel up the Rari, performance 
I been left out the streets like an orphan 
I was strong but I wanted to forfeit 
I got famous and rich, now I'm corporate
