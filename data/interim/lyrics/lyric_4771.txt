I'm back on the street again
Gotta stand on my own two feet again
And I'm walkin' that beat again
Rememberin' when, woah
Rememberin' when
Got a tear in my eye again
Reminding me that I might cry again
Feelin' sad wonderin' why again
Rememberin' when, woah
Rememberin' when
Once I used to think that the world belonged to me
Now, it belongs to someone else
So, I'm thinkin' of me again
That's the way it's gonna be again
'Til the day I can be again
Rememberin' when, woah
Rememberin' when
So, I'm thinkin' of me again 
That's the way it's gonna be again
'Til the day I can be again 
Rememberin' when, woah
Rememberin' when, woah
Rememberin' when, ooh
Rememberin' when
