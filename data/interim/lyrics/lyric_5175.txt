I'll be in New York City
When the lights shine bright tonight
Where my woman waits for me
Arms that hold me tenderly
Lips as sweet as honeycomb
Love that waits for me alone
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
The eyes of a New York woman
Are eyes that can hold a man
She swept me off of my feet
Made my world seem so complete
I'll never have to look for more
I found what I've been lookin' for
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
Thought I wasn't ready
For the tie that binds
But I lost my heart to her
When her eyes met mine
Now I see her differently
I've got to make her mine
So I'll make my home Fun City
And let the lights shine bright on me
East side café†s, West side plays
Uptown, downtown, I'll be there
I'll never have to look for more
I found what I've been lookin' for
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
The eyes of a New York woman
Are eyes that can hold a man
She swept me off of my feet
Made my world seem so complete
I'll never have to look for more
I found what I've been lookin' for
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
Deep in the eyes of a New York woman
