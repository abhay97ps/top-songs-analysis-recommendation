There will never be any peace
Until God is at the conference table
There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
Men are runnin? from land to land
Tryin? to make things alright
Holding meeting after meeting, constantly reaching
For what they maybe thinking is right
Everybody has a plan
Ain?t that just a man
People can?t you understand?
We gotta tell ?em
There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
What went on in the dark
Has come to light
Tell me who's to blame
And what?s his name?
You can point your finger
But you gotta remember
What was done was done by a man
So we gotta tell ?em
There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
Oh yeah, until God is seated
At the conference table
God only needs
God seeing it 
Every body sing together
There will never be any peace
No, no, peace
Until he is seated at the conference table
There will never be any peace
So sing a little prayer now
Everybody
(There will never be any peace until God
He?s at the conference table)
Holding hand in hand
All over the land
He's at the conference table
