I got a boo and she beautiful
She bougie and alladat
I’m tellin you my girl is new and unusual
An immutable artifact
She been wit the bullshit
I been making music for her
She like the reason i drop
I plug her straight to the aux
She like my secret for bops
I told her hop in car
And we gon go downtown girl i’m tryna get lost witcha
Told her get ready for count down kuz i’m tryna take off witcha
Whole lotta loud in the background but we ain’t worried bout officers
Vibin don’t gotta talk too much
I can’t keep my eyes off of her
Off of her
Hey baby
Tell me what’s ya vibe this evening
I hopе you doin fine this evening
Been lookin at ya drеss and i’m lovin the design
Ya seamstress has got you lookin more than devine
Baby you more than a dime
Imma need more of ya time
Tryna be more than ya main
Gotta be sortve a body pillow but portable
Huggin on me adorable never ever been bored of you
Call you up in the morning to dick you down till you sore
An i could never comprehend the way you trickin on these bitches
How you cop a stare from every single nigga in attendance
You a limited edition
Unpredictable ya energy be shiftin
Unforgettable i’m really on a mission
Like damn girl i’m infatuated
I wanna thank you for this date we on i’m glad you made it
I got paper on me baby you don’t have to pay it
Some dirty women tryna take me so i had to say it i’m like
I got a boo and she beautiful
She bougie and alladat
I’m tellin you my girl is new and unusual
An immutable artifact
She been wit the bullshit
I been making music for her
She like the reason i drop
I plug her straight to the aux
She like my secret for bops

By golly gee whiz i ain’t never seen a body like this
Pardon my stare but shawty quite thick
New drip poppin wit the body con fit
Quick to molly whop a nigga talkin to her wrong since
Bout 15 shawty been the nigga round here
Round 16 shawty noticed she was top tier
Got big things poppin off shit is not fair
How quickly shawty started winnin
And i’m so flabbergasted how you do it so diligent
Girl how you so nasty while you lookin so innocent
You sweeter than candy wit the skin color cinnamon
We lit off the brandy singin put that on everything
It got me feelin loose sippin on a new zip by the pool
Got the juice wit me and some new shit for the mood
Off the blue bottle like a new crip on the cool
Gotta move different now i got you
Sayin i gotta booo
I got a boo and she beautiful
She bougie and alladat
I’m tellin you my girl is new and unusual
An immutable artifact
She been wit the bullshit
I been making music for her
