Corrine I want no opinion from you
Was it fun or just a bad thing to do
And while you play, I’m waiting for the day
I’ll find some way to make you pay
But then you come and you pull me around
Would Jesus pull me around
Would Jesus pull me around
I need some food, some sleep
Some company to keep
The sun, some shade
A word and a will made
And drink, my cabinet’s open wide
I’ll take something to make me go wild
In truth, good fortune sets me free
Would vengeance make a killer of me
Pull me around
Would Jesus pull me around
Would Jesus pull me around
I need some food, some sleep
Some company to keep
The sun, some shade
And somebody’s bed
Lull me around, drag my bad name down
And people say
Lull me around, drag my bad name down
Oh Jesus
Would Jesus pull me around
Would Jesus pull me around
I’ll take some books, films, changing my will
A lies test, everybody
Jesus, pull me around
Would Jesus pull me around
Would Jesus pull me around
