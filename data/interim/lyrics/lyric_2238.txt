A crazy little smile
Everybody's got a smile
But if we get together
And they smile when I hold you
Then we've got love
Tell you that 
So much love 
We've got 
So much love 
Now if we get together
And they smile when I hold you
Then we've got love
One more thing
You've got lips
Such pretty little lips
Everybody's got lips
But if you kiss me back
When I kiss your pretty lips, baby
Then we've got love
I keep-a tellin' you that 
So much love 
Oh 
We've got a love babe 
Now if you kiss me back
When I kiss your pretty lips, baby
Then we've got love
Now listen
You've got a heart
I know you've got a heart
Because everybody's got a heart
Now listen
Now if your heart beats faster
When you see me comin'
Then we've got love
But oh 
We've got love 
So much love baby 
You know we got love 
Now if your heart beats faster
When you see me comin'
Then we've got love
I wanna tell you 'bout it 
So much love 
Baby got love 
Oh yeah 
Now if your heart beats faster
When you see me comin'
Then we've got love
