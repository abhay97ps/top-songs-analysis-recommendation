If I could be you and you could be me for just one hour
If we could find a way to get inside each other's mind
Mm-hmm
If you could see you through my eyes instead of your ego
I believe you'd be surprised to see that you've been blind
Mm-mm
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Hey, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes
Now, your whole world you see around you is just a reflection
And the law of karma says "You're gonna reap just what you sow"
Yes, you will
So unless you've lived a life of total perfection
Mmm, mmm, you'd better be careful of every stone that you should throw
Yeah, yeah
And yet we spend the day throwin' stones at one another
'Cause I don't think or wear my hair same way you do
Mm-hmm
Well, I may be common people but I'm your brother
And when you strike out and try to hurt me it's a-hurtin' you
Lord, have mercy
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Hey, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes
There are people on reservations and out in the ghettos
And brother, there, but for the grace of God, go you and I
Yeah, yeah
And if I only had the wings of a little angel, yeah, dontcha you know I'd fly
To the top of the mountain and then I'd cry
Yeah
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Hey, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Better walk a mile in my shoes
Drop whatcha doin'
Walk a mile in my shoes, yeah, yeah
Walk a mile in my shoes
Oh, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes
Yeah
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Hey, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes
