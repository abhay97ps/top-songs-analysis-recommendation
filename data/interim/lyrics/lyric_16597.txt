It's good to see your face again, It's been a while
How am I doing?
Well I get by somehow
You sure look good
Since your new love
Came in your life
No I didn't see that fire in you he's found
Oh but I can see it now
Oh I never saw
That look in your eyes
And I never had
You hold me that tight
And I never saw
You dance with your feet off the ground
Oh but I see it now
Holding him you've never looked more beautiful
Lettin' go has been so hard on me
And sittin' here it's clear to see
What he means to you
The way you look at him
It ain't no mystery
He's all I couldn't be
Oh I never saw that look in your eyes
And I never had you hold me that tight
And I never saw
You dance with your feet off the ground
Oh but I see it now
And I never saw
You dance with your feet off the ground
Oh but I see it now
