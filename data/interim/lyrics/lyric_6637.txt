Flesh and blood
Beside a Singin Mountain Stream
Where the Willow grew
Where the Silver Leaf of Maple
Sparkled in the Morning Dew
I braided Twigs of Willows
Made a String of Buckeye Beads
But Flesh And Blood needs Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
I leaned against a Bark of Birch
And I breathed the Honey Dew
I saw a North-bound Flock of Geese
Against a Sky of Baby Blue
Beside the Lily Pads
I carved a Whistle from a Reed
Mother Nature's quite a Lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood needs Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
A mockingbird sang just for me
And I thanked him for the Song
Then the Sun went slowly down the West
And I had to move along
These were some of the things
On which my Mind and Spirit feed
But Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
And when this Day was ended
I was still not satisfied
I knew ev'rything I touched
Would wither and one day die
And Love was all that would remain
And grow from all these Seed;
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
