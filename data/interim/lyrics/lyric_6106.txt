Verse 1:
Boy you played me now I played you
And that's just something that a bad bitch supposed to do
You fell in love, nigga you got attached?
That was yo fault you need to fall back
I'm young and heartless, I don't give a fuck
Got my nose in the air with my middle finger up
Can't be touched you tried to cuff me
Gave me everything you had but now its all bad
Now you sad, but no sympathy for you
You was the one playing all them hoes too
I think like a nigga, you got hurt like a bitch
Got my head in the game, I'm just trynna get rich
And you found out I was wit your best friend
But fuck you nigga you ain't my man
Get with the program took the money and ran
Playing you was a part of the plan
Chorus:
You could, never get the best of me
 Repeat
Verse 2:
I played you, I'm a bitch
Nigga you loved me, but I'm a ho, ok
What about that time when I hit yo line and that bitch answered yo phone
Yea nigga you got me fucked up cause you got caught up
And now you ain't cashing out, fuck what you talking bout
I'm trynna get rich, you can get off my clit
You ain't even bout that action, that dick is what you lackin' yup, I'm the last of a dyin breed
Best believe you won't find nobody better than me and nigga

She can have you and your empty wallet too
Yup you just mad cause we through BRRRRRRA

Chorus:
You could, never get the best of me

Verse 3:
How does it feel? Yup I bet it hurts
Walking around feeling less than what you worth
Wanna be ma man, better put in work
Throw me stacks wanna cuff plus tax
I want new J's and a diamond ring
I got expensive taste I like them finer things
You're looking for a friend, then bitch get a dog
I paid the cost to be a fucking boss
Yea you sprung but I'm some other shit
House of diddy bad bitch
Yea I know you miss this
My lips, my hips, my switch, my swag
All yo friends telling you," She bad, she got a friend put you on wit her sis
Me and my sis move mean like this
Yea you mad cause you lost the best thing you ever had but its over your loss, too bad!
Chorus:
You could, never get the best of me
