Who can I turn to, when nobdy needs me
My heart wants to know, and so I must go
Where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me, and no one beside me
I'll go on my way, and after today
The darkness will hide me
And maybe tomorrow, I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow, beg, steal or borrow
My share of laughter
With you I could learn to, with you on a new day
But who can I turn to, if you turn away
With you I could learn to, with you on a new day
But who can I turn to, if you turn away
