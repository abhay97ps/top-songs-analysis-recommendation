Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time
Get those problems of your head
Put your mama to bed
But don't stay too far from reality
Or you will live in a dream world
Dreaming of things that there ain't no possiblity
Who we believe me
Let's have a nice grooving time
But don't go too far
From the truth in your mind
'Cause you'll drink and drive
And then you'll fly too high
And so you'll pay the price
For justa feeling nice
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time
So many things to foresee
We were not born to live this way
We were born having fun in the jungle of grace
With plenty food to eat and plenty drink to drink
So you know what I mean when I say
Liberate yourself from the state that you're in
And don't get involved in
That everywhere it stink, it stink, it stink
Me say to dance
If you have to
But don't take no chance
To be deceived there
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time
Base is heavy, the drummer is steady
Ooh, rhythm runs
And it got you on the floor
Cry out for more
That's the only way
You gonna know it for sure
You need some more
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time
Your mind is your mind
I mean your body and your soul
Don't let material things
They must not keep you down
I get on up, I get on up
I mean you'll do what I ya say
I say do what you do
But don't get carried away
Let's have a good time
Yes educate oneself
Let's have a good time
And liberate oneself
Don't be no fool today
Don't be so cruel today
Let us build up the place
For the human ways
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time
Base is heavy, the drummer is steady
Woe yes it run and got you on the floor
Cry out for more
That's the only way you gonna know for sure
We need some more
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time
Let's have a good time
Let's have a good time
Let's have a good time
Let's have a good time
Let's have a good time
Let's have a good time
