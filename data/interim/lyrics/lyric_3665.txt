Give me heartaches, scold me
Give me cause to hurt again
Hear me well now
Shake hands
Shake hands
Â Crying
Crying
Crying enemy
Give me sadness, bring to me
Give me credit for not being any good
One more teardrop
Shake hands
Shake hands
Crying
Crying
Crying enemy
Shake hands
Shake hands
Crying
Crying
Crying enemy
