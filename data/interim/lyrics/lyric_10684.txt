It's been a while since we spent quality time
I miss ya pretty face baby, 
I've been on tour for a while and
I'm coming home today girl
I've been reminiscing and I'm ready 
You wanna touch me baby 
I'm touchin down arond noon
Can you pick me up from the airport
I gotta see you
I wanna see you now
Can't wait 'til later
I wanna lay you down
Can't wait 'til later
Is it on your mind?
Do you want it like i want it? 
I gotta see you now
Can't wait 'til later
I wanna get wild
Can't wait 'til later
Is it on ya mind?
Do you want it like i want it?
Make sure you wear that little dress 
And those stilletos with the straps 
You know that turns ya boy on
But ya birthday suit is the ultimate
Laying on the sofa then turn that body over
Don't let me down girl
I'll see you at the airport
I'mma serve it good all because it's mine
I'mma take my time it's a special night
Got the wine on chill White Zinfandel
I'm clappin' two times to dim all of the lights
I can't wait to see you
