I don't want something complicated, baby
I just want something simple like the truth
Now's the time
This time I'm going to take a stand
Call me honestly only if you show your hand
Don't keep walking away
Today we got to work it out now
Understand
Give me yours
I'll give you mine
Put your heart on the line
I don't want something complicated, baby
Just want something simple like the truth
I don't want something fabricated, baby
Just want something simple like the truth
Hot love, cold lies
Can't you find a compromise
Good bad, never had
Anything but troubled times
And how come every time
I need a little sincerity
It's such a crime
Give me yours
I'll give you mine
Put your heart on the line
I don't want something complicated, baby
Just want something simple like the truth
I don't want something fabricated, baby
Just want something simple like the truth
Look in my eyes
Don't look away
Look in my eyes
Hey... Hey... Hey... Hey...
I don't want something complicated, baby
I don't want something complicated, baby
Just want something simple like the truth
I don't want something fabricated, baby
Just want something simple like the truth
Not complicated
Like the truth
Not fabricated
Like the truth
Not educated
Don't want it complicated
Not calculated
Like the truth
