Saturday night in the club
Yo, Dis N Dat
Yeah, we in the house
We getting our freak on
With K-Nock, 69 and 95 South
CC Lemonhead, he taped it
Fixed it and remixed it
So, Thrill from 69
Double talk and just keep getting
Jump on the party
So you should go home
We got Dis N Dat and 69
They got it going on
Yo, what's up, miss thang
Why don't you and your friends
Get with me and my friends
And we'll all go check in
At the motel, tell a few jokes
And maybe have a drink or two
Then arrive for the bump and grind
And the freaky things you gon' do
Now I can't say what you don't do
Huh, 'cause I don't know
But if you let me, I'll go, go
Where no man has gone before
You dancing all freaky, ha
And talking your talk
But at 4 AM when it's time to go home
Let's hope you can walk the walk
And at that time, I think we'll find
That you can't fight me
'Cause you gots to be all that
If you gonna freak me, baby
Break it down, become a freak
You know how we do it
Up and down, wanna take you 'round
'Cause there ain't nothing to it
You around till the end of the night
Uh, it ain't no thing
But don't your friends
Got cash to spend
Bought a dog and some chicken wings
So if you're freaky, you wanna meet me
Yo, you got to..
Call me anything you want
But don't call me collect
So just come on down, don't frown
No ifs, buts and no maybes
At party time, I become a freak
So, whoop, here it is, big baby
Oh, baby, don't say nothing
Just let me freak, all right
If you mean that, bring your lunch 
'Cause we're gonna eat out tonight
It's time for what, girl
I can do a little bit of this
And a little bit of that
True dat, true dat
Come on, come on
Let's freak me deep
Freak of the week
And when you start, don't stop
Once again, my friends is hanging out
With Dis N Dat and we're running things
Getting freaky like Rick James
And I play for keeps
'Cause I'm a super freak
Come on, girl
What you waiting for and don't try
And act like you don't know

Doing our thing, getting our...
So, girl, let's go

With the rodeo show
Just ride on out
You know what I'm talking about
I wanna hear giddy, giddy
Here, get the hell on
'Cause I got some freaky stuff to do
Can I do my freaky stuff with you
I can't wait all day
I ain't got time to play
I gotta ten dollar room
And some Hennessey
I wanna see that booty, uh
So freak me, girl, and don't stop
Ooh, I got a winner
I think I got a winner
This the Rottweiler from 69
And I'll freak you down
Like a three piece chicken dinner
Don't press with you
Don't wanna mess with you
While you getting your club on
I had to clear my throat
And let's go through the motions
We can get our love on
So, grab your car keys
Some extra clothes
And a bottle of Boone's
I'm in to play, well
You're about to come face to face
With a monster freak real soon
So when I drop you home in the morning
You can give me a peek
When I let you go
You'll know for sure
That you was with a real freak
Oh, baby, don't say nothing
Just let me freak, all right
If you mean that, bring your lunch 
'Cause we're gonna eat out tonight
It's time for what, girl
I can do a little bit of this
And a little bit of that
True dat, true dat
