This is the way that I feel
When I'm with you, baby
This is the way that I feel
When I'm with you, baby
Oh, but I love you, yeah, baby
I love you
Listen, baby
When I'm just barely surviving
Oh, you make me feel so important
And you mean so much to me
That I never want to leave your side
Oh, this is the way that I feel
When I'm with you, baby
This is the way that I feel
When I'm with you, baby
Oh, but I love you, yeah, baby
I love you
I know some of my friends try to tell you
That you oughta put me down
And start dating some other girls, yeah
Whenever I'm not around
And I feel so good
Till I hear someone say
You're not right for me
But when I'm with you, baby
I'm right where I want to be, yeah
This is the way that I feel
When I'm with you, baby
This is the way that I feel
When I'm with you, baby
Oh, but I love you, yeah, baby
I love you
My heart beats like a thousand drums
When I reach out to hold you in my arms
It feels like I'm floating on a cloud
Every time you speak my name out loud
This is the way that I feel
When I'm with you, baby
This is the way that I feel
When I'm with you, baby
