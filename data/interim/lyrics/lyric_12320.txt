Sometimes I sit and I dream on for hours
Sometimes my hours they turn into days
I dream of a girl I once knew as a schoolboy
She was the one who could sing me away
But she is a long ways away
And I want to be with her today
I'll think of a way I can get back
Oh I'd run all the way back home
Sing me away
Sing me away
Sing me away
Sing me away
What do you see when you look in the mirror
I see a face from the past it's so clear
What do you hear when I sing you forever
A song that will last for a million years
But I am a long ways away
I want to be with you today
Think of a way I can get back
Oh I'll run all the way back home
Sing me away
Sing me away
Sing me away
Sing me away
