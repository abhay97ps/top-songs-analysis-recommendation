Yeah I'm lost in the night
The icy wind is howling out your name
Desolation lingers like a fog
The fire is growing dimmer in the wind
I'm out in the rain
The moon has gone behind the cloud again
And I can't stand to live another day
Cause my bluebird went away
And I'm locked in this room with my sorrow
No escape no way to get away
And my only connection with tomorrow
Is hoping that you might decide to not stay away
Oh, I'm out on a limb
If I could only find sweet love again
And I can't stand to live another day
Can't find my bluebird anywhere anywhere anywhere
Oh I'm lost in the night
The icy wind is howling out your name
And I can't stand to live another day
Bluebird why did you go away
Bluebird why did you go away
Oh, little bluebird, why did you go away
