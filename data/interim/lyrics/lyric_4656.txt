Oh yeah
Leave my heart alone
Spring is here and like a wayward breeze
The love that left me came back haunting me
He's like the ever changin' sun that warms my heart and leaves
The love but tries to bite again
Ooh I'm falling, the same old heartaches calling
Oh yeah
I don't wanna love him
Behind each gentle word he speaks, love bug there you hide
To stir my tender feelings through his words of honey
But if you wait to sleep in love, I bear it deep inside
Love bug you love and leave me sobbing and sighing
Again he'll leave me cryin'
Oh yeah
I'm telling you love bug, love bug, hope you fly away
Spread your little wings, leave my heart and fly away
'Cause I don't want to love a guy who truly don't love me
I don't want the heartaches that I had before
He wants me for the moment and another girl he'll see
And through long and sleepless nights
When I'm tossin' and turnin'
My heart will be burning
Oh yeah, leave my heart alone
I don't wanna love him
You know, you know that he don't love me
Oh, don't give me the fever, I
