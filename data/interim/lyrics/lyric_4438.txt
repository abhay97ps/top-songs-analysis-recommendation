Oh, oh we could be on a desert
Lost without a place  to  go 
And we're so in love, in love with each other
That we wouldn't even  know 
 don't care 
Anyplace, anywhere 
 just as long
 as we are there, baby, baby
 together, baby
 together, baby
 just you and me
 oh, how  happy  we'll be 
And, oh, oh, oh, we could be in proverty
No one to lend a helping  hand 
But it's alright , alright I know
Because you always understand
 and I don't care 
Anyplace, anywhere 
 just as long
 as we share them, baby, baby
 together, baby
 together, baby
 just you and me
 oh, how  happy  we'll  be
 and I don't care 
Anyplace, anywhere 
 just as long
 as we share them, baby, baby
 together, baby
 together, baby
 just  you and me
 oh, how happy  we'll  be 
 oh, we're together
 we're gonna stay together
 do it all together
 gonna work together
 girl, every day, ever now
 gonna stay together
 oh, we're together
