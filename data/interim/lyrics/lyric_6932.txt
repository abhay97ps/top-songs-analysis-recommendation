He's so fine wish he were mine
That good looking boy over there the one with the coal black hair
I don't know how I'm gonna do it but I'm gonna make him mine
He's the envy of all the rest he's just a matter of time
He's so soft spoken guy oh so sweet kinda shy
Makes me wonder if I should even give him a try
But then again he can't shy he can't shy away forever
And I'm gonna make him mine if it takes me forever
Oh he's so fine gotta be mine
Sooner or later hope it's not later
We gotta get together the sooner the better
I just can't wait I just can't wait to be held in his arms
If I were a queen honey ask me to leave my throne
I'd do anything that he'd ask anything to make him my own
Cause he's so fine so fine he's so fine
Cause he's so fine so fine he's so fine
He's so soft spoken guy...
