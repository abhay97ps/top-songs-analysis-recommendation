My pretending days are over
Gonna leave acting to the stars in Hollywood
I should receive the Academy Award
For every girl I've fooled in this old town
I played my tricks on them
Told them they looked so sweet
When I knew all the time
Not a one did I wanna keep
My pretending days are over
Gonna leave acting to the stars in Hollywood
I used to masquerade from one girl to another
But sincе I met you, I can't go any further
Just one kiss from your sweet lips
Brought mе down down down from my ego trip
My pretending days are over
And I'm glad I found a girl just like you
My pretending days are over
Every man should have somebody sweet and true
You made me find myself
I don't pretend no more
I stopped acting like someone
On the late late T.V. show
You, you helped me find myself
And just because of you
I don't have to act like somebody else
My pretending days are over
Gonna leave acting to the stars in Hollywood
