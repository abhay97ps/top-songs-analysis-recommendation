Should you wander this land to the North
And few seldom do
Should you follow the song of the gull
To enchanted western isles
Coax a fisherman to take you out
Where the silky seals are seen
Hear the stories that they tell about
The maiden who is their queen
The maiden who is their queen
Celia of the Seals
She knows just how they feel
Celia of the Seals
Voyna, voyna, voyna
Voyna, voyna vay
Voyna, voyna, voyna
Voyna, voyna vay
Seal hunters are not brave and bold
They murder her poor wee seals
And cut off their skins to be sold
Cursed be he who deals
There's no reason for this slaughtering
They're left on the rocks to bleed
He's not a man who does this thing
It's a cruel and a heartless deed
A cruel and heartless deed
Celia of the Seals
She knows just how they feel
Celia of the Seals
Celia of the Seals
Celia of the Seals
She knows just how they feel
Celia of the Seals
Celia of the Seals
Celia of the Seals
Voyna, voyna, voyna
Voyna, voyna vay
Voyna, voyna, voyna
Voyna, voyna vay
Voyna, voyna, voyna
Voyna, voyna vay
