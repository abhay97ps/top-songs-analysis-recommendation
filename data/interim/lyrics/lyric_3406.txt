Since you left me
I'm finding out what heartbreak is so
Help me, save me
You are the judge and I'm your prisoner
Don't sentence me into a lifetime of loneliness
Without your love
I would die
Without your love
I wouldn't even try
To carry on
I was born to love you
Spare me a life of loneliness and tears
For I believe when love is true
One hasn't got the right
To turn to someone new
One hasn't got the right
To break somebody's heart
The way you've broken mine
Come back, I want you, need you
Bring back the love you shared with me
Without you, darlin'
I'm such a lonely human being
Don't sentence me into a lifetime of loneliness
Without your love
I would die
Without your love
I wouldn't every try
To carry on
I was born to love you
Come to my arms and rescue, rescue me
