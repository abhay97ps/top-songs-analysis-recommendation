Whut UP!
For the first time I actually feel accomplished with me life
My worst month was May the best was July
Nobody saw the sweet smoothness coming
It's been a while since I made a song that people kept loving
Never want anything to do with this guy
I'm so high I fell like i'm in the sky
Got so much hate that I'd really like to die
God take me now I don't wanna be here i'm too shy
All you haters, why you dissin'?
There is an explanation that you are just missin'
All I gotta say is this is a joke
When my rhymes come up it will stop the choke
Never make a scene
I've got into this label you know what I mean?
I'm questioning my life choices where do I stand?
I don't have to work hard my music isn't in demand
Lil C was bad but now he's good
If he could diss me again I think he would
Nevermind he never wants to do all of this old
Garbage I've just said how this story was told
I have no examples
Have so much music I could break them down in samples
I would give you a demo
I've been searching for the fans like I lost that fish Nemo
Got so many haters, I just get roasting
My rhymes are very toasting
You don't agree with me cause you don't like me
I don't even care I'll make ya wanna flee
This thing is too much
I'll make so many rhymes that many fakers can't touch
Your rhymes are so stale they see rust
My rhymes are so artifactual, they are surrounded with dust
All I do is send shivers
You cry so damn much all I see in you is rivers
Rhymes so cold all I think about is ice
I've gave another chance i've been too nice
