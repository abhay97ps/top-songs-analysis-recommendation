We do it for fun
We just do it for fun
Derrty ENT
We do it for fun
Bad Boy 
We do it for fun
Bend them trucks
We do it for fun
Stack them bucks
We do it for fun 
And the band played on
We do it for fun
Singing my song
We do it for fun
Bad Boys 2, the soundtrack
Let's go
Hey girl, what your name is?
Where you from? Turn around; who you came with?
Is that your ass or your mama half reindeer?
I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here
I'm still a sucker for cornrows, you know I never changed that
Your body is banging mama, but where your brains at?
I'm still the same cat when I was younger running with bad boys
But now I'm on the hook and so I'm running with Bad Boy
Here come another man, unlike no other man
Candy coated  switching every other lane
Y'all help me, why don't cha please help me
Eighth girl this week and it's only Tuesday
I like the cocky bowlegged ones
Black, white and Dominicans
Hispanics and Asians, please shake it for Nelly San
Manolos, Ma-no-no's, I can't tell
Everybody ain't that rich, just when you do it, do it well
Let me see you take it low
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Now real girls get down on the floor 
Now get that money, honey, act like you know 
Mama, I like how you dance, the way you fit in them pants 
And to the floor  take it low  girl, do it again 
You know I love that 
Now where them girls at? 
It's Diddy, Murphy Lee, and Nelly, how you love that?
Come on, we got another one player
From New York to the Dirty, how they loving it player?
Baby, you impressive, let's get
To know each other
You the best of the best and
You got to love it in the dresses, the sexiest
I had to tell her she's a young Janet Jackson live in living color
Look here mama you're dead wrong for having them pants on
Capri's cut low so when you shake it I see your thong
My pocket's full of dough, shake your feathers 'til the morning
It's Bad Boy and Nelly, man, somebody better warn them
Let me see you take it low
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Oh no, I heard them bad boys coming
Can't stop now
Got to continue my running 
'Cause we gon' party 'til the lights come on
And if my song stop, fuck it 'cause my mic's still on
Yo, I'm the big booty type
I like 'em thick with their mind right 
Banging personality, conversate when the time right 
I'm not hard, I've got women to handle that
They be like, "He the man," when I'm really a Thundercat
Come on, you know the 'Tics connect like Voltron
Collect so much grass, popo thinking we mow lawns
My Cole Haans don't match that
But it matches her headwrap and the seats that I got in the 'Lac
I'm just a Juvenile, 'cause I Be about G's
Keep the women Weezy, many say they have my babies
I'm Young like Turk, I like that Cash and that Money
 Man, I'm that damn hungry
You see I'm starvin' like Marvin, girl
I've got sixteen bars of fire is what I'm starting
Plus my rats come in packs like Sammy and Dean Martin
And I got so many keys, you think I'm valet parking 
Let me see you take it low
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Oh no, I heard them bad boys coming
Can't stop now
Got to continue my running 
'Cause we gon' party 'til the lights come on
And if my song stop, fuck it 'cause my mic's still on
