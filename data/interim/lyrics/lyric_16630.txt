Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
Say your lines, but do you feel them?
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around?
Watching you, watching me, one lonely star
I've always been in love with you 
I guess you've always known it's true 
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye 
Say good-bye
Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part where you're breaking my heart
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star
I've always been in love with you 
I guess you've always known it's true 
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
I've always been in love with you 
I guess you've always known it's true 
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye 
Say good-bye
All the world is a stage 
And everyone has their part 
But how was I to know which way the storyâ€™d go?
How was I to know you'd break 
You'd break my heart?
I've always been in love with you
I guess you've always known
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
I've always been in love with you 
I guess you've always known it's true 
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye 
Say good-bye
Say good-bye
