Oh, have mercy, baby
The latest talk
Is the funky funky walk
They doing that thing
Called the Broadway freeze
I want everybody
To keep on dancing now
Come on, y'all
Come on, y'all
Oooh wee
Oh, have mercy
I want everybody to
Get they saddles on
Cause we gonna ride
The horse for a little while
If you ain't got no horse
Come on out here with your mule
And keep on dancing, baby
Oh, have mercy
Whip it now
Whip it, baby
Drummer, I want you to get real funky
Bass player, take it up a little bit
Now add a whole lotta soul
Come on, guitar player
I want everybody
To keep on dancing now
Whip it, oh, have mercy
Ooh wee
Keep on dancing, baby...
