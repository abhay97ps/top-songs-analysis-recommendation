Ain't nothin' goin' on in town tonight
Except a loud party crowd drinkin' too much beer
So, baby tell me would it be all right
If we just take a little rain check and stay right here
I'm sure we could find somethin' to do
As a matter of fact, baby why don't you
Grab a couple glasses and a bottle of wine
Walk down the hall and turn down the lights
And baby while you're at it you might as well
Let down your hair and I can take it from there
Yeah, I can take it from there
I'm gonna put an old record on
Conway Twitty, yeah girl I'd love to lay you down
Kill the ringer on the telephone
Ain't gonna stop lovin' you 'til the candle burns out
Oh there it is, that little smile of yours
Come on, baby, what ya waiting for?
Grab a couple glasses and a bottle of wine
Walk down the hall and turn down the lights
And baby while you're at it you might as well
Let down your hair and I can take it from there
Tomorrow's gonna be here way too soon
Let's not waste another minute girl
I got plans for me and you
Just grab a couple glasses and that bottle of wine
Walk down the hall and darlin' turn down those lights
Baby while you're at it you might as well
Let down your hair and I can take it from there
Oh, I can take it from there
I can take it from there, yeah yeah
