They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere 
They say the girls are something else
On Broadway 
But looking at them just gives me the blues 
'Cause how ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime?
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes 
Ha! They say that I won't last too long
On Broadway 
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say 
But oh! They're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway 
Oh, they're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway 
On Broadway 
I'm gonna make it, yeah 
I'll be a big, big, big man 
I'll have my name in lights 
Everybody, everybody's gonna know me, yes 
All up and down Broadway 
Ohhhhh yeah!
