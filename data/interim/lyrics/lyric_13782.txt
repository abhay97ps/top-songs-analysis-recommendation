I can feel something just ain't right
I can see when you sleep at night
In your dreams, there is no way you can find peace of mind
When we touch, all the fire's gone
Mean too much, I won't let you run out on me
As I watch our love grow old, turning cold
Looking out for love in Siberia
Gotta look for love everywhere you are
Ain't nobody gonna take your love away
Looking out for love in Siberia
Checking out to see what our chances are
Ain't nobody gonna take our love away
Could it be I just need you more?
Can't you see what you got in store?
If you stay, I will never let you go, oh, no
Try to reach, try to hold me tight
One and each, we must try and fight
Getting cool where we used to be sincere 'cause we're
Looking out for love in Siberia
Gotta look for love everywhere you are
Ain't nobody gonna take your love away
Looking out for love in Siberia
Checking out to see what our chances are
Ain't nobody gonna take our love away
Looking out for love in Siberia
Gotta look for love everywhere you are
Ain't nobody gonna take your love away
Looking out for love in Siberia
Checking out to see what our chances are
Ain't nobody gonna take our love away
Looking out for love in Siberia
Gotta look for love everywhere you are
Ain't nobody gonna take your love away
Looking out for love in Siberia
