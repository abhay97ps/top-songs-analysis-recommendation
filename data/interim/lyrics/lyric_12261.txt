How can I get you to notice that I want you?
My heart's on fire with desire
'Cause I love you
There's no time for waiting
Ready
I will tell you
So there's no doubt
I'll spell it out
Come give it to me
Give it
Come give your love to me 
Come give your love to me 
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
You've turned the spark of my love
Into a raging flame
And now I need to convince you
To feel the same
So don't you stand there
Talkin' 'bout the way I feel
Cause, baby, talk is cheap
Action speaks louder than words
Come give your love to me 
Come give your love to me 
Come give your love to me 
Come give your love to me
Hey, babe
My love just won’t let me wait
For you, I’m so weak
You know I’ll do anything it takes
So I beg you please, baby
Come give your love to me 
Come give your love to me 
Come give your love to me 
Come give your love to me 
Come give your love to me 
Come give your love to me 
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me 
Come give your love to me
