Laugh everyone at the clown
He's the best one in town, ah ha
Ride on his merry-go-round
Spinning faster than sound, ah ha, ah ha
Laugh as the funny man cries
Though his makeup is smeared, ah ha
Laugh at his comical tears
As he thinks of the years, ah ha, ah ha
Living just a little
Laughing just a little
Ain't easy
Ah ah ah ah ah
Living just a little
Laughing just a little
Ain't easy
 oh no no
Laugh everyone at the fool
With his heart in his hand, ah ha
Still he can't quite understand
That he's less than a man, ah ha, ah ha
Lost somewhere deep in his shell
There's an ember of pride, ah ha
Watch how he tries hard to hide
That he's dying inside, ah ha, ah ha
Hey we're living just a little
Laughing just a little
Ain't easy
Ah ha ha ha ha 
Living just a little
Laughing just a little
Ain't easy
Ah ha ha ha ha 
Living just a little
Laughing just a little
Ain't easy 
Ah ah ah ah ah
