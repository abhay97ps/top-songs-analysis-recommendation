I'm watching you
Watching you to see
What you're doing without me
Now that you've been gone
I'm watching you
Watching every girl
As you give them all the eye
And dance another song
Yeah, I'm watching every little move you make
Every little step you take
Every little heart you break
Yeah, every little thing
Every little word you sigh
Is every little time I die
And every little time I try
To look the other way
But I keep watching you
I take a little peek
As I see you cheek to cheek
Oh, the jealousy
I'm watching you
You know I'm on the floor
So you pour it on some more
Just to torture me
-Instrumental-
Yeah, I'm watching every little move you make
Every little step you take
Every little heart you break
Yeah, every little thing
Every little word you sigh
Is every little time I die
And every little time I try
To look the other way
But I keep watching you
I'm watching you
Watching you to see
What you're doing without me
Now that you've been gone
I'm watching you
Watching every girl
As you give them all the eye
And dance another song
I'm watching you
Watching you to see
What you're doing without me
Now that you've been gone
