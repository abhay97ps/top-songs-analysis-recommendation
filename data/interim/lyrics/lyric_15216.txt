I’ve heard of true loves that lasted forever
I guess there is a way
And I’ve heard of true loves that needed each other
More and more each day
What is love when there’s no one that cares?
Next time you need my love, I’ll be there
Be right by your side
Let’s try it again, try it again
Let’s try it again
My love for you, it has no end
Let’s try it again, ‘til the end
All because I love you
I’ve heard of two loves that stayed with each other
Didn’t wander through the night
And I’ve heard of two loves that prayed for each other
Didn’t argue, fuss or fight
Now I know just what love’s all about
Next time you need my love
I won’t doubt, doubt your love again
Let’s try it again, try it again
Let’s try it again
My love for you, it has no end
Let’s try it again, ‘til the end
All because I love you
You, gotta try it again
My love for you, it has no end
You know and I know
It’s all because, I love you
Let’s try it again
Let’s try it again
Try it again
Let’s try it again
Let’s try it again
My love for you, it has no end
Try it again
