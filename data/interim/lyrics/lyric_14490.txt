I see the love deep in your eyes
You let the love, grow in my mind
In the morning sun, I see your face
I can feel your love and your embrace
You fell in love right from the start
It has to last from falling apart
In the morning sun, I see your face
I can feel your love and your embrace
Long way, long way to love
Long way, long way to love
Your fires kept warm in my heart
You feed the flame from going out
In the morning sun, I see your face
I can feel your love and your embrace
Long way, long way to love
Long way, long way to love
Long way, long way to love
Long way, long way to love
Long way, long way to love
Long way, long way to love
Long way, long way to love
Long way, long way to love
