And I am telling you
I'm not going
You're the best man I'll ever know
There's no way I can ever go
No, no, no, no way
No, no, no, no way I'm livin' without you
I'm not livin' without you
I don't want to be free
I'm stayin'
I'm stayin'
And you, and you, you're gonna love me
Oh, you're gonna love me
And I am telling you
I'm not going
Even though the rough times are showing
There's just no way
There's no way
We're part of the same place
We're part of the same time
We both share the same blood
We both have the same mind
And time and time we have so much to share
No, no, no, no, no
I'm not wakin' up tomorrow mornin'
And findin' that there's nobody there
Darling, there's no way
No, no, no, no way I'm livin' without you
I'm not livin' without you
You see, there's just no way
There's no way
Tear down the mountains
Yell, scream and shout
You can say what you want
I'm not walkin' out
Stop all the rivers
Push, strike, and kill
I'm not gonna leave you
There's no way I will
And I am telling you
I'm not going
You're the best man I'll ever know
There's no way I could ever, ever go
No, no, no, no way
No, no, no, no way I'm livin' without you
Oh, I'm not livin' without you
I'm not livin' without you
I don't wanna be free
I'm stayin'
I'm stayin'
And you, and you, and you
You're gonna love me
Oh, yeah, you're gonna love me
Yes, you are, love me
Oh, oh, oh, love me
Love me
Love me
Love me
Love me
You're gonna love
Me
