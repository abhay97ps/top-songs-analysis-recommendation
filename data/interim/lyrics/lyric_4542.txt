Don't go out into the rain
You're gonna melt, sugar
Oh no, come and sit here by the fire for a spell, sugar
Oh ho, please take your shoes off and make yourself comfortable
The weather's miserable and you're so kissable
It's getting late
Why don't you stay?
It's after one
We've just begun
She's got to go
Oh no no no, please don't go
Don't go out into the rain
You're gonna melt, sugar
Oh no, come and sit here by the fire for a spell, sugar
Oh ho, the house is ours now that everybody's gone
And while the telly's on we should be having fun
It's getting late
Why don't you wait?
It's after one
We've just begun
She's got to go
Oh no no no, please don't go
Don't go out into the rain
You're gonna melt, sugar
Oh no, come and sit here by the fire for a spell, sugar
Oh ho
It's getting late
Why don't you wait?
It's after one
We've just begun
She's got to go
Oh no no no, don't be insane
