When the moon hung soft and low
Catchin' stardust in the light
You held me closer and closer
There was magic in the night
A sweet love song, a melody
That I still can recall
Two young hearts filled with dreams
To walk away with it all
Whoa, whoa tender years
Won't you wash away my tears
How I wish you were here
Please don't go, tender years
A summer love, a beach romance
Sought her kisses in the sand
Two young hearts filled with fire
Lost in never never land
