I'll be home, my darling
Please wait for me
We'll stroll along together
Once more our love will be free
At the corner drugstore
Each Saturday we would meet
I'd walk you home in the moonlight
All of these things we'll repeat
So darling, as I write this letter
Here's hoping you're thinking of me
My mind's made up
So long until I'll be home to start serving you
I'll be home, my darling
Please wait for me
We'll stroll along together
Our love will be free
