Pull up , watch these mothafuckas freak

I done paid taxes, paid dues, paid bills my whole life
So I'ma throw money in the air, like I'm tryin' to pay the sky
Told myself that man if I can't live like this, I'd rather die
I give it up to God, and he always replies:
"Control yo' hoes, you let her talk 'til you crazy
You got baby mama drama, you ain't even got you no baby!
You fugazi, b-boss up, boss up with your time dog
You ain't got time for no hoes, I ain't even got time for no time off!"

So these niggas can know I do what they can't
I'm stuntin' for all the people who ain't
You still hatin'? You should be fuckin' ashamed
Far as I came, guess when you're running the game they want you to sprain
Yeah, I know, I know, but I don't get my stress on
Takin' shots, swear it's like my stomachs made of Teflon
They like, "Boy, won't you get your rest on?"
Bitch, cause I'm up for every hour I was slept on
And last night I dreamed about two girls, bisexual
They was tryin' things, trisexual
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll
Drew my blueprint, got it illustrated, F.F. affiliated
Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated
Life of a Don, Chandon sippin', never had a palm readin'
Always had my palms itchin' time to get it
Boy, I was taught to get it 'til it's gone
Even when I got it, watch me get it like I don't
Hol' up, hol' up, tell me what you see 
Pull up , watch these mothafuckas freak 
S-say what up though when you see me in the streets
G.O.O.D. Music in this bitch, now drop that mothafuckin' beat, woah
