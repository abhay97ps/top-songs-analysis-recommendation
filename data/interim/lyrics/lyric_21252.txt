The clouds are partin
The summer suns startin to burn down on that river
My babys waitin
I got the chevy shaking
Im blazing a trail to get her
There she is
Shes got her shades on
& man shes lookin strong
Mine all mine for the weekend
The coolers loaded down
We're headed outta town
Jumpin off the deep end
Goin barefoot and crazy
Me and my baby
Backflip off the flipright bridge
Double dog dare me and I will
Meet me at the bottom with a cool wet kiss
Shes rockin that bikini top
My hearts skippin like a rock across that water
Don't ever wanna stop
Goin barefoot and crazy
The sun is droppin
We got the fire poppin &
Its lightin up her blue eyes
With a little bit of luck
It'll heat things up &
We'll be lovin in the moonlight
Break out my old guitar
Sing fishin in the dark
Baby get ready
We'll take a little sip
We'll take a little dip &
Sleep in the bed of my Chevy
Goin barefoot and crazy
Me and my baby
Just me & her & the man in the moon
Drinkin on a cold bud brew
Mornins gonna come way too soon
We'll wake up &
Do it all again
Wishin it would never end
Anybody asks where we've been
Tell em
Barefoot and crazy
Barefoot and crazy
Me and my baby
I did a back flip off the flipright bridge
Double dog dared me and I did
Met me at the bottom with a cool wet kiss
Shes rockin that bikini top
My hearts skippin like a rock across that water
Don't ever wanna stop
Goin barefoot and crazy
Don't ever wanna stop
Don't ever wanna stop
Goin barefoot and crazy
