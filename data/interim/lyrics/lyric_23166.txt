My motorcycle needs an oil change
Fence needs mending, house needs paint
I got a million things that need to be done but
Baby I can only focus on one
The way you're looking back at me right now
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're playing with my mind, baby ain't no doubt
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're everything I shouldn't be thinking about
Baby you've always had a one track mind
So what you're saying ain't no surprise
What may come as a shock to you
Is that I'm having all those little thoughts too yea
The way you're looking back at me right now
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're playing with my mind, baby ain't no doubt
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're everything I shouldn't be thinking about
Baby since you and me are on the same page
Let's do something 'bout it, what do you say, ay?
The way you're looking back at me right now
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're playing with my mind, baby ain't no doubt
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
The way you're looking back at me right now
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're playing with my mind, baby ain't no doubt
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're everything I shouldn't be thinking about
