Feat.Brenda Lee
The only time you come to me
Is in my cruel and empty dreams
No matter how lonely and sad
Don't take my dreams they're all I have
But you'll never know
I never thought that you d one day
Betray my heart then turn away
With every reason I had to live
No-one would love you like I did
But you'll never know
So all alone I walked away
Into the darkness of the night
It hurt me so that I could die
Knowing you'll never ever realize
How I loved you so
And if you told me ever
You felt for how I cried
Still you would surely never
Know the hurt inside
I know that I'll never be free
Of chasing you and you just out of reach
Forever hungry consumed by pain
Once all I needed now all I crave
But you'll never know
No you'll never know
How all alone I walked away
Into the darkness of the night
It hurt me so that I could die
Every time it comes to mind
That you will never ever realize
How I loved you so
But you'll never know
How I loved you so
