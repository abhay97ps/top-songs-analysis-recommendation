Mmmm ... I'm looking for a love
Lookin' for a love
Well now
I'm lookin' here and there
And I'm searchin' everywhere
And I'm lookin, I'm lookin, I'm lookin, I'm lookin
Oh lookin' for a love to call my own
Well, someone to get up in the mornin' and rub my head
Someone to fix my breakfast and bring it to my bed
Someone to do a little housework and back with me again
Well now with lots of love and kisses and people until then
I'll be lookin' for a love
I'm lookin' for a love
Well well well
I'm lookin' here and there
And I'm searchin' everywhere
I'm lookin, I'm lookin, I'm lookin, I'm lookin
Oh lookin' for a love to call my own
Yes, someone to be in my corner all the way
She'll be working to the end no matter what the people say
I'll give her my love to soothe her all the time
I'll be glad to have her know that she's mine, all mine
But right now I'm lookin' for a love
Let tell you
Lookin' for a love
Woo-oo
I'm lookin' here and there
And I'm searching everywhere
And I'm lookin', I'm lookin', I'm lookin', I'm lookin'
Oh, I'm lookin' for a love to call my own
Well, I'm goin' lookin'
