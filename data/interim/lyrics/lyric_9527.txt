I hear the sound
Sweet summer music
When school is out
Living is music
Playing in the park
Daring in the dark
A kiss then it starts
The sound of music
It gets sunny so soon
I can't wait till June
To sing that summer tune
Sweet summer music
Sweet summer music
She'll come around
Brings me up when I'm down
With a smile on her face
Winter's cold could not erase
Warm summer breezes
Set my mind at ease
All this comes without a trace
And I know there's no time to waste
It gets sunny so soon
I can't wait till June
To sing that summer tune
Sweet summer music
Sweet summer music
Summer gets cool
Autumn's in view
We'll be singing this tune
Summer ended too soon
Warm summer breezes
Set my mind at ease
All this comes without a trace
And I know there's no time to waste
It gets sunny so soon
I can't wait till June
To sing that summer tune
Sweet summer music
Sweet summer music
Sweet summer music 
Sweet summer music 
Sweet summer music...
