Dooby-do yeah let's do this dance now
This dance started down in the sea
Now they're doing it on tv
All the way to the Pacific shore
Man it's the greatest dance you ever saw
Let's get up everybody and move your feet
Yeah my drummer's got a swinging beat
Everything is grooving people here's your chance
It's time for you to do this dance
It's the majestic the majestic do it the majestic the majestic yeah
Come on everybody take a tip from me
They even got the message down in Waikiki
Grab your partner and get on the ball
Every time you hear this call
Cause there is no more shimmy and no more bop
The kids in Philly stopped doing the slop
Everybody now looking just fine
It's the majestic the majestic do it the majestic the majestic yeah
All the way from Georgia to the Golden Gate
Kentucky Virginia and Dakota state
There even grooving in Chicago town
This dance is really getting 'round
Dance Dance People
