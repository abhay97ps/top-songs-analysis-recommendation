One, two, three, four it all started in Baltimore
A crazy couple on a crowded floor
It looked funny but it worked real neat
A little dance they called the Lover's Leap
Everybody go one, two, three four
Then you stomp the floor
Once again you go one, two, three, four
Then you let out a roar
Old time sweety, sweet
Keep in time with that solid beat
You bend your knees and set your feet
We're gonna do the Lovers Leap
Everybody go one, two, three four
Then you stomp the floor
Once again you go one, two, three, four
Then you let out a roar
Now the story goes in Washington
That all the kids are having lots of fun
Got a place they call the Dragon Inn
They do the leap from four to ten
Everybody go one, two, three four
Then you stomp the floor
Once again you go one, two, three, four
Then you let out a roar
Old time sweety, sweet
We're gonna do the Lovers Leap
Old time sweety, sweet
We're gonna do the Lovers Leap
We're gonna do the Lovers Leap
We're gonna do the Lovers Leap
