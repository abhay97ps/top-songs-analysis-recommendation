Lift me, won't you lift me
Above the old routine;
Make it nice, play it clean, jazzman
When the jazzman's testifyin'
A faithless man believes
He can sing you into paradise
Or bring you to your knees
It's a gospel kind of feelin'
A touch of Georgia slide
A song of pure revival
And a style that's sanctified
Jazzman, take my blues away;
Make my pain the same as yours
With every change you play
Jazzman, oh jazzman
When the jazzman's signifyin'
And the band is windin' low
It's the late night side of morning
In the darkness of his soul
He can fill a room with sadness
As he fills his horn with tears
He can cry like a fallen angel
When rising time is near
Jazzman take my blues away;
Make my pain the same as yours
With every change you play
Oh lift me, won't you lift me
With every turn around
Play it sweetly, take me down, oh jazzman
