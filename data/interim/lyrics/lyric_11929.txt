Sometimes lonely nights
Turn into sunny days
I never thought I'd feel this way
I never knew that you and I
Were meant to be in love
Oh, darling, you've always been around
To see me through
How was I to know
You'd make my dreams come true?
Time and time again we fall
Always on our own but now
We're friends in love
Hoping that we'll always
Still be friends in love
Strong when we're together
Darling, now we got forever and day
Don't you go away
Remember
Every time you cried
You came to me
Oh, much to my surprise
I found someone who could see
Through the night of loneliness
You were always there for me
We're friends in love
Hoping that we'll always
Still be friends in love
Strong when we're together
Darling, now we got forever and day
Don't you go away
You turn around
And looked my way
I can't say that it
Hasn't crossed my mind
I've loved you all along
Ah, and now we're leavin'
Yesterday behind
We'll never be alone, whoa
We're friends in love
Hoping that we'll always
Still be friends in love
Strong when we're together
Darling, now we got forever and day
Don't you go away
We're friends in love
Hoping that we'll always
Still be friends in love
Strong when we're together
Darling, now we got forever and day
Don't you go away
