I know your leaving I see the signs
Your going to walk out on this heart of mine
You'll never call me, you'll never write
You made your mind up and your gone tonight
If some rainy day your all alone
And feel like talking you can log me on
At www dot memory
I'll be waiting for you patiently
If you feel the need just click on me
At www dot memory
You won't even have to hold me
Or look into my eyes
You can tell me that you love me
Through your keyboard and wires
No you won't have to touch me
Or even take my hand
Just slide your little mouse around until you see it land
At www dot memory
I'll be waiting for you patiently
If you feel the need just click on me
At www dot memory
If you feel the need just click on me
At www dot memory
