I’ve always been a fighter
When bad times come around
I’m not gonna take it laying down
I won’t let it get me down
I’m gonna get back up
Stand my ground
I’m gonna show who’s boss
To everyone who’s watching
Fighting evil all around
I’m gonna run those bad guys
Out of town
Spreading love
When hate is taking over
I’m a superhero
I keep on fighting
There’s no way i’m
Laying down and dying
I’m Wonder Woman
I’m here to stay
If you can’t help me
Get out of my way
I’m a superhero
Ohh
A superhero
Ohh
Getting all the thoughs jobs done
I won’t ever need a gun
My bi heart is my secret weapon
You can always count on me
Save your kitchen from a tree
Do it all
And still have time for dinner
I’m a superhero
I keep of flying
There’s no way i’m leaving without trying
I’m Wonder Woman
I’m here to stay
If you can’t help me
Get out of my way
I’m a superhero
Ohh

Ohh
Call me when you’re crying

I’ll be there in time to save the day
I’m a superhero
I keep on fighting
There’s no way i’m
Laying down and dying
