I am the morning, you are the light
You make the morning such a beautiful thing
I am the green grass, you are the rain
Fall on me, make me grow
No-one will ever know
Fall on me make me grow again
I am the spirit, you are the light
You make the sun shine brighter, you make me smile
I am the water, you are the rose
Oh lady of the land
Come to me take my hand
Until tomorrow I'm your man
Step back in time dear Romeo she said
Step back in time please take me to your bed
Step back in time dear Romeo
My Juliet and take me home
I am the darkness, you are the night
You make the darkness such a beautiful thing
I am the mountain, you are the snow
Fall on me make me grow
No-one will ever know
Fall on me make me grow again
Step back in time dear Romeo she said
Step back in time please take me to your bed
Step back in time dear Romeo
My Juliet and take me
Step back in time dear Romeo she said
Step back in time dear now
Step back in time dear Romeo she said
Step back in time please take me to your bed
Step back in time dear Romeo
My Juliet and take me
Step back in time dear Romeo she said
Step back in time please take me to your bed
Step back in time dear Romeo
My Juliet and take me
Step back in time dear Romeo she said
Step back in time please take me to your bed
Step back in time dear Romeo
My Juliet and take me home
