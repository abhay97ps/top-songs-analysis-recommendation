GO!
I'm gonna wake you up early cause I'm gonna take a ride with you
We're goin' down to the Honda shop, I'll tell you what we're gonna do
Put on a ragged sweatshirt, I'll take you anywhere you want me to
Refrain:
First gear, it's all right 
Second geear, I'll lean right 
Third gear, hang on tight 
Faster, it's all right
It's not a big motorcycle
Just a groovy little motorbike
It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys
That two-wheeled bike
We'll ride on out of the town
To anyplace I know you like
Refrain
It climbs the hills like a Matchless
Cause my Honda' built really light
When I go in to the turns
Better hang on tight
I'd better turn on the lights
So we can ride my Honda tonight
Refrain
