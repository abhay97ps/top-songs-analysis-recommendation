Music holds the secret, to know it can make you whole
It's not just a game of notes, it's the sounds inside your soul
The magic of the melody runs through you like a stream
The notes that play flow through your head like a dream 
Like a dream
I sing this song for the common man, for the people in despair
I bring my song into the world and I sing it everywhere
The simple truth lies waiting here for everyone to share
So hold on and I will take you there
Hold on and I will take you there
The daily routine takes your soul, lost without a trace
It holds you down and turns you 'round and puts you in your place
Another day, another dollar, another pretty face
Another chance to lose yourself in the endless race
Hold on, hold on to your dreams
Hold on, even though it seems
Everyone around you has their little schemes
Listen to your heart, hold on to your dreams
Can't you feel the magic, feel it everywhere
Can't you hear the music, there's something in the air
There's a celebration deep within a song
Celebrate this feeling, you know it can't be wrong
Hold on, hold on to your dreams
Hold on, even though it seems
Everyone around you has their little schemes
Listen to your heart, hold on to your dreams
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Caught up in routine, you've got to break it
Time won't wait for us, we got to make it
Fate gives you the chance, you've got to take it
Take it
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
