I can't wait to get to school each day
And wait for you to pass my way
And bells start to ring
And angels start to sing
"Hey that's the girl for you
So what are ya gonna do?"
Hey little girl
I love you 
All I do is think of you
Day and night 
I can't get you off my mind
Thinking back 
All the time
I begin to take the long way home
Just so I can be alone
To think of how to say
My heart's here to stay
(Hey I'm in love with you
I think the world of you)
So won't you please, please be mine?
All I do is think of you 
Day and night 
I can't get you off my mind
Thinking about 
All the time
Oooooooh

I think the world of you 
Ooooooooooooh

Thinking about

All I do is think of you
Day and night

Thinking about

Sometimes
All I do is think of you
Day and night

Thinking about 
'Cause you know sometimes girl,
