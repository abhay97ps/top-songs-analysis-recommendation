If I had a dime for every time
I dreamed about you
I'll tell you no joke yes I'm really broke baby without you 
And oh ho ho
Tell me what should I do
When you tell me that you love me, darling
You said that you love me
And now you're actin' so strange
You said that you need me
If I saw you with somebody new, I'd be so helpless 
So tell me what are you gonna do, don't leave me breatless 
And oh ho ho
Tell me what should I do
When you tell me that you love me, darling
You said that you love me
Tell me what should I do
When you tell me that you love me, darling
You said that you love me
Now you're actin' so strange, baby
You said that you need me
