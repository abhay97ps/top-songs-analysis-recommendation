Friday night and the moon is high
I'm wide-awake just watching you sleep
And I promise you you're going to have
More than just the things that you need
We have not got much now, weâ€™re just starting out
But I know somehow paradise is coming
Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's going to shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life
Oh now there's a place for you and me
Where we can dream as big as the sky
I know it's hard to see it now
But baby someday we're going to fly
This road we're on, you know it might be long
But my faith is strong
It's all that really matters
Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life
So hold on, hold on
Come on baby, hold on
Yeah, we're gonna have it all
And ooh
Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life
Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life
Oh, a better life
Hey we're going to leave this all behind us baby, wait and see
We're headed for a better life, you and me
We're going to break the chains that bind and, finally we'll be free
We're going to be the ones that have it all, you and me
Just hold on tight now baby
