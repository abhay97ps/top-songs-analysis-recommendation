Whatever happens to all those butterflies inside
When you're running down the street to the arms that open wide
Where does love go?
Where does it fly?
We must find ourselves helplessly waiting to say goodbye
Remember the days spring was a state of mind
When you'd only touch my hand and I'd leave the world behind
Where does love go?
Why must it die?
Why must it end this way for you and I
Oh, darling, where does love go?
