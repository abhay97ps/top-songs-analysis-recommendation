I'm rolling down a lonely highway
Asking God to please forgive me
For messing up the blessing he gave to me
I see everything clearer now
The nights is black as, black as its ever been 
Without my girl, I'ma lose it
I pray that he would just shed his grace on me
I need just to be back with my baby, yeah
It feels like I just walked right out of Heaven
And it feels like I have damn near thrown my life away 
And I'm scared just like a child that's lost at seven 
Don't know what to do to get back right with you 
It feels like I just walked right out of Heaven
And it feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, yeah 
Like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do
Feels like I just walked right out of Heaven
See my mama told me that's if it's meant to be
She'll come back and she'll forgive me
And the best thing I can do is to just let her, let her go
I know, I don't wanna do it
But if I continue to push, she'll just pull away 
And I know that in my heart, it's a reality
I didn't treat her like she wanted to be treated
And I hope that she's not gone for good, no, no, no
It feels like I just walked right out of Heaven
And it feels like I have damn near thrown my life away 
And I'm scared just like a child that's lost at seven 
Don't know what to do to get back right with you 
It feels like I just walked right out of Heaven 
And it feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, yeah 
Like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do 
Feels like I just walked right out of Heaven 
Craving , craving for you all the time 
Suppose to move on with my life 
And, girl, I tried and I tried 
I feel like I can't walk 
I feel like I can't talk, girl 
I don't know what to do get back right with you
I feel like I just walked outta Heaven, baby
I feel like I can't walk
If you ever loved somebody
I feel like I can't talk, girl, ooh
And if you ever had somebody
But you know that you hurt that somebody
Know that in my heart, I just want you back, baby
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah
I feel like I just walked out of Heaven
It feels like I just walked right out of Heaven 
And it feels like I have damn near thrown my life away 
And I'm scared just like a child that's lost at seven 
Don't know what to do to get back right with you
