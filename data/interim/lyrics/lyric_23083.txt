Yeah, wait for a minute
Yeah, can you wait for a minute?
Yeah, wait for a minute
Wait for a minute, girl, just a minute
Well if you walk with me
Well if you take my hand babe
We can go to a place you ain't never seen before 
Woah
Slow dance in the moonlight 
I'm just tryna set the mood right 
I'm just doin' what I do
Do it over and over and over
Quickly, wanna run with me now?
Swiftly just come with me, now
Footsteps go to the beat, now
Over and over and over
It’s just the way that, the way that
The way that you do it, babe 
Well, I can say that, say that, say that I'd behave
But I'd be lyin', babe
Let's run away for a minute 
Away for a minute, babe 
Let's run away for a minute 
A dream place for a minute
Place for a minute, baby
Hol' up, I don't need no luck
I said that with a straight face, baby, that's poker
Feelin' lil sober, gotta mix it in my soda
I clean up good, a ropa dopa
Baby I'm the shh, but that's a good odor
I'm a young star, but my money look Yoda
Crib on the ocean, backyard boat shit
You hatin' on the internet, I couldn't even notice
Tickets, no service, we at the top workin'
Pop-pops is lurkin', told her "Don't get nervous"
I don't swerve Suburbans, this a gold derby
Ferarris and horses, I snap like tourist
No rug, I floor it, girl, come feel important
I'm all about a dollar, babe, banks call me Georgi
9-5 Rollie, 96 Kobe
Tonight we gon' ball like Ginobili, you know me
I'm just tryna...
Slow dance in the moonlight 
I'm just tryna set the mood right 
I'm just doin' what I do
Do it over and over and over
Quickly, wanna run with me now?
Swiftly just come with me, now
Footsteps go to the beat, now
Over and over and over
It’s just the way that, the way that
The way that you do it, babe 
Well, I can say that, say that, say that I'd behave
But I'd be lyin', babe 
Let's run away for a minute 
Away for a minute, babe 
Let's run away for a minute 
A dream place for a minute
Place for a minute, baby
Wait for a minute, yeah
Can you wait for a minute?
Yeah, wait for a minute
Wait for a minute
Baby girl, just a minute
Wait just a minute
Can you wait just a minute?
Baby girl, just a minute
Wait just a minute
Wait just a minute
Yeah, T-Raww, JB
Too fly, never stop
Know why?
