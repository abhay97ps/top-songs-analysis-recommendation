Hey
What's your favourite thing in the world ?
Fantastic ! Now tell me:
How much do you love me ?
Oh about this much. Mmm
Heavy !
Who's your Baby ?
Who's the one you love ?
You're the only one for me
Who's you dreaming of ?
You're the only one my eyes can see
An' let me say in ev'ry way you are dynamite
Do you know how good you really are ?
Please don't let her stray away
I pray each night
Can't stop now it's been - so good so far
Who's your Baby ?
Who's the one you love ?
You're the only one for me
Who's you dreaming of ?
You're the only one my eyes can see
Upon opening your eyes when morning comes
What's very first thing on your mind ?
If you had enough
Hey
Would you give me some
And would a thank you to you do you fine
Who's your baby in the mornin' ?
Who's your baby at night ?
Who do you want
When you want somebody to come
And hold you tight ?
