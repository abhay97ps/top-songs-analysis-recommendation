I had a hundred dollar ring in my hand
So weak and tired I could barely stand
From being up all night, praying she'd say yes
So with a hopeful heart I hit one knee
With a tear in her eye she looked at me
It was the moment of truth, I was scared to death
My life hung on what that tear meant
Then she smiled at me
And I lost it
No one can make me cry, make me laugh
Make me smile or drive me mad, like she does
It's like the curse that is the cure
Better or worse one thing's for sure
It's real love
And I don't know what I'd do
If I lost it
Well the honeymoon ended and life began
Jobs and bills losing touch with friends
And that apartment it got smaller everyday
Then one night the walls finally closed in
I came home late, She said, "Where've you been
You used to call and tell me you were on your way"
She said, "If this is how it's gonna be, then I quit"
Then she walked out the door
I lost it
No one can make me cry, make me laugh
Make me smile or drive me mad, like she does
It's like the curse that is the cure
Better or worse one thing's for sure
It's real love
And I don't know what I'd do
If I lost it
I picked myself up off the floor
She walked back through the door
We made love like it was the first time
No one can make me cry, make me laugh
Make me smile or drive me mad like she does
It's like the curse that is the cure
Better or worse one thing's for sure
It's real love
And I don't know what I'd do
If I lost it
Oh, if I lost it 
I don't wanna lose it
