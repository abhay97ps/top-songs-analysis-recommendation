Here we go!
Stop! In the name of love, before you break my heart {Free your mind}
Stop! In the name of love, before you break my heart
Think it over
I wear tight clothing, high heeled shoes
It doesn't mean that I'm a prostitute 
I like rap music, wear hip hop clothes
That doesn't mean that I'm out sellin' dope 
Before you can read me you gotta
Learn how to see me, I said
Stop! In the name of love, before you break my heart {Free your mind}
Stop! In the name of love, before you break my heart
Think it over
Free your mind and the rest will follow 
Be color blind, don't be so shallow
I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?
Before you can read me you gotta
Learn how to see me, I said
Stop! In the name of love, before you break my heart {Can't stop! Can't stop!}
Stop! In the name of love, before you break my heart {Before you break my heart and stop!}
Think it over
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow
 Free your mind and the rest will follow {Oohh, oh-oh-oh}
Be color blind, don't be so shallow {Don't break my, don't break my heart}
Stop!
Stop! 
Free your mind
Stop!
Free your mind
Stop! 
Before you can read me you gotta
Learn how to see me, I said
Stop!  In the name of love, before you break my heart  
Stop! In the name of love 
Before you break my heart 
Free your mind and the rest will follow  
Be color blind, don't be so shallow  {You got to be!}
Free your mind and the rest will follow  {Wo, oh oh!}
Be color blind, don't be so shallow  {Don't break my, don't break my heart}
Stop! In the name of love, 
Before you break my heart  {Free your mind}
Stop! In the name of love,  before you break my heart
Oh think it over
Free your mind
And the rest will stop!
