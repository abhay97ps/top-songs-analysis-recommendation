Oh, show me your love
Oh, show me your love
Oh, show me your love

It feels so good, knowing that you're mine
All I want is to have you all the time
Satisfaction, that's what I intend to do
Your devotion is all I need from you
My love for you grows stronger every day
In your arms is where I have to stay
I don't believe what my heart makes me feel
All I know it feels so real
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
Oh, show me your love

 If I believe in you
 If I believe in you
