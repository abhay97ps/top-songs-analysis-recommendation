Lady, would you mind if I politely kiss your hand?
I've been watchin' you all night and I can't stand
To see you all alone like this
You're giving me an opportunity I can't resist
I saw you standing from across the room
And I like to get to know you without being rude
So just take my hand and let's move on the floor
And if the chemistry is right then we will do so much more
But for now lady, would you mind if I politely kiss your hand?
I've been watchin' you all night and I can't stand
To see you all alone like this
You're giving me an opportunity I can't resist
I know my conversation is not boring you
'Cause when I look into your eyes, I see you want it, too
Don't make no misconception about my attitude
But when I feel the time is right, I'll get you in the mood
But for now, oh yeah, oh yeah
Lady, would you mind if I politely kiss your hand?
I've been watchin' you all night and I can't stand
To see you all alone like this
You're giving me an opportunity I can't resist
Lady, lady, lady, lady
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lady, kiss your hand
I've been watchin' you all night and I can't stand
To see you all alone like this
You're giving me an opportunity I can't resist
Lady, kiss your hand
I've been watchin' you all night and I can't stand
To see you all alone like this
You're giving me an opportunity I can't resist
Lady, kiss your hand
I've been watchin' you all night and I can't stand
To see you all alone like this
You're giving me an opportunity I can't resist
