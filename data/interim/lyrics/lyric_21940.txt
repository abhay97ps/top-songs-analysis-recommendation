When a woman loves
She, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
She took me back
After I broke her heart
About a thousand times
She gave her life to me
With no regrets, she followed me
And she, and she, the girl, she raised me
And I'm forever indebted
And I'm forever indebted
I'm forever indebted to her 'cause...
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real, oh
She filled my soul
With the very touch of her hand
She really did
And she’s got more, more faith in me than a beach got sand
And I'd like to tell her, I'd like to tell her
That I’m forever indebted
That I’m forever indebted
I’m forever indebted to her 'cause...
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real, yeah, yeah
See, a woman's love, it will never die, no
Even when I’m dead and gone
I’m gonna love her from the sky
'Cause she’s given me
Something that no other woman has given me
Woo-hoo, when I think about the girl, it makes me sing
When, when, when, when, when a
When a, woman, loves
She loves for real, oh
When a woman loves, loves, loves
I'm telling you when she loves
She, she loves for real, yeah
Woo-hoo

Oh, When she loves
