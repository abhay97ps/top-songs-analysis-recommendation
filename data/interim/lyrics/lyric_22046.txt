Oh yeah   
 Oh yeah   
So scared of breaking it
That you won't let it bend
Now I wrote two hundred letters
I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much
Deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up
I'd rather let them be
So let me be
And I'll set you free
I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me 
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me 
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
Your salty skin and how it
Mixes in with mine 
The way it feels to be
Completely intertwined 
It's not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know 
It's not what I didn't feel
It's )
So let me be
And I'll set you free
I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me 
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back 
You say your faith is shaken
You may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and
Waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
I'm getting there
I don't care where I have to go
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah
I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
