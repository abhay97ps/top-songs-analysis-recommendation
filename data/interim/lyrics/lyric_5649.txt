Morning girl
How'd you sleep last night?
You're several ages older now
Your eyes have started showin' how
The little girl's growin' now
Morning girl
Was that you last night?
Crying on the radio
Beggin' for a way to go
To go back where love
Wasn't jumbled so
Oh no, things are different now
Than they were before
You know love is more than kisses
A whole lot more
Morning girl
Put your dreams away
And read your box of Cheerios
And powder-puff that pretty nose
And go out and find your man
Where the wild wind blows
Morning girl
