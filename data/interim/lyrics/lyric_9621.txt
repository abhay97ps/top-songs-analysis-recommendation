Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doin' to me 
I have spent all my years in believin' you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord
Somebody 
Ooh, somebody 
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
Yeah
I work hard  every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end  I take home
My hard-earned pay all on my own
I get down  on my knees  and I start to pray 
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord
Somebody 
Ooh, somebody 
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
Oh
 everyday 
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
I got no common sense
 I got nobody left to believe
No, no, no, no
Ooh somebody
Ooh 
Anybody find me
Somebody to love
(Can anybody find me
Someone to love?)
Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losin' my beat 
I'm okay, I'm alright 
I ain't gonna face no defeat 
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
 Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love 
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love-ove-ove
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Somebody 
Somebody 
Somebody 
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
 Ooh
Find me somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody to love
Find me, find me
Find me, find me, find me
Ooh, somebody to love
Ooh, find me, find me
Find me somebody to love
Anybody, anywhere, anybody
Find me somebody to love, love
Find me, find me, find me, find me
