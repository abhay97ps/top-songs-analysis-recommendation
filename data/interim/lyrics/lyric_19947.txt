This is 24-karats but it shine like stainless
Just look at how the diamonds complement my fingers 
Yes indeed, shit chokin' me, woah, I need a breath to breathe
Chasin' with the Hennessy, now that's how a G play it

We ain't leavin' right now we on a positive vibe
But I still keep the homicide squad on the side
See how I'm holdin' on the steering wheel controllin' the ride
And y'all comin' out of park because I got it in drive

A hard worker like myself could afford that price

This not the right spot to let ya daughters visit
It's some freaks up in here and it's all explicit 
My round put me on ya just cause he won't hit it
Shit I hope you don't be trippin' on some 'be home'shit
Cause Jack ain't worried bout who Staci with
And he don't have to be puttin' up with Staci's shit 
I ain't lyin' sometimes when you cross my path
Up in the club all night and niggas stalk yo ass
