(Had to survive, livin' in the light
Have to stay alive, livin' in the light
Have to survive
Livin' in the light)
Hold the beat, stop the beat, drop the beat
Children of nature
From another culture
Had to survive
Livin' in the light
Stolen from the center 
Untimely departure
Somehow survived
Livin' in the light
(Had to survive, livin' in the light
Have to stay alive, livin' in the light
Had to survive
Livin' in the light)
Rootical subculture
Oh, the sound of the street dub-vendor
Knew you had to survive
Livin' in the light
Beautiful yet scattered
Through it all your spirit never shattered
Glad to stay alive
Livin' in the light 
 Oh, I, I, I , I, I
 Ohohohohoh
 Yes, in a light
 So bright, had to guide you home
 Children of nature
 Livin' in the light, yes
 Had to survive
 I, I, I, I, I
There's ways we can sometimes turn our wrong to right 
But some things we can never change
Things can be so fine
Livin' in the light
To those who know what I mean
And those who don't, I'll tell you
Follow good feeling through
And let the superficial pass you by, oh yeah
Livin' in the light, yeah, yeah
 Children of nature
 Livin' in the light, yes
 Had to survive
 I, I, I, I, I 
 Oh, I, I, I , I, I
 Livin' in the light, yes
 Had to survive
 I, I, I, I, I
Yeah 
Ow!
