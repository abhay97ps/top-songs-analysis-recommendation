I packed a cooler and a change of clothes
Let's jump in, see how far it goes
You got my heart in your daddy's boat
We've got all night to make it float
We could sit on the shore
We could just be friends
Or we could jump in
The whole world could change in a minute
Just one kiss could stop it spinning
We could think it through
But i don't want to, if you don't want to
We could keep things just the same
Leave here the way we came
With nothing to lose
But i don't want to, if you don't want to
I got your ring around my neck
And a couple of nights i don't regret
You've got a dream of a degree and a shirt that smells like me
Yeah we both got dreams
We could chase alone
Or we could make our own
The whole world could change in a minute
Just one kiss could stop it spinning
We could think it through
But i don't want to, if you don't want to
We could keep things just the same
Leave here the way we came
With nothing to lose
But i don't want to, if you don't want to
Never waste another day wondering what you threw away
Holding me, holding you
I don't want to, if you don't want to
We could keep things just the same
Leave here the way we came with nothing to lose
But i don't want to, if you don't want to
But i want to
But i want you
