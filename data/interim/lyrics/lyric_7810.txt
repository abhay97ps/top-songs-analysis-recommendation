Look at us today
We ain't got nothin' nice to say
We've got our hands up in the air
Expecting miracles from somewhere
And the words, we don't pay no attention
And the good in us all we don't mention
We need more love music, we sure can use it
To turn those people on
We need more love music, my heart approves it
Before the beat is gone
Droppin' down the street
No happy faces do you meet
And all those promises that we made
Are soon forgotten or mislaid
When the spirit, people, is dying
And the time pretty prices are trying
We need more love music, we sure can use it
To turn those people on
We need more love music, my heart approves it
Before the beat is gone
A little music never hurt no one
Gotta be a song for every mother's son
So believe your heart can hum
Well, let me tell you where I'm comin' from
We need more love music, we sure can use it
To turn those people on
We need more love music
We need more love music
We need more love music, we sure can use it
To turn those people on
We need more love music, the heart approves it
Before the beat is gone
We need more, we need more love
We need more love, yeah
We need more love music
We need more love music
We need more love music
