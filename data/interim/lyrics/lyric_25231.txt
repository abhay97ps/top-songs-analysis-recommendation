Bang outside, I hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside
Bang outside, I hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside
Bang outside, hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside
Bang outside, hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside
13, got my first stripe, nigga 
Glenwood Road, where they shiest', nigga
Slaughter Gang so I keep a knife, nigga
We was broke so all we ate was rice, nigga
Paid the J's to cut on my mama's lights, nigga
Come get your bitch, she tryna spend the night, nigga 
You a bitch, that make her a dyke, nigga 
All these bodies, I can't sleep at night, nigga
Y'all must thought that I was gon' whisper the whole time 
I ran out of weed, I sent your bitch out of town 
Gave her fifteen hundred and she came back with pounds 
Rappers think they it, but they really just clowns 
Gucci store, a hundred thou', that's just in a day 
Always cheatin', I'm a dog, think I need a cage 
Savage loaded, chips and dip, I'm not talkin' 'bout Lays 
Throwback Rafs, call 'em retros, I'm not talkin' 'bout J's 
First name 21, last name Hefner, I got too many freaks 
Levi jeans, low self-esteem, he on BlackPeopleMeet 
Look like MÃ½a, she's on fire, who got the keys to my Jeep? 
Who want smoke 'cause I want smoke, I had a wet dream about beef 
Bang outside, hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside
Bang outside, I hang outside
Don't come out the house 'cause the gang outside
Kids see my car, they get to playin' Bingo 
Off-brand rappers stealin' all the lingo 
Thirty on my hip, the label want a single 
I green light hits, I don't make jingles 
Shut your damn mouth 'fore you drop, nigga 
Last nigga dissed me, he dropped, nigga 
I want smoke, nigga, all, nigga 
Savage kill all of his opps, nigga 
Smoke the mall last week, ball nigga 
Slaughter Gang, yeah, we brawl, nigga 
4L Gang, lot of shots, nigga
Savage kill all of his opps, nigga 
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
