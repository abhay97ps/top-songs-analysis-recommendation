Mama.  I want to ask you something
Yeah?
Mama if I meet a real fine boy
And he says that I'm his pride and joy
Or if he walks me in the 
Oh and he say he want to hold me tight
What might I say, mama, oh tell me what must I say? ?
Tell him no, girl, tell that man
Tell him no make him understand
Unless he’s got a preacher in his plans
Tell him no, you better tell him no
But mama if he say he loves me so
And he say he'll never let me go
Or if he tell me that tonight's the night
And that he’s gonna make me see the light
What must I say, oh tell me, mama, what must I say?
Tell him no girl and take my advice
Keep his hands off the merchandie
Unless he's thinking about  and rice
Tell him no, you better tell him no
Supposin he's fine
Girl I hate to see you cryin
If he go he won't come back
There's another train moving on the very same track
But maybe maybe I can't let him go
Or maybe when he stay I feel that glow
If I tell him no with all my might
Oh still he say he want to hold me tight
What must I say, mama oh tell me what must I say
Tell him no girl and play your part
Don't want to see you with a broken heart
Or get the ring from the romance scar
Tell him no you better tell him no
Tell him no, girl, tell him no
Tell him no, girl, tell him no
Tell him no, girl, tell him no
