It's something about her you know that
The way she cares of herself, she's just so bad
Ooh, I dont know
Her style, her mind compares
To nothing on this earth
She's not the kind to share
Only God know what she's worth
I gotta show her that I want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing
I gotta show her that I want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing
Her eyes, her smile, her skin
Her smell, her hair 
Her walk, her talk, her way her savoir faire
There she goes, there she goes
I hope to find her there
Gotta make some eye contact
She's not the kind to stare
Move quick or lose her fast
I gotta show her that I want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing
I gotta show her that I want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing
Her eyes, her smile, her skin
Her smell, her hair 
Her walk, her talk, her way, her savoir faire
There she goes, there she goes, ooh
Her eyes, her smile, her skin
Her smell, her hair 
Her walk, her talk, her way, her savoir faire
There she goes 
Spending all my time watchin' that girl go 
Gotta love the way she moves 
Spending all my time watchin' that girl go 
Gotta love the way she moves
Her eyes, her smile, her skin
Her smell, her hair 
Her walk, her talk, her way, her savoir faire
There she goes 
Her eyes, her smile, her skin
Her smell, her hair 
Her walk, her talk, her way, her savoir faire
There she goes 
Her eyes, her smile, her skin
Her smell, her hair 
Her walk, her talk, her way, her savoir faire
There she goes 
Spending all my time watchin' that girl go 
Gotta love the way she moves 
Spending all my time watchin' that girl go 
Watch her go, watch her go
Gotta love the way she moves 
I got to show her that I want her
Spending all my time watchin' that girl go
If I can't have her, then I'll go crazy
Gotta love the way she moves
I got to show her that I want her
Spending all my time watchin' that girl go
If I can't have her, then I'll go crazy
Gotta love the way she moves
I got to show her that I want her...
If I can't have her, then I'll go crazy...
I got to show her that I want her...
