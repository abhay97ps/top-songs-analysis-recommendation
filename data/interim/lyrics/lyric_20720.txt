Looks like everybody's here
Had to put some foldin' chairs in the vestibule
Yeah, it's gettin' full
Even old Aunt Ruby came
Her first time on an airplane
It's her sister's girl
She wouldn't miss it for the world
Pre Chorus
And all them kids jumpin' in the pews
And Mr. Charlie in his lime-green suit
'Is a handsome man'
Remarks Widow Callahan
Uncle Joe and Uncle Jake
Haven't spoken since '98
Just said, 'Hello'
It's a good day to let it go
Chorus
So let the angels gather
Let the music play
Let the preacher get to preachin' all the "do you take"'s
Love is a beautiful thing
Throw the rice in the air
Let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of that limosine
Love is a beautiful thing
2nd Verse
Daddy's waitin' with the bride
Yeah, she helps him with his tie
She sees a tear
He says, 'Man, it's hot in here' hmm
He hugs his little girl and asks
'How did you grow up so fast?
God, I wish your Momma could be here for this'
Pre Chorus
And everybody stands and smiles
As she goes walkin' down the aisle
In her Momma's gown
And Daddy breaks on down
Gran and Gramps in the second row
Stood right there fifty years ago
And said their vows
Yeah, I guess it's workin' out
Bridge
A little table full'a gifts
Catering's covered dish
And the wedding band
Well, that's on her hand
And Tommy's teasin' Lorelei
He pushed her down and made her cry
And neither one knows
A day will come
Tag Chorus
When the angels gather
And the music plays
And the preacher gets to preachin' all the "do you take"'s
Love is a beautiful thing
Throw the rice in the air
Let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of that limosine
Love
Two people in love is a beautiful thing
