I can't get
No, I can't get
No, I can't get you out of my mind
I can't get
No, I can't get
No, I can't get you out of my mind
Now when I wake up in the morning
You know you make my temperature rise
You're like a summer breeze
You got me beggin' please
Can you see it when you look in my eyes?
So you think you can handle my body
But do you think you can handle my mind?
I'm thinking you and me, a pure fantasy
I can give you, baby, more than a sign
Anything you want now, baby
Anything you need
Show no shame, just call my name
Yes, I got what you need
Anyplace you want me, baby
Take me anytime
You and me, pure ecstasy
Can't get you off my mind
I can't get
No, I can't get
No, I can't get you out of my mind
I can't get
No, I can't get
No, I can't get you out of my mind
Now when I wake up in the morning
You know exactly what I got on my mind
Touch me anywhere
Because you know I don't care
So come on, baby, work me all through the night
So you say that you can freak my body
I know you think that you control my mind
But ,baby, soon you'll see that you are owned by me
My decision was for you to be mine
Anything you want now, baby
Anything you need
Show no shame, just call my name
Yes, I got what you need
Anyplace you want me, baby
Take me anytime
You and me, pure ecstasy
Can't get you off my mind
I can't get
No, I can't get
No, I can't get you out of my mind
I can't get
No, I can't get
No, I can't get you out of my mind
Anything you want now, baby
Anything you need
Show no shame, just call my name
Yes, I got what you need
Anyplace you want me, baby
Take me anytime
You and me, pure ecstasy
Can't get you off my mind
I can't get
No, I can't get
No, I can't get you out of my mind
I can't get
No, I can't get
No, I can't get you out of my mind
