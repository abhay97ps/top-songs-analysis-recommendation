How could you let me go
The way we've been getting on
I didn't see no sign of trouble
All of a sudden, you're gone
How was I meant to know
I left you alone too long
I never thought you needed
All of that talking
But I could be wrong
And Sara, I'll never forget your name
The woman is gone
But the feeling is here to stay
Sara, the melody will remain
Though you'll be gone
Before the sun goes down
Sara tearing apart
The heart you turned around
How could you let me go
And whittle your dreams away
I didn't see you leaving me
Give me a moment to say
How can I let you know
I'm willing to give it all
I'll gather your tears
From all of the years
And catch 'em whenever they fall
I'll catch you whenever you fall
Sara, I'll never forget your name
The woman is gone
But the feeling is here to stay
Sara, stay
The melody will remain
Though you'll be gone
Before the sun goes down
Sara, I'll never forget your name
The woman is gone
But the feeling is here to stay
Sara, stay
Though you'll be gone
Before the sun goes down
Sara, tear apart
The heart you turned around
How could you let me go
