It's a bird, no
It's a plane, no
It's Superman
Superman, you make me feel
I'm the queen of the world
Superman, you make me feel so special
When you move me up and down, and round
You get so deep inside and wow
You warm me up, it's super then
I wanna shout again and again
Superman, I love you, Superman
Do it to me, Superman
I love it, Superman
Superman, I love you, Superman
Do it to me, Superman
I need it, Superman
Superman, I love you, Superman
Do it to me, Superman
I love it, Superman
It's a bird, no
It's a plane, no
It's Superman
Superman, you make me feel
I'm the queen of the world
Superman, you make me feel so special
When you move me up and down, and round
You get so deep inside and wow
You warm me up, it's super then
I wanna shout again and again
Superman, I love you, Superman
Do it to me, Superman
I love it, Superman
Superman, love my Superman
Do it to me, Superman
I need it, Superman
Give it to me, Superman
