It's easy to love when I love someone like you
It's easy to feel when you feel the way I do
You know love don't come easy and love don't come fast
But when love comes to you, you gotta make it last
On the day that I met you, I knew it could be
So easy for you and so easy for me
It's easy to love when I love someone like you babe
It's easy to feel when you feel the way I do babe
Like the stars in the night seem to shine from above
But that's the way I love to shine when you give me your love
And your love satisfies me like a natural high
From the soles of my feet to the top of the sky
It's easy to love when I love someone like you
It's easy to feel when you feel the way I do
You know love don't come easy, and love don't come fast
But when love comes to you, you gotta make it last
On the day that I met you, I knew it would be
So easy for you and so easy for me
It's easy to love when I love someone like you babe
It's easy to feel when you feel the way I do babe
It's easy to love when I love someone like you babe
It's easy to love, it's easy to love
Yeah so easy to love, yeah so easy to love
Yeah so easy to love
