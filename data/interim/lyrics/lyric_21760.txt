What do you say girl, we do something crazy
Quit putting it off, you know what I'm saying
Ain't like it ain't going to happen, forever's a given
It's already written
Who we kidding baby, come on
The stars can't line up any straighter
Let's do it now and think about it later
Why wait another minute
For something we should'a done yesterday?
I know a little church
With a preacher who could hook us up right away
Love don't need a reason
Baby I don't see how I could love you anymore than I do today
So why wait
Now I love your mama, let's save her some trouble
And your daddy won't mind if we save him a bundle
Girl it just so happens, that ring that you wanted
Well guess what I bought it
It's in my pocket baby, come on
Let's get it done, let's get it on your left hand
This is me, girl, popping the question
Why wait another minute
For something we should'a done yesterday?
I know a little church
With a preacher who could hook us up right away
Love don't need a reason
Baby I don't see how I could love you anymore than I do today
So why wait
Let's do something crazy
Because crazy's what you make me
Why wait another minute
For something we should'a done yesterday?
I know a little church
With a preacher who could hook us up right away
Love don't need a reason
Baby I don't see how I could love you anymore than I do today
So why wait
What do you say girl we do something crazy
