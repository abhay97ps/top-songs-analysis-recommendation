Pee-rac-ti-cal-I-ty de-us-n't int'rest me
Love the life that I lead
I've got a pocketful of miracles
And with a pocketful of miracles
One miracle a day is all I need!
Tree-rou-bles, more or less
Bee-ah-ther me, I guess when the sun doesn't shine
But there's a pocketful of miracles
The world's a bright and shiny apple that's mine, all mine
I hear sleigh bells ringing, smack!
I go around like there's a snow around
I feel so good, it's Christmas every day!
Lee-ife's a carousel, fee-ar as I can tell
And I'm riding for free
So if you're down and out of miracles
I've got a pocketful of miracles
And there'll be miracles enough for you, and me
Kids Choir: I hear sleigh bells ringing
Frank: Smack in the middle of May, I go around like theres snow
Around
Kids Choir: I feel so good its Christmas every day
Frank: Lee-ifes a carousel, fee-ar as I can tell, and i'm ridin' for free
Kids Choir: I've got a pocketful of miracles
Frank: But if I had to pick a miracle, my favorite miracle of all is you love
Me
