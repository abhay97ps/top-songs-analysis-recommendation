Sun is up, day is on
Look for me, I'll be gone
'Cause today's the day
I'm gonna see him again
He's an Indian cowboy in the rodeo
And I'm just another little girl who loves him so
He's an Indian cowboy in the rodeo
And I'm just another little girl who loves him, so-woah-woah-oh
Once he stopped and talked to me
I found out how dreams can be
With a big wide smile
And a big white hat
He's an Indian cowboy in the rodeo
And I'm just another little girl who loves him so
He's an Indian cowboy in the rodeo
And I'm just another little girl who loves him, so-woah-woah-oh
The sun is up, the day is on
Look for me, mama I'll be gone
'Cause today's the day
I'm gonna see him again
He's an Indian cowboy in the rodeo
And I'm just another little girl who loves him so
He's an Indian cowboy in the rodeo
And I'm just another little girl who loves him, so-woah-woah-oh
