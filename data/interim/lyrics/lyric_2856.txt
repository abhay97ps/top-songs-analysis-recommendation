There's a dance goin' 'round they call the eighty-one 
Everybody's doin' it whether they are old or young 
Because you're tired of doin' the monkey 
Tired of doin' the swim
So, if you wanna have some fun
Come on and dance, dance, dance
Do the 81 
'Cause it's so fun 
In a big boss line 
Let's do it one more time! 
My momma said she's gonna buy herself some dancin' shoes 
And all you need is to feel the beat to get with the groove 
Well, it's better than the cha-cha 
Better than the swim
Everybody, come, join in
And dance, dance, dance
Do the 81 
'Cause it's so fun 
In a big boss line 
Let's do it one more time! 
I know you're tired of doin' the monkey 
Tired of doin' the swim
So come along and join the fun
And dance, dance, dance
Do the 81 
'Cause it's so fun 
In a big boss line 
Let's do it one more time! 
Do the 81 
'Cause it's so fun 
In a big boss line 
Let's do it one more time! 
'Cause it's so fun 
In a big boss line
