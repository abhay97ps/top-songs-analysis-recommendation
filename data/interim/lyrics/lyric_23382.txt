I just spent three nights in a two night town
Sun's coming up and I’m just going down
Am I ever gonna turn my life around
I just spend three nights in a two night town
It was women, it was sinning, it was alcohol
It was everything the Bible says will make a man fall
And I didn’t wanna little lord I wanted it all
It was women, it was sinning, it was alcohol
When am I, ever gonna learn to walk away
When the chips are down and the cards ain't falling my way
Why do I, always gotta stay to long 'til it’s too late
I just spend three nights in a two night town
With a bunch of lost souls out tryna get found
Girl I’ve been a little crazy since you walked out
So I just spend three nights in a two night town
That's right
When am I, ever gonna learn to walk away
When the chips are down and the cards ain't falling my way
Why do I, always gotta stay to long 'til it’s too late
I just spend three nights in a two night town
Suns coming up and I’m just going down
But baby this pain is still hanging around
I think I’ll spend four nights in a two night town
