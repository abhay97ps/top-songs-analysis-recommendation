All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I've been for a walk 
On a winter's day 
I'd be safe and warm 
If I was in L.A. 
California dreamin' (California dreamin'
On such a winter's day)
Stopped into a church
I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees 
And I pretend to pray 
You know the preacher likes the cold 
He knows I'm gonna stay 
California dreamin' (California dreamin'
On such a winter's day)
All the leaves are brown 
And the sky is gray 
I've been for a walk 
On a winter's day 
I'd be safe and warm 
If I was in L.A. 
California dreamin' (California dreamin'
On such a winter's day)
