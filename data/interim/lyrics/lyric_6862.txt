I'm spinning around in a whirlpool
I'm walking on cloud nine
I'm just about to blow my cool
If I don't unwind
I'm spinnin' around
Spinnin' around
Spinnin' around
Spinnin' around
I must be falling in love, baby
I must be falling in love
'Round and around and around
I'm spinnin' around, I can't stop
I've lost my self-control
I'm spinnin' around 'til I drop
I'm whipped down to the soul
I'm spinnin' around
Spinnin' around
Spinnin' around
Spinnin' around
I must be falling in love, baby
I must be falling in love
Turning around 
I'm upside-down 
Like a ferris wheel
The wind will blow my mind
The wind will blow my mind
Won't let me stop
Spinnin' around
Spinnin' around
Spinnin' around
Spinnin' around
I must be falling in love, baby
I must be falling in love, I'm falling
I must be falling in love, baby
