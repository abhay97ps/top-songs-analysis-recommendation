The big cold city
Was such a lonely place to be
Hustle all day
And dream of the islands and sea
Millions of girls but none of them seemed right for me
'Till you came along and you touched me
And set me free
So we slipped away last night
Eased on down to the Cay
Flying so high we hitched a ride on a Gulf Stream breeze
Living on love and the fruits from tropical trees
With a song in our hearts and our eyes on the West Indies
It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away 'till the sunrise
Seeing that "I love you" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise
A bottle of rum
Listening to the steel drum band
Laughing in the moonlight
Along the beach we ran
Splashing naked in the sea making love upon the sand
Falling fast asleep like children hand in hand
It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away 'till the sunrise
Seeing that "I love you" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise
I woke up this morning
With the sunlight in my eyes
Guess it was only a dream
I hear the city outside
But I look at you sleeping
And honey now I realize
That anywhere with you
Is paradise
It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away 'till the sunrise
Seeing that "I love you" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise
It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away 'till the sunrise
Seeing that "I love you" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise
It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away 'till the sunrise
Seeing that "I love you" look
