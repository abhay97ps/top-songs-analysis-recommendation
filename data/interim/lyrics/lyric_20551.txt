Hey batter, batter, hey batter, batter swing
I've got to just do my thing
Hey batter, batter, hey batter, batter swing
Yeah
I'll show you that it's one and the same
Baseball, dancing, same game
It's easy, step up to the plate, start swingin'
I wanna play ball now and that's all, this is what I do
It ain't no dance that you can show me, yeah
You'll never know if you never try
There's just one little thing that stops me every time, yeah
Come on, I don't dance
I know you can, not a chance, no
If I could do this well, you could do that
But I don't dance, hit it out of the park
I don't dance, I say you can
There's not a chance
Slide home, you score
Swingin' on the dance floor, I don't dance, no
Hey, batter, batter, hey batter, batter swing
I've got to just do my thing
Hey, batter, batter, hey batter, batter swing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Two steppin', now you're up to bat
Bases loaded, do your dance
It's easy
Take your best shot, just hit it
I've got what it takes, playin' my game
So you better spin that pitch
You're gonna throw me, yeah
I'll show you how I swing
You'll never know if you never try
There's just one little thing that stops me every time, yeah
Come on, I don't dance
I know you can, not a chance, no, no
If I could do this well, you could do that
But I don't dance, hit it out of the park
I don't dance, I say you can
There's not a chance, oh no
Slide home, you score
Swingin' on the dance floor, I don't dance, no
Lean back, tuck it in, take a chance
Swing it out, spin around, do the dance
I wanna play ball, not dance hall
I'm makin' a triple, not a curtain call
I can prove it to you till you know it's true
'Cause I can swing it, I can bring it to the diamond too
You're talkin' a lot, show me what you got
Stop, swing
Hey, come on, swing it like this
Oh, swing, jitterbug, just like that
That's what I mean, that's how you swing
You make a good pitch but I don't believe
I say you can, I know I can't, I don't dance
You can do it, I don't dance, no
Nothin' to it, atta boy, atta boy, yeah
Hey, batter, batter, hey batter, batter what?
One, two, three, four, everybody swing
Come on, I don't dance
I know you can, not a chance, no, no
If I could do this well, you could do that
But I don't dance, hit it out of the park
I don't dance, I say you can
There's not a chance, oh
Slide home, you score
Swingin' on the dance floor, I don't dance, no
