Prolly heard I was broke from a broke nigga 
Prolly heard I'm a ho from a ho
I don't know what you know
I ain't runnin' from no nigga 
These bitches be waitin' in line after shows
I don't want fuck with her, let my bro hit her 
I'm the first one to come out of Charlotte 
Niggas know I put on for that four, nigga
'Bout to buy a new Lambo, let's go, nigga 
Tired of sellin' them zips, get a 'bow, nigga 
Me and Da used to post at the store 
Gucci Mane in '06, swing my door, nigga 
I told her I keep hearin' voices 
Why he rich and he keep wearin' Forces? 
These niggas, they lactose-intolerant 
Bitch, I'm married to cheese, no divorcin'
Bitch, you can't get a ring if you want it
I pull up with a bitch that's so thick, think I'm Norbit 
I'm slammin' the ho like I'm O'Neal 
She want money for pussy, bitch, no deal 
You can bet if I fuck, it's a freebie 
Bitches pay VIP just to see me 
I'm a shark, he a shrimp, nigga, peewee 
Fuck a rapper, I spit on his CD 
Bitch ass nigga
Prolly heard I was broke from a broke nigga 
Prolly heard I'm a ho from a ho

Niggas know I put on for that four, nigga 
I'm still in the city, bitch, no doubt 
Gotta give me six figures to go out 
I count up fifty K for a walk-through 
He try me at my show, we gon' show out 
I just left the club with your ho, fucked her right on the floor 
Say I fucked up her blowout 
My bad, boo, I thought that was weave
Orange juice, the first nigga try me, I squeeze 
Before I fucked her, fucked a few of her friends
Can you tell her stop callin' me, please? 
Bitches know I'm a dog off the leash
A big dawg, niggas call me "OG" 
Crossed that line with us, he can't come back and say, "Sorry"
My city, they call that a plea
Let these rap niggas lie like it's sweet
I'm from Charlotte, you die when it's beef, nigga
Prolly heard I was broke from a broke nigga 
Prolly heard I'm a ho from a ho
