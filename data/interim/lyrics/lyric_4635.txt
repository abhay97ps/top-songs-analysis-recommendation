I didn't cry
I just stood and watched her say goodbye
She closed the door
Said "I don't want to see you anymore"
Things I should have said to her
That maybe would have changed her mind to stay
Things I should have said to her
Like "Girl, I love you so let love find a way"
Was it that she
Just couldn't understand a man like me?
Was I to blame
Did I leave too many things unexplained?
Things I should have said to her
That maybe would have changed her mind to stay
Things I should have said to her
Like "Girl, I love you so let love find a way"
Oh, why didn't I try telling her
She was all I had
Why didn't I try telling her?
Now she's gone, and I feel oh so bad
But I didn't try
I just stood and watched her say goodbye
She closed the door
Said "I don't want to see you anymore"
 Oh
Things I should have said to her 
Things I should have said to her 
Things I should have said to her
