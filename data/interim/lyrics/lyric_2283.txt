I walk down this old lonely street
No one seems to wanna speak
Oh, who cares, yes, who cares
For poor, poor me
(Who, who cares
Who, who cares)
All the world seem cold
Everything is gray
Nothing seems the same
Since you went away
Oh, who cares, yes, who cares
For me 
Surely happiness can be found
Surely someone for me
Must I go through life
With this hopeless love
Oh, why can't I be set free
All I want is you 
All I know is you 
But somehow our 
Love just can't be 
Oh, who cares, yes, who cares
For me 
Surely happiness can be found
Surely someone for me
Must I go through life
With this hopeless love
Oh, why can't I be set free
All I want is you 
All I know is you 
But somehow our 
Love just can't be 
Oh, who cares, yes, who cares
For me 
I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave his town
I'm going to the river
Jump overboard and drown
Whoa, oh
...
