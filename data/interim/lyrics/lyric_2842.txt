The $oljaz still the best you know that we next
You sitting in my spot but I called seat check
They tried to say I'm trash and they tired to call me out but it didn't come thru like they on reject
Niggas still talkin shit like I won't body them

Burning shit up but I ain't fuckin up the O-zone
Eating rappers they edilble
Medical, smoking on that I'm incredible
The coldest nigga ever I'm Frozone
Most likely these niggas don't like me as it might seem
But I'm getting cold money, ice cream, I'm Coldstone
They dont got the testicles, get to the point like decimals
They vegetables put em on them pagers, old phones
Oh Lord
I told them niggas not to sleep on me
Them niggas really started counting sheep on me
Came from the bottom to the top now niggas sour cause they thought that everything was sweet homie
Oh man, I'm Conan, I'm dope man
Dont choke man, hang these niggas up like coat stands

Yo hoe give me brain like she don't know shit
Yall niggas still spittin old shit
Tellin Tales From the Heart, that  Edgar Allen Poe shit
Pullin Up Ready to Get Even, this my purge
This elbow put you out for the season, goodbye Serge
This may be World Peace if you actin hard and all 
Throw a bullet and them wide receivers gonna catch the ball like
Catch the ball, catch em all at the mall
They running shocked like they doing track in awe
Track em all, at em all
And I still wish a nigga would like I  found the last Dragon Ball
Im on my grind a nigga bout to hit a  heel flip
Black boy ballin on my Lil Bill shit
Put u Christians in a cage, hit you with the Unprettier

Disarm you so you ain't got no hold
Then put this arm around yo neck like a chokehold nigga
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit

Niggas about that action, nigga  its do or die
Need to kill yaself commit a mass.suicide
Ain't nothing between you and I
I ain't Tracy McGrady cause yall niggas ain't movin I
To the left to the left, nigga  im moving right

And niggas talkin shit but scared to say it with they chest out
Niggas sayin that the team stoppin
Nigga we got 2014 popping
All.Day.I.Dream.About.Smoking., A$$hole, and Forever Chicago nigga the whole team droppin
Ain't nobody fuckin with them $oljaz nigga
Nobody fuckin with SMB either
I am yo father no Maury Polvich nigga
The best singer after Ray Charles I can't see niggas
That was one of my childish moments
But im back in the game, one more foul im in the bonus
Now im shootin free throws with the game on the line
I missed one grabbed the rebound now im callin the time
Now we discussin who takin the shot
Meanwhile im lookin up at the time on the clock
Im bout to explain to coach how much time that we got
They all said C-Note you shootin whether u make it or not
Deezy inbound it to Plug, then Plug pass it to Star
And star pass it back to Deezy and im like look at the top
They give the ball back to Plug then Plug call my name
He dime me and I hit the shot that won us the game, the catch up
