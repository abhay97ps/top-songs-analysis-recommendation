I got a date tonight with such a sweet little innocent thing
I'll sweep her off her feet before she knows what's happening
I'm gonna hand her  my sweet-talkin' line
I know it kills her  every time
She's gonna love me from the start
And then I'm gonna break her heart
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
This is your conscience speaking
Be kind and sentimental
Treat her tenderly
'Cause if you're not a gentleman
You're gonna hear from me
And if she loves you from the very start
Now listen, Jimmy
I'm tellin' you, you'd better not break her heart
No, no, no, n-no, no, no
Oh, yes, I will
Oh, no, you won't
Yes, I will
No, you won't
Oh, yes, I will, yes, I will, yes, I will
I'm just a big, bad wolf, I know tonight I'll be lookin' so good
She'll be a helpless child just like a Little Red Riding Hood
I'm gonna charm her  right into a trance
I know she'll never  stand a chance
She's gonna love me from the start
And then I'm gonna break her heart
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
This is your conscience speaking
Be kind and sentimental
Treat her tenderly
'Cause if you're not a gentleman
You're gonna hear from me
And if she loves you from the very start
Now listen, Jimmy
I'm tellin' you, you'd better not break her heart
No, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, yes, I will
Oh, no, you won't
Yes, I will
No, you won't
Yes, I will, yes, I will, yes, I will
Now listen, Jimmy
You'd better not break her heart
But I'm a lover
You'd better not break her heart
Man, my reputation
You'd better not break her heart
Now, now you listen
You'd better not break her heart
