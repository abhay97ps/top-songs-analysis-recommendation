When the kisses get so long that you can't catch your breath
And the huggin' gets so strong that it's gotcha scared to death
Most people get married 
That's what they do-o-o
Most people get married 
And that's what I wanna do with you
When you only wanna walk  together
Only wanna talk  together
Only wanna touch  too much
You never wanna say "Good night"
Most people get married 
That's what they do-o-o
I-I-I wanna get married 
An' I only wanna do it to you
When you light up like a flame each time your baby calls
And the way he says your name has gotcha climbin' walls
Most people get married 
That's what they do-o-o
Most people get married 
And that's what I wanna do with you
When you're feelin' in your heart , what I feel
Reelin' in your heart  like I reel
An' you wanna shout  "Look out
Somethin's gotta give tonight"
Most people get married 
That's what they do-o-o
I-I-I wanna get married 
An' I only wanna do it to you
I-I-I wanna get married
An' I hope you wanna do it, too
