Well, I'm a day at a time
I'm a day at a time
Well, I'm a seeker and knower
In a six man mind
'Cause I'm a travelin' man
Yes, I'm a travelin' man
Well, I'm a comer and a goer
In a six man band
Well, I'm a California man
My instrument in hand
I'm electrified
On a fast flyin' trip
Dirty laundry in my grip
Mostly drip-dry
We got the seventeen jewels
That dictate the rules
And the time to fly
As we're passin' by
We just got the time to say hello
And then a fast goodbye
I'm a travelin' man
Yes, I'm a travelin' man
Well, I'm a comer and a goer
In a six man band
