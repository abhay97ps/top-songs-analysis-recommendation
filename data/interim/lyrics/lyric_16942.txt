You gotta get together...
Love is but a song we'll sing
And feels the way we die
You can make the mountains ring
Or making just cry
Though the bird is on the wing
And you may not know why
C'mon people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Some will come and some will go
And we shall surely pass
When the one that left us here
Returns for us at last
We have but a moments on life
Fading in the grass
C'mon people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
C'mon people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Wanna grab all all your friend
Nothing for deal and is just for making
Live in this situation
Must forward in this generation
Seek the truth in your heart, in your mind
Do what's right and you shall fight
There's a universal family
Peace my brothers and my sisters
C'mon people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
If you hear the song I sing
You will understand 
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
Just when key unlocks them both
It's there at your command
C'mon people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
C'mon people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Right now
Right now...
