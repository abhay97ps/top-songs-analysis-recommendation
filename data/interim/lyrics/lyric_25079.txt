Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check 
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest 
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex 
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed 
Two-tone Patek 
In the Clearport like I Uber these jets 
VVS's on me, got my Gucci shirt wet
Put an M in my bag , gon' get used to these racks 
I went to school where they teach you finesse 
Five hundred shoes for the drip, I invest 
I'm the bossman, I keep cash in the desk 
Know the coupe fast , when it end with an "S"
Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down where it ain't so
With checks in the streets, Jay number 4's
Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes
Take it with me, double your dose
Covered with angels that's watchin' my soul
Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows
Said I'll be there in ten, but I got there in four
I feel like I'm chosen, I'm covered in gold
Mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm
Mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm
I left her wide open, no self control 
Mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm
Mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm
Took nothin' but five minutes, she hopped in and drove
Mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm
Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes

Cash through the month, I get a check 
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest

Count up a hun', cop a Rolex 
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed 
Two-tone Pateks 
In the Clearport like I Uber the jets 
VVS's on me, got my Louis shirt wet
It's an M in my bag , gon' get used to these racks 
I went to school where they teach you finesse 
Five hundred shoes for the drip, I invest 
I'm the bossman, I keep cash in the desk 
Know the coupe fast , when it end with an "S"
La Flame on an island, me and Cash, Gunna hopped on a Learjet
Got Pradas every color and I got CC's you ain't seen yet
Said I'd kick the cup and now I'm askin', "Where the codeine at?"
Thirty pointers and up, Eliantte, drippin', my whole team wet
