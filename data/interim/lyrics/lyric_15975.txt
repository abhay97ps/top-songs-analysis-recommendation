 4: 16
Walking through the rooms in my head
I came across your image
You looked at me with that sweet smile and said
Something they won't let me repeat
We hurt the ones we love the most
It's a subtle form of compliment
I don't care if you talk about me
I don't care if you write it out in stone
Whenever I fall I land on my feet
I don't care, I just don't care
Mark the spot you hate with an X
Then shoot your bow and arrow
Do your worst get it all off your chest
I'll hold my breath and swallow
We hurt the ones we love the most
It's a subtle form of discipline
I don't care if you talk about me
I don't care if you write it out in stone
Whenever I fall I land on my feet
I don't care, I just don't care
I don't care if you act like a queen
I don't care if you take it out on me
I've got nine lives and I land on my feet
I don't care, I just don't care
I don't care if you talk about me
I don't care if you write it out in stone
Whenever I fall I land on my feet
I don't care, I just don't care
I don't care if you act like a queen
I don't care if you take it out on me
I've got nine lives and I land on my feet
I don't care, I just don't care
