What's he doing in my world?
What's he doing holding my world?
If he's not more than just friend
Why were you kissing him?
And what's he doing in my world?
What's he doing in my world?
Did you tell him that you're my girl?
If your love is really true
Tell him my world's made for two
And what's he doing in my world?
Oh, don't let me keep on wondering
Just what you're gonna do
Wondering if the one I love
Loves somebody new
What's he doing in my world?
We don't need him in our world
So if it's true he's just a friend
Explain those kisses you gave him
And what's he doing in my world?
