Yesterday, all my troubles
Seemed so far away, yeah
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I'm not a half the man
I used to be, no, no, no
There's a shadow hanging over me
For yesterday came suddenly
Why did she have to go?
I don't know, she wouldn't say
Wait a minute, I, I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Oh, yesterday, love was such an
Easy game to play, yes, it was
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Why did she have to go?
I don't know, she wouldn't say
But listen, I, I must've said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an
Easy game to play, yeah
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mm mm mm mm mmm
