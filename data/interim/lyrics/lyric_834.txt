You better take it easy, baby
Before you go away
You did me dirty
But you'll get yours one day
You better 
Talking about you 
You better 
Keep your eyes open wide
'Cause you'll be hurting down inside
You better leave me all your money
Before you go away
Don't think I'm funny, honey
But all I've gotta say
You better 
Whoa, oh 
'Cause when you
Took your love from me
You left me full of misery
 hey, hey
I'm gonna miss your loving every night
When I get myself together
I'm gonna be all right now
Yeah, yeah
Need me by your side
I'm gonna say
Go somewhere and hide
 hey, hey
You better watch out, baby
Everything you do
I'm gonna keep my eyes focused
Right on you
You're gonna look out, honey
Eerywhere you go
