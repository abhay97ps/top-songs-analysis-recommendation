You could've heard a pin drop
When they walked through the door
I had to turn my eyes away
My heart fell to the floor
Someone whispered, "Where's her halo?"
Cause she had an angel's face
He stood there smiling
Holding on to the one who took my place
So tonight the heartache's on me, on me
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
Bartender pour the wine 'cause the hurtin's all mine
Tonight the heartache's on me
I wonder if he told her she's the best he's ever known
The way he told me every night when we were all alone
She'll find out when the new wears off
He'll find somebody new
She'll learn what the heartache's all about
And what I'm going through
So tonight the heartache's on me, on me
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
Bartender pour the wine 'cause the hurtin's all mine
Tonight the heartache's on me
So tonight the heartache's on me, on me
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
Bartender pour the wine 'cause the hurtin's all mine
Tonight the heartache's on me
Yes tonight the heartache's on me
