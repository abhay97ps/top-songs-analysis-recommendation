Dang I’m Down bad right now
Heavenly father, Give us this day
I’m down to my last, last last last
I’m grinding, Went Broke
No lights, Just Roaches
Pulling Up, Skrrrrrt

No Heat, Door Locked

SKRRRRRT, PRAY
MAKE SUM’N SHAKE 
AIN’T NO WAY
MAKE SUM’N SHAKE

I had to get it lil hitta
I had to get out my feelings
I had to feed the family
Struggle done brought out the man in me
Early morning plotting winnin’
I was up countin’ these pennies
I was up thanking God
It ain’t over till its finished
I’m gone make sum’n shake
I’m gone make sum’n shake
You don't wanna run no play
I’ll take any play
I’ll play any position
Six man to the point
Bussin’ them buckets, yeah
Racking the points 
Hustle retarded 
They get the point
Glory to God
Look up and point
Gun shot
My Block
Night Time
Door Locked
I gave it to God that’s the recipe
I’m seeking hHis face ain’t no stressing me
I’m down to my last, last last last
I’m grinding, Went Broke
No lights, Just Roaches
Pulling Up, Skrrrrrt
Good night
No Heat, Door Locked

AIN’T NO WAY
MAKE SUM’N SHAKE
ANI’T NO WAY
SKRRRRRT, PRAY
MAKE SUM’N SHAKE 
AIN’T NO WAY
MAKE SUM’N SHAKE

Going, Off
Out in miami I'm fresh out the yard
Back to the field i run with the lost
Come at me real
Dont come at me soft
Pulled up with nothing
I came in the same
Whole hood be talkin’ bout ronnie done changed
All these prayers
Got like 30 on me
All this favor i’m the plug homie
Phone going off
Phone going off
Sins all paid
Ask me what it cost
I dont understand i ain't take a loss
If i die today blood on the cross
I dont fear nothing
I ain’t got a reason
You can keep the hate
I dont really need it
You will never see me
Walkin’ round defeated
Fresh up out of hell
Plead the blood of jesus
Dead broke teach you how to grind right
Call it perfect timing cause the time right
No time for fooling yay
Prey we gone, prey we gone do this yay
Everybody tryna touch the vision
If you ain't see it you'll never get it
All these haters move around with it
God saved me stayed down with me
I’m down to my last, last last last
I’m grinding, Went Broke
No lights, Just Roaches
Pulling Up, Skrrrrrt
Good night
No Heat, Door Locked
Aye
AIN’T NO WAY
MAKE SUM’N SHAKE
ANI’T NO WAY
SKRRRRRT, PRAY
MAKE SUM’N SHAKE 
AIN’T NO WAY
MAKE SUM’N SHAKE
ANI’T NO WAY
SKRRRRRT, PRAY
MAKE SUM’N SHAKE
