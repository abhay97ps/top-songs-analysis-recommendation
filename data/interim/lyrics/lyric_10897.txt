Yesterday I swore
I was gonna switch you
But today I'm back for more, ooh
I can't resist you
Starvin' just to feed the feel
But lust just to make a deal
Willpower disappears
You become the music in my ears
I want you tonight
I feel like getting crazy
Oh, I know it's not right
But who is gonna save me?
Now and then I stop
And wonder what I'm doin'
And sometimes when I talk
I don't know who I'm foolin'
As the demon livin' deep inside
It's really me all right
Temptations doin' it to me
Got me in the mood I can't get free, no
I want you tonight man I'm thinkin' maybe
Oh, I know it ain't right but who is gonna save me?
Is there no way of fighting this feeling inside
Where ecstasy lives but sanity dies?
We all need more of each other
I want you tonight
I feel like getting crazy, yeah
Oh, I know its not right
But who is gonna save me?
I want you tonight man I'm thinkin' maybe
Oh, I know it ain't right but who is gonna save me?
Oh!
I want you tonight
I want you tonight
I want you tonight
I want you, I want you tonight
I want you tonight
I feel like gettin' crazy
Oh-oh I know it's not right
But who is gonna save me?
I want you, I want you tonight
Won't you baby, won't you baby
