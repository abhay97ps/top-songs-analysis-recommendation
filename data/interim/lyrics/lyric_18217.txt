6 A.M., gettin' out of bed again
Can't get back in
'Cause sleep ain't gonna pay the rent
Day to day
They got you working like a slave
Taking credit for the work you gave
And stealing your raise, but I
 I know you're down
When you gon' get up?
 I see you're down
When you gon' get up?
 I know you're down
When you gon' get up?
 I see you're down
When you gon' get up?
People try to pull the wool over your eyes
Don't know why
They want to profit from your demise
They lie to cover up how weak they are inside
Ooh, baby, baby, don't you cry
All you got's your pride, so I
 I know you're down
When you gon' get up?
 I see you're down
When you gon' get up?
 I know you're down
When you gon' get up?
 I see you're down
