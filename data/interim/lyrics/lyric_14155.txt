Johnny played guitar, Jenny played bass
Name of the band is The Human Race
Everybody tell me, have you heard
Pop goes the world
Jenny played keyboard, Johnny played drums
Called Little Baby and a big Bonhomme
Everybody tell me, have you heard
Pop goes the world
It goes something like this
Johnny and Jenny had a crazy dream
See their pictures in a magazine
Every little boy needs a girl
Pop goes the world
Jenny and Johnny getting smart, it seemed
Make more money on a movie screen
Every little nest needs a bird
Pop goes the world
One, two, three and four is five
Everybody here is a friend of mine
Whatever happened to the Duke of Earl
Six, seven, eight and nine is ten
Send Al Gunn to see the doctor 
Hey, what planet are we on 
Pop goes the world
And every time I wonder where the world went wrong
End up lying on my face going ringy-dingy-ding-dong
And every time I wonder if the world is right
End up in some disco, dancing all night
Johnny played guitar, Jenny played bass
Name of the band is The Human Race
Everybody tell me have you heard
Pop goes the world
Johnny played guitar, Jenny played bass
Ain't nobody couldn't take their place
Everybody tell me have you heard
Pop goes the world
