Like the wallpaper sticks to the wall
Like the seashore clings to the sea
Like you'll never get rid of your shadow
Frank you'll never get rid of me
Let all the others fight and fuss
Whatever happens, we've got us
We're closer than pages that stick in a book 
We're closer than ripples that flow in a brook
Wherever you find him, you'll find me, just look 
Closer than a miser or the bloodhounds to Liza
We're closer than smog when it clings to L.A 
We're closer than Booby is to JFK
Not a soul can bust this team in two
We stick together like glue
And when it's sleeping time
That's when we rise
We start to swing
Swing to the sky
Our clocks don't chime
What a surprise
They ring-a-ding-ding!
Happy New Year!
And now to repeat what I said at the start 
They'll need a large crowbar to break us apart
We're alone but far from blue
Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar
We'll wind up at Jilly's right after Toot's Shore
Life is gonna be wow-wow-wee! 
For my shadow and me!
Frank: Say Frank?
Sammy: What is it, Sam?
Frank: Do me a favor?
Sammy: What do you want, now?
Frank: Would you mind just taking it, one more time?
Sammy: From the top?
Frank: No! From the ending!
Sammy: Wonderful!
And while we are swinging, to mention a few
We'll drop in at Danny's, The Little Club too
But wind up at Jilly's, whatever we do
Life is gonna be we-wow-whee!
For my shadow and me!
Sammy: Frank?
Frank: Oh, forget it Sam
Sammy: Alright
