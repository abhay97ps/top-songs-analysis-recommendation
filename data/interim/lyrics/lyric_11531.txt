Well I can see - that you weren't givin' enough
That you weren't givin' as much as me
With all your small talk - bendin' the rules
Are you runnin' before you can walk
I've got the feelin' you've been runnin' around
You've gone and left behind the feelin' we'd found
Too much too soon too much too soon
Too much too soon
Well can you get excited by what you see
You've been takin' my love
You should be giving it back to me
Give a little bit of love like you did before
Give a little bit more 
Give a little bit more 
Give a little bit more
In a photograph you didn't put me in the picture
My lovin' just made you laugh I was wide eyed
Taken right in I can't understand why you lied
I've got the feelin' you've been runnin' around
You've gone and left behind the feelin' we'd found
Too much too soon too much too soon
Too much too soon
Well can you get excited by what you see
You've been taking my love
You should be giving it back to me
Give a little bit of love like you did before
Give a little bit more 
Give a little bit more 
Give a little bit more
I've got the feelin' you've been runnin' around
You've gone and left behind the feelin' we'd found
Too much too soon too much too soon
Too much too soon
Well can you get excited by what you see
You've been taking my love
You should be giving it back to me
Give a little bit of love like you did before
Give a little bit more 
Give a little bit more
Give a little bit more
