Got a guitar
Got a guitar on my back
And I'm standing on this lonesome railroad track
Train's a coming
It'll be here before too long
But I don't think I can stop it with a song
Girl that's the kind of way I'm feeling
Trying to stop your leaving
Got a pebble
Got a pebble in my hand
And I toss it out into the middle of the Rio Grande
But the river keeps running
Don't even know that I'm around
I could throw a million more and not slow it down
Girl that's kind of what I'm feeling
Trying to stop your leaving
There's nothing that I wouldn't try
If I thought it would change your mind
But you don't love me
No you don't love me anymore
And I know as soon as you walk out that door
Train's a coming, river's running
Train's a coming, river's running
Pain's a coming, tears are running
Yeah that's kind of the way I'm feeling
Knowing I couldn't stop your leaving
