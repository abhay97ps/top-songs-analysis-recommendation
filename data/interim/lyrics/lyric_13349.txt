Ooh, boy
Oh, yeah yeah
Oh yeah
You walked in on the sly
Scoping for love
In the crowd I caught your eye
You can't hide your stuff
You thought I'd be naive and tame
But I beat you at your own game, oh
Take another look and tell me, baby
Now the fish jumped off the hook, didn't I, baby?
Yeah
Take another look and tell me, baby
The fish jumped off the hook, baby
Yeah, yeah
Guess you believed the world
Played by your rules
Here stands an experienced girl
I ain't nobody's fool, bump you
You thought you had me covered now, boy
But you're bound to be my lover, oh
Take another look and tell me, baby
Now the fish jumped off the hook, didn't I, baby?
Yeah
Take another look and tell me, baby
Now the fish jumped off the hook, didn't I, baby?
Yeah
You think you're smooth
And you can pick and choose when the time is right
But just look behind, you'll be surprised to find
I'm gonna make you mine tonight, oh yeah
Take another look and tell me, baby
Now the fish jumped off the hook, didn't I, baby?
Yeah
Take another look and tell me, baby
The fish jumped off the hook, baby
Yeah, yeah
Take another look and tell me, baby
The fish jumped off the hook, baby
Yeah, yeah
