Hair and nails fresh from the shop
And we're at the bombest spot
Called the shackkk

Three months of pleasure
How can I measure

All the fun I'm facin

Standin in line tah get a free lunch
Why do we do what we do when we do what we do
Hangin out late wit no curfew
-Chorus-

Hangin wit my homies and my friends

We got Da Five Footaz and the Twinz
We got Warren G and the D-O-G
All come around
Tah hear the Dove Shack G Funk sound
