Yeah
One, two
Story about a place I'm from
Yeah
Shout to the mighty Mos Def, one time
Said, we used to live in Brooklyn, baby
Haha, okay
Sometimes I sit back, reflect on the place that I lived at
And how what it was, I can't get back
World screaming, "Where Brooklyn at?"
We never knew our own impact
But bet we knew where all the flips at
Corner dreams, can't gift-wrap
You hit a groove, and win or lose, we all with that
And everyone who ever had to live that
Ain't alive to be there when they switched that
But if it switch back, bet they try to give it back
Like "y'all can have this"
Same shit they did in the 60s, before the madness
And in turn we took Brooklyn and put a flag in
Proudly, we in the dirt but look at the fabric, ha
We was next-door neighbors with pride
Regardless of all the vials they was slingin' outside
Like before the day ones was displaced
And the church ain't need a permit to set up and sell fish plates
When bodegas knew the picture
Before they started calling everything organic to move it quicker
Stoops was littered with truth and liquor
But bet you was protected, and never had to live under neglection
Now it's 1200 to live in the Ps and double for the studios up the street
True indeed, they lookin' at you and me like "y'all had your run"
And turned all the block parties into Afropunk
Or how they used to say we look like a target
But took it regardless, and now Brooklyn is a moshpit
It's real, yo, but still, yo, it's love here
And it's felt by anybody that come here
Unless you ask the new neighbors who was brung here
They might play on entitlement like they from here
One year as a resident, deep in sentiment
They tell you, you don't know Brooklyn and they representin' it, ah
Sittin' on they front stoop out witnessin'
Changin' the native dialect but you ain't listenin', huh
You might get an ignore when passing them in the store
'Cause they predict by next year, you gone
So this goes out to Fulton Street, Franklin Ave
Atlantic and Nostrand and all the dollar cabs
This goes to Adelphi, Myrtle Ave
Lafayette, behind the 'jects, to circle back
To Gates Ave, to Flushing Ave, to Macon
We made that, they'll run it back, just play calm
This is for Bedford Ave, Sullivan and Montgomery
From President to Rogers, they all deserve homage
From Marcy to Tompkins, Broadway down to the junction
The Hook to Gowanus to Sunset
To Mermaid and Surf Ave on how you saw it
First ones who ever had to deal with all them tourists
From Flatbush and Church Ave and Caton Ave
When they was telling y'all that you never could make it past
And if you ever did, you never could make it last
And now they live upstairs breaking glass
And this is coming live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
And when I was a kid, the broads I was tryna get in
Wanted to come to the crib, they told they mothers where I lived
And they mothers was denyin' 'em, son
Fast forward to the now, and the same broads I couldn't get
Live here, and got they moms with 'em, it's weird
Wonder why half of Atlanta got on Yankee hats
New Brooklyn ran us out like "Where you think you at?"
But know that I'm old Brooklyn wherever
And regardless of where I park, I hold Brooklyn together
So thinking you'll ever be mo' Brooklyn, you'll never
Just enjoy it along with us, know it's Brooklyn forever
For real
You know why?
We used to live in Brooklyn, baby
We used to live in Brooklyn, baby
We tried to make it, baby
And our time was now
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
And when I was a kid, the broads I was tryna get in
Wanted to come to the crib, they told they mothers where I lived
And they mothers was denyin' 'em, son
Fast forward to the now, and the same broads I couldn't get
Live here, and got they moms with 'em, it's weird
