I don't wanna think too much
I just wanna feel
You know that it ain't no rush
Let me keep it real
Just let me be in your life like that
In your life like that
I'll bring the light right back
I'll bring the life right back
I'm gonna make you want more 
I'm gonna be your new favorite
Tell 'em you closing the door
I am the only for sure
Oh, babe
Hold up, there shouldn't be no hold up
There's more love if you follow emotions
Show up, now if you're down to roll up
Meet me on the west side for me
Hold up, there shouldn't be no hold up
There's more love if you follow emotions
Show up, now if you're down to roll up
Meet me
I don't want it if it ain't your touch
It's better every time we chill
You ain't gotta bring no stuff
We got all we need right here
Just let me be in your life like that
Be your wife like that
I'll bring the light right back
I'll bring the life right back
I'm gonna make you want more 
I'm gonna be your new favorite
Tell 'em you closing the door
I am the only for sure, baby
Oh, babe, yeah
Hold up, there shouldn't be no hold up 
There's more love if you follow emotions 
Show up, now if you're down to roll up 
Meet me on the west side for me
Hold up, there shouldn't be no hold up
There's more love if you follow emotions
Show up, now if you're down to roll up
Meet me on the west side for me
Mmm
