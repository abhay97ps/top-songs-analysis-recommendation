I met her in a music school
A flute major
C major
So natural when we made the
Time to scale up
The size of our auras
1:1 model
A model of no boredom
So porcelain
The name of our daughter
Thinking ahead too far
A fatal flaw
When the mantra
Mansa Musa my muse
Is so rich
But due to past shit
She dip
When it gets too deep
And here's me the poet
With no emoji
The motive's emotive
Yeah I'm trying to tap
Like wires for McNulty
But I ain't string a belle along
I'm singing Bella it's on
I'm adamant that ain't nobody like ya
No hoax call when I say that shit was fire
But I see the problem was major
Now I'm nothing but A minor
In your life
Hello, stranger
It's been a minute since we last kicked it
By the way, just got in town
And I won't let cumulus clouds all in the sky ruin my vibe
Usually I don't do this often
But since recruiting isn't an option
Due to unusual rain and thunder
Baby I wonder, baby I wonder, would you just
Put your sweats on, put your sweats on for me
'Cause I got the plug, I made the call for green
I'm talkin' late-night for you
Let me lay a great time on you
Don't hesitate, no, don't you
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
I wanna love her all night
I wanna love her all night
I wanna love her all night
I wanna
Hello stranger, vape's been waiting

I'm playin' baby, I'm sayin' baby
Lovin' shit, you know I'm crazy
So go ahead and pour the drink up
I'm so glad we got to link up, uh yeah
Get to takin' that off, takin' that off for me
'Cause I got the plug, I made the call for green
I'm talkin' late-night for you
Let me lay a great time on you
Don't hesitate, no, don't you, no, no
Just say you will, will, will yeah
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will
I wanna love her all night

Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just like you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
