Oh man, you've got to watch where you're steppin' around here
Yeah, I got a friend in New York City
He's never heard of Conway Twitty
Don't know nothin' 'bout grits and greens
Never been south of Queens
But he flew down here on a business trip
I took him honky tonkin' and that was it
He took to it like a pig to mud, like a cow to cud
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide it
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but a hollerin', Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you got to admit that's in them genes
Aren’t nothing wrong, just gettin' on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone
Nah, you ain’t gotta be born out in the sticks
With an F-150 and a 30-06
Or have a bubba in the family tree
To get on down with me
Yeah, bubba, all you need is an open mind
If it fires you up you got to let it shine
When it feels so right that it can't be wrong
Come on, come on, come on
You ain't alone, you ain't alone
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide it
And when the band starts bangin' and the fiddle saws
You can't help but a hollerin' Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you got to admit that it's in them genes
Ain’t nothin' wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone
Come on y'all
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide
And when the band starts bangin' and the fiddle saws
You can't help but a hollerin', Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man, you got to admit that's in them genes
Aren’t nothing wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone
Hillbilly bone ba-bone ba-bone bone
Hillbilly bone ba-bone ba-bone bone
Hillbilly bone ba-bone ba-bone bone
I've always wanted to sing the bone song
