A-there's a dance spreadin' round
Like an awful disease
Oh well, you shake yo' shoulders
And you wiggle yo' knees
This dance goin' around
From coast to coast
A-when me an my baby do it
Child, we do it the mo-oh-ost
A-mama, Hully Gully
Papa, Hully Gully
Baby, Hully Gully, too
'Come on let's take a lesson, now'
'Alright, shake yo' shoulders, now'
'Alright, wiggle yo' knees, now'
A-wail, now
Mama, Hully Gully
Sure can, Hully Gully
You can Hully Gully, too
We-eeeell
I went to a party, now
And what did they do?
Now, everybody's doin' it
Now, why ain't you-ooo-hoo?
Everybody look like he's got the sha-a-ake
Just listen here, brother
That is all it takes
A-mama, Hully Gully
Papa, Hully Gully
And baby Hully Gully, too
Mama, Hully Gully
Baby, Hully Gully
And you can Hully Gully, too
'Whew'!
'Hold it, hold it, hold, hold it'
'I'll make time you wanna call it?
He asked for one more time, so that's it!'
'Maurice, can't help it'
'One mo'-ooh, again
'All of us work a little while, now'
'That's the way I like it'
'I mean, ho's even with it'
Why you bringin' ho's for?
Do a little cha-cha
Then you do the Foot Stomp
Everybody's here, gonna get aboard
Get the police coming out
'I mean the Soul Train'
'Oh, shake that thing, honey'
We're gonna do the Hully Gully
Never gonna stop
Tell me anybody here
Who learned to do The Slop?
Bring uncle along
Auntie, too!
Don't forget about the cousins
Nieces, nephews
Auntie, Hully Gully
Auntie, Hully Gully
Brother, sisters, nephews, nieces
Gramma, too!
'Oh, shake that thing'
'That's the way I like it'
