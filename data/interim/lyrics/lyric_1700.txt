My arms reach out for you
I kiss you tenderly
But when you touch my lips
You're kissing him not me
Why must it be?
Half heaven, half heartache
My lovin' you, darlin'
Can't you forget that other love you knew, hmm
Within your angel eyes
A world of dreams are there
Yet I'll keep wondering
If they are mine to share
Oh it's just not fair
Half heaven, half heartache
My loving you, darlin'
Oh let my love be strong enough to
Take away the heartache
And make my life
A heaven on earth
With you-ou-oo-ou
Half heaven, half heartache
My loving you, darlin'
Oh let my love be strong enough to
Take away the heartache
And make my life
A heaven on earth
With you-ou-oo-oo-ou
