I haven't been myself these days according to friends
I tend to lose a part of me when my heart is on the mend
I'll be alright it's safe to say
'Cause just like your love, this is only a phase
Well, I've been down this road a time or two, it's nothing new
Well, I'll get on my feet and over you
I tell myself that everything will be just fine
Oh, I'm just going through a little downtime
Some might think I've gotten caught up in heartache's aftermath
But your memory's taken second to a good book and nice long bath
I must admit it threw me at first
But I'm convinced I'm over the worst
Oh, I've been down this road a time or two, it's nothing new
Oh, I'll get on my feet and over you
I tell myself that everything will be just fine
Oh, I'm just going through a little downtime
Well, time is meant to play the part
In taking care of broken hearts
Oh, I've been down this road a time or two, it's nothing new
I'll get on my feet and over you
I tell myself that everything will be just fine
Oh, I'm just going through a little
Oh, I'm just going through a little
I'm just going through a little downtime
