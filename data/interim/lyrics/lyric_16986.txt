 Sophie, it's time...
Ahaaa...
You don't know why I'm crazy
I don't know why your blue
You messed with my head
You messed with the dead
Now I'm gonna mess with you
I don't know why your lazy
I'm so in love with you
What's God gonna see
Who's God gonna know
When's God gonna help us through
I can't deny, I can't explain, I can't reply, I can't refrain
I want his hands, I want his chest, I want his feet, I want his sex
I am the child, I am the whore, I am the wild woman at your door
I need to touch, I need to talk, I need to love, I need to give you, you up
What am I fighting for
If I win I lose my life
I need you more and more
To break my will tonight
Only love can set us free
Only love can bear the truth
Only love can bring us peace
Only love can save me and you
Oh Daddy what I've been thinkin'
Only heaven knows
What's Ma gonna see
Who's Ma gonna blame
When's Mama gonna carry you home
I have the urge, I have the mind, I have the touch, I drank the wine
I want the loss, I want the pain, I want to start my life again
I can't define, I can't forget, I can't restrain the feeling of regret
I know the dead, I'm not alone, I made my bed, I wanna let you, you go
What am I frightened for
If I speak I lose my mind
You've broken down the door and there is no place to hide
Only love can set us free
Only love can bear the truth
Only love can bring us peace
Only love can save me and you
Only love can purify
Only love can conquer fear
Only love can testify
Only love can make a miracle of life
Only love can set us free
Only love can bear the truth
Only love can bring us peace
Only love can save me and you
Only love can purify
Only love can conquer fear
Only love can testify
Only love can make a miracle of life
