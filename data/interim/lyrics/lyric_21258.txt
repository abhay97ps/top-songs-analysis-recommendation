I just wanna tell the truth, man...
I just wanna tell the truth, man...
I just wanna tell the truth, man...
I just wanna tell the truth, man...
You're so fly, you're so high
Everybody around you trying to figure out why
You're so cool, you win all the time
Everywhere you go, man, you get a lot of shine
Boy like a magnet better, yet I have it
Everything you wear, people say they gotta have it
From the sweat suit to the white tee to the Gucci
You can probably say people wanna get like me
But what they don't know is when you go home
And get behind closed doors, man, you hit the floor
And what they can't see is you're on your knees
So, the next time you get it, just tell them
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
They think I'm so fresh
They think I'm so clean
They think I'm so sweet
It's the God in me
It's the God in me 
It's the God in Me
You see her style, you think she's nice
You look at her whip, you say the whip tight
You look at her crib, you thinking she paid
You look at her life, you think she's got it made
But everything she got, the girl's been given
She calls it a blessing, but you call it living
When it comes to money, she can be a hero
She writes them checks with a whole lot of zeros
But what they don't know is when you go home
And get behind closed doors, man, you hit the floor
And what they can't see is you're on your knees
So, the next time you get it, just tell them
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
They think I'm so fresh
They think I'm so clean
They think I'm so sweet
It's the God in me
It's the God in me 
It's the God in Me
What is it you think you see
When you see me, you see me
You don't know how much I pray
Don't know how much I gave
Don't know how much I changed
I'm just trying to explain
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
It's the God in me
They think I'm so fresh
They think I'm so clean
They think I'm so sweet
It's the God in me
It's the God in me 
It's the God in Me
