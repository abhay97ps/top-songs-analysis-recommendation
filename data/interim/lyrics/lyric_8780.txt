I'd like to live out all my dreams
And if I could
Yes, if I could
The nicest one would be with you
And you'd be here with me
Don't you ever get lonely
Lord, I'm no good when you're away
But what do you expect from a girl
Who loves you like I love you
Won't you ever just get tired
And come on home to me
Don't you ever get lonely
You're a part of me
That I can't do without
You're a part of me
That dreams are all about
But you can't hold on to
Something that you never had before
Love waits for the wind
To bring you back again
And take you away
Friends say it's great now you're a star
But what do they expect from a girl
Who loves you just the way you were
And late at night
I wish things had never changed
And you were here with me
Don't you ever get lonely
You're a part of me
That I can't do without
You're a part of me
That dreams are all about
But you can't hold on to
Something that you never had before
Love waits for the wind
To bring you back again
And take you away
Take you away
Honey, I love you
Take me away
'Cause honey, I love you
Take me away...
