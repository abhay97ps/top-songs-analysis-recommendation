Hey everybody it's music time!
"Now, you can't expect to figure out how to be cool looking in catalogs so forget about it!
You've gotta do it the old fashioned way... fake it!"
Yeah
"Play your drum, boys!"
I like music
The rhythm really gets to me
I can't control it
My feet move automatically
And I like hot licks
The kind I wish that I could play
And when I hear them
I crank the volume all the way
Turn it on
Turn it up
Turn it loud
All the way
I like strangers
Their kindness means a lot to me
They don't ask questions
Don't care about my history
And I like fast girls
I don't know what's come over me
They make me do things
I would not ordinarily
Turn me on
Turn me up
Turn me loose
All the way
Hear it
Feel it
Like it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Want it
Need it
Love it
Can't get enough of it
Try it
Do it
Go ahead and go for it
All the way
And I like daydreams
I've had enough reality
My job is boring
I'm overworked and underpaid
I like TV
It stirs up all my fantasies
Girls in tight jeans
Acting so outrageously
Turn me on
Turn me up
Turn me loose
All the way
Hear it
Feel it
Like it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Want it
Need it
Love it
Can't get enough of it
Try it
Do it
Go ahead and go for it
All the way
Turn it loose, loose
I like big things
The size of them impresses me
Just give me plenty
Forget about the quality
And I like fast food
The burgers always taste the same
No snotty waiters
Escargot or Beaujolais
Turn me on
Turn me up
Turn me loose
Turn it loud
All the way
Hear it 
Feel it 
Like it 
I do it, do it, do it, do it
Want it 
Need it 
Love it 
I can't get enough of it
Hear it 
Feel it 
Like it 
I do it, do it, do it, do it
Try it
Do it
Go ahead and bank on it
All the way
Way-ay -ay way
Yeah!
Turn it on
Turn it up
Turn it loose
Turn it loud 
Turn it on
Turn it up 
Turn it loose
Turn it loud 
Turn it on
Turn it up 
Turn it loose
Turn it loud 
Turn it on
Turn it up 
Turn it loose
Turn it loud 
Turn it on
Turn it up 
Turn it loose
Turn it loud
