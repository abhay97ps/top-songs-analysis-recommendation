Downtown anywhere in the USA
You can find yourself a Hard Rock Cafe
Put your money on a number anyone can play
Come on and tell us all about what happened to you today
At the Hard Rock Cafe
Come to the Hard Rock Cafe
I hope you can find your way to the Hard Rock Cafe
After a hard day's work I guarantee
There just isn't anywhere better to be
If you're unable to find good company
You can always sit down and watch the color TV
At the Hard Rock Cafe
Come to the Hard Rock Cafe
The regulars can't keep away from the Hard Rock Cafe
And if you're feeling just a little bit lonely
Don't sit at home just hoping
Come on down to where the spirits flow so free
You know that door is always open
At the Hard Rock Cafe
Come to the Hard Rock Cafe
They will help keep your blues at day at the Hard Rock Cafe
