Honestly already knew it, when I tuned my guitar
Then I woke up at dawn, just to do it again
This a movement not song
It's the truth I'm the don
Write this 'til I am gone

Cause this is Ardon Nsengiyumva
Pick your path and pick your shooters
Pick apart, and do it ruthless
Line them up cause they my students uh

Making moves, and I maneuver uh
Made myself the starting five
Got tired of substitutions uh
Tied a noose on nuisance uh
Used to feel so clueless, but then God gave me the blueprint
Got me writing with this blue pen uh
