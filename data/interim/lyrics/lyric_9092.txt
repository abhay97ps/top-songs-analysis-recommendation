20 YEARS LATER
Joel: I'm coming.
Tess: How was your morning? Want one?
Joel: No, I don't...want one.
Tess: Well, I have some interesting news for you.
Joel: Where were you, Tess?
Tess: West End district. Hey, we had a drop to make.
Joel: We. We had a drop to make.
Tess: Yeah, well, you wanted to be left alone, remember?
Joel: So, I'll take one guess. The whole deal went south, and the client made off with our pills. Is that about right?
Tess: Deal went off without a hitch. Enough ration cards to last us a couple of months -- easy.
Joel: You want to explain this?
Tess: I was on my way back here, and I got jumped by these two assholes, alright? Yeah, they got a few good hits in. But... Look, I managed.
Joel: Gimme that.
Joel: Are these assholes still with us?
Tess: Now that's funny.
Joel: Did you find out who they were?
Tess: Yeah, look, they were a couple of nobodies -- they don't matter. What matters is that Robert fucking sent them.
Joel: Our Robert?
Tess: He knows that we're after him. He figures he's gonna get us first.
Joel: That son of a bitch, he's smart.
Tess: No. He's not smart enough. I know where he's hiding.
Joel: Like hell you do.
Tess: Old warehouse in Area 5 -- can't say for how long, though.
Joel: Well, I'm ready now. Yeah?
Tess: Oh, I can do now.
Tess: The checkpoint's still open.
Joel: Only got a few hours left until curfew.
Tess: We better hurry up then.
Loudspeaker: Attention. Citizens are required to carry a current ID at all times. Compliance with all city personnel is mandatory.
Tess: Look at that. Ration line hasn't opened yet. Must be running low again.
Tess: Seems like more people are gettin' infected.
Joel: That just means more people are sneakin' out.
Man: S'up, Joel?
Joel: Nothin'.
Man: Hear they took Marianne?
Woman: What happened?
Man: Snatched her in the middle of the night. Said she was a Firefly. Can you believe that shit?
Woman: Better not mention the Fireflies too loudly. You don't want the wrong person hearing you.
Man: Yeah...yeah, you're probably right.
Tess: I got us all new papers. They shouldn't give us any static up there. Just play it cool.
Guard: Let me see your IDs.
Joel: There you go.
Guard: What's your business here?
Joel: Got the day off. Visiting a friend.
Guard: Alright, move on through.
Joel: Thanks.
Tess: Oh shit.
Guard: Get outta here! Go!
Guard 2: Close it up!
Guard: Fireflies!
Guard 2: Fuckin' shoot 'em!
Guard: They're running! Call for backup!
Tess: Joel, come on. Let's get outta here. Let's go. C'mon.
Guard: Goddamn Fireflies.
Loudspeaker: Attention. Checkpoint 5 is now closed until further notice. All civilians must clear the surrounding area immediately.
Tess: Looks like the coast is clear. C'mon.
Tess: Fuck...so much for the easy route. Patch yourself up, alright?
Tess: They're gonna close all the checkpoints. We're gonna have to go around the outside.
Joel: Outside the wall?
Tess: Or we could just let Robert go.
Joel: Cute.
Man: Hey Tess, you see that shit?
Tess: I was there. Hey, how's the east tunnel looking?
Man: It's clear. I just used it. No patrols. Where you off to?
Tess: Gonna pay Robert a visit.
Man: You too?
Tess: Who else is looking for him?
Man: Uh, Marlene. She's been asking around, trying to find him.
Tess: Marlene? What do the Fireflies need with Robert?
Man: You think she'd tell me?
Tess: Well, what did you tell her?
Man: The truth. I got no idea where he's hiding.
Tess: Good man. Hey, you stay outta trouble, alright? Military's gonna be out in force soon.
Man: Yeah -- see you around.
Tess: Marlene lookin' for Robert? What do you make of that?
Joel: I don't like it. We better find him before the Fireflies do.
Tess: This is us.
Man: Hey guys. How's it going?
Tess: Shit's stirring up out there? How we lookin' over here?
Man: Ah, it's been quiet. No signs of military or infected.
Tess: That's what I like to hear. Joel, give me a hand with this.
Man: Y'all take it easy out there.
Tess: Agh, this place reeks. They need to watch what they throw away down here.
Tess: Let there be light. Let's grab our gear. Our backpacks are still here from last time.
Joel: Not a lot of ammo.
Tess: Well, make your shots count. Alright, Texas. Boost me up. You ready?
Joel: Yes, ma'am.
Tess: C'mon.
Joel: Go on.
Tess: Got it.
Joel: Be careful.
Tess: When am I not?
Joel: That a trick question?
Joel: Ain't been out here in awhile.
Tess: It's like we're on a date.
Joel: Well I'm the romantic type.
Tess: You got your ways. Where's the ladder?
Joel: It's gotta be around here somewhere. Got it.
Tess: Great. Bring it over.
Joel: Ladies first.
Tess: Lady? You must be thinking of someone else.
Joel: It's all relative.
Tess: This way. Down through here. You think Robert's still got our guns?
Joel: For his sake...he better.
Tess: Look, once we get our merchandise back, it should be easy to unload.
Joel: Speaking of merchandise, when's the next shipment due?
Tess: Well, we're meeting Bill next month, more pills, lots of ammo,
supposedly.
Joel: Yeah, well he always shows up with somethin'. Should keep us busy for a while.
Tess: Hold up. Spores.
Joel: Where the hell are all these comin' from? Place was clear last time.
Tess: They're coming outta somethin'. Stay alert.
Joel: There's our culprit.
Tess: Body's not that old. Better keep your eyes and ears open.
Joel: We should be able to fit through here. Oh, shit.
Tess: You okay?
Joel: Yeah. Damn ceiling's falling apart. Be careful. This way. Easy...
Joel: Jesus. Watch it. Watch it.
Infected: Help me... My mask broke. Don't...don't leave me to turn. Please.
Tess: What you want to do?
Tess: Poor bastard.
Infected: Come back... Don't leave me like this. Come back.
Tess: Up ahead. You hear that?
Joel: Shh, shh, shh.
System: Hold R2 to focus Joel's hearing.
Tess: How you wanna handle it?
Tess: Alright, that's all of 'em.
Joel: Let's hope so.
Tess: Let's head back into the city.
Tess: Ahhh...some fresh air. That's the one thing I love about the outside. Fuckin' hate the smell of the city.
Joel: Why don't you ask Bill to get you some of them air fresheners?
Tess: Hey, if they weren't expired, that'd be a good idea. Through here.
Tess: Cover the entrance.
Joel: I got it.
Tess: Damn it. Plank fell down. Be a dear, would you?
Joel: I'll get it.
Tess: Here. Pass it to me.
Joel: It's a bit heavy.
Tess: I think I can handle it.
Joel: Alright.
Tess: Get your ass up here. Let's move.
Joel: Bossy today.
Joel: Let's make sure there aren't any soldiers around.
Tess: It's clear. Come on.
Tess: Shut it. Pick up that ammo. I'm sure we'll need it.
Tess: Hey, little man. Make sure the coast is clear. No soldiers. None of Robert's men. Yeah?
Joel: You know he's expecting us.
Tess: Well, that'll make it more interesting.
Tess: Good to go. C'mon.
Man: Hey Tess, hey Tess. Hey, pretty lady, how you doin' today?
Tess: Not right now, Terence.
Man: No, no, it's good.
Tess: Not...now. You hear me?
Terence: Okay. I can do that. Don't get all huffy-puffy about it.
Man: Tess, it's been awhile. You don't visit us any more.
Woman: Who the hell is that?
Man: None of your damn business.
Man: Where do you think you're goin'?
Tess: Malick. Sit back down.
Malick: Oh sorry, Tess. Didn't realize you two were together. Go ahead.
Joel: Who's that?
Tess: An old headache. Don't ask.
Tess: I'm lookin' for Robert. He come through here?
Man: Half hour ago. He went back to the wharf. He's there now.
Joel: Here we go.
Tess: Let us through.
Goon: You guys need to turn around and head back if you know what's good for you.
Tess: Our beef isn't with you. We just want Robert. You don't want to do this.
Goon: Turn the fuck around and leave now.
Tess: I'm not going anywhere without Robert.
Goon: Bitch, I will bash your skull unless you turn around and get your dumb ass outta here.
Tess: Fuck this.
Goon 2: Take cover!
Tess: You ready?
Joel: Yeah.
Goon 3: I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!
Tess: I'll cover you. Get the angle on them.
Tess: Nicely done, Texas.
Joel: You too. How the hell did he get all these guys?
Tess: If Robert's good at one thing, it's writing blank checks. Let's go put an end to that. Shit. Not goin' through here. Hey. Boost me up.
Joel: Alright, c'mon...
Tess: Gimme your hand. There you go.
Joel: Alright.
Tess: Over here, Joel.
Tess: More of Robert's guys.
Joel: Shit, I see them.
Sentry: How do you know they're comin'?
Sentry 2: Two of our guys died trying to take Tess out. I guarantee that she and Joel are on their way, right now, to get Robert.
Sentry: Jesus, we shouldn't have taken this job.
Sentry 2: Not our call. Let's spread out and make sure no one's creeping around here.
Tess: Nice and quiet, Texas.
Tess: Move up, move up.
Sentry 3: I meant to tell you, I was down on Jordan Street, and all these soldiers showed up with a group of about five civs, all in handcuffs.
Sentry 4: Let me guess, Fireflies?
Sentry 3: Yup, they lined 'em up against the wall and bang, bang, bang, they just executed all of 'em.
Sentry 4: Holy shit.
Sentry 3: Yeah, I hear it's like that all over the city. They're cracking down on 'em hard.
Sentry 4: I got a cousin with 'em.
Sentry 3: Seriously?
Sentry 4: Yeah. Idiot thinks he's gonna save the world. Hope he's alright.
Tess: You take one out, I'll take the other.
Tess: Good to have you around. Let's search the area.
Guard: Hey, we consolidated the crates in the south warehouse. Supplies are locked up.
Guard 2: Good, let's do another once-over and then head out. It's getting too close to curfew.
Guard: What about Robert? Who's he holing up with tonight? Guy's too paranoid to stay here by himself.
Guard 2: Fuck if I know. We'll check in with the others and come up with something.
Guard: Okay.
Tess: We shoulda brought more people.
Joel: They'd just slow us down.
Tess: Yeah, you're right. C'mon, the docks are this way. Let's do this.
Tess: There's our boy. That cocky son of a bitch.
Joel: Let's go wrap this up.
Sentry: Shipments have been dry for a long time.
Sentry 2: Yeah, well we lost our contacts in the North, lost our contacts in the South. Shit. I don't know who's left out there to sell us stuff. Guess this is why we're taking shitty protection jobs.
Sentry: Fucking Robert. This rat better be good for it.
Sentry 2: Even if he is, then what? I'm telling you, this zone is done for. We better think of an exit strategy.
Sentry: You're insane. Going outside the wall is suicide.
Sentry 2: Plenty of other smugglers do it. What do you think's gonna happen here once supplies run out?
Sentry: I'd still take my chances in here.
Tess: That office. Robert must've run in there. Let's not wait around.
Robert: Oh shit! Get back! Get the fuck back!
Tess: We just wanna talk Robert.
Robert: We ain't go fuckin' nothin' to talk about.
Tess: Put your gun down!
Robert: Go fuck yourself!
Tess: He's running!
Joel: Robert!
Robert: Screw you, Joel!
Tess: Joel, this way! C'mon, he ran in here!
Tess: We almost got him.
Joel: C'mon, c'mon.
Tess: Joel, he's right there.
Robert: Come on.
Tess: Hello, Robert.
Robert: Tess. Joel. No hard feelings, right?
Tess: None at all.
Robert: Ahh...goddammit!
Tess: We missed you.
Robert: Look, whatever it is you heard, it ain't true, okay? I just want to say--
Tess: The guns. You wanna tell us where the guns are?
Robert: Yeah, sure, but...it's complicated. Alright? Look, alright, just hear me out on this. I gotta--
Robert: Fuck... Ah, stop, stop, stop!
Tess: Quit your squirmin'. You were saying?
Robert: I sold 'em.
Tess: Excuse me?
Robert: I didn't have much of a choice. I owed someone.
Tess: You owed us. I say you bet on the wrong horse.
Robert: I just need more time. Just gimme a week.
Tess: You know, I might've done that if you hadn't tried to fucking kill me.
Robert: C'mon, it wasn't like--
Tess: Who has our guns?
Robert: I can't. Just gimme a couple days--
Robert: Fucking...
Tess: Who has our guns?
Robert: It's the Fireflies. I owed the Fireflies.
Tess: What?
Robert: Look, they're basically all dead. We can just-- Just go in there, finish 'em off. We get the guns. Whaddya say? C'mon. Fuck those Fireflies. Let's go get 'em.
Tess: That is a stupid idea.
Joel: Well, now what?
Tess: We go get our merchandise back.
Joel: How?
Tess: I don't know. We explain it to them. Look, let's go find a Firefly.
Voice: You won't have to look very far.
Joel: There you go: queen Firefly.
Marlene: Why are you here?
Tess: Business. You aren't looking so hot.
Marlene: Where's Robert?
Marlene: I needed him alive.
Tess: The guns he gave you, they weren't his to sell. I want them back.
Marlene: Doesn't work like that, Tess.
Tess: The hell it doesn't.
Marlene: I paid for those guns. You want 'em back? You're gonna have to earn'em.
Tess: How many cards are we talking about?
Marlene: I don't give a damn about ration cards. I need something smuggled out of the city. You do that...I'll give you your guns and then some.
Joel: How do we know you got 'em? Way I hear it, the military been wiping you guys out.
Marlene: You're right about that. I'll show you the weapons.
Voice: Search the area.
Voice 2: Yes, sir.
Marlene: I gotta move. What's it gonna be?
Tess: I wanna see those guns.
Marlene: Follow me.
Tess: We gotta get out of here -- now!
Voice 1: Find the door!
Voice 2: They locked it!
Marlene: You want this deal, we gotta move. Through here. I know a way around this. C'mon.
Tess: Holy shit. Is that your people?
Marlene: What's left of them. Why do you think I'm turning to you guys? This way.
Joel: So why now?
Marlene: We've been quiet. Been planning on leaving the city, but they need a scapegoat. They've been trying to rile us up.
Joel: Looks like they did.
Marlene: We're trying to defend ourselves.
Marlene: Joel, give me a hand with this.
Tess: Hey, how you holding up?
Marlene: I'll live.
Marlene: Hold up. Soldiers. That's the way out. The door under the bridge.
Joel: Ain't a big fan of these odds.
Marlene: We can sneak by them, even though I know that's not your style.
Tess: We'll see how it goes. Let's get moving.
Guard: Damn, we missed all the action.
Guard 2: Justice waits for no one, private.
Guard: Ah, whatever.
Tess: I'll get this one. Go around and get the other.
Marlene: Good, stay quiet.
Marlene: Okay, watch yourselves.
Tess: They're out in numbers today.
Marlene: Go on. Get inside.
Tess: Where are we going, Marlene?
Marlene: This way. It's not far now.
Tess: How you holding up?
Marlene: I'm running on fumes -- but I'll make it. The place is right up ahead.
Loudspeaker: Attention. Curfew is now in full effect. Anyone caught outside without the proper authorization will be arrested and prosecuted.
Tess: Shit. We need to hurry.
Joel: What the hell are we smuggling?
Marlene: I'll show you. Joel, give me a hand with this.
Joel: Whoa, whoa, whoa... Come on now, get up.
Girl: Get the fuck away from her!
Tess: Hey, hey, hey.
Marlene: Let her go.
Joel: You're recruitin' kind of young, aren't ya?
Marlene: She's not one of mine.
Girl: Shit. What happened?
Marlene: Don't worry. This is fixable. I got us help...but I can't come with you.
Girl: Well then I'm staying.
Marlene: Ellie, we won't get another shot at this.
Joel: Hey -- we're smuggling her?
Marlene: There's a crew of Fireflies that'll meet you at the Capitol Building.
Tess: That's not exactly close.
Marlene: You're capable. You hand her off, come back, the weapon are yours. Double what Robert sold me.
Tess: Speaking of which, where are they?
Marlene: Back in our camp.
Tess: We're not smuggling shit until I see them.
Marlene: You'll follow me. You can verify the weapons, I can get patched up. But she's not crossing to that part of town. I want Joel to watch over her.
Joel: Whoa, whoa. I don't think that's the best idea.
Ellie: Bullshit! I'm not going with him.
Marlene: Ellie...
Ellie: How do you know them?
Marlene: I was close with his brother, Tommy. Said if I was ever in a jam I could rely on him.
Joel: Was that before or after he left your little militia group?
Marlene: He left you too. He was a good man.
Tess: Look, just take her to the north tunnel and wait for me there.
Joel: Jesus Christ.
Tess: She's just cargo, Joel.
Ellie: Marlene...
Marlene: No more talking. You'll be fine. Now go with him.
Joel: Don't take long. And you -- stay close. Let's go.
Ellie: Whoa...I heard all the shooting, but... What happened?
Joel: The Fireflies. Same thing's gonna happen to us if we don't get off the street.
Ellie: You're the pro. I'm just following you.
Loudspeaker: Attention. Harboring or aiding wanted criminals is punishable by death. Do not place yourself at risk. Report any suspicious activity immediately.
Joel: Down here.
Joel: C'mon, keep up.
Ellie: I am.
Ellie: Where are we going?
Joel: Up there, that'll get us to the north tunnel.
Ellie: How are we supposed to reach that?
Joel: Just gimme a minute.
Ellie: This tunnel...you use it to smuggle things?
Joel: Yep.
Ellie: Like illegal things?
Joel: Sometimes.
Ellie: You ever smuggle a kid before?
Joel: No. That's a first. So what's the deal with you and Marlene, anyways?
Ellie: I don't know. She's my friend, I guess.
Joel: Your friend, huh? You're friends with the leader of the Fireflies. What're you, like twelve?
Ellie: She knew my mom, and she's been looking after me. And I'm fourteen, not that that has anything to do with anything.
Joel: So where are your parents?
Ellie: Where are anyone's parents? They've been gone a long, long time.
Joel: Hm. So instead of just staying in school, you decide to run off and join the Fireflies, is that it?
Ellie: Look, I'm not supposed to tell you why you're smuggling me, if that's what you're getting at.
Joel: You wanna know the best thing about my job? I don't gotta know why. Be honest with you, I could give two shits about what you're up to.
Ellie: Well great.
Joel: Good.
Joel: This is it.
Ellie: What are you doing?
Joel: Killing time.
Ellie: Well, what am I supposed to do?
Joel: I am sure you will figure that out.
Ellie: Your watch is broken.
Ellie: You mumble in your sleep. I hate bad dreams.
Joel: Yeah, me too.
Ellie: You know, I've never been this close. To the outside. Look how dark it is. Can't be any worse out there. Can it?
Joel: What on earth do the Fireflies want with you?
Tess: Hey. Sorry it took so long. Soldiers fuckin' everywhere.
Ellie: How's Marlene?
Tess: She'll make it. I saw the merchandise. It's a lot. Wanna do this?
Joel: Yeah.
Tess: Let's go.
Joel: Don't you think it's a bit strange that they're askin' us to do their smuggling?
Tess: Marlene wanted to do it herself. We weren't the first choice, or the second for that matter. She's lost a lot of men. Beggars can't be choosers.
Joel: Yeah, let's just hope there's someone alive to pay us.
Tess: Someone'll be around. Come on.
Joel: Who's waitin' for us at the drop-off?
Tess: She said there's some Fireflies that have traveled all the way from another city. Girl must be important. What is the deal with you? You some bigwig's daughter or something?
Ellie: Something like that. How long is this all gonna take?
Tess: If everything goes as planned, we should get you to them in a few hours. Ellie, once we get out there, I need you to follow our lead and stay close.
Ellie: Yeah, of course.
Tess: Climb up and check if the coast is clear.
