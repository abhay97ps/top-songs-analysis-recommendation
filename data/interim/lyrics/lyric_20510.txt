Yeah!
Ow!
I might be a young girl, but I know how to have fun
I got them boys chasing me, tryna make me the one
When I'm out shopping, it's like I'm having a gun
Whatever I wanna get, I got them boys caught up
I know I'm a hot, hot shorty
But you gotta slow down 
You don't know me 
If you in a hot, hot hurry
Then you gotta go now 
Back up off me 
Uh-oh
Got them going crazy, you see 
Head over heels for me, oh  
Weak in the knees for me, boy 
'Cause you were so damn easy
'Cause you were so damn easy 
'Cause you were so damn easy 
I'm much wiser than you think, better act like you know 
Just because I'm a teen, it don't mean that I'm slow
I think you're a cutie boy, but you're turning me off
Sometimes you gotta play hard to get and then it's on
I know I'm a hot, hot shorty
But you gotta slow down
You don't know me
If you in a hot, hot hurry
Then you gotta go now
Back up off me 
Uh-oh
Got them going crazy, you see 
Head over heels for me, oh  
Weak in the knees for me, boy 
'Cause you were so damn easy {Fo sho'}
'Cause you were so damn easy {It's a money ain't a thing, J.R.}
'Cause you were so damn easy
I am Bow Weezy
Lil' mama, you so fine
What's it gonna take for you to be mine?
Now let me upgrade ya
Don't listen to your friends, they haters
And umm, them guys so lame
I'm way in biz, they not the same
I am, far from a beginner
Put some on your wrist, cold like winter
Pay no limit on the black cars
Anything you want, baby, it's yours
You now rollin' with the best, baby
Plus, I know how to treat you, lady
They call me the modern LL Cool J
All I do is write girl bills
Bow Weezy, hot like a sauna
Me and Paula
Now everybody on us
Holla back
Uh-oh
Got them going crazy, you see 
Head over heels for me, oh 
Weak in the knees for me, boy 
'Cause you were so damn easy
Uh-oh
Got them going crazy, you see 
Head over heels for me, oh 
Weak in the knees for me, boy 
'Cause you were so damn easy 
Don't be so damn easy
Don't be so damn easy
