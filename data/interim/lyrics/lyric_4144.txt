The best things in life are free
But you can give it to the birds and bees
I need money
That's what I want, hey
I need money, that's what I want
That's what I want
Your love give me such a thrill
But your love won't pay my bills
I need money
That's what I want
Hey
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
Money can't buy everything, it's true
But what it don't buy, I can't use
I need money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
Hey
Give me money
That's what I want
I need money
That's what I want
