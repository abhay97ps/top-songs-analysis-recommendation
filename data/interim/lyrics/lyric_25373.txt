24 seconds, yeah, you better not stop
You got 24 seconds, can you beat the shot clock?
What you waitin' on, lil' daddy? I ain't got that much time
You seem anxious, you seem adamant but you ain't pressed my line
Wondering why, why, why 
Know you ain't shy, shy, shy 
I'ma say bye, bye, bye, better know I won't think twice 
Better let go of your pride 
Do it now , just do it now , oh yeah
When that nigga pull up on me, tell that nigga back, back
Don't you know all of these niggas wish that they could bag that?
I'm just saying, boy, you're playing, you're gon' let it wind down
You got 24 seconds and it's starting right now
Shot clock
Shot clock
Shot clock
Shot clock
Five years of dating, tired of being patient
What the fuck you're waiting for? Oh, yeah
It's a lot of niggas hating and I don't entertain 'em
But damn, you gotta give me more
Oh-ohh, if you don't want it like me
I could think about a hundred things I could be doing right now
Than wasting my time with you, oh 
Okay, okay, since you gotta have it your way 
I'm have to start that clock on you 
We gon' see what's up
When that nigga pull up on me, tell that nigga back, back
Don't you know all of these niggas wish that they could bag that?
I'm just saying, boy, you're playing, you're gon' let it wind down 
You got 24 seconds and it's starting right now 
Shot clock
Shot clock 
Shot clock
Shot clock, shot clock
Shot clock
24 seconds
You got 24 seconds
You gon' miss your opportunity
Shot clock
L, Love
Add "-rs" and that's surely what we are
Flip it 'round, add "-ve" and let's see if this goes far
Full of chuckles and cuddles and sometimes, eye puddles
Compose love like we're Mozart
