Girl, you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Wha, wha, why?
You tell me that you need me, but then you wanna leave me
And never make your way to the door
I tell you that you're too much and that I'll miss you too much
Don't even know what we're fighting for
You keep my car, girl, and then you go get it fixed
I talk all them other chicks just to make you jealous
How can we make it right when we both put up a fit?
You make me so mad it's kind of hard to forgive
But when I look into your pretty eyes
My heart just drops
Girl, you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Wha, wha, why?
You always talking reckless sending a text message
Telling me to pack and get goin'
And then I get a call a minute you sounded so innocent
Saying that you can't sleep alone
I'll go find every receipt to show how you spend all my dough
You wanna go inside my room and burn all of my clothes
How can we make it right when we put up a fit
You make me so mad it's kind of hard to forgive
But when I look into your pretty eyes
My heart just drops
Girl, you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Wha, wha, why?
Calling it quits just ain't what we were built for
I'd rather love you than to hate you, girl
I, I want you to know
You're my, you're my
You're my shawty
Say you're my, you're my
You're my shawty
Girl, you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Wha, wha, why?
Girl, you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, dum bee dum, dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, dum bee dum, dumb
Wha, wha, why?
