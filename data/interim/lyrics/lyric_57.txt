Alright you chipmunks, ready to sing your song?
I'd say we are
Yeah, let's sing it now
Okay, Simon?
OK
Okay, Theodore?
OK
Okay Alvin? Alvin? Alvin?!
Okay!
Christmas, Christmas time is near
Time for toys and time for cheer
We've been good, but we can't last
Hurry Christmas, hurry fast
Want a plane that loops the loop
Me, I want a hula-hoop
We can hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late
Ok, fellas, get ready
That was very good, Simon
Naturally!
Very good, Theodore
Hahahaha
Uh Alvin, you were a little flat
Watch it, Alvin—Alvin? Alvin?!
Okay!
Want a plane that loops the loop
I still want a hula-hoop
We can hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late
We can hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late
Very good, boys
Let's sing it again
Yeah, let's sing it again
No, that's enough, let's not overdo it
What do you mean overdo it?
We want to sing it again
Now wait a minute, boys
Yeah, why can't we sing it again?
Alvin, cut the c—Theodore, just a m—Simon, cut that out—boys
