Don't start now
Not unless you're gonna love me
Ooh, wee, you've got to love me all the way
Don't touch me, baby
Don't even call me on the phone
I can't have you love me one minute, baby
And the next minute leave me all alone
I can't stand for you to leave me
Once I'm used to having you around
If you're going to pick me up, baby
You gotta stick by me when I'm down
I just wanna tell you one more time
Don't start now, not unless you're gonna love me
Ooh, wee, you've got to love me all the way
It's not my fault
I've been hurt like this before
Please try and understand if you can
I can't take it
I just can't take it no more
I just wanna tell you one more time
Don't start now, not unless you're gonna love me
Ooh, wee, you've got to love me all the way
