Yeah
Uh
Future
Wakin' 
I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich 
I go so hard with these riches 
I fell in love with this dodie 
I fell in love with the Rollie 
I wake up, pray every morning 
These demons, they callin' my soul 
I said fuck all of you hoes 
I'm ballin' outta control 
I'm ballin' outta control 
If I could give everything back to you
All this passion I got, all I ever need 
For me to move on and succeed 
For me to move on and succeed 
Jealousy, envy, and greed 
Too much of this shit, I don't need it
I turned on the gas with a nickel-plated 
I sit back and laugh 'cause these niggas traitors 
Mentally, none of this shit can faze me 
Mentally, none of this shit can faze me 
I came out the trenches, I really made it 
I came out the gutter, I really made it 
I stack up the butter, I gotta save it 
Stack up the cheddar, you gotta save it 
Shoot out the carbine, no lovey-dovey 
These bitches, they lookin' for hubby-hubby 
I'm lookin' for paper in any city 
I got a bitch located in every city
Gotta have them sticks on us in every city 
Take the private 'cause lately, out here, we gettin' it 
Spent like seven-hundred thousand on both the Bentleys 
I got love for the city, I jugg and get it 
I wake up on a daily basis
I count the money, man, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love with the dodie
I fell in love with the Rollie
Wake up and pray every morning
Demons, they callin' my soul 
I said fuck all of you hoes 
I'm ballin' outta control 
I'm ballin' outta control 
I'm ballin' outta control 
I'm ballin' outta control 
I need acknowledgement 
If I got it, then tell me I got it then 
I'm ballin' outta control 
Keep on receiving the scholarships 
Mayor comin' to the house 
Nigga, please, watch your mouth 
I'm the one without a doubt , yeah
And I rock Kentucky blue on these hoes
Drafted, I'm gettin' choosed by these hoes
Usually, they just leave when we done
I don't wan' share no room with these hoes
Metro gon' make it boom on these hoes
And me, I just stick and move on these hoes
We got that purple rain for the pain
My niggas, we ain't change, we ain't change, yeah
I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich 
I go so hard with these riches 
I fell in love with this dodie 
I fell in love with the Rollie 
I wake up, pray every morning 
These demons, they callin' my soul 
I said fuck all of you hoes 
I'm ballin' outta control 
I'm ballin' outta control 
I'm ballin' outta control 
I'm ballin' outta control
