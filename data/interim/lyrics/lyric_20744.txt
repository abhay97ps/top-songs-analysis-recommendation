There's no other love
There's nobody else I'm thinking of
Only you baby you're special
How could I ever forget you
And let the moment slip away
We've been here for a while ha!
And I just wanna take you away
You got me doing things I never do
I can't stop feenin' and dreamin' about you oh
And about your love it feels so real to me
You know what to say
And you know just what to do 
What you got for me 
I wanna see 
I've been waitin' way too long
Don't know what I'm gon' do 
You got me going
You got me going
I can't wait no longer
My anxiety is building up
Moments turn into hours
And hours to days in my mind
Can someone tell me the time
I don't wanna wait in vain
And I don't wanna deal with the pain
You got me doin' things I never do
I can't stop feenin' and dreamin' about you oh whoa
And about your love it feels so real to me
You know what to say
And you know just what to do... 
What you got for me 
I wanna see
I've been waitin' way too long 
Don't know what I'm gon' do 
You got me going 
You got me going 
So beautiful 
Won't you let go 
I wanna know
See I got to know if you're ready
For a moment so special
And I want you closer
I don't wanna let you go 
Just let me be 
Be all that you need 
You got that thing that I want and I'm ready
Ready to give you my love 
You already know it
Girl you got me going 
What you got for me 
I wanna see 
I've been waitin' way too long
Don't know what I'm gon' do 
You got me going 
You got me going 
Know what I want from you
So what you got baby
You know I wanna see
What you can do with me
Girl If you only knew
The things that we can do
I'm ready to recieve
Just what you got for me
