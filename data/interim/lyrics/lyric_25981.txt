And I can't do my dance 'cause my pants, they from
They from France
I can't slow this
Yeah, no, I can't slow it
Fast-paced all the time 
Too much guap, bands, bands, bad lil' foreign, ten, ten
She ignore that man, fuckin' with me, handstand
I can't lie, she got that good, but that girl bad, bad
I stay with a bag, bag, make that girl dance, dance 
Yeah, what is mine? That is yours
You can't hold my Lam', yes, I own my land
Stacking this paper, you know that I get it up
I can't be broke again
Talkin' that shit, then that Glocky gon' hit it up
Headshot soak his mans
My choppa get hot just like a pan
Knock your headlights just like a ram
I got ten toes and I count up, ten fingers
So I do not need an, um, helping hand
Monopoly crib, I'm movin' again
Got your bitch on me, she groovin' again 
Lamborghini just give them a reason to hate
So my niggas shootin' again
My coupe, my roof, drop that shit again
She sucked my dick then she mopped up my friend
No, we do not wanna feel tooth again
When she let me go, I'm on the loose again
She on the molly, she tryna boot again
She ain't even mine, this girl is a lend
I prayed every time when I thought you sinned
I write in my mind, I don't use a pen 
She givin' me time, my watch cost a Lam'
Just give me more time, other watch cost a Benz 
Look at Lil Uzi, he poppin' again
Them niggas, they switchin', they hoppin' again 
Look at them niggas, they oppin' again
She give me that top and she sloppin' again 
Look at his album, it's floppin' again
Not takin' a break, I'm not stoppin' again 
Too much guap, bands, bands, bad lil' foreign, ten, ten 
She ignore that man, fuckin' with me, handstand 
I can't lie, she got that good, but that girl bad, bad 
I stay with a bag, bag, make that girl dance, dance 
Yeah, what is mine? That is yours
You can't hold my Lam', yes, I own my land
Stackin' this paper, you know that I get it up
I can't be broke again
Talkin' that shit, then that Glocky gon' hit it up
Headshot soak his mans
Woah, spent a hundred thousand on a brand new pointer choker 
Automatic gun's got a motor
I can feel that shit in my shoulder 
Brand new watch cost a quarter
And you know it's flooded in water
You know every day I'm gettin' older
But I'm young enough for your daughter 
And you know my neck is flooded in boulders 
Gettin' money, yeah, that's my quota 
Even though Lil Uzi gettin' older 
Know I'm young enough for your daughter 
Every time I'm in my mind, I focus 
She give me head, hypnosis 
Talkin' 'bout the love can't hold me 
Talkin' 'bout the guap can't fold me
Uh, uh, talkin' 'bout "You're mine," no, you don't own me
Yeah, just take your time, and gotta be colder
Yeah, it's on my mind and they just know me 
Yeah, fast-paced all the time and I can't slow it 
Too much guap, bands, bands, bad lil' foreign, ten, ten
She ignore that man, fuckin' with me, handstand
I can't lie, she got that good, but that girl bad, bad
I stay with a bag, bag, make that girl dance, dance 
Yeah, what is mine? That is yours
You can't hold my Lam', yes, I own my land
Stacking this paper, you know that I get it up
I can't be broke again
Talkin' that shit, then that Glocky gon' hit it up
Headshot soak his mans 
Hello? Hello? Where am I?
