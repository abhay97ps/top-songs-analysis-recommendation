When my friends say that you're a run-around
I laugh at all and I tell them
That's why they lie but I'm a worried guy
You said last night you had to stay at home
Then how come you didn't answer the phone
That boy don't cry but I'm a worried guy
I never been unfaithful to you
So if you got a cheatin' heart you'll break my heart in two
Won't you tell me the stories that I hear
Are nothing but the silly rumors
Tell then oh my I'm just a worried guy
That boy don't cry but I'm a worried guy
I never been unfaithful to you...
I'm just a worried guy I'm just a worried guy
I'm just a worried guy I'm just a worried guy
