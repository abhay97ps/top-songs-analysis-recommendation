Going 'round in circles
Circles
Going 'round in circles
Ooh, ah, you're taking too much time to make up your mind
Either you love me or you don't
And all the other girls in your crazy mixed-up world
You said you'd drop them, but you know you won't
Sometimes I think about forgetting you
But it's so, so hard to make that choice
'Cause, boy, with you
I go to to seventh Heaven
Just by the sound of your voice
Circles
Going 'round in circles 
Circles
Going 'round in circles
Ooh, out of my head, that's where I'm going
Trying so hard to deal with you
It's not so easy trying to bear these changes
Ooh, boy, that you're putting me through
In my head, there's a ball of confusion
And I can't figure out just what to do
I guess my life will keep on going 'round and 'round
Until I get away from you

Circles, oh
Out of my mind, that's where I'm going
Trying so hard to deal with you
It's not so easy trying to bear these changes
Ooh, boy, that you're putting me through
In my head, there's a ball of confusion
And I can't figure out just what to do
I guess my life will keep on going 'round and 'round
Until I get away from you, oh
