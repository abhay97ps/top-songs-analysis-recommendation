Star light, star bright
First star I see tonight
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have the wish I wish tonight
Star light, star bright
First star I see tonight
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have the wish I wish tonight
Shine down, star light
Please help to make this our night
The one I love will be here soon
Please shine above and bring the moon
If he should take me riding
Far away from the city
Cover me with your magic glow
Make him think I'm oh so pretty
Star light, star bright
First star I see tonight
Can't you hear my wish to you
Won't you help my dreams come true
Star light, star bright
First star I see tonight
Can't you hear my plea to you
Won't you make my dreams come true
Ohh that pretty star light
Hey look at that star light
