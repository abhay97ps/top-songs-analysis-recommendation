Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ahh, yeah
I live my life like there's no tomorrow
And all I've got I had to steal
Least I don't need to beg or borrow
Yes, I'm livin' at a pace that kills
Ooh, yeah
Ah, Ah-ha yeah, whoo-hoo-ooh
I'll tell y'all about it
I found the simple life ain't so simple
When I jumped out on that road
I got no love, no love you'd call real
Ain't got nobody waitin' at home
Ahh, yeah
God damn it lady, you know I ain't lying to ya
I'm only gonna tell you one time
Aah, yeah
Yes I am
Yeah
Whoo
Whoo
You know Iâ€”
I found the simple life, weren't so simple, no
When I jumped out on that road
Got no love, no love you'd call real
Got nobody waiting at home
Woo
