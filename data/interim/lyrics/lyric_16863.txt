I got a call
A telephone call today
Somebody’s offering a job
A thousand miles away
And I want to take it
It’s the opportunity of a lifetime
But I need a second opinion
An opinion other than mine
Pre-Chorus - Darnell
So I
I’m turning to you
Because you always seem to know what to do
When times like these arrive
I call on my only true friend in the world
My girl
So I
I want to know
If you really want me to go
And if so
Are you coming with me?
I
I want to know
Should I really, really go
And if so
Come with me
Verse 2 - Garfield 
I never wanted anything as much
As I want you with me
You were the one who said to follow my dreams
(Of having a house
A car
A view of the stars)
And a beautiful wife
So I need someone I can go with
I need some love in my life
Pre-Chorus - Darnell
So I
I’m turning to you
Because you always seem to know what to do
When times like these arrive
I call on the only real love of my life
You are my life, my life, my life babe
So I
I want to know 
If you really want me to go 
And if so 
Are you coming with me? 
I
I want to know 
Should I really, really go
And if so
Come with me 
I need you to
