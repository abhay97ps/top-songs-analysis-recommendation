Mustard on the beat, ho
I make shit look easy, but they don't know what it take 
Don't ask me the time, I got baguettes in the face 
Virgil dropped some Louis, I want everything he made 
When it come to hoes, I never be the one to save
Keep on throwing ones, these bitches keep on showing ass
Bitches on my body and I'm just tryna relax
They always come off cool but in the end they come out wack 
Her boyfriend getting mad, I told her he could take you back
Have you ever been with a boss?
I know your boyfriend took you shopping at Ross
I'm always dripping, I leave puddles when I walk 
If she don't know how to dress, I don't wanna talk 
But I might still get some top
I don't need a belt, my pockets full of knots
Number one, there's finally real ones at the top 
I'm with Mustard and we talking Lambo' talk 
I make shit look easy but they don't know what it take 
Don't ask me the time, I got baguettes in the face 
Virgil dropped some Louis, I want everything he made 
When it come to hoes, I never be the one to save
Keep on throwing ones, these bitches keep on showing ass
Bitches on my body and I'm just tryna relax
They always come off cool but in the end they come out wack 
Her boyfriend getting mad, I told her he could take you back
Yeah, I just pulled up, I got some new shit 
I just pulled up, I got a new bitch 
My bitch, she bad, I bought her a bracelet 
Iced-up 'guette on my necklace 
I pull up and shake shit 
I pull up and break shit 
I just told my mom, "Thank God I made it" 
We got money over here, we startin' to pay, bitch 
I got old school, yeah, in the backyard 
In the black car 
I'm a black boy 
What's your net, boy? Huh
Check this neck, boy 
Got these black diamonds 
On baguettes, boy 
I make shit look easy but they don't know what it take 
Don't ask me the time, I got baguettes in the face 
Virgil dropped some Louis, I want everything he made 
When it come to hoes, I never be the one to save
Keep on throwing ones, these bitches keep on showing ass
Bitches on my body and I'm just tryna relax
They always come off cool but in the end they come out wack 
Her boyfriend getting mad, I told her he could take you back
Huh, me and your bitch up in the Phantom
If you want her back, you better man up
I know you just don't understand her
She just want you to help her get her bands up
Oh, nah, nah, nah, ayy
Just ride my wave like a tsunami
I came from the jungle, from a safari
I don't want no Nicki, I want a ménage à
Don't give me no hickies, baby, give me sloppy
I already seen you naked, girl, I know your body
You like fucking with the lights off, on some shy shit
You gon' end up being famous if you talk about it
I make shit look easy but they don't know what it take 
Don't ask me the time, I got baguettes in the face 
Virgil dropped some Louis, I want everything he made 
When it come to hoes, I never be the one to save
Keep on throwing ones, these bitches keep on showing ass
Bitches on my body and I'm just tryna relax
They always come off cool but in the end they come out wack 
Her boyfriend getting mad, I told her he could take you back
