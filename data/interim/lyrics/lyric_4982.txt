OPENING CREDITS
CUT TO: INT. ELLE’S ROOM
"Perfect Day" by Hoku plays as the credits play over shots of Elle getting ready for her day while a woman rides a bike through the CULA campus to the Delta Nu sorority. The woman arrives at Delta Nu and hands a letter addressed to Elle to one of Elle’s sorority sisters. The camera follows the sister through the sorority as we are treated to shots of Elle’s things. Other sisters sign the card for Elle. Finally, two of Elle’s sisters, Serena and Margot, pass the envelope underneath her door. Elle’s dog Bruiser goes for the letter and brings it to her. She’s talking on the phone.
ELLE: I love that restaurant! I heard Madonna went into labor there. Oh, gosh! I have to go shopping! I'll see you tonight. Bye.
Elle hangs up her phone.
ELLE: Bruiser, what's this?
She takes the letter out and reads it.
ELLE: "Good luck tonight. Elle and Warner forever." Oh, that's so cute.
She blows a kiss to a framed photo of Warner.
CUT TO: EXT. COMMON AREA
Elle approaches Serena and Margot.
ELLE: Oh, my gosh! You guys are so sweet! But I'm not positive it'll happen tonight.
SERENA: Hello! He just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got the rock.
MARGOT: Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six-carat diamond.
ELLE: Do you really think?
SERENA: I can't believe you're getting engaged!
ELLE: Oh, my gosh… you guys have to help me pick out the perfect outfit.
CUT TO: INT. BOUTIQUE
Bruiser watches from Elle’s purse as Serena and Margot help Elle pick out a dress.
MARGOT: Come on! I think you should go with the red. It's the color of confidence.
SERENA: I don't understand why you're disregarding your signature color.
ELLE: He's proposing. I can't look like I would on any other date. This is the date. The night I'll always remember. I want to look special. Bridal. But not like I expect anything.
One of the store employees watches them and turns to one of her coworkers.
EMPLOYEE: There's nothing I love more than a dumb blonde with daddy's plastic.
She rips the tag off of a red dress and brings it over to Elle.
EMPLOYEE: Did you see this one? We just got it in yesterday.
ELLE: Is this low-viscosity rayon?
EMPLOYEE: Yes. Of course.
ELLE: With a half-loop top-stitching on the hem?
EMPLOYEE: Absolutely. It's one of a kind.
Elle hands the dress back.
ELLE: It's impossible to use a half-loop top-stitching on low-viscosity rayon. It would snag the fabric. And you didn't just get it in. I saw it in the June Vogue a year ago. So if you're trying to sell it  to me for full price you picked the wrong girl.
The employee’s face falls.
MARGOT: Ow.
The employee walks away. Elle’s sisters join her in front of the mirror.
ELLE: Girls, this is it. In a few hours I'll be the future Mrs. Warner Huntington III.
They all get excited.
CUT TO: EXT. DELTA NU
Warner knocks on the door of the sorority. One of the sisters answers and lets him in.
WARNER: Hello.
He walks further in. Elle comes down the stairs in a red dress, accompanied by Bruiser.
WARNER: Wow. You look so beautiful.
ELLE: So do you.
The camera pans to show many of the sorority sisters watching the couple from a few feet away. Elle and Warner kiss.
WARNER: Let's get out of here.
Warner walks away as Elle and her sisters watch. They help her with some last minute preparations and ogle as she leaves.
CUT TO: INT. RESTAURANT
Elle and Warner sit at a table in a restaurant. A waiter opens a bottle of wine for them and pours it.
ELLE: Must be strange having such perfect eyes.
WARNER: God, you're so wonderful. Elle, thank you.
ELLE: Here's to us.
WARNER: To us.
They clink their wine glasses together.
WARNER: Elle…
ELLE: Yes?
WARNER: One of the reasons I wanted to come here tonight was to discuss our future.
ELLE: And I am fully amenable to that discussion.
WARNER: Good. Well, you know how we've been having all kinds of fun lately?
ELLE: Yeah.
WARNER: Well, Harvard is gonna be different. Law school is a completely different world and I need to be serious.
ELLE: Of course.
WARNER: I mean, my family expects a lot from me.
ELLE: Right.
WARNER: I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office someday.
ELLE: And I fully support that, Warner. You know that.
WARNER: Absolutely. But the thing is if I'm going to be a senator by the time I'm thirty I need to stop dicking around.
ELLE: Warner, I completely agree.
WARNER: Well, that's why I think it's time for us. Elle, pooh bear...
They speak over each other.
ELLE: I do.
WARNER: I think we should break up.
There’s a pause as Elle registers what Warner has said.
ELLE: What?
WARNER: Well, I've been thinking about it, and it's the right thing to do.
ELLE: You're breaking up with me? I thought you were proposing.
WARNER: Proposing? Elle, if I'm going to be a senator, well, I need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn.
ELLE: You're breaking up with me because I'm too blonde?
WARNER: No. That's not entirely true.
ELLE: Then what? My boobs are too big?
People at other tables begin glancing over at Elle and Warner.
WARNER: Elle, your boobs are fine.
ELLE: So when you said that you would always love me you were just dicking around?
As he talks, Elle begins crying.
WARNER: Elle, I do love you. I just can't marry you. You have no idea of the pressure that I am under. My family has five generations of senators. My brother's in the top three at Yale Law. And he just got engaged to a Vanderbilt, for Christ's sake.
Elle’s distressed crying gets louder. Warner makes eye contact with one of the couples watching.
WARNER: Bad salad. Sweetie… Pooh bear?
Elle looks at him in disgust and then gets up and leaves.
WARNER: It's not like I have a choice here, sweetheart! Okay… you get the car, I'll get the check.
CUT TO: EXT. STREET
Elle is walking back to campus alone. Her crying has ruined her makeup. Warner pulls up in his car.
WARNER: Let me take you home.
ELLE: No!
WARNER: Elle, believe me. I never expected to do this… but I think it's the right thing.
ELLE: How can it be the right thing when we're not together?
WARNER: Well, I have to think of my future, and what my family expects of me.
ELLE: So you're breaking up with me… because you're afraid your family won't like me? Everybody likes me.
WARNER: Well, East coast people are different.
ELLE: Because I'm not a Vanderbilt, suddenly I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! Most people would agree that's a lot better than some stinky old Vanderbilt!
WARNER: I told you. I need someone serious.
ELLE: But I'm seriously in love with you. Isn't that enough?
WARNER: Pooh bear, just get in the car.
ELLE: No.
WARNER: You’re gonna ruin your shoes.
ELLE: ...Okay.
Elle gets in the car. Cut to them arriving at Delta Nu. Elle gets out of the car and walks away. She turns to say something, but Warner has already started driving away. Cut to the next morning. A sorority sister, Amy, walks through the sorority house and knocks on Elle’s door.
AMY:  Elle, it's Amy. I'm having trouble with this whole lip-liner thing.
Another sister approaches Amy.
SISTER: Sweetie, didn't you hear?
AMY: Hear what?
SISTER: It's terrible. He dumped her.
The sister leads Amy away. Cut inside Elle’s room. She’s eating chocolate and watching an episode of General Hospital. Serena and Margot enter as she watches.
WOMAN: Why me?
MAN: Because you're not gonna remember anything after tonight.
WOMAN: Oh, you're wrong. I will remember, no matter what. And I'm never gonna lose you again.
MAN: You couldn't. You're a part of me. I love you.
ELLE: Liar!
Elle throws her chocolate at the TV.
MARGOT: Honey, you have to leave this room. It's been, like, a week.
ELLE: So?
MARGOT: Drink this.
Margot hands her a drink.
SERENA: What’s the one thing that always makes us feel better no matter what?
CUT TO: INT. SALON
Serena and Margot are getting manicures. Serena talks to the manicurist.
SERENA: She had eight grilled cheese sandwiches. She stuffed them in her mouth all at once. It was so sad. We all thought she'd be the first to walk down the aisle and now she's totally adrift.
MARGOT: Totally.
SERENA: She hasn't conditioned her hair in a week.
Elle sits on a nearby couch next to another woman. Elle picks up a magazine and begins reading.
MARGOT: Maybe she's going for the grunge look. And her nails are full-on chipped. So trailer park.
SERENA:  She’ll never get him back with those cuticles.
MANICURIST:  No shit.
Elle turns a page in the magazine she’s reading. Her eyes go wide.
ELLE: Oh, my God! Do you know who this is?
She turns to the woman next to her.
WOMAN: No.
ELLE: That's Warner's older brother!
WOMAN: Who?
ELLE: "Third year Yale Law student Putnam Bowes Huntington III and his fiancee Layne Walker Vanderbilt, first year Yale Law." This is the type of girl that Warner wants to marry! This is what I need to become to be serious!
WOMAN: What, practically deformed?
ELLE: No. A law student.
Elle leaves the salon.
MARGOT: Elle?
CUT TO: EXT. POOL
Elle’s father stands over her as she sits in their pool.
ELLE’S FATHER: Law school?
ELLE: It's a perfectly respectable place, daddy.
Cut to a wider shot, revealing Elle’s mother in a chair nearby and a worker raking leaves further away.
ELLE’S MOTHER: Honey, you were first runner up at the Miss Hawaiian Tropics contest. Why are you gonna throw that all away?
ELLE: Going to Harvard is the only way I'm gonna get the love of my life back.
ELLE’S FATHER: Oh, sweetheart, you don't need law school. Law school is for people who are boring and ugly and serious. And you, button, are none of those things.
Elle sighs.
CUT TO: INT. OFFICE
Elle sits across a desk from an academic advisor. The advisor is looking at a folder of documents.
ADVISOR: Harvard Law School?
ELLE: That's right.
ADVISOR: But that's a top three school.
ELLE: Oh, I have a 4.0.
ADVISOR: Yes, but your major is fashion merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced History of Polka Dots.
The advisor sets the folder aside.
ADVISOR: What are your back-ups?
ELLE: I don't need back-ups. I'm going to Harvard.
ADVISOR: Well, then, you'll need excellent recommendations from your professors.
ELLE: Okay.
ADVISOR: And a heck of an admissions essay.
ELLE: Right.
ADVISOR: And at least a 175 on your LSATs.
ELLE: I once had to judge a tighty-whitey contest for Lambda Kappa Pi. Trust me, I can handle anything.
Elle smiles and leaves.
ELLE: Thanks!
ADVISOR: You're welcome.
CUT TO: INT. DELTA NU
Serena and Margot pass by Elle’s room.
MARGOT: Because I have a metrabolism... I have a really high metrab-
SERENA: Metabolism. Metabo-
They stop and enter Elle’s room when they see her surrounded by books and reading.
MARGOT: Oh, my God. What are you doing?
ELLE: Reading about the LSATs.
SERENA: My cousin had that. Apparently, you get a really bad rash on your-
She gestures down.
MARGOT: Oh.
ELLE: The LSATs are an exam. Girls, I'm going to Harvard!
SERENA: You mean like on vay-kay?
MARGOT: Let's all go!
SERENA & MARGOT: Road trip!
They begin cheering.
ELLE: No, I'm going to Harvard Law School!
They stop.
MARGOT: Why?
Serena sits down with Elle.
SERENA: Elle, now, I know you're upset about all this, but can't you just take a Percocet?
ELLE: Okay, once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll totally want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
MARGOT: But isn't it hard to get into law school?
ELLE: I had the highest GPA in Delta Nu.
MARGOT: Oh, well. Here, you're gonna need this.
Margot hands Elle a scrunchie.
ELLE: Your scrunchie?
MARGOT: My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.
SERENA: You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a lap dance after the final.
MARGOT: Yeah, luckily.
CUT TO: EXT. POOL
Cut to Elle’s video essay. The shot is blocked so as to imitate a VHS recording. She sits in her pool. A caption on the bottom reads, “ELLE WOODS HARVARD VIDEO ESSAY.”
ELLE: Oh, hi. My name is Elle Woods, and for my admissions essay, I'm gonna tell all of you at Harvard why I'm gonna make an amazing lawyer.
Elle narrates over a shot of herself speaking at the head of a table of her sorority sisters.
ELLE:  As president of my sorority I'm skilled at commanding the attention of a room and discussing very important issues.
Cut to a close up of Elle’s face as she addresses her sisters.
ELLE: It has come to my attention that the maintenance staff is switching our toilet paper from Charmin to generic. All those opposed to chafing please say "aye."
SORORITY:  Aye.
Elle brings down a gavel. Cut away from her video essay to Amy helping Elle study in a library.
AMY: A: Neither type of opera or neither type of rap is on sale. B: Neither type of jazz and neither type of opera is on sale. C: Neither type of opera and neither type of soul…
Elle is distracted by fraternity brothers outside, shirtless and carrying a keg and snacks.
BROTHER: Party! Delta Nu, we love you!
Amy taps her pencil on the table, getting Elle’s attention.
AMY. Mm-mm.
ELLE: Okay.
Cut back to the video essay style of shot. Elle lazes on a floatie in her pool.
ELLE: I'm able to recall hundreds of important details at the drop of a hat.
Margot enters the shot on another pool floatie.
MARGOT: Hey, Elle, do you know what happened on Days of Our Lives yesterday?
ELLE: Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we join Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano.
Cut to the Delta Nu house. Amy and some other sisters are exercising while Elle sits at a table nearby with Bruiser. Amy holds up a stopwatch.
AMY: Get set and go!
Amy starts a timer. Elle begins writing. Cut to some time later. Margot writes 143 on Elle’s practice LSAT.
MARGOT: One forty-three.
Elle sighs. Cut back to her video essay. She walks down a busy sidewalk on campus.
ELLE: I feel comfortable using legal jargon in everyday life.
Someone whistles at Elle from out of shot.
ELLE: I object!
Cut to Elle taking the LSAT in a crowded room. She looks worried. Cut back to Delta Nu. Amy runs through the sorority house, followed by all of Elle’s sisters, holding the results of Elle’s LSAT.
AMY: Elle, it's here!
Elle is walking down the stairs with Margot.
ELLE: What?
AMY: It's here!
Amy hands Elle the envelope with her score.
MARGOT: The LSAT score! It’s here!
All of her sisters gather around excitedly as she opens it.
ELLE: One seventy-nine!
All of Elle’s sisters yell out in celebration. Margot and Serena hug her and lift her up as some other sisters use spray cans and confetti.
CUT TO: INT. HARVARD
Cut back to Elle’s video essay, which is now revealed to be playing on a TV in front of a Harvard admissions board.
ELLE: And that's why you should vote for me, Elle Woods, future lawyer for the class of 2004.
One of the admissions men stops the video. All six men continue staring for a few moments before one refocuses.
ADMISSION MAN 1: She does have a 4.0 from CULA, and she got a 179 on her LSATs.
ADMISSION MAN 2: A fashion major?
ADMISSION MAN 3: Well, sir, we've never had one before, and aren't we always looking for diversity?
ADMISSION MAN 4: Her list of extracurricular activities is impressive.
ADMISSION MAN 2: She was in a Ricky Martin video.
ADMISSION MAN 1: Clearly she's interested in music.
ADMISSION MAN 2: She also designed a line of faux fur panties for her sorority's charity project.
ADMISSION MAN 3: Uh huh. She's a friend to the animals as well as a philanthropist.
ADMISSION MAN 2: Elle Woods… Welcome to Harvard.
The camera zooms in on the paused TV with Elle’s smiling face. Fade to some establishing shots of Elle driving to Harvard and of the Harvard campus itself.
CUT TO: EXT. STREET
Elle sits in her convertible. Bruiser is in the passenger seat.
ELLE: Oh Bruiser, it's so exciting! Look! Harvard! Are you excited?
Bruiser barks. Cut to some moving men unloading some of Elle’s things outside Wyeth House.
ELLE: This is our new house for the next three years.
Other students approach apprehensively.
ELLE: Oh, are you thirsty? Let's get you some water. Sweetheart, you just look parched.
Elle sets Bruiser down. All around other students begin watching Elle.
STUDENT: Hey, Brad, check out Malibu Barbie! Where's the beach, honey?
Elle sets down a bowl and begins filling it with water for Bruiser.
ELLE: Here you go. Good boy. Warner's gonna be so excited to see you.
Elle turns to the movers.
ELLE: Guys, this way.
STUDENT: This ain't L.A.!
ELLE: Come on, Bruiser.
Elle walks inside as the movers carry some of Elle’s things. Other students continue to ogle.
ELLE: It's gonna be so exciting. Now, don't be scared. Everyone will love you.
Cut to a welcome event outside. Elle approaches a table.
ELLE: Hi. Woods, comma, Elle.
The man at the table looks at her incredulously before handing her some things.
MAN: Class schedule, map, book list.
ELLE: Wait a second. My social events calendar is missing.
MAN: Your what?
ELLE: Social events? You know, mixers, formals, clambakes, trips to the Cape.
He says nothing.
ELLE: Okay, has Warner Huntington III checked in yet?
MAN: No. Maybe you should check with the cruise director on the Lido deck.
Cut to Elle sitting on the grass with some other students.
MAN: Okay, welcome to law school. This is the part where we go around in a circle and everyone says a little bit about themselves. Let's start with you.
DAVID: Uh, my name is David Kidney. I have a masters in Russian literature, a Ph.D in biochemistry, and for the last eighteen months, I've been deworming orphans in Somalia.
MAN: Awesome. What about you?
ENID: Hey. How you doin'? I'm Enid Wexler. I got a Ph.D. from Berkeley in women's studies, emphasis in the history of combat, , and last year, I single-handedly organized the march for Lesbians Against Drunk Driving.
MAN: Killer.
ENID: Thanks. Good times.
AARON: Aaron Mitchell. I graduated first in my class from Princeton. I have an I.Q. of 187, , and it's been suggested that Stephen Hawking stole his Brief History of Time from my fourth grade paper.
MAN: Cool.
ELLE: Me?
MAN: Yeah.
ELLE: Okay. Hi. I'm Elle Woods, and this is Bruiser Woods, and we're both Gemini vegetarians. I have a bachelor's degree in fashion merchandising from CULA, and I was a Zeta Lambda Nu sweetheart, president of my sorority, Delta Nu, and last year, I was homecoming queen. Oh! Two weeks ago I saw Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal and I talked her out of buying this truly heinous angora sweater. Whoever said orange was the new pink was seriously disturbed.
The other students give her strange looks.
CUT TO: INT. ELLE’S ROOM
Elle looks at herself in her mirror in her new room. Bruiser sits on her bed nearby.
ELLE: Wish me luck, Bruiser. This is my first class as a serious law student. I totally look the part.
Cut to a hallway. Elle greets other students as she walks towards her class. Suddenly, she spots Warner. After a brief moment, she walks by him. He notices and turns to her.
WARNER: Elle?
ELLE: Warner? I totally forgot you go here!
WARNER: What are you talking about? Are you here to see me?
ELLE: No, silly. I go here.
WARNER: You go where?
ELLE: Harvard. Law school.
WARNER: You got into Harvard Law?
ELLE: What, like it's hard? Oh, my gosh, Warner, it'll be so great. I'm planning this great mixer. You totally have to help me. I'm thinking like a luau, or maybe like casino night. This is gonna be just like senior year, except funner.
He stares with his mouth open, unable to say anything.
ELLE: Oh, time to go. I have to go to class, but meet me after on the benches. All right, bye!
Elle enters her class. Cut to Professor Stromwell beginning her lecture. Elle notices all of the students around her are taking notes on computers. She takes out a heart-shaped notebook.
STROMWELL: A legal education means you will learn to speak in a new language. You will be taught to achieve insight into the world around you and to sharply question what you know. The seat you have picked will be yours for the next nine months of your life. And those of you in the front row... beware.
Elle is handed an attendance sheet. Stromwell gestures to a quote on the blackboard and reads it out loud.
STROMWELL: "The law is reason free from passion." Does anyone know who spoke those immortal words?
David’s hand shoots up.
STROMWELL: Yes?
DAVID: Aristotle.
STROMWELL: Are you sure?
DAVID: Yes?
STROMWELL: Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
DAVID: I think so.
STROMWELL: What about his life?
She raps another student on the head with her pencil.
DAVID: I don't know.
STROMWELL: Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation but very little for self-doubt. And you were right. It was Aristotle.
The woman sitting next to David whispers to him.
WOMAN: Good job.
STROMWELL: Now, I assume all of you have read pages 1-48 and are now well-versed in subject matter jurisdiction. Who can tell us about Gordon vs. Steele? Let's call on someone from the hot zone.
Elle avoids eye contact and takes notes. Stromwell approaches her.
STROMWELL: Elle Woods?
ELLE: Actually, I wasn't aware that we had an assignment.
Stromwell looks at the attention and calls on another student further back.
STROMWELL: Vivian Kensington. Do you think it's acceptable that Ms. Woods is not prepared?
VIVIAN: No. I don't.
STROMWELL: Would you support my decision to ask her to leave class and to return only when she is prepared?
VIVIAN: Absolutely.
Elle looks shocked. She gathers her things and leaves.
STROMWELL: Now, Ms. Kensington, did diversity jurisdiction exist in this case?
VIVAN: No, it did not.
STROMWELL: Good. How about in the case of Owens vs. McCullogh?
CUT TO: EXT. COURTYARD
Elle huffs past Emmett, who is sitting on a bench, and sits at another bench nearby. He notices she is upset.
EMMETT: Excuse me. Are you okay?
ELLE: Yeah. Do they put you on the spot like that like, all the time?
EMMETT: The professors? Yeah, they, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
ELLE: So if you don't know the answers, they’re just gonna kick you out?
EMMETT: So you have Stromwell, huh?
ELLE: Yes! Did she do that to you, too?
EMMETT: No. But she did make me cry once. Not in class, I waited till I got back to my room, but she'll kick you right in the ball… Or wherever, you know. But, uh, yeah. She's tough. Really tough.
ELLE: Great.
EMMETT: Don't worry, though, it gets better. Who else do you have?
ELLE: I have Callahan, Royalton, and Levinthal.
EMMETT: Yeah… Let's see, speak up in Callahan's class. He really likes people that are opinionated.
ELLE: Okay.
EMMETT: And in Royalton's class… try to get a seat in the back. He tends to spits when he talks about products liability.
Elle laughs.
EMMETT: And, uh, for Levinthal, make sure you read the footnotes, cause that's where he gets a lot of his exam questions from.
ELLE: Right. Wow. I'm really glad I met you.
They both smile.
WARNER: Hey.
Elle doesn’t hear him and continues talking to Emmett.
ELLE: Are you a third year?
EMMETT: Well-
WARNER: Hey, Elle.
ELLE: Hi! Thanks for all your help.
EMMETT: Good luck.
Emmett leaves. Elle gets up and approaches Warner.
ELLE: Hi!
WARNER: Uh… So… how was your first class?
ELLE: Oh, it was good, except for this horrible preppy girl who made me look bad in front of the professor. But no biggie. You're here now. So, how was your summer?
WARNER: Good. It was good.
ELLE: Did you do anything exciting?
Vivian arrives and puts her arm around Warner.
WARNER: Hey… Have you met Vivian?
VIVIAN: Hi. Vivian Kensington.
ELLE: Do you know her?
WARNER: She's-
VIVIAN: I'm his fiancee.
Elle notices the ring on her finger.
ELLE: I'm sorry. I just hallucinated. What?
WARNER: Yeah, she was my girlfriend in prep school. And, well, we got back together this summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
VIVIAN: Warner told me all about you. You're famous at our club. But he didn't tell me you'd be here.
WARNER: Pooh bear, I didn't know she would be here.
ELLE: Excuse me.
Elle walks away.
CUT TO: EXT. STREET
Elle is driving and listening to loud music. She abruptly spins around when she notices a salon, causing a traffic jam.
ELLE: Oh, thank God!
She walks in and goes to the front desk, where Paulette is working.
ELLE: Are you free? It's an emergency.
PAULETTE: Bad day?
ELLE: You can't even imagine.
PAULETTE: Spill.
Paulette puts down what she’s doing. Elle tears up as she explains.
ELLE: I worked so hard to get into law school. I blew off Greek week to study for the LSATs. I even hired a Coppola to direct my admissions video. All to get my boyfriend Warner back. And now he's engaged to this awful girl Vivian, so it was all for nothing, and I… I just wish… I just wish I had never gone to Harvard.
PAULETTE: After you went to all that trouble.
ELLE: He's engaged! She's got the six-carat Harry Winston on her bony, unpolished finger. What am I supposed to do?
PAULETTE: You're asking the wrong girl. I mean, I'm with my guy eight years, and then one day, it's, "I met someone else. Move out."
ELLE: Oh, no. That's awful.
PAULETTE: Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I didn't even get to throw him a birthday party.
Paulette shows Elle a framed photo of her dog, Rufus.
ELLE: No!
PAULETTE: I mean, what's a girl to do? He's a guy who followed his pecker to greener pastures and I'm a middle-aged high-school dropout who's got stretch marks and a fat ass.
ELLE: That's terrible.
PAULETTE: Yep. Happens every day. So what's this Vivian got that you don't have? Three tits?
ELLE: She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
PAULETTE: Is she as pretty as you?
ELLE: She could use some mascara and some serious highlights but she's not completely unfortunate looking.
A UPS delivery man enters the salon with a package.
UPS MAN: Hello, ladies.
SALON WORKER: Hey, there.
UPS MAN: How you doing? Sign here.
Paulette stares at the UPS man. He turns and smiles at her. She smiles back and spills water all over Elle.
PAULETTE: Oh, jeez. Look what I did.
UPS MAN: See you later.
He gives Paulette one last look as he leaves.
PAULETTE: Aw, shit. Could I have been any more goddamn spastic?
Elle helps Paulette clean up.
ELLE: It's OK.
PAULETTE: Are you sure this Warner guy is, like, the one?
ELLE: Definitely. I love him.
PAULETTE: Well, if a girl like you can't hold on to her man, then there sure as hell isn't any hope for the rest of us. What are you waiting for? Steal the bastard back.
They both smile at each other.
CUT TO: INT. HARVARD CLASSROOM
Professor Callahan is giving a lecture.
CALLAHAN: I should warn you that in addition to competing against each other for the top grade in this class you will also be competing for one of my firm's highly coveted four internship spots next year where you will get to assist on actual cases. Let the bloodbath begin. Now, let's commence with our usual torture. Ms. Woods, would you rather have a client who committed a crime malum in se or malum prohibitum?
ELLE: Neither.
CALLAHAN: And why is that?
ELLE: I would rather have a client who's innocent.
CALLAHAN: Dare to dream, Ms. Woods. Ms. Kensington, which would you prefer?
VIVIAN: Malum prohibitum. Because then the client would have committed a regulatory infraction as opposed to a dangerous crime.
CALLAHAN: Well done, Ms. Kensington. You've obviously done your homework. Now let us look at malum prohibitum a little more closely. It has been said...
He sees Elle’s raised hand.
CALLAHAN:  Yes, Ms. Woods?
ELLE: I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one 'cause I'm not afraid of a challenge.
She smirks at Vivian, whose smile drops.
CUT TO: EXT. FIELD
A group of students is playing football. Elle sits down with Bruiser and her notes. Warner runs with the football, but all of his teammates are distracted by Elle and stop playing.
WARNER: Guys?
ELLE: Hi!
CUT TO: INT. LIBRARY
Warner, Vivian, and some other students are studying at a table. Elle approaches with a basket of muffins.
ELLE: Hi, everybody.
WARNER: Elle, what are you doing here?
ELLE: I've come to join your study group. Look, I brought sustenance. Who's first?
Vivian shakes her head.
VIVIAN: Our group is full.
She gives Warner a look. He avoids her gaze.
ELLE: Oh, is this like an RSVP thing?
STUDENT: No. It's like a smart people thing. And as Viv said, we're full.
WARNER: Come on, guys, we can make room for one more.
Vivian kicks Warner under the table.
WARNER: Ow!
VIVIAN: We've already assigned the outlines. The answer is no.
The other students avoid looking at Elle.
ELLE: Oh, okay. I'll just leave, then.
VIVIAN: Bye.
Elle turns and walks away. As she goes, she passes by a group of women studying, including Enid.
ENID: Hey, maybe there's, like, a sorority you could, like, join instead, like?
ELLE: You know, if you had come to a rush party, I would have at least been nice to you.
ENID: Oh, is that before you voted against me and then called me a dyke behind my back?
ELLE: I don't use that word. You must have heard it from Vivian.
Vivian looks up and frowns.
CUT TO: INT. ELLE’S ROOM
Elle enters her room in a bathrobe carrying Bruiser. She picks up her phone and calls Margot. Throughout the call, shots switch back and forth between Elle in her room and Margot trying out wedding dresses with Serena.
MARGOT: Hello?
ELLE: Hey, it's me.
MARGOT: It's Elle! Guess what I'm doing right this second!
ELLE: I don't know. What?
MARGOT: I'm picking out my wedding dress!
ELLE: What?
MARGOT: Josh proposed!
Margot hands the phone to Serena.
SERENA: Did you get the rock yet?
ELLE: Um, almost.
SERENA: Well, hurry up, so you can come home! We miss you!
ELLE: I miss you guys, too. The people here are so vile. Hardly anybody speaks to me unless-
SERENA: Oh, my God! I almost forgot to tell you!
ELLE: What?
SERENA: I got bangs! My hair is so now.
ELLE: Really?
MARGOT: Okay, so just listen to me. Keep June 1st open, you're one of my bridesmaids, and give Warner our love because I'm getting married! I’m getting mar-
Margot trips and falls over. Serena hangs up. Elle puts down her phone.
CUT TO: INT. HARVARD
Vivian is standing in a hallway with the three other students.
VIVIAN: So don't forget. Eight o'clock at 45 Dunston Street. It'll be a really nice party.
STUDENT: We'll be there.
VIVIAN: Oh, and don't forget to bring your own merlot!
Elle hears this from in her room.
ELLE: No way! Is somebody at this school actually having a party?
Elle leaves her room. Her face falls when she realizes it’s Vivian and one of her friends from the study group.
FRIEND: Yes.
VIVIAN: But it's a costume party. You probably wouldn't want to come.
Vivian’s friend gives her some side-eye.
ELLE: I love costume parties.
VIVIAN: Oh. Well, then I guess we'll see you there.
ELLE: Okay.
VIVIAN: Oh, at 45 Dunston Street.
Vivian and her friend leave. Bruiser growls.
CUT TO: EXT. STREET AT NIGHT
Elle arrives at the party dressed as a Playboy Bunny. Cut to inside the party. Enid is playing foosball. The camera pans up to reveal no one else is in costume. Enid notices Elle.
ENID: Oh, my God.
Elle assesses the situation. Everyone is staring at her. She smiles and walks to Vivian and her friend. Vivian does a spit take when she sees Elle’s costume.
ELLE: Thanks for inviting me, girls. This party is super fun.
VIVIAN: Nice outfit.
ELLE: Oh, I like your outfit, too. Except when I dress up as a frigid bitch, I try not to look so constipated.
Elle walks away.
VIVIAN: Oh, she's horrible.
FRIEND: You've got the ring, sweetie.
Elle walks through the party.
STUDENT: Nice ears.
ELLE: How you doin'?
Elle happens upon Enid and Warner talking.
ENID: Warner, Warner, the English language, it is all about subliminal domination. I mean, take the word semester, okay? A perfect example of this school's discriminatory preference of semen to ovaries. That's why I'm petitioning to have next term be referred to as the winter ovester.
Elle approaches and interrupts.
ELLE: Excuse me. Hey, Warner.
WARNER: Wow! Well, don't you look like a walking felony?
Enid scoffs and leaves.
ELLE: Thank you. You're so sweet. Are you having fun?
WARNER: I am now. What's with the costume?
ELLE: Oh, I just decided to dress up.
WARNER: Really.
ELLE: You know, I feel like we barely get to see each other since we've been here.
WARNER: Oh, I know. I'm so busy with these case studies and hypos.
ELLE: I know what you mean. I can't imagine doing all this and Callahan's internship next year. That's gonna be so much.
WARNER: Elle, come on, you'll never get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough, sweetie.
ELLE: Wait, am I on glue, or did we not get into the same law school?
WARNER: Yeah, but-
ELLE: But what? We took the same LSATs, and we're taking the same classes.
WARNER: I know, but come on, Elle, be serious. You can do something more valuable with your time.
ELLE: I'm never going to be good enough for you, am I?
They say nothing for a moment. Elle leaves.
WARNER: Oh, come on.
ELLE: Just forget it!
Elle walks through the party.
ELLE: I'll show you how valuable Elle Woods can be!
CUT TO: INT. STORE
Elle stands in a line of people at a store. She’s still in her costume and is holding a computer. Emmett comes into line behind her. He clears his throat. Elle turns and sees him.
ELLE: Don't ask.
EMMETT: Wasn't gonna.
CUT TO: INT. ELLE’S ROOM
Elle sits at her desk typing a paper with her new computer.
CUT TO: EXT. CAMPUS
Elle walks past Warner and Vivians study group talking outside. She’s carrying a load of books. They notice as she walks past, but she just keeps walking.
STUDENT: Was she carrying books?
CUT TO: INT. LIBRARY
Elle struggles to reach a book on a tall shelf. David happens to be there and helps her get it.
ELLE: Thanks!
CUT TO: INT. STROMWELL’S CLASSROOM
STROMWELL: So, you've filed a claim. What next?
David appears to be dozing off.
STROMWELL: Ms. Woods?
David jerks to attention when he hears Stromwell call on Elle.
ELLE: Don't you need to have evidence?
Vivian and her friend share snide glances.
STROMWELL: Meaning?
ELLE: Meaning you need reasonable belief that your claim should have, like, evidentiary support?
Stromwell looks surprised.
STROMWELL: And what kind of evidentiary support does this case require?
CUT TO: INT. ELLE’S ROOM
Bruiser is watching a video of chihuahuas on Elle’s TV. Elle is studying on an elliptical. She changes the channel to the news.
CUT TO: INT. SALON
Elle studies while she’s getting a perm with Paulette and Bruiser.
CUT TO: INT. CALLAHAN’S CLASSROOM
Callahan is giving a lecture.
CALLAHAN: And the purpose of diminished capacity is?
Elle raises her hand higher than Vivian and Warner. Callahan calls on her.
ELLE: To negate mens rea?
Callahan nods. Vivian and Warner look annoyed.
CUT TO: EXT. JUNKYARD
Elle drives into a junkyard with Bruiser and Paulette.
ELLE: Are you ready?
PAULETTE: No.
ELLE: Yes, you are! Go. You can do this.
Paulette approaches her ex’s trailer while practicing what she’s going to say.
PAULETTE: Listen to me, Dewey. You shut your mouth. No, you shut your big mouth. I'm doing all the talking.
Paulette knocks on the door. Her ex, Dewey, answers.
DEWEY: What the hell do you want? We're eating lunch.
PAULETTE: I just thought that...
DEWEY: You just thought-
PAULETTE: Maybe we could…
He walks towards her.
DEWEY: -you could come here and show me what I'm definitely not missing?
Dewey chuckles. Elle peeks her head out from a corner and watches the exchange.
PAULETTE: That's not why I came by.
DEWEY: Hey, Paulette, how many times are you gonna come over here begging me to take you back, huh?
Elle puts on her glasses.
PAULETTE: I was… Um… I…
ELLE: Dewey Newcombe?
DEWEY: Who's asking?
ELLE: I'm Elle Woods. Miss Bonifante's attorney. And I’m here to discuss the legal situation at hand.
DEWEY: Come again?
ELLE: Do you understand what subject matter jurisdiction is?
DEWEY: No.
ELLE: Yeah, I didn’t think so. Well, due to habeas corpus, you and Miss Bonifante had a common law marriage. Which heretofore, entitles her to what is legally referred to as equitable division of the assets.
DEWEY: Come again?
ELLE: Due to the fact that you've retained this residence Miss Bonifante is entitled to full canine property ownership and will be enforcing said ownership right now.
DEWEY: Huh?
ELLE: Tell him, Paulette.
Dewey chuckles. Paulette steels herself.
PAULETTE: I'm taking the dog, dumbass!
Cut back to the car. Paulette, Elle, and the newly emancipated Rufus all get in.
ELLE: That's awesome! We did it! Oh, my gosh, did you see him? He's probably still scratching his head.
PAULETTE: Yeah, which must be a nice vacation for his balls.
They both laugh and pet their respective dogs.
PAULETTE: Thank you.
CUT TO: INT. CALLAHAN’S CLASSROOM
Warner is answering a question.
WARNER: Well according to Swinney vs. Neubert, Swinney, who was also a private sperm donor was allowed visitation rights as long as he came to terms with the hours set forth by the parents. So, if we're sticking to past precedent, Mr. Latimer wasn't stalking. He was clearly within his rights to ask for visitation.
CALLAHAN: But Swinney was a one-time sperm donor, and our defendant was a habitual sperm donor who also happens to be harassing the parents in his quest for visitation.
WARNER: Well, yeah, but without this man's sperm, the child in question wouldn't exist.
CALLAHAN: Now you're thinking like a lawyer.
Vivian and her friend smile and take notes. Elle raises her hand.
CALLAHAN: Yes, Ms. Woods?
ELLE: Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of every sperm emission made throughout his life.
CALLAHAN: Interesting. Why do you ask?
ELLE: Well, unless the defendant attempted to contact every single one-night stand to determine if a child resulted in those unions, he has no parental claim over this child whatsoever. Why now? Why this sperm?
As she talks, we see shots of Emmett and David, who both seem to take what she says into consideration.
CALLAHAN: I see your point.
ELLE: And for that matter, all masturbatory emissions where his sperm was clearly not seeking an egg could be termed reckless abandonment.
CALLAHAN: I believe you've just won your case.
Warner, Vivian, and Vivian’s friend all look annoyed. Cut to the end of class. As all of the students leave, Callahan stops Elle.
CALLAHAN: Ms. Woods, you did well today.
ELLE: Really?
CALLAHAN: You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
ELLE: I don't know.
CALLAHAN: You should. Do you have a resume?
ELLE: Yes, I do. Here it is.
She searches through her bag and pulls it out.
CALLAHAN: It's pink.
ELLE: And it's scented. I think it gives it a little something extra. Don’t you think?
He says nothing.
ELLE: Okay, well, see you next class.
Elle leaves. Emmett approaches Callahan.
CALLAHAN: Do you think she woke up one morning and said, "I think I'll go to law school today."
EMMETT: Well, that lapse in judgment aside, I think she's got a lot of potential. Here's the Windham file.
Emmett hands Callahan a folder.
CALLAHAN: Smell this.
Callahan hands Emmett Elle’s resume. He sniffs it.
EMMETT: What's that?
CALLAHAN: It's her resume.
EMMETT: Smells good.
CUT TO: INT. SALON
As it snows outside, Elle and Paulette sit inside the salon. They sit watching the snow for a few moments and then drink. Cut to later in the year with an establishing shot of the school in spring.
CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY
A number of students are gathered around something. Elle approaches David in the crowd.
ELLE: What's going on?
DAVID: Callahan's firm is defending a murder trial. His caseload is so big, he's taking on first year interns.
ELLE: He picked them already?
David nods.
VIVIAN: My God, I can't believe it, Warner! We got it!
Vivian and Warner kiss. Elle pushes past them.
STUDENT: That only leaves one for…
Elle makes it to the front and sees the list. In order, the internships have been awarded to Warner, Vivian, Enid, and Elle. Elle gasps when she sees her name and spins around, smiling.
ELLE: Me! Yes!
Vivian and Warner both shoot her looks. Enid approaches her from behind, surprised. Elle turns to Warner and approaches him.
ELLE: Oh, Warner. Do you remember when we spent those four amazing hours in the hot tub after winter formal?
WARNER: Yeah- No.
ELLE: This is so much better than that! Excuse me. I have some shopping to do.
Elle walks away from them.
VIVIAN: Four hours?
CUT TO: INT. LAW FIRM
Cut to an establishing shot of Boston. Inside of Callahan’s firm, Elle, Warner, and Vivian get out of elevators. Warner grunts and walks away.
ELLE: You look very nice today, Vivian.
VIVIAN: Thank you.
ELLE: You're welcome.
Elle and Vivian continue on. Cut to inside a conference room. The four interns and two lawyers are sitting at a table. Callahan enters.
CALLAHAN: We're defending Brooke Windham, whose very wealthy husband was found shot to death in their Beacon Hill mansion.
VIVIAN: Gold digger?
CALLAHAN: You'd think so, since the stiff was 60, but she was rich on her own. Some kind of fitness empire. You can buy her exercise tapes on infomercials.
ELLE: Wait, are you talking about Brooke Taylor?
Callahan looks at his notes.
CALLAHAN: Maiden name, Taylor. You know her?
ELLE: She's a Delta Nu! She wasn't in my pledge class. She graduated four years before me. But I used to take her class at the Los Angeles Sports Club. She's amazing!
CALLAHAN: Amazing? How?
ELLE: She can make you lose three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted.
CALLAHAN: Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.
WARNER: By who?
CALLAHAN: His 26-year-old daughter and the pool boy.
Emmett enters the room.
EMMETT: Sorry, I'm late. Excuse me.
Elle looks up at him, surprised. They smile at each other.
CALLAHAN: This is Emmett Richmond, another associate. Top three in his class, and former editor of "Harvard Law Review." You've probably seen him lurking around campus doing my research.
EMMETT: Thanks for the introduction.
WARNER: So, what about the murder weapon?
CALLAHAN: The gun is missing. The coroner said he'd been dead 30 minutes when the cops arrived, giving Brooke plenty of time to stash it.
ELLE: I just don't think Brooke could have done this. Exercise gives you endorphins. Endorphins make you happy. Happy people just don't shoot their husbands. They just don't.
Emmett smiles.
CUT TO: INT. JAIL
Brooke sits in a prison jumpsuit at the end of a table with the lawyers and interns.
BROOKE: I didn't do it. I walked in, I saw my husband lying on the floor. I bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off, and then Enrique and Chutney ran inside.
CALLAHAN: Okay, your step-daughter and the pool boy came in where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
BROOKE: Why would I kill my husband?
CALLAHAN: Insurance, a love affair, pure unadulterated hatred. Believe me, the D.A. will come up with plenty of reasons.
BROOKE: I loved him.
CALLAHAN: He was 34 years older than you. That doesn't look so good to a jury.
BROOKE: Then show them a picture of his dick. That might clear a few things up.
CALLAHAN: Brooke, I believe you, but a jury is going to want an alibi.
BROOKE: Well, I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
CALLAHAN: Well then. I guess we're done for today.
Callahan grabs his briefcase. Everyone gets up and leaves. Brooke stops Elle as she leaves.
BROOKE: Hey…
ELLE: Hi.
BROOKE: I know you.
ELLE: I'm a Delta Nu, and I'm a huge fan of yours.
BROOKE: You took my class in L.A.
ELLE: Uh huh.
BROOKE: You had the best high-kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
ELLE: Yeah, sort of.
BROOKE: Well, thank God one of you has a brain.
COP: Let's go.
The cop pulls Brooke from the room. Elle smiles and leaves.
CUT TO: INT. SALON
Bruiser and Rufus are laying next to each other in a doggie bed. Paulette is giving Elle a manicure.
ELLE: I'm the only one that believes her. Callahan totally thinks she's guilty.
PAULETTE: Yeah, well that's because men are big fat retards who don't-
She stops and looks up as she hears the front door open. The UPS man enters.
UPS MAN: Afternoon, ladies.
PAULETTE: It's him.
He approaches the front desk.
UPS MAN: Paulette Bonifante?
The woman at the front desk points to Paulette.
PAULETTE: Oh, my God.
ELLE: He's coming over here.
He approaches Paulette’s desk.
UPS MAN: I've got a package.
Paulette is unable to respond.
ELLE: He's got a package.
Paulette is still too nervous to even look at him. He turns to Elle, who signs for her. Elle subtly nods towards the UPS man while smiling and looking at Paulette. Paulette turns and smiles at the UPS man.
UPS MAN: How you doing today?
PAULETTE: Fine.
He sets down the package and smiles at her.
UPS MAN: Take it easy.
He leaves.
ELLE: That's great, Paulette. Is this the only interaction you two have ever had?
PAULETTE: No. Sometimes I say "OK" instead of "fine."
ELLE: Why don't you offer him a cold beverage or a neck massage or something?
PAULETTE: Oh, come on, what's the point?
ELLE: Trust me, Paulette. You have all the equipment, you just need to read the manual. Do you know what I'm saying?
Paulette shakes her head.
ELLE: Okay. I’m gonna show you a little maneuver that my mother taught me in junior high. In my experience, it has a 98% success rate of getting a man's attention, and when used appropriately, it has an 83% rate of return on a dinner invitation.
PAULETTE: Wow!
ELLE: It's called the “bend and snap." Watch this.
Elle gets up and walks to the center of the Salon.
ELLE: "Oh! I think I dropped something on the floor that I need to pick up." So you bend… and snap!
She demonstrates by bending over and snapping upright.
ELLE: See? Come on. You try it.
Paulette gets up. Elle directs her. Another woman nearby watches them.
ELLE: Bend...and snap! Okay, yeah. A little less bend, a little more snap.
The woman watching gets up.
WOMAN 1: Like this?
The woman demonstrates a snap.
ELLE: Good snap! Come on.
Elle pulls Paulette over to another woman.
ELLE: You! Come on, you can do it.
All of the women in the salon begin to pay attention.
WOMAN 2: Bend... and snap!
The rest of the women applaud her.
ELLE: We can all do it! Come on, guys. You're gonna bend… and snap!
All of the women slowly join in.
ELLE: Now put your head into it. Bend... and snap! Bend... and snap! Good job! A little attitude, please. Now, everybody smile. That's very important. Bend... and snap! Good job, everybody!
The first woman begins dancing.
ELLE: Work it out! Work it out! That's it! Wow! Come on, Paulette! Bend and snap!
Paulette comes and joins everyone for one last bend and snap. A male employee walks past.
MAN: Oh, my God! The bend and snap! Works every time!
Bruiser and Rufus bark.
CUT TO: INT. LAW FIRM
Emmett paces around the conference room.
EMMETT: Well, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, then who did?
ELLE: My money is on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
CALLAHAN: Chutney has a trust fund. She didn't need the insurance pay off or the inheritance.
LAWYER: What about the mother?
CALLAHAN: Covered. She was in Aspen at the time. Vivian, get me some plum sauce.
Vivian looks disgruntled. Warner smirks.
CALLAHAN: Ten people saw her downing cosmopolitans at the Caribou Club.
ELLE: Well all I know is it's not Brooke.
CALLAHAN: That's touching, Elle. But we need an alibi.
CUT TO: INT. PRISON
Elle talks to Brooke through the phone at the prison.
ELLE: I brought you some necessities. Some Calvin Klein, 720 cut sheets, the entire Clinique skin care line, some aromatherapy candles, a loofah... Oh! And the Bible.
She holds up a copy of Cosmopolitan.
BROOKE: You're an angel.
ELLE: So how are you? Are you all right? You look so... orange.
BROOKE: I'm just glad that it's you and not Callahan.
ELLE: He means well. He's very brilliant.
BROOKE: He better be for what I'm paying for him.
ELLE: I have to tell you the real reason I came here. Professor Callahan says we really, really need your alibi.
BROOKE: Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
ELLE: Who could understand better than me?
BROOKE: It's so shameful.
ELLE: Whatever it is, Brooke, it could save you.
BROOKE: No! That's just it. It would ruin me.
ELLE: How?
BROOKE: I've made my fortune on the ability to perfect women's bodies with Brooke's Butt-Buster workout.
ELLE: I know! You helped me go from a six to a four.
BROOKE: That's great! Um... On the day of Heyworth's murder... I was getting…
She whispers inaudibly.
ELLE: What?
BROOKE: I was getting liposuction.
She says it too quietly for Elle to hear.
ELLE: Huh?
BROOKE: Liposuction!
ELLE: Oh, God!
Other people turn and look.
BROOKE: I know! I'm a fraud! It's not like normal women can have this ass! If my fans knew that I bought it… I would lose everything! I've already lost my husband. I'd rather go to jail than lose my reputation.
ELLE: Brooke… your secret's safe with me.
BROOKE: Thank you.
CUT TO: INT. LAW FIRM
Callahan enters the conference room. Everyone is hard at work.
CALLAHAN: Vivian, grab me some coffee.
Vivian looks annoyed and gets up.
CALLAHAN: We got two interviews tomorrow that Gerard and Bobby are gonna handle. The ex-wife in an hour. And, according to this communique from the prison, our client apparently had a visit from her sister. A Miss Delta Nu.
Callahan looks pointedly at Elle and removes his glasses. Emmett smiles.
CALLAHAN: Anyone you know?
ELLE: Yes. I went to visit her.
CALLAHAN: What the hell do you mean you went to visit her?
ELLE: I went to get her alibi.
CALLAHAN: Did you get it?
ELLE: Mhm. It's really good.
CALLAHAN: Well, great. What is it?
ELLE: Oh, I can't tell you.
CALLAHAN: Why the hell not?
ELLE: Because I promised her I'd keep it a secret, and I can't break the bonds of sisterhood.
CALLAHAN: Screw sisterhood! This is a murder trial, not some scandal at the sorority house. I want the alibi!
ELLE: I can't give it to you, but I can tell you she is innocent.
A woman enters.
WOMAN: Mr. Callahan, Mrs. Windham Vandermark is on line two for you.
CALLAHAN: Someone reason with her while I take this.
LAWYER 1: Are you crazy? Just tell him the alibi.
ELLE: No!
LAWYER 2: We’re gonna lose this case if you don't.
ELLE: Well then we're not very good lawyers.
WARNER: If you tell him, he'll probably hire you as a summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
Vivian gives Warner a look.
ELLE: I gave her my word, Warner.
WARNER: So what?
CALLAHAN: The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned with the fact that her interview is today. She's at a spa in the Berkshires.
LAWYER 1: A spa? Isn't that like your mothership?
ELLE: I could go if you want me to.
CALLAHAN: Emmett? Go with her.
EMMETT: Okay.
CUT TO: EXT. ROAD
Emmett and Elle drive to the spa.
EMMETT: She seems completely untrustworthy to me.
ELLE: Why?
EMMETT: This is a person who's made her living by telling women that they're too fat.
ELLE: Brooke would never tell a woman she was too fat.
EMMETT: And she seems like she's hiding something.
ELLE: Maybe it's not what you think.
EMMETT: Maybe it's exactly what I think.
ELLE: You know, you're really being a butthead.
EMMETT: A butthead? Why would you call me that?
ELLE: You know, Emmett, you just need to have a little more faith in people. You might be surprised.
EMMETT: I can't believe you just called me a butthead. I mean, no one's called me a butthead since about the ninth grade.
ELLE: Maybe not to your face.
They arrive at the spa.
EMMETT: So this is what a spa looks like. Wow. How do we find her?
ELLE: I called ahead. She's in the mud room.
EMMETT: She's not, um... naked, is she?
Cut to inside the spa. Emmett and Elle stand next to Mrs. Windham Vandermark. She has a mask on and cucumbers over her eyes. Elle removes one of the cucumbers.
ELLE: Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
MRS. W. V.: So you found me.
ELLE: Yes. We're from Austen, Platt, Jaret, and Callahan, and we're here to ask you a few questions.
MRS. W. V. : So I hear that that little tart from California shot poor Heyworth.
EMMETT: Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen, actually.
ELLE: Do you have any reason to believe that it did?
MRS. W. V.: I've never actually met the woman, but my daughter tells me she can be quite the little bitch.
EMMETT: Did your daughter ever mention anything about the relationship between Brooke and Heyworth?
MRS. W. V.: Well, she did say that they humped like gorillas. I guess it wasn't enough, though, for Brooke.
EMMETT: Why do you say that?
MRS. W. V.: Well… haven't you seen the cabana boy?
Cut to Elle and Emmett walking outside.
ELLE: She's lying.
EMMETT: And you know this for a fact?
ELLE: Did you see the icky brown color of her hair?
EMMETT: So? Now you discriminate against brunettes?
Cut to Emmett driving Elle back to campus.
ELLE: Why shouldn’t I? I'm discriminated against as a blonde.
EMMETT: You know, being a blonde is actually a pretty powerful thing. You hold more cards than you think you do. And I personally would like to see you take that power and channel it towards the greater good, you know?
ELLE: Thanks. I'll see you tomorrow.
EMMETT: All right.
Elle gets out of the car.
EMMETT: Hey, how do you think I'd look as a blonde, you know?
ELLE: I'm not sure you could handle it.
EMMETT: Bye.
ELLE: Bye.
Emmett drives away. Cut to Elle walking on campus. She passes David and two women talking.
DAVID: So, I called your room last night.
WOMAN: I heard.
DAVID: I was thinking maybe we could go out sometime.
WOMAN: No. You're a dork.
Elle stops.
DAVID: I'm in law school.
WOMAN: Look, I'm not gonna go out with you. I can't believe you'd even ask. Girls like me don't go out with losers like you. Let's get out of here.
ELLE: Excuse me.
Elle walks over to David and slaps him.
ELLE: Why didn't you call me?
DAVID: What?
ELLE: We spent a beautiful night together, and then I never hear from you again?
David looks confusedly at the two women and then back at Elle.
DAVID: I… I'm sorry?
ELLE: Sorry for what? For breaking my heart, or for giving me the greatest pleasure I've ever known and then just taking it away?
DAVID: Uh… both?
ELLE: Well, forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
Elle walks away and smiles.
WOMAN: So...when did you want to go out?
CUT TO: INT. ELLE’S ROOM
Elle sits in a chair with Bruiser and looks over a deposition. There’s a knock on her door.
ELLE: Come in.
Vivian enters.
VIVIAN: Are you done with that deposition yet?
ELLE: Oh, yeah. Here, take it. I've read it like, 20 times.
She puts the deposition down. Vivian comes over to take it.
VIVIAN: Okay. You know, Elle… I still can't believe you didn't tell Callahan the alibi.
ELLE: It's not my alibi to tell.
VIVIAN: I know. And I thought that was very classy of you.
ELLE: Really?
VIVIAN: Sure.
ELLE: Thanks.
Vivian turns to leave, but seems hesitant. She speaks again after a moment.
VIVIAN: Did you ever notice how Callahan never asks Warner to bring him his coffee? I mean, he's asked me at least ten times.
ELLE: Men are helpless. You know that.
Vivian sits down.
VIVIAN: I know. Warner doesn't even do his own laundry.
ELLE: I know, he has to have it sent out.
VIVIAN: I know. Did you know when he first applied, he got wait-listed?
Elle looks shocked.
ELLE: What?
Vivian moves closer.
VIVIAN: His father had to make a call.
ELLE: You're kidding. No way!
VIVIAN: Oh, God, that is such a precious dog.
ELLE: His name is Bruiser. Do you want to hold him?
VIVIAN: Oh.
ELLE: He's very friendly.
Elle hands Bruiser to Vivian.
VIVIAN: Sure. Oh!
Bruiser licks her.
ELLE: Look, he likes you.
VIVIAN: Ah, he's giving me kisses!
Elle smiles.
CUT TO: EXT. COURTHOUSE
A camera man exits a van as a reporter begins talking. The camera pans away to show the courthouse and dozens of people gathered around the area, including multiple news vans.
REPORTER: Thanks, Jeoff. We're here today covering the trial of Brooke Windham. She's charged with the murder of her husband, Boston millionaire Heyworth Windham. First to testify are the victim's daughter and ex-wife.
Cut to inside the courthouse. Everyone is standing as the judge enters.
BAILIFF: The Superior Court of Suffolk County is now in session. The Honorable Judge Marina R. Bickford presiding. You may be seated.
Everyone sits. Cut to later in the trial. Callahan, Emmett, Brooke, and another lawyer sit at the defense table while the interns Elle, Vivian, and Warner watch from the stands. They’re all watching District Attorney Joyce Rafferty question Chutney.
JOYCE: And where was she exactly?
CHUTNEY: Standing over my father's dead body.
Cut to Mrs. W. V.’s testimony.
JOYCE: And what was the defendant doing?
MRS. W. V.: Well, she was sitting next to the pool, topless, while the Latin boy handed her a drink.
Cut to a shot of the courtroom sketch artist, who smirks and continues drawing Mrs. W. V. Cut to later during the pool worker’s testimony.
JOYCE: Mr. Salvatore, can you tell us what this is?
She holds up a blue speedo.
ENRIQUE: My uniform.
JOYCE: This is the uniform Mrs. Windham asked you to wear while cleaning her pool?
ENRIQUE: Yes.
JOYCE: And, are you or are you not having an affair with Brooke Windham?
ENRIQUE: Define "affair."
JOYCE: Have you and Mrs. Windham had sexual relations?
ENRIQUE: Yes. OK? Yes.
JUDGE: Ladies and gentlemen, court will reconvene tomorrow morning at 9 A.M. We're adjourned.
Brooke gets up and angrily approaches Elle.
BROOKE: You know a Delta Nu would never sleep with a man who wears a thong.
ELLE: Never!
BROOKE: I just liked watching him clean the filter.
A cop takes Brooke away.
ELLE: I know. I believe you, Brooke.
BROOKE: Take care of me, Elle.
ELLE: I will.
Elle sighs as people file out of the courtroom.
CUT TO: INT. SALON
The UPS man enters as Paulette looks at herself in a mirror. He comes up from behind her with a big package and checks her out.
UPS MAN: I got a big one for you.
She turns and smiles at him.
UPS MAN: Can you sign?
She nervously picks up her pen and goes to sign. She looks at the pen for a moment and then drops it. She goes for the bend and snap
UPS MAN: Oh, I got it.
He goes for the pen too, and she accidentally headbutts him square in the face as she snaps.
CUT TO: INT. COURTHOUSE
Cut to Elle on the phone with Paulette.
ELLE: You broke his nose?
PAULETTE: Oh, I blew it, Elle. My snap was all over the place.
ELLE: I'll be there right as soon as court is out. We have to cross-examine Enrique. But don't worry. My girlfriend Serena barfed on a guy during "The Blair Witch Project" and they ended up dating for three months.
PAULETTE: Really?
ELLE: Mhm!
PAULETTE: All right. Bye-bye!
ELLE: Okay, bye.
Elle goes for a water fountain, but Enrique cuts in front of her. As he drinks, she taps her foot at him.
ENRIQUE: Don't stomp your little last-season Prada shoes at me, honey!
He walks away.
ELLE: These aren't last season.
Elle gasps as she has a sudden realization. Cut to her running back into the courtroom.
ELLE: Emmett! He's gay! Enrique is gay!
Callahan looks at her.
EMMETT: What?
Elle turns to Warner.
ELLE: Warner, what kind of shoes are these?
WARNER: Black ones.
ELLE: See!
CALLAHAN: What are you talking about?
ELLE: He’s gay. He isn't Brooke's lover. He's making it up.
EMMETT: Wait, back up. How do you know he's gay? Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
BROOKE: Know what? He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house one time.
CALLAHAN: While I appreciate your masterful legal theory, I have a murder trial to attend to. Emmett?
EMMETT: Okay. I’ll take care of it. Thanks.
ELLE: Okay.
BAILIFF: The court will come to order.
Everyone sits back down. Cut to the courtroom sketch artist drawing Enrique.
CALLAHAN: Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
ENRIQUE: Only the love in my heart.
CALLAHAN: Well, if that's all the proof that he has, Your Honor, I think I'm done here.
The judge nods.
JUDGE: You may step down-
EMMETT: I'd like to ask a couple of questions, Your Honor.
Emmett approaches Callahan.
EMMETT: Just give me a couple minutes.
EMMETT: Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
ENRIQUE: Yes.
EMMETT: Where?
ENRIQUE: A restaurant in Concord where no one could recognize us.
EMMETT: And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
ENRIQUE: Three months.
EMMETT: And your boyfriend's name is…?
ENRIQUE: Chuck.
EMMETT: Right.
Emmett goes to sit down. Elle smiles. Many people in the courtroom gasp and begin talking.
JUDGE: Silence!
The judge bangs her gavel.
ENRIQUE: Pardon me! Pardon me.
Emmett turns back around.
EMMETT: Yes, Mr. Salvatore?
ENRIQUE: I was con- I was confused. I thought you said friend. Chuck is just a friend.
EMMETT: Oh, okay.
In the stands, Chuck stands up.
CHUCK: You bitch!
Chuck leaves. People gasp. Enrique gets up.
ENRIQUE: Chuck, wait!
JUDGE: Silence in my court! Sit down, Mr. Salvatore.
Enrique watches as Chuck leaves. Emmett sits down at the defense table.
JUDGE: Silence in my courtroom! Silence in my courtroom.
Emmett turns around to Elle.
EMMETT: Thanks.
ENID: Wow.
CUT TO: INT. LAW FIRM
Elle walks down the hall.
ELLE: Goodnight!
WOMAN: Goodnight.
As Elle keeps walking, Vivian exits a room carrying a load of papers.
.VIVIAN: Oh, Elle, Callahan asked to see you before you leave.
ELLE: Really?
VIVIAN: Yeah, you know, he already has coffee, but maybe he needs a doughnut.
ELLE: Do you need any help?
VIVIAN: No. I'm fine.
Vivian leaves.
ELLE: Okay, bye.
Elle goes and knocks on Callahan’s door.
CALLAHAN: Come on in.
Elle enters his office.
CALLAHAN: Hi.
ELLE: Hi.
CALLAHAN: Sit down.
Elle sits down.
ELLE: Is everything all right?
CALLAHAN: You followed your intuition today, and you were right on target. I should have listened.
ELLE: Thank you.
CALLAHAN: About the alibi...
ELLE: I'm sorry-
CALLAHAN: I'm impressed you took the initiative to go get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And, on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys on my payroll.
ELLE: Wow.
CALLAHAN: I think it's time to discuss your career path.
He gets up and approaches her.
CALLAHAN: Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
He sits down next to her.
ELLE: Oh, um, not really. I know it's very competitive.
CALLAHAN: Well, you know what competition's really about, don’t you? It's about ferocity, carnage. Balancing human intelligence with animal diligence. Knowing exactly what you want… and how far you'll go to get it. How far will Elle go?
Vivian returns and looks through a crack in the door as Callahan places his hand on Elle’s leg. She runs away.
ELLE: Are you hitting on me?
CALLAHAN: You're a beautiful girl.
Elle gets up.
ELLE: So everything you just said...
CALLAHAN: I'm a man who knows what he wants.
ELLE: And I'm a law student who just realized her professor is a pathetic asshole.
CALLAHAN: Too bad. I thought you were a law student who wanted to be a lawyer!
Elle leaves and gets on an elevator. Vivian stops her.
VIVIAN: You almost had me fooled.
ELLE: What?
VIVIAN: Oh, maybe you should sleep with the jury, too. Then we can win the case.
The elevator door closes as Vivian storms off. Elle sees her reflection in the elevator door and wipes away a tear. Cut to her in the lobby. She walks past Emmett.
EMMETT: Hey!
ELLE: I'm quitting.
Emmett stops her.
EMMETT: Why?
ELLE: Law school was a mistake. This whole internship was a mistake.
EMMETT: What are you talking about? You earned it.
ELLE: I didn't earn anything, Emmett! Callahan only gave me that internship because he liked the way I looked. Which he made clear tonight when he tried to feel me up.
EMMETT: What? Callahan did what?
ELLE: Just forget about it. I'm going back to L.A. No more boring suits. No more pantyhose. No more trying to be something that I'm just… I'm just not.
EMMETT: What if you're trying to be somebody you are? The hell with Callahan. Stay.
ELLE: Call me if you're ever in California, okay?
She leaves. Emmett watches her.
CUT TO: INT. SALON
Cut to a shot of Elle’s things in her car outside the salon. Cut inside to Elle and Paulette hugging.
ELLE: What's the point in staying, Paulette? I mean, all people see when they look at me is blond hair and big boobs. No one's ever gonna take me seriously. The people at law school don't. Warner doesn't. I don't think my own parents take me seriously. I just felt, like, for the first time that someone expected me to… to do something more with my life than just become a Victoria's Secret model. But I was just kidding myself. Callahan never saw me as a lawyer, he just saw me as a piece of ass. Just like everybody else. Turns out I am a joke.
She begins tearing up.
PAULETTE: No, you're not a joke.
They hug again. Cut to a long shot of a woman getting her hair done with Elle and Paulette in the background.
ELLE: The hell with law school. I just wanted to say good-bye.
The woman in the foreground turns around and is revealed to be Professor Stromwell.
STROMWELL: If you're going to let one stupid prick ruin your life…
Stromwell approaches her.
STROMWELL: You're not the girl I thought you were.
Stromwell walks away.
CUT TO: INT. PRISON
Emmett approaches a TV and turns the volume up. A reporter is interviewing Callahan.
REPORTER: Did you go in there knowing how you were going to discredit Mr. Salvatore?
CALLAHAN: Absolutely. It's a little thing I'd like to call strategy.
Emmett walks over to where Vivian and Brooke are sitting.
BROOKE: Is he always such an ass?
EMMETT: He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
BROOKE: Fine, but is he an ass that’s going to win my case?
EMMETT: Well, he's an ass that'll try.
BROOKE: He thinks I'm guilty, doesn’t he?
EMMETT: That's not what's important.
BROOKE: If he doesn't trust me, why should I trust him?
VIVIAN: Ask Elle. She looked pretty cozy with him last night.
EMMETT: No. You don't even know what the hell you're talking about.
BROOKE: What's going on here?
EMMETT: Elle quit.
BROOKE: What?
EMMETT: Yeah. Callahan hit on her, so she quit.
BROOKE: Oh, my God. Scumbag.
VIVIAN: Oh, God.
BROOKE: What?
VIVIAN: I feel terrible. I made a huge mistake.
EMMETT: Well, maybe there's something we can do about it.
CUT TO: INT. COURTROOM
A bailiff lets Brooke into the room.
BROOKE: Thank you.
Brooke approaches the defense table where Callahan, Emmett, and another lawyer are sitting.
CALLAHAN: What are you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
BROOKE: Get up.
CALLAHAN: What?
BROOKE: You're fired. I have new representation.
Callahan throws down some files.
CALLAHAN: Who?
Brooke smiles and turns towards the entrance of the courtroom. Everyone in the room turns as Elle enters with David. They approach the defense table.
ELLE: Excuse you, you're in my way.
CALLAHAN: She's a law student. She can't defend you.
Elle clears her throat. David reads from a legal text.
DAVID: Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling 3.03.
ELLE: See? Thank you, David.
JUDGE: Counselors, approach the bench.
Elle turns to go to the judge.
CALLAHAN: You're not going up there.
ELLE: Oh, yes, I am.
BROOKE: I’m sorry, maybe you didn't hear me. You're fired.
JUDGE: Counselors, now. All of you.
Elle, Callahan, Emmett, and Joyce approach the judge.
ELLE: Elle Woods, Your Honor. Rule 3.03 of Supreme Judicial Court states that a law student may appear on behalf of a defendant in criminal proceedings.
JOYCE: Your Honor, I have no problem with this.
CALLAHAN: I do. I'm not allowing it.
ELLE: But you agreed last night. In your office when we were discussing my career.
JUDGE: The ruling also states that you need a licensed attorney to supervise you. Mr. Callahan?
CALLAHAN: That I won't agree to.
EMMETT: Uh, I'll supervise, Your Honor.
Emmett and Callahan exchange looks.
JUDGE: Well, Ms. Woods, proceed.
ELLE: Thank you, Your Honor.
They all walk away from the judge. As Elle returns to the defense table, she sees Paulette enter with the UPS man, whose nose is bandaged. Callahan turns to Brooke.
CALLAHAN: Enjoy prison.
Callahan leaves.
JUDGE: Mrs. Windham, you do realize what you're doing?
BROOKE: Absolutely.
Margot and Serena enter the courtroom.
SERENA: Oh, my God! There she is! Elle!
MARGOT: Elle, we came to see your trial!
SERENA: Oh, look how cute! There's like a judge and everything. And jury people.
MARGOT: Vote for Elle!
JUDGE: Ladies, take a seat.
SERENA: Go, girl.
Serena and Margot sit down behind Elle. Cut to a bailiff swearing in Chutney.
BAILIFF: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
CHUTNEY: I do.
BAILIFF: Be seated.
The bailiff leaves. Chutney sits down in the witness seat.
JUDGE: Ms. Woods, you may begin your questioning.
ELLE: Um… First of all I would like to point out that not only is there no proof in this case, but there is a complete lack of mens rea which by definition tells us there can be no crime without a vicious will.
The prosecutors chuckle.
JUDGE: I am aware of the meaning of mens rea. What I'm unaware of is why you're giving me a vocabulary lesson when you should be questioning your witness.
ELLE: Yes, Your Honor. Um… Miss Windham, when you arrived back at the house, was your father there?
CHUTNEY: Not that I saw, but like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
ELLE: And when you came downstairs, what happened?
CHUTNEY: I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
ELLE: But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
CHUTNEY: No. She'd stashed it by then.
EMMETT: Move to strike that from the record, Your Honor. It's speculation.
JUDGE: So stricken.
Elle looks nervously at Emmett. He nods.
EMMETT: Go ahead.
ELLE: Miss Windham, did you hear a shot fired?
CHUTNEY: No. I was in the shower.
ELLE: Okay, so, some time in the 20 minutes that you were in the shower, your father was shot.
CHUTNEY: I guess.
ELLE: Your father was shot while you were in the shower, but you didn't hear the shot because… because you were in the shower?
CHUTNEY: Yes. I was washing my hair.
Bruiser yips, startling Joyce.
LAWYER: Where is she going with this?
EMMETT: Have a little faith, Gerard.
ELLE: Um, Miss Windham, what had you done earlier that day?
CHUTNEY: I got up, got a latte, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
ELLE: Where you got in the shower?
JUDGE: I believe the witness has made it clear that she was in the shower.
There’s laughter in the courtroom.
ELLE: Yes, Your Honor. Um, Miss Windham, had you ever gotten a perm before?
CHUTNEY: Yes?
ELLE: How many would you say?
CHUTNEY: Two a year since I was 12. You do the math.
ELLE: You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko got a perm once? We all tried to talk her out of it. Curls weren't a good look for her. She didn't have your bone structure. But, thankfully, that same day, she entered the Beta Delta Pi wet t-shirt contest, where she was completely hosed down from head to toe.
JOYCE: Objection! Why is this relevant?
ELLE: Oh, I have a point, I promise.
JUDGE: Then make it.
ELLE: Yes, ma'am. Um, Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
CHUTNEY: Because they got wet?
ELLE: Exactly. Because Isn't it the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you're forbidden to wet your hair for at least 24 hours after getting a perm at the risk of deactivating the ammonium thioglycolate?
Joyce looks worried.
CHUTNEY: Y-yes.
ELLE: And wouldn't somebody who's had, say, 30 perms in their life be well aware of this rule? And if in fact you weren't washing your hair as I suspect you weren’t, because your curls are still intact, wouldn't you have heard the gunshot? And if in fact you had heard the gunshot, Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs, which would mean you would have had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story plausible. Isn't that right?
CHUTNEY: She's my age! Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone who was your age?
ELLE: You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn’t you Chutney? After you shot your father.
CHUTNEY: I didn't mean to shoot him. I thought it was you walking through the door!
Chutney points at Brooke. There are gasps in the courtroom.
JUDGE: Order! Order! Order!
The noise in the courtroom continues. Joyce gasps.
ELLE: Oh, my God.
BROOKE: Oh, my God.
JUDGE: Oh, my God.
Emmett looks at Elle. She approaches the defense table.
JUDGE: Bailiff, take the witness into custody, where she will be charged for the murder of Heyworth Windham.
Emmett shakes Elles hand.
JUDGE: In the matter of The State vs. Brooke Windham, this case is dismissed. Mrs. Windham, you are free to go.
Everyone cheers.
BROOKE: Yes!
Bruiser jumps out of Elle’s bag. Brooke and Elle hug. Chutney is taken away by two bailiffs. Paulette kisses the UPS man. Callahan looks disgruntled. Elle hugs David. Cut to Elle and Brooke walking down the courthouse stairs surrounded by reporters.
REPORTER 1: Elle, how did you know Chutney was lying?
BROOKE: Because she's brilliant, of course.
ELLE: The rules of hair care are simple and finite. Any Cosmo Girl would have known.
Cut to Elle walking through a doorway. Warner approaches her.
WARNER: Elle! Elle, Elle.
ELLE: What?
WARNER: I just wanted to say that you were so brilliant in there. And that I was wrong. And you are the girl for me.
ELLE: Really?
WARNER: Yes. Pooh bear...I love you.
He kisses her hand.
ELLE: Oh, Warner. I've waited so long to hear you say that. But if I'm gonna be a partner at a law firm by the time I'm 30, I need a boyfriend who's not such a complete bonehead.
She walks away from him and out the courthouse door as two cops open it for her.
ELLE: Thank you, boys.
She continues walking in slow motion as the shot fades into the next one.
CUT TO: INT. HARVARD
Text appears on screen reading “Two Years Later” as the camera pans from the ceiling down to Professor Stromwell.
STROMWELL: Ladies and gentlemen, I present the graduates of Harvard Law School Class of 2004. I am personally very honored to introduce this year's class-elected speaker. After getting off to a quite interesting start here at Harvard, she graduates today with an invitation to join one of Boston's most prestigious law firms. I'm sure we are going to see great things from her. Ladies and gentlemen, Elle Woods.
As Stromwell talks, shots pan over the crowd. As she finishes, the crowd applauds. Cut to Elle smiling and getting up. Cut to Enid and David in the audience clapping happily, and then to Warner clapping slowly. Elle hugs Stromwell, who goes to sit down as Elle prepares to speak.
ELLE: On our very first day at Harvard, a very wise professor quoted Aristotle. "The law is reason free from passion."
Stromwell smiles.
ELLE: Well, no offense to Aristotle, but in my three years at Harvard, I have come to find that passion is a key ingredient to the study and practice of law and of life. It is with passion, courage of conviction, and strong sense of self, that we take our next steps into the world, remembering that first impressions are not always correct.
Cut to a shot of Vivian smiling at her. Cut back to Elle.
ELLE: You must always have faith in people.
Cut to a shot of Emmett smiling at her. Cut to Warner looking glum. Cut back to Elle.
ELLE: And most importantly, you must always have faith in yourself. Congratulations, Class of 2004. We did it!
Everyone applauds. Elle’s father raises a glass to her in the audience. Everyone stands up and continues applauding. As "Perfect Day" by Hoku plays, we cut to shots of many of the characters while text comes up on screen describing what happens to them after the events of the movie. On a shot of Vivian text reads, “Vivian dumped Warner. She and Elle are now best friends.” On a shot of Warner text reads, “Warner graduated without honors, without a girlfriend and without any job offers.” On a shot of Paulette and the UPS man text reads, “Paulette married the UPS guy. They are expecting their first child, a daughter to be named Elle.” On a shot of Emmett text reads, “Emmett quit Callahan’s firm and opened his own practice. He and Elle have been dating for the past two years.” Elle smiles at him and throws her graduation cap in the air. Everyone else in the room follows suit. The camera zooms in on Elle in slow motion. On a shot of Emmett text reads, “Emmett is proposing to Elle tonight.” Elle smiles one last time as the screen fades to black.
