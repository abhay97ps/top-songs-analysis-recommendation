Baby, you walked out on me
Leaving me in misery
Now you want me back again
But I've got news for you, my friend
I wanna know, do you want me?
Do you love me?
Do you need me?
Real bad
Real bad
Then beg me, beg me, beg me
Beg me in the morning, beg me in the evening, beg me
Now get down on your knees and let me hear you say it, please
I want you to beg me
Once I loved you desperately
What a hold you had on me
Now you left me sad and blue
But now the table's turned on you
Tell me, do you want me?
Do you love me?
You sure you need me?
That bad
Real bad
Then beg me, beg me, beg me
Beg me, morning, beg me, evening, beg me
Now get down on your knees and let me hear you say it, please
I want you to beg me, yeah
Girl, I don't pity you
You know why 'cause you didn't pity me
I begged you not to leave
I told you how I grieved but you left and I'm free
I wanna know, do you want me?
You're sure you need me?
Do you love me?
Real bad
Real bad
Then beg me, beg me, oh, God, beg me
I knew you would 'cause you left me all alone, I knew you would
Now you're back and you gotta beg me
Louder, I can't hear you
