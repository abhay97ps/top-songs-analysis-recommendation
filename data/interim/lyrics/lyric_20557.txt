Sad to say I'm only in town for the night

But ya say you gotta lame ass nigga in your life
And he can't get the mental and physical part right
You playin wit ya toys but ya toys dont bite
See they dont talk shit and they dont hit it how you like
See I just want the first right of refusal, when you catch mood
Just call and I come through and sock it to you, promise you booboo
He said he got the magic stick, well ma my shit is like voodoo
That there stay harder than a rodeo you can ride like Isuzu
But all you need is your leather boots, we riding in birthday suits
My time is movin fast, so thats why I ask ya
