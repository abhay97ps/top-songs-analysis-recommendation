Hello Josephine
How do you do
Do you remember me baby?
Like i remember you
You used to laugh at me and holler: Woo Woo Woo
I used to walk you home
I used to hold your hand
You used to use my umbrella
Every time it rained
You used to cry so much..it was a cryin' shame
You used to live over yonder
By the railroad track
When it rained you couldn't walk..i used to tote you on my back
Now you try to make believe..it was a thrill at that
