Sit yourself down
And think of what you'd like to do today
Then take a look around
And if the sky kind of looks a little gray
Just take a hook on a dream
Watch your cares all start runnin’
Your smile won't stop comin'
When you take a mind excursion
It’s just a slight diversion
You might come out a winner
In a bullfight in Spain
Paint your face like an Injun
And dance for some rain
Get on your magic carpet
'Cause nothing can stop it, no
Open up your eyes
Excitement would like to be your friend
Try him on for size
He may lead you to the rainbow's end
You got your ticket to glide
And while the sun's gettin' brighter
Your head's gettin' lighter
When you take a mind excursion
It's just a slight diversion
You might drive out your window
In your own private car
Watch the whole world go rollin’
From the top of a star
Get on your magic carpet
’Cause nothing can stop it, oh
Take a mind excursion
It's just a slight diversion
You can take a mind excursion
It’s just a slight diversion
You can take a mind excursion
It's just a slight diversion...
