I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smilin' next to Oprah and the Queen
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shinin' lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh I
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Artie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had it
Give away a few Mercedes like, "Here lady, have this"
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Artie Claus minus the Ho-Ho
Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And darn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me stupid
Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music
Oh every time I close my eyes 
I see my name in shinin' lights 
A different city every night, oh I
I swear the world better prepare 
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh 
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh 
I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunkin' on his delegates
Then I compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twentys, tens and Bens completely separate
Yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eatin' good, sleepin' soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
Put it in the air and sing
I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad 
Buy all of the things I never had 
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen 
Oh every time I close my eyes 
I see my name in shinin' lights 
Yeah, a different city every night, oh I
I swear the world better prepare 
For when I'm a billionaire 
Oh oooh oh oooh 
When I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh 
I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad...
