Real hot girl shit
Ah, ayy 
I got a stank ass walk and a reckless ass mouth 
And my shit so tight, when we fuck, my pussy talk 
I don't even say, "What's up?", I just tell him what I want 
'Cause I got another nigga that's gon' do it if he don't, ah
Attitude bad, pussy too good 
When he say, "Fuck me," I tell him, "Fuck me good" 
Chase these niggas? I wish I would
Bad bitch like me? Hoes wish they could 
She a Casper to me, I need glasses to see
In the mall with her daddy, she a bastard to me 
You ain't fuckin' him right, bitch, pass him to me
Real niggas love me from the H to thе D
Don't stop, pop that cat
Mmm, mmm, just like that
Mmm, mmm, shake that shit 
Hmm, hmm, work it, bitch
Don't stop, pop that cat
Mmm, mmm, just like that 
Mmm, mmm, shakе that shit 
Hmm, hmm, work it, bitch
Patek just for the day 
She gotta go, roll the Ace of Spades
She catch a cold when she rock the chains 
But let me see, Pinky and the Brain 
Our baby mamas ain't the same 
She like, "Baby daddy, ice my chain" 
She 'bout to come and give me top like a crane 
You a bitch and a ho, but you gang, ayy 
Shake what your doctor gave ya
And I'ma ice your wrists like a player 
Doctor Miami add layers
Now the ass is fat like an acre
Come to the spot and we lay up
And I'll cream that pussy like mayos
Ever since I got my cake up 
I been runnin' these bitches like the mayor 
Don't stop, hatchback 
Shakin' that ass on Snapchat 
Off the script and shakin' that ass 
What you'll do for these rack, racks 
Where my thots at? 
I just freed this bitch like a bird, yeah 
Where my thots at? 
Let me hit it from the back, say, "Slatt, Slatt"
Don't stop, pop that cat

Hmm, hmm, work it, bitch

Mmm, mmm, just like that 
Mmm, mmm, shake that shit 
Hmm, hmm , work it, bitch
I'm gon' blow him like AC 
Give me big head like IT 
Lick, lick, lick me 'til I scream
Twist his tongue like I, I mean
I mean my body so out of this world
Change my at name to ASTROGIRL 
People say I'm way too full of myself
You're right, and I ain't even made it to dessert, ah
Buffy, no Angel, star, no spangle
Forty-inch weave by Kellon don't tangle
Call my drug dealer boyfriend on Tango
Use the Tajín when I'm eatin' a mango
Yeah, I get jealous
If you ate it real good, I can't help it
Any bitch you fuckin' with, you need to dead it
'Fore I come through and shit get hectic, ah
