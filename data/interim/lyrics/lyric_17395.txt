I was 12 when Daddy said to me
"Don't take to drinking, boy, that road don't lead no where
And don't you ever let me hear you swear
Don't you dare."
He told me stealing is a lazy man's way
Something for nothing leaves you hell to pay so don't buy into it
And then you can look the whole world in the eye
Honey, I've tried
But since I met you girl I'm breaking every rule
I must confess I'm just a back sliding fool
I want to drink from your loving cup
Swear I'll never give you up
Steal all your kisses underneath the moon
I wanna lie here close to you, look at what you made me do
Darling you're the reason why
I drink, swear, steal and lie
Last night I threw away the 12 step book
I finally faced the fact that I am hooked on you
There's nothing more that I can do, Ain't no use
Cause every time I see your angel face
My halo disappears without a trace I swear
Girl, I'd admit I haven't got a prayer
But I don't care
I know this ain't exactly how I was raised
But heaven help me, honey, I ain't changing my ways
I want to drink from your loving cup
Swear I'll never give you up
Steal all your kisses underneath the moon
I wanna lie here close to you, look at what you made me do
Darling you're the reason why
I drink, swear, steal and lie
I want to drink from your loving cup
Swear I'll never give you up
Steal all your kisses underneath the moon
I wanna lie here close to you, look at what you made me do
Darling you're the reason why
I drink, swear, steal and lie
Drink, swear, steal and lie
