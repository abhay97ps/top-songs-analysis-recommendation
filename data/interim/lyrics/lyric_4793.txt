Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only man?
Didn't I give you everything that a woman possibly can?
But with all the love I give you
It's never enough
But I'm gonna show you, baby
That a woman can be tough
So come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
And
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Break another little bit of my heart now, honey
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
You're out on the streets 
And you know deep down in your heart that it ain't right
And ohhhhh you never never hear me when I cry at night
Ohhhhhhhh
I tell myself
That I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms
I'll say it again
So come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
And take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Heyyyy!
Break another little bit of my heart now, baby
You can
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
Hey heyyyyy!
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Ohhhh
Break another little bit of my heart now, honey
Heyyyyyy!
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
Come on
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
