Every night it's the same
I hear you calling my name
You're lying next to me
I give into your charms
You disappear in my arms
I realize it's just a dream, but
Desperately, I long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love
And now I
Shake the sleep from my head
And try to crawl out of bed
Today is just another day
I make the coffee for one
I turn the radio on
Pretend that everything's ok, but
Desperately, I long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love
And now I
Know there's no reason to smile
It's gonna take me awhile
'Cause I still love you desperately
Desperately, I long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love
And now I
Watch the sun going down
There ain't nobody around
I feel a night in the breeze
I keep on telling myself
I don't need nobody else
And I can do as I please, but
And now I
Desperately, I long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love
And now
Every night it's the same
I hear you calling my name
I still love you desperately
I still love you
I still want you
I still love you desperately
