I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
Too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
Too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
I took my baby to the doctor
With a fever but nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown!
 Someone's always trying,  to start my baby crying
 Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' {You just wanna be startin' somethin'}
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
But you got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
But you got to be startin' somethin'
Too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder { Na na na, Na na na na} 
Too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder {Na na na, Na na na na} 
You're a vegetable 
You're a vegetable 
Still they hate you 
You're a vegetable 
You're just a buffet 
You're a vegetable 
They eat off of you 
You're a vegetable, ow!  
Lift your head up high
And scream out to the world!
I know I am someone
And let the truth unfurl!
No one can hurt you now
Because you know it's true
Yes, I believe in me
So you believe in you!
Help me sing it!
