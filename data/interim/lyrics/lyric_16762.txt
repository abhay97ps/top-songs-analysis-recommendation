Jenny came over and told me about Brad
He's such a hairy behemoth she said
And dumb as a box of hammers
But he's such a handsome guy
And I opened up and I told her about Larry
And yesterday how he asked me to marry
I'm not giving him an answer yet
I think I can do better
So we laughed, compared notes
We had a drink, we had a smoke
She took off her overcoat
I kissed a girl
I kissed a girl
So she called home to say she'd be late
He said, he worried but now he'd feel safe
I'm glad you're with your girlfriend
Tell her "Hi" for me
Then I looked at you, you had guilt in your eyes
But it only lasted a little while
And then I felt your hand above my knee
And we laughed at the world
They can have their diamonds
And we'll have our pearls
I kissed a girl
I kissed a girl
I kissed a girl, her lips were sweet
She was just like kissing me
I kissed a girl, won't change the world
But I'm so glad
I kissed a girl
And we laughed at the world
They can have their diamonds
And we'll have our pearls
I kissed a girl 
I kissed a girl 
I kissed a girl
I kissed a girl
I kissed a girl, her lips were sweet
She was just like kissing me 
I kissed a girl
I kissed a girl, won't change the world
But I'm so glad
I kissed a girl 
I kissed a girl 
I kissed a girl
I kissed a girl
