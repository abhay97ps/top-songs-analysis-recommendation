Well I spent a lifetime looking for you
Single bars and good time lovers were never true
Playing a fool's game
Hoping to win
And telling those sweet lies and losing again
I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Hoping to find a friend and a lover
I'll bless the day I discover
Another heart lookin' for love
And I was alone then
No love in sight
I did every thing I could to get me through the night
Don't know where it started
Or where it might end
I'd turn to a stranger just like a friend
'Cause I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Hoping to find a friend and a lover
I'll bless the day I discover
Another heart lookin' for love
And you came a knockin'
At my heart's door
You're everything I've been lookin' forrrrrrrr
There's no more lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Now that I've found a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discovered
You
Oh, you, lookin' for love
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Now that I've found a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discovered
You
Oh, you, lookin' for love
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Now that I've found a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discovered
You
Oh, you, lookin' for love
