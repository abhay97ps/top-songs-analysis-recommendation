Driving down the street today I saw a sign for lemonade
They were the cutest kids I'd ever seen in this front yard
As they handed me my glass, smiling thinking to myself
Man, what a picture-perfect postcard this would make of America
It's a high school prom, it's a Springsteen song, it's a ride in a Chevrolet
It's a man on the moon and fireflies in June and kids selling lemonade
It's cities and farms, it's open arms, one nation under God
It's America
Later on when I got home, I flipped the TV on
I saw a little town that some big twister tore apart
And people came from miles around just to help their neighbours out
And I was thinking to myself I'm so glad that I live in America
It's a high school prom, it's a Springsteen song, it's a ride in a Chevrolet
It's a man on the moon and fireflies in June and kids selling lemonade
It's cities and farms, it's open arms, one nation under God
It's America
Now we might not always get it all right
There's no place else I'd rather build my life
But yeah, 'cause it's a kid with a chance, it's a rock 'n roll band
It's a farmer cuttin' hay
It's a big flag flyin' in a summer wind
Over a fallen hero's grave
It's a high school prom, it's a Springsteen song
It's a welcome home parade, yeah
It's a man on the moon and fireflies in June and kids sellin' lemonade
It's cities and farms, it's open arms, one nation under God
It's America! It's America! Oh, oh yeah, woo!
