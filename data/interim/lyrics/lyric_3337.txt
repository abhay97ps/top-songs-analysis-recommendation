Do dow dow dow......
I've got so much to say
And so little time to talk
And with so little time
It's best to say nothing at all
Just let me love you while I can
When I'm gone you'll understand
That if you wait for love
It may be too late for love
This day you'll never forget
And when I'm gone
You'll have no regret
Do dow dow dow......
Though I'm leaving today
I'll remember this day
For a long, long time
And I'll remember the way
That I heard you say you're mine
Just let me love you while I can
When I'm gone, you'll understand
That if you wait for love
It may be too late for love
Today you are mine, can't you see
It's now or never for me
Do dow dow dow......
Aw, just let me love you while I can
When I'm gone, you'll understand
That if you wait for love
It may be too late for love
This day you'll never forget
And when I'm gone
You'll have no regret
Do dow dow dow.....
