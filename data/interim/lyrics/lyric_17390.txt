Boxed out, rebound, bitch, you know we balling 
Always check my phone to find another hoe is call–
​swvde
I'm on the team, I’ma shoot for three
Breaking them knees then I release
Hitting that buzzer beater, uh
Winning the game I'm winning, uh 
I let my brother beat 'em, uh 
I couldn’t lose if y'all made me a noose and I jumped from the fucking bleachers
Boxed out, rebound, bitch, you know we balling 
Always check my phone to find another hoe is calling
Why is she calling my phone? I don't know
I cannot answer 'cause I'm on a boat 
Got the remote 'cause you know I control
All of the waves that you ride like I told you 
This that super fly dropkick shit
All these motherfuckers jumping in the mosh pit, quick 
If you got a big booty better pop that shit
I been looking for the biddy that will rock my dick 
Need a new flow then I'll top this shit
Me and swvde. be the team, always coming with the hits 
Everybody love it when we drop them shits
I'ma spit it ’til I hit it then I got my fix 
I don’t even look like I should rap, but yo, I kill this shit
Working 'til this perfect finger’s hurting, know you feel this shit 
Uh, I spit a couple of bars at a time
Off of the dope but it's coming out fine
Trippy, bitch, drinking full bottles of wine 
But now I been sober, I'm ready to grind 
I'm a goof and that’s just the way I am
Don't follow the rules and I don't stick to the plan
Okay, you know me, that don't mean that you're my friend
So all of that shit you was talking, you saying it all was pretend?
Gotta change it up a little bit like she gon' be with me
Got that Boba Fett up in the blunt, we high as we can be
Out in Colorado for a while, I'm in the 303
Sending my vocals to Dutchman, we gon' be like, "Leedle leedle lee"
Hit the sto' for weed, I'm Tripp'ThaKid, I get the tree for free
Pass the blunt to him so he get lifted, never seeing me
Higher than the universe, you know you wanna be a G
TrippyThaKid the GOAT, y'all already know you never beating me
Hit the sto' for weed, I'm Tripp'ThaKid, I get the tree for free
Pass the blunt to him so he get lifted, never seeing me
Higher than the universe, you know you wanna be a G
TrippyThaKid the GOAT, y'all already know you never beating me
Uh, yeah
