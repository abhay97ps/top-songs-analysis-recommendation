I ain't taking no rainbow ride
I ain't taking no rainbow ride, girl
Touch my heart but not my pride
Love me right or step aside
I ain't taking no rainbow ride with you
I got to find me somebody to love
Someone to love all the time
Keep off of my mind
I ain't taking no rainbow ride
I ain't taking no rainbow ride, girl
Touch my heart but not my pride
Love me right or step aside
I ain't taking no rainbow ride with you
Is that forever I see in your eyes
Carefully planned like a dream
Just like a dream
I want someone to love 
Maybe it's you 
Someone who will be true 
Maybe it's you 
But I ain't taking no rainbow ride
I ain't taking no rainbow ride, girl
Touch my heart but not my pride
Love me right or step aside
I ain't taking no rainbow ride with you
But I ain't taking no rainbow ride
I ain't taking no rainbow ride
Whoa, no
