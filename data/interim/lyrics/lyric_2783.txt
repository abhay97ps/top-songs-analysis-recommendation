I see you rocking a Louis, a watch, and some jewelry
Best be giving all of it to me or I'll be popping a toolie
Swallowing phlegm halfway into hocking a loogie
In front of a bitch and wonder why she ain't more talkative to me
So many heads in the freezer it’s getting hard to reach the Hot Pockets
Sniffing glue and getting fuming that it’s not toxic
Sending snot-rockets into cups of hot chocolate for kids getting over colds
Rock an overcoat to the box office
As far as your whip’s breaks go, I detached the cable
At the very best you’re gonna be left toothless eating mashed potatoes
And if the wreck don’t bring damage to your ass that’s fatal
I’m going voodoo style - ayo, someone pass the Play-Doh
Pinkie up on the razor, I’m snorting fancy
Good lord, I’m antsy, and I got a temper like Gordon Ramsay
Calling C.O.s “Mary” and the fucking warden “Nancy.”
Shit, my mom should’ve pulled a shotgun when the stork was landing
Arthritic grip with the amount that I pull triggers
And I don’t break up fights, I cheer on with a foam finger
My bitch in vibrator mode like a phone with no ringer
But I want her fucking like I’m Hef and she’s a gold digger
Forged so many signatures, at this point I’ve ripped off cursive
Throw water under the hood as soon as your whip’s all serviced
We’re making a pit stop at the beach. Oh, you’re in flip flops? Perfect
Stick and apple on your head, aim, and miss on purpose
Y’all rappers are blood in the water
And this right here’s that Jaws shit
Break out the tubas, straight up you’re a gonner
Yea up in here it’s getting raw as shit
Looks like we got some blood in the water
And this right here’s that Jaws shit
You’re setting yourself up to get slaughtered
For claiming to be even half as raw as this
Let’s fight at the playground, around the corner from where the junkies are
Grammar school-style, I’ll leave you hanging from the monkey bars
Red hair and a knife, fuck Decibel, I’m Chucky, brah
CD’s so ill it comes with a contract and a monthly charge
Blowing up, but I ain't no hero, so don’t waste confetti
Ran into a burning building, left the kid there, and saved the teddie
Robbed the register, plus the leave-a-penny take-a-penny
Came back in 5 minutes and asked the cashier to break a 20
Taking my past douchiness to another degree
I’m stealing government cheese from starving mothers-to-be
Be fucking with me, you’re death’s gonna be something to see
I’ll play reverse hangman and chop limbs while you’re hung from a tree
This white boy’s the black coffee of rap - I ain't got no equal
Dumping bags of strictly-made-of-bones people at Home Depot
How the fuck can I go Walter White with the stove repo’d?
You’re shocked I’m a .08? It’s a bigger deal if I drove legal
Only thing on my mind is which vodka I’ll rip shots of
Shoving nerd-ass zit-poppers in gym lockers
Illest hip-hopper and shit-talker, trick-dropper like Vince Offer
Murder weapon getting cleaned with the Slapchop in the dishwasher
Clean money’s got my dick softer. How quick can it get laundered?
Called the nurse’s tits “knockers” and now I gotta switch doctors?
Every action I take’s a red flag, like when I did soccer
I know the first four were rough, girl, but how’d you  like a fifth stalker?
You see your checkbook?  You hand me that, you get your Camry back
Plus the family cat, but your son? I don’t know where he’s at
It’s a scary fact I’m crime-spreeing while drugs have got me handicapped
Your mom’s on line 2, but tell her she ain't getting her panties back
Lob City? Not with me, fuck Clippers, I got a razor blade
That I’m taking to your skull til I’m shaving brain
Was a good kid, but from GTA games I was made insane
Now I’m fucking up more tricks than an inebriated David Blaine
Making a noose, got a tight rope like the Wallenda brothers
Dear Woodchipper, thanks for making sure those bodies ain't been recovered
Such a nightmare I got the closet monster hiding in the covers
Hey, escort service, the bitch is dead, send another
Drop some spare clothes in a box and donate books
Then throw in a match and spill some propane - oops
I ain't been eating powdered donuts, it’s called cocaine, toots
Killed my manager then still bitch about how my shows ain't booked
Novacaine, doc? Shit, I already got liquored and bought pliers
But, fuck it, try the I.V., as if it’s possible I got higher
All these pills I’m a Tic Tac from foaming like a rottweiler
Took so much acid earlier, I could just burp and rot iron
Gator bill so high I ain't even got fluids in the dang moat
But you’re still getting chucked in, cuz I’m doing it insane, yo
Hating Decibel? Those wack thoughts are ruining your brain, bro
Keep ‘em up and you’re two minutes from Huey Lewis and a raincoat
