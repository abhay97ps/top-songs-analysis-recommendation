Ooh
Baby, don't ever forget
We're just like Romeo and Juliet
Baby, let's feel the love that'll last forever
And ever and ever
Baby, baby
Let's feel the love that never dies this time
I know we can do it
If we only stick together, oh
I know we can do it
If we try
You see
I believe that we've got a chance
For the storybook romance
Let's be like Romeo and Juliet
Lovers till the end of the line
However trying times we get
I'll be yours
If you will be mine
Just like Romeo and Juliet
Ain't nothing gonna tear us apart
Just say the words
So I'll never forget
We've got the roots in a lifetime love
The kind you spend your whole life dreaming of
You know I believe that we've got a chance
For a storybook romance
I know that we can do it
Like Romeo and Juliet
Lovers til the end
'Til the end
The end of the line
However trying times we get
I'll be yours
If you will be mine
Just like Romeo and Juliet
Ain't nothing gonna tear us apart
One thing, baby
You'll never forget
You're my Romeo
I'm your Juliet
And, baby, once in a lifetime
There's a present from the heavens above
Baby, once in a lifetime
You'll find this kind of love
Do you believe it can last forever?
I want a love that'll never die
I had a dream we would live together
Oh, just like
Oh, just like
I'll be your lover, baby
I wanna drive you crazy
I wanna do it like
Romeo and Juliet
No other one can do me
The things you're doing to me
It's like we're into movies
Romeo and Juliet
I'll be your lover, baby
I wanna drive you crazy
I wanna do it like
Romeo and Juliet
No other one can do me
The things you're doing to me
It's like we're into movies
Romeo and Juliet
I'll be your lover, baby
I wanna drive you crazy
I wanna do it like
Romeo and Juliet
No other one can do me
