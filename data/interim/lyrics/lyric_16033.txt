Your sex is
Got it going on
Your sex is
Got it going on
Your sex is
Got it going on
Your sex is
Got it going on
I want your body
Tell me you want mine too
There's so many nasty things
I wanna do to you
Lick you up and down
And a running around
But a lovely mind could never
Ever be found
Now you see me and
Baby, now you don't
Come fast upon me, girl
Just give me what I want
Lick you real good
'Til the very last drop
Ah, no, no, no, no, honey
Don't you ever, ever, stop
Happy days are here again
Looks like this love of ours
Will never ever end
Hold me tight, baby
Don't you let me go
Oh, come on, sugar
You know I love you so
Make you feel like
You never did before
Here's the key, baby
Now open up the door
Now you see me
And baby, now you don't
Come on, honey
Just give me what I want 
Love you up till you feel so good inside 
You may try to run
But you just can't hide 
Happy days are here again
I don't think they'll help me, baby
I don't think they'll help me see
Ah, come on
Happy days are here again
Baby, looks like this love of ours
Will never ever end
Happy days are here again
Come on, baby
Come on, sugar
Happy days are here again
Come on, honey
Another jam
Happy days
When it's too dull
Looking a
Making a
Taking a time to see
What you women are all about
I still don't get it
Slap it
And grab it
Make it last forever
â€˜Cause I bet you gotta have it
Soon can make you sweat
When you're alone in your home
'Cause her back is pretty strong
And your sex
Got it going on
My man, Will
Can make the groove sweat
Your big G and little G
