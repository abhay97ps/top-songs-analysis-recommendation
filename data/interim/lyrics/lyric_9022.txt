Aye, we doin' this for the fans
For the motherfuckers that be in our corner
This right here is some live shit
Ain't one word written down
Ain't no words from my mind
This is the shit right off the level
This how we do it
Cause most of the time, what niggas like
Niggas know me!!!
But they don't know the D-O-double-G 
They don't know oh-oh-oh
I say they swear they know me!!!
But they don't know the D-O-double-G 
They don't know oh-oh-oh
My niggas down with me!!!
Until the day I d-i-e-e-e
You ho's know oh-oh-oh
I say my niggas down with me!!!
Until the day I d-i-e-e-e
You ho's know oh-oh-oh
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't need it
And if there's a cure for this
I don't need it, I don't want it
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't need it 
And if there's a cure for this
I don't need it, I don't want it
I'm up early in the mornin', tryin' to get paid
Cause my mind's on my money, everything is so made
I play game in the youngster, as a youngster
Tryin' to make my money, tryin' to become a hustler 
Finally made the status
Gladys Knight and the Pips
Snoop Dogg 'bout to trip
Catch your grip and then I'll dip
Makin' money is a must for me, I gots to have it
Cause you know my lifestyle is like 2Pac's, it's just so lavish
Just movin' on paper; movin', makin' and shakin'
Leavin' fools in a daze, as if, I was a Laker
Break 'em down and shake 'em, pass it off to 2Pac
And let him take a jump shot
Because he gon' give it all he got
Back in the old days, niggas was suckers, tried to belittle me
But that was when I was much smaller, just a little G
But now I'm a just a bigger baller
Niggas don't wanna see me, because I'm larger and taller
Made my money get bigger, bank account is larger
Niggas don't wanna see me
They label Dogg the father
When they see us on the streets, niggas scream peace
They don't want it
Cause they screamin' they "Can't C Me"
You heard the album, All Eyez On Me
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't need it
And if there's a cure for this
I don't need it, I don't want it
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't need it
And if there's a cure for this
I don't need it, I don't want it
Take a trip around the world 
Cause that's what a nigga love to do 
I'm havin' money like a nigga's 'suppose to 
You know this money be the topic that I'm spittin' on 
Cause I gots to get my grip and fingers gots to keep it on
I'm scratchin' for some scratch and some scrilla
Tryin' to get the big paper
Cause yo, paper is a killer
Leavin' niggas on daze
Cause yes, money pays
Cause, if you ain't got it
Then it seems you out plottin'
Tryin' to do you a robbery, or some type of assault
But you just might get caught
But you know it ain't my fault
I'm gon' dip away and slip away
And find me a hideaway 
And look for my nigga 'Pac
Gon' and take the ride away
Well I'll be right there homie, uh
What's up baby?
You lookin' crazy like you don't really know me 
I know you heard the album, I Ain't Mad at Cha 
So move closer, big baby, let me stab at cha 
You know the rules, Big 'Pac in this motherfucker 
Don't look at me crazy, cause baby I ain't with them other suckers 
This Thug Life, baby, Outlaw Immortalz
I thought I taught you
Baby we don't do it, but we fought you
And when we did, we beat you ass niggas in the streets
To the motherfuckin' studio
Soundin' like Phil Collins, singin' su-su-sudio
You niggas is booty
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't need it
And if there's a cure for this
I don't need it, I don't want it
If there's a

Until the day I D-I-E 
You ho's know oh-oh

Until the day I D-I-E
You ho's know oh-oh

Corleone style , or mafioso 
Snoop Dogg 'bout to do it like Mussolini slow
E.D.I. what up nigga? I see you, I feel you real now
Snoop Dogg 'bout to show how you, how I peel the crowd
I step back, relax
New jacks, they get smacked up against the wall
When they, think that they can get with that, nigga Doggy Dogg
I'm so smo-o-o-th , I keep it on the real-a 
Cause, I'm a true killa when it come to makin' scrilla
Them niggas know, I suppose they froze
Once they seen me and the Dogg, doin' clothes in the videos
Bitches pause, we all up in them drawers
Baby you know the secret, uh, I gots to keep it
Money, paper, and bitches, my only motto
Drink out the cold forty bottle
My dog, you know these niggas is hogs 
Now me and Snoop came up, and built our name up
Bitches thought they had us crossed, but bitch I got my game
Plus, I'm a motherfuckin' baller, alcoholic
You can ask my homie K
He'll tell you, I've been ballin' since around the way
And E.D.I., had a baby
He's needy, but he's crazy
Got these niggas runnin' wild from this fuckin' .380, now uh
