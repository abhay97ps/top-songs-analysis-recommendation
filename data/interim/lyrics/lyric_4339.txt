There's a train leaving here tomorrow, yeah
And I'll be a free, free man once again, yes I will now
I'm so glad I served my time
I'm gonna meet the girl that I left behind
And when I see her, I'm gonna give her
All the love I've got
Ooh, when I see her, I'm gonna give her
All the love I've got
There were times, there were times
When each day seems like a year, yes it did now
But the sweet things she said in her letters
Made the times disappear, oh yeah
She said, No one's arms will I let hold me
'cause in your arms is where I want to be
So when I see her, I'm gonna give her
All the love I've got
When I see her, I'm gonna give her
All the love I've got
Ooo, baby, baby, baby, I miss you so, ooh
Countless nights I stared out my window
At the moonlight, yes I did now
Thinking about the way I used to
Hold her tight, oh yeah
I must've been out of my mind
To do the wrong I did and leave her behind
So when I see her, I'm gonna give her
All the love I've got, listen to me
When I see her, I'm gonna give her
All the love I've got
Believe me when I tell ya When I see her, I'm gonna give her all the love I've got
