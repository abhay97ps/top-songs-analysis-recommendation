When I first saw you standing there
You know, was a little hard not to stare
So nervous when I drove you home
I know, being apartâ€™s a little hard to bare
Sent some flowers to your work
In hopes that I'd have you in my arms again
We kissed that night before I lapsed
Still now, was something I could never forget
You've got all that I need
Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
With you, I know that I am good for something
So, lets go, give it a try
We got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world
Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
Let's take a chance, go far away today
And never look back again
Since I said I loved you in Las Vegas
It's never been the same since then
You've got all that I need
Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
With you, I know that I am good for something
So, lets go, give it a try
We got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world
Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
This is it, nothing to hide
One more kiss, never say goodbye
This is it, babe, you're all mine
Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
I know that I am good for something
So, lets go, give it a try
We got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world
Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
With you, I know that I am good for something
So, lets go, give it a try
We got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world
Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
Looking at all or nothing, babe, it's you and I
