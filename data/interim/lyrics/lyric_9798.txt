So you and your old man
Decided to call it quits last night
You're both tired of trying after five long years
There's a pretty little girl watching
Color cartoons in the living room
And she's not too young to know
The meaning of grownup tears
And you say
You'll send her on home to Brooklyn
She'll be okay
Send her on home to Brooklyn
You gotta get her out of the way
But tell me who's gonna love her
When you send her on home to Brooklyn
Will her grandmother answer
The questions she'll ask every day?
Who's gonna love her
When you send her on home to Brooklyn
While her mom and her dad are running free in L.A.?
It's been three years
Since you made the move from the East to the West
You thought the change would do you both some good
And the folks back there
I guess they'll always care for the little girl
Even though the marriage
Ain't working out like it should
And you say
You'll send her on home to Brooklyn
She'll be okay
Send her on home to Brooklyn
You gotta get her out of the way
But tell me who's gonna love her
When you send her on home to Brooklyn
Will her grandmother answer
The questions she'll ask every day
Who's gonna love her
When you send her on home to Brooklyn
While her mom and her dad are running free in L.A
