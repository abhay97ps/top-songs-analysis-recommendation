Yeah, yeah
Mornin' came and I was on my way
When you reminded me
I had too soon forgotten
It was you that set me free
Yeah, you were here when I came
And you'll be here when I'm gone
So don't be waitin' for love
'Cause I'll be waiting to ramble on
Headed for a heartbreak
Headed for a heartbreak
Darlin', don't wait up for me
Tonight I won't be home
You've become a stranger
I just got to be alone
Don't need nobody on my side
To dull the blade I'm on
So don't be waitin' for love
'Cause I'll be waiting to ramble on
Headed for a heartbreak
Headed for a heartbreak
Headed for a heartbreak
It's no mistake
Don't you think I can feel the pain?
I walk away to live again
Headed for a heartbreak
Headed for a heartbreak
Headed for a heartbreak
Headed for a heartbreak
Don't you think I feel the pain?
