Yeah 
Ooh
Wrist lookin' like it been dipped
Dipped in that, dipped in that, dipped in that
Script lookin' like it been flipped
Flippin' that, flippin' that, flippin' that 
Pull up in that foreign, my God 
Whole squad get in that, get in that
Please say it ain't true, I had to go and cop two
Hell nah, we can't fit in that
Wild ones, like we fresh out the cage
Showtime, baby, fresh off the stage 
Bad lil' mama, fresh off the page 
Front like you love it
But you know that you hate it 
Yeah, you know no better
Yeah, you know no better 
Yeah, you know no better
Ooh
Yeah, you know no better
Say you different, who you kidding?
Yeah, you know no better
Ooh, save that talk for the ones
Who don't know no better 
'Cause, baby, I know you better 
Baby, I know you better 
Baby, I know you better
Baby, I know you better
Straight up
Baby, I know you better
Baby, I know, I know no better
Top dropped off on my whip
Whippin' that, whippin' that, whippin' that
Yellow and that purple on mix
Mixin' that, mixin' that, mixin' that 
Copped my bitch from the tropics 
You know where she sittin' at
Takin' shots, pourin' bottle after bottle after bottle
No, we ain't sippin' that 
Wild ones, like we fresh out the cage
Showtime, baby, fresh off the stage 
Bad lil' mama, fresh off the page 
Front like you love it, but you know that you hate it
Yeah, you know no better 
Yeah, you know no better 
Yeah, you know no better
Ooh
Yeah, you know no better
Say you different, who you kidding?
Yeah, you know no better
Ooh, save that talk for the ones
Who don't know no better 
'Cause, baby, I know you better 
Baby, I know you better 
Baby, I know you better
Baby, I know you better 
Baby, I know you better
Baby, I know, I know no better 
Droptop on the whip 
Dab of ranch on the chips 
Ice cream gave her chills 
Too much cash, pay the bills
I make her ride Mercedes 
I can afford the latest 
Baby, ignore the ratings 
Just pull up, we pop out, we ragin'
We know no better , stack my bread up 
Don't get fed up 
Ain't gon' let up 
You told me to shut up , but I'ma do better 
It's not my race , get out my face 
Drop my case 
Which way? , that way 
Yeah, you know no better
Say you different, who you kidding?
Yeah, you know no better
Ooh, save that talk for the ones who don't know no better
'Cause, baby, I know you better
Maybe I know you better 
Maybe I know you better
Maybe I know you better 
Maybe I know you better
Baby, I know, I know no better
