You could have knocked me out with a feather
I know you've heard this all before, but we're just Hell's neighbors
Why, why, why won't the world revolve around me?
In my dreams, trees grow all over the streets
But I don't know much about classic cars 
But I've got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke 
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike, media blitz
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts, but I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts, but I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
You can bow and pretend that
You don't, don't know you're a legend
Time, time, time hasn't told anyone else yet
Sorry, I just let my love loose again
But I don't know much about classic cars 
But I've got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke 
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike, media blitz
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts, but I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts, but I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
You could have knocked me out with a feather
I know you've heard this all before
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts, but I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts, but I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
 Let's hear it for, let's hear it
 Let's hear it for, let's
 Suitehearts...
