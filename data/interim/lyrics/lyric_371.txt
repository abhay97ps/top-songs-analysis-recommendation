No
I said no
Just plain no
Don't you understand English?
No
N-O, No
Please let go
Of my hand
Every time I let you kiss me, kiss me
My heart goes on a roller coaster ride
And every time I let you kiss me, kiss me
I get the little butterflys inside me
No
Uh-uh, no
Please let go
Of my hand
Oh
Must you go
Don't you know
That a girl means yes, when she says
No
N-O, No
Don't let go
When I say no
Don't let go
Don't let go
Don't let go
