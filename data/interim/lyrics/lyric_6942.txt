Riding high down a mountain trail sunshine follows me
Windy early morning mist tries to swallow me
Sunlights clears the way for me, my mother nature's wine
Sunshine
 Yellow river wash away the rain
 Splashing down a Napa Valley lane
Woman of the valley road, my mother nature's wine
Sunshine
Road run fast beside me, my lady's holding on behind
I feel her heart inside me, beating hard as we unwind
All along the road is what we're after but we're waiting for that special sign
According to our favorite brand of laughter
 My mother nature's wine
 My mother nature's wine
 My mother nature's wine
