Sing me, sing me, baby
Sing me, sing me, sing me
Oooh
La, lala, lalala
La, lala, lalala
La, lala, lalala
La, lala, lalala
Ever since I met you
I couldn't want you better
I couldn't love you stronger if I tried
It's my true heart I'm showin'
Or my nose would be growin'
You know that it gets longer when I lie
Singin' la, lala, lalala
La, lala, lalala
La, lala, lalala
La, lala, lalala
Bein' kinda pretty and down here in the city
You'll find it isn't easy to be smart
When tryin' to untangle the jingle from the jangle
It's easy if you listen with your heart
Singin' la, lala, lalala
La, lala, lalala
La, lala, lalala
La, lala, lalala
We'll make the winter springtime
And jingle jangle sing time
Right on through the summer and the fall
So darlin' don't be weepin'
And please don't you be sleepin'
When I come a-creepin' down the hall
To sing you
La, lala, lalala
La, lala, lalala
Oh, come on 
We'll get it together
Oh, come on 
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, come on 
Let's get it together
Oh, come on 
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
La, lala, lalala
La, lala, lalala
La, lala, lalala
La, lala, lalala
