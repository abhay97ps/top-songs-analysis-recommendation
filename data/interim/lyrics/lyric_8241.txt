Let me get to know you
Help me make it last
Love me spare the moment
Good things go so fast
Let me kiss you slowly
There, upon your mouth
Let me get to know you
North, east, west and south
Love, love, love
We found love
Together
In each other
We found love
Loving you comes easy
With someone like you
Skin to skin you please me
I hope I please you, too
Let me build you rainbows
Keep you from the rain
Fill your world with sunshine
Time and time again
Love, love, love
We found love
Together
In each other
We found love
Love, love, love
We found love
Together
In each other
We found love
