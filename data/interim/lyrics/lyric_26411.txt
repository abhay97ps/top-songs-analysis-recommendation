Oh, they fresh out a coffin, don't know why they talkin'
Got power like Austin, they cap with a gown
These rappers is exhaustin', that ho shit gon' cost 'em
They wet like a faucet, I look like a fountain 
In Texas like Austin, in L.A., we golfin'
Can't take no more losses and we steady countin' 
I put 'em in office and didn't get a crown
I'm drenched like a dolphin, the freshest in town 
Racks in, walk in, Maxfield and I'm splurgin' again
Mixin' up Crush like it's juicе and the gin
Stick in her pussy, it's loosenin', yеah 
I went to Houston with Travis, I'm lit 
Niggas send threats and ain't nobody dead 
I done got rich, but I still ain't a lick
Take a Perc' 30 whenever I'm sick
Ring cost a thirty, I ain't even 30 
F.N. hold a .30, blue tips in the clip 
Widebody swervin', Rolls-Royce, that's for certain 
Her head game is urgent, I bust on her lip
We the big dawgs and these lil' niggas shrimps
Vegas, I spent twenty K on the strip
Neighborhood blue on the 'Vette, that's for Nip'
XO, YSL, in the game off the rip
Oh, they fresh out a coffin, don't know why they talkin'
Got power like Austin, they cap with a gown
These rappers is exhaustin', that ho shit gon' cost 'em
They wet like a faucet, I look like a fountain 
In Texas like Austin, in L.A., we golfin'
Can't take no more losses and we steady countin' 
I put 'em in office and didn't get a crown
I'm drenched like a dolphin, the freshest in town 
Came out the jungle with tigers and apes
Can't believe Cash's studio, covered in BAPE 
Fuck so much bitches, I should be in porn
Cost an arm and a leg just to see me perform 
Speakin' the truth 'cause I ain't good at lyin'
And I never play golf, but I still keep my iron
Call up some vibes, I got nothin' but dimes
And she gave me some brain, I got piece of her mind 
Pull up to functions, my name on the banner
Still walkin' through the back door with my hammer 
Told these lil' boys that they don't want no smoke
Had to aim for his legs, can't get caught on the camera
Got me a baddie, when she give me sloppy
She tie up her hair with a Gucci bandana
Come between me and my blues and get handled
I know me some dangerous Crips from Atlanta 
If I run into a problem with cake
I put pots on the stove and I whip up the batter 
Speak on my name, I'ma pull up on you
All your people gon' run when the shots start to splatter
Stayed on my grind and I been makin' noise
And I still find a way how to tune out the chatter
Catchin' yo' bitch is like catchin' the opps
I just pull out my dick and I shoot it right at her
Oh, they fresh out a coffin, don't know why they talkin'
Got power like Austin, they cap with a gown
These rappers is exhaustin', that ho shit gon' cost 'em
They wet like a faucet, I look like a fountain 
In Texas like Austin, in L.A., we golfin'
Can't take no more losses and we steady countin' 
I put 'em in office and didn't get a crown
I'm drenched like a dolphin, the freshest in town 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
