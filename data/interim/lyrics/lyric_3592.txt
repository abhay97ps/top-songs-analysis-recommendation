Young man balling like LeBron James
I ain't on the court, but I'm on the hot page
I got five different beats, kill 'em five different ways
Man, these kids make me laugh when they say they spit flames
It's a shame
'Cause you ain't got what I got, bruh
I am on top of all of these rappers
They are not tough
Everybody thinks that they hot stuff
Let me be the first one to tell you: you are not, cuz
Huh!
Everybody wanna spit the way that I do
Treat a childish rapper like he Caillou
I could write eleven fucking novels and a haiku
In the same time you'd take to write a single line, dude
It would take 21 savages to drop me
And a whole boatful of Lil Yachtys
And if you think that any garbage rapper in this game tops me
You been smoking too much broccoli 
I've been really going hard: call me Tungsten
Raising up the bar on you munchkins
Yeah, you be pulling up in cars at the function
But I been spitting bars at the function
I'm a wizard on the mic: call me Dumbledore or Voldemort
Tatted all over like Baltimore rappercore
Hunting down these rappers like the kid was born on Mandalore
I'm treating competition like Michael Vick with a Labrador
But I could change it up like a switch hitter
Stomach full of mixed liquor, still I spit sicker than these other MCs
You ain't fucking with me, like a nun that you met on Tinder
I'm Master Splinter, but rip a mic like Shredder
I'm better than these rats only in it for the cheddar
I'm a veteran
Y'all a bunch of squares like Tiananmen
I'm eating young bucks like venison
I'm clever when-
-ever I spit with sharp, devilish wit
My bars are heaven-sent
You are essentially shit
I flush 'em down, then I spray Febreze
Y'all best stay away from me
I slay with these, I play for keeps
I'm basically a raging beast
Serve rappers like a ma√Ætre'd
Call me DJ Khaled, got the major keys
I'm top-shelf like grade-A beef
Y'all are softer than a mattress made of Tempur-Pedic foam
Either step up to my throne, or leave me the hell alone
I'm in my zone like Kanye, sipping on Bombay
They taking shots at me like Harambe
I'm finna blow like Pompeii, so stay out of my way
'Cause I'm a verbal giant like Andre
I'm hotter than the sun's rays in the summer
I was Lon Chaney's plumber
You ain't fucking with the boy like a mean ex
I spit sick: get the microphone a Kleenex
I'mma be next
Fuck it, I'mma be best
I bully rappers like the mean kid at recess
Yeah, I run the game like a PC
All of these rappers are cheesy
And if you're on Twitter and see me, it'd be really sweet to hit me with the retweet
Whoa, killing the flow
Colder than sticking your dick in six inches of snow
I'm sicker than syphilis when I be spitting these writtens
I'm slick with the syllables, bro
Welcome to class: here's the syllabus, ho
I'm giving the lesson, call me the Professor
Act up and you get a detention
I guess I should mention: I'm also the principal, ho!
Do you like when I run it like that?
Do you want me to run it right back?
Nah!  I ain't really into mumble-type rap
Or the bitches-and-the-money-type rap
Nah! 'Cause, to me, that's dummy-type rap
And I'm looking for a little bit more
All the people on the radio spitting that dumb shit leave me just a little bit bored
Yeah
Don't need a million to know I'm the best
I'm different, I'm different, I'm not like the rest
Only thing that I need to succeed is a beat
And there's one on repeat right inside of my chest
And that shit won't stop 'til I take my last breath... and I'm still breathing!
Bitch, I am the Devil, this body's my vessel
The judge to all these heathens
Yeah, yeah
Uh!
Fuck fame: I just want a life that's stable
I just want to put food on my table
Want a house and a car, good friends and family
Gimme Netflix, I don't need cable
Just as long as I'm able to keep making music
And laugh at the people who said I was stupid
Prove everyone wrong who said I could not do it
All I have is this passion, and I'mma pursue it
That's real
This is some shit that I feel
I'm in my own lane, with both hands on the wheel
And I'mma keep doing my thing 'til I've made it
I won't ever stop, and I won't ever kneel
I'm snapping, I'm happy, I'm handsome, I'm young
I'm proud of this person that I have become
I followed my passion, I made that shit happen
I'm making the people who doubted look dumb
Look where I'm from, and look at me now
Feeling on top: I don't wanna look down
To all of the people that helped me get where I am:
Just know I won't stop 'til I've made you proud
One, two, three, four, five!
Gimme a beat, and I'mma eat that shit alive!
Been the best since '12, when I learned how to rhyme
And that shit won't stop until I have resigned
Oh my, I rhyme outside the lines
Call me Optimus, because I'm in my prime
My grind's on the rise like tangent lines
Did it all without a co-sign
Get it?
Y'all can't fuck with the kid like Billy
I'm savage, y'all just meek like Milly
Y'all average, mine's just mean
I'm really fucking hot, y'all bars are a little bit chilly
Clap, clap, everybody clap
When I step up to a microphone, you know I'm gonna snap
Cartographer: put my city on the map
Still sleeping on me?  You better wake up from your nap
Control the game like I'm Simon
You know the name, 'cause I'm grindin'
No 9 to 5 as long as I'm alive
If I don't do this shit, then I'm dyin'!
Huh!
