There's nothin' you can do girl, there's nothin' you can say
You talkin' to the sky babe, I just got to get away, yeah
Got to hear the wind song singin' in my ear
Got to get it on girl and I'll never make it here, yeah
'Cause the wind was my mother, the highway is my brother
I was born to wander and it's time for movin' on
I was born to wander turn around and I'll be gone, gone, gone
I'm just followin' my heart girl, and it's followin' the sun
Lookin' for an answer, I know may never come
But I got to chase my dreams girl like a river to the sea
Got to find the rainbow that's waitin' there for me
'Cause the wind was my mother, the highway is my brother
I was born to wander and it's time for movin' on
I was born to wander turn around and I'll be gone, gone, gone, gone
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, gonna move, yeah
Yeah, I was born to wander
I said, I was born to wander
Yeah, born, born to wander
Born to wander, born to wander
Born to wander, born to wander
Born to wander, born to wander
