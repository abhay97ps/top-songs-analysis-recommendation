You're the kind of woman, I've been dreaming of
But I never thought I could ever say it good enough to win your love
You probably think I'm foolish you probably tell me so
I open up my heart then you're probably going to tell me no, but here I go
I want to give you all I've got inside, I want to love you for the rest of my life
There I've done it
There I've said it
There you have it
I don't regret it
I give you my love, in a minute, if you want it, come and get it
There I've done it
There I've said it
There you have it
This is confidential, I never told a soul
Every time I see you, feel my heart begin to loose control
And all I know; is I'm feeling something I've never felt
I want to be with you and nobody else
There I've done it
There I've said it
There you have it
I don't regret it
I give you my love, in a minute, if you want it, come and get it
There I've done it
There I've said it
There you have it
There I've done it
There I've said it
There you have it
I don't regret it
I give you my love, in a minute, if you want it, come and get it
There I've done it
There I've said it
There you have it
Oh yah yah yah
There I've done it
There I've said it
There you have it
