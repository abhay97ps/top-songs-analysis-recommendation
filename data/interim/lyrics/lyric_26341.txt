It's one of the crazier stories we’ve heard of, guys 
As it's unfolding it's like—Fuck Tory Lanez, okay? Now, I’m from Houston, and he's from, bro
And to think that the whole night unfolded on social media
You are the alleged shooter of Megan Thee Stallion
Instagram, in the pool with Kylie Jenner
Was she backtracking with what she said originally?
You know, maybe that's why we don't have a report
Donkey of the day
Some bitches tryna  take up for Tory and, "It's more to the story," bitch, it ain't-there ain't nothing to the story
Tory Lanez got a lot of bad press
Serious, he's gon’ get deported
Donkey of the day for Friday August 21st goes to Daystar Peterson
So they got pulled over and she had been shot already, great
Well, hold up—
Donkey of the Day
What I’m looking like, he looking at the police and then shot her?
Niggas like that, you a sucker, he's the king sucker, he’s the-he's the biggest sucker in the industry 
We gotta talk about Tory Lanez and Megan Thee Stallion
Kaash is looking for you, dawg
Because the police came out saying, "We didn't even know she was shot"
Guess who I believe? Megan
The best thing for Tory Lanez is for real, he needs to just begone
I'm done with this, you gotta know the truth
Ayy, they rather see me in the cell
Like how he posted out with thirty thousand dollar bail?
I’m the GOAT, y'all niggas know I made that dope float on the scale
I had them hoes goin' crazy, fiends crackin', goin' pale
They know I'm real, I got that flow, it's on sale if you need a rush
Coke blowin' out my fiend's nose like the speaker bus
Ho caught me D'd up, talk down, we T'ing up
Megan people tryna frame me for a shootin'
But them boys ain't clean enough
I see how they teamin' up, watchin' and I'm calculatin'
Gotta keep it quiet, I can't jeopardize the outcome waitin'
Seein' certain niggas hatin', like, how this nigga hatin'?
I done gave these people so much features, made these niggas famous
They was on the blog sayin' I'm canceled from this entertainment
I was on that Spotify like thirty million monthly listeners, I'm fuckin' goin' crazy
And my fans support me brazy, everythin' I do is for you, I promise I'll be on it daily
I got nothin' but love to spread, but niggas hate me
Hurt my heart to see them Twitter fingers come from Kehlani's and Kaash Paige's
But I flipped the switch, I'm grippin' money at that fast pace
And don't ask me for shit when it get real, that's my last favor
Can't cry now 'cause I'ma laugh later
Girl, you had the nerve to write that statement on that affidavit
Knowin' I ain't do it but I'm comin' at my truest
Tryna keep this shit two hunnid with you, shorty, I can prove it
But them people in yo ear, they the true ones that I fear
They really got you thinkin' Tory Lanez would do you in, for real
Don't forget you was my bitch, I held it down and kept it real
I would never paint no fake picture of you just for some mills
And I thought that you was solid too, but look at how you doin' me
Look at how you doin' me, people tryna ruin me
And what's even worse is I'm still thinkin' about you and me
How you goin' live my birthday with all your jewelry to try to make some fool of me?
But I love you hard so I'm gon' cool it, B
'Cause I was coolin' right with Cuban, B, that was a stupid me
Somehow I'm still down to renegotiate the unity
My heart in some foolery, this shit is just confusin' me
I'm goin' through these phases, but I gotta stack that paper
And the real estate niggas hatin', took me off that application
But when they took that from me, they really took that from my baby
What the fuck I'm finna say to his old lady?
What the fuck y'all mean, my son don't need a house?
My baby momma don't need safety?
And even though I got the payment, the real estate niggas still hatin'
'Cause he watchin' me all on the news, but I ain't charged with no cases
Say the owner say my case is lookin' crazy, how the fuck that even make sense?
New times turn to past tense
All I want is straight cash, niggas say I lack sense
Star player, hearin' lies comin' from the back bench
Kill or be killed, that's the reason I don't have friends
Niggas lyin' on the crodie, niggas sayin' I'm deported
Oh, now I'm 5'3"? Niggas sayin' I'm a shorty
But lil' bitch I'm 5'7", money on me side-steppin'
And if I stand on my wallet, you can see my thighs in Heaven
One Umbrella gang and when we come back, don't you try reppin'
'Fore I let these niggas breathe, I gotta teach a couple lessons
Gotta see a couple questions: how the fuck you get shot in your foot, don't hit no bones or tendons?
How the fuck your team is tryna to paint me as some whole menace?
I just lost like ten million dollars because this cold business
But I got like ten million followers that's gon' roll with me
Fans that support me 'cause they know my heart
So I don't give a damn if shorty know Jigga
I was taught to beat the block
Eeny, meeny, miney in these streets, and so my Nina cocked
Niggas, y'all can play me, y'all can frame me, but I'ma reach the top
I would never put you in no danger, and if I did, you would've said it when you seen the cops
Ayy, Lamborghini bands and they comin' out the floor
Fff, hit the fan when I'm pullin' out the dough-oh
I would never fall out with niggas over hoes, ayy
Money over fall outs, my nigga, that's the code-oh
Santorini bands when I pull up to the coast
Better have my bands when I pull up to the door-oh
Niggas can't believe I done pulled up in a Ghost
And I don't ever wanna fuck with y'all no more, G
I got bad bitches tryna have a orgy
Keep umbrellas for the days it get stormy
I pour the Henny for my niggas, that's before me
My outfit fly, you gotta seat out by the floor seats
She tatted me all on her face 'cause she adore me
They talkin' petty 'bout me but they lookin' corny
I had to fight for mine, nigga, you were sworn in
And God bless me when I wake up every mornin'
