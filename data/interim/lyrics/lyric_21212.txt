If I wrote a note to God
I would speak what's in my soul
I'd ask for all the hate
To be swept away
For love to overflow
If I wrote a note to God
I'd pour my heart out on each page
I'd ask for war to end
And for peace to mend this world
I'd say, I'd say
I'd say give us the strength
To make it through
Help us find love
'Cause love is overdue
And it seems like
So much is going wrong
On this road we're on
If I wrote a note to God
I'd say please help us find a way
End all the bitterness
Put some tenderness in our hearts
I'd say, I'd say
I'd say give us the strength
To make it through
Help us find love
'Cause love is overdue
And it looks like
We haven't got a clue
Need some help from you
Grant us the faith to carry on
Give us hope
When it seems all hope is gone
'Cause it seems like
So much is going wrong
On this road we're on
No, no
We can't do it on our own
So, so
No, no
We can't do it on our own
So, so
If I wrote a note to God
