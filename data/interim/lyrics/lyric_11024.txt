Ooh, rockin'
Oh yeah
Cruisin' down the motorway
Got my girl by my side
We're both a little anxious
Ooh, we got love on our mind
Waitin', anticipatin'
For the fireworks in the night
Well, I swear we were doin' eighty
When we saw those motel lights
And we were rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
Ooh hoo, rockin'
Rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
Yeah...
Out on the back streets
Taking love where I can
I found a sweet madonna
Ooh, with a bible in her hand
She's waiting
Anticipating
Well, for someone to save her soul;
Well, I ain't no new messiah
But I'm close enough for rock and roll
And we were rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
Ooh hoo, rockin'
Rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
And I'm slowin' down
And she's pullin' in
Waitin', anticipatin'
For the fireworks in the night
Well, I swear we were doin' eighty
When we saw those motel lights
We were rockin'
Rockin'
Into the night
Ooh yeah
Rockin'
Rockin'
Into the night
Ooh, rockin'
Rockin'
Rockin'
Into the night
Rockin', yeah yeah
Rockin'
Rockin'
Into the night
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, rock on
Rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
Ooh, rockin'!
Rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
Ooh, rock in the night
Rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
Yes, rockin' in there tonight
Rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
Yeah, yeah
