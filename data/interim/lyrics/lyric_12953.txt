High energy, your love is lifting me-ah
Hoh-oh-oh-oh, high energy, your love is lifting me
Lifting me hiiiiiiiiiigher, hi-hi-hiiiiiiiigher
It was only last week that we first met
When I was a-walking' down the street
You came up from behi-ind me and I knew
That our eyes were gonna meet
That's when I fell, into your arms
Ima-agine my surprise
I thought this only happened in fairytales
Lo-ove hit me right between the eye-eyes
Oh yeah, high energy, your love is lifting me
Woh-oh-woh-oh-oh, high energy, yeah
Your love is lifting me
Lifting me hiiiiiiiiiigher, hi-hiiiiiiiiigher
When you call me on the phone
You make my spirits rise
I'm glad the others didn't last
It's a blessing in disguise
Everytime your touchin' me
It gives me such a thrill
When I look deep into your eyes
My heart just can't keep sti-i-i-ill, oh no
High energy, yeah, your love is lifting me
Woh-woh-woh-woh-woh, high energy, woh yeah
Your love is lifting me
Lifting me hi-i-i-igh 
Oh-high-high, 
Wooooh-hooo-hooo-hoo , high-yeah-yeah-eah
 Lifting me hiiiiiiiiiigher, hiiiiiiiiiigher
