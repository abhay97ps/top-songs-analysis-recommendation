Every time I see you
Girl, it makes me feel so sad
Knowing you've been seeing
Some other guy that treats you bad
You know that I'm burning
Deep inside for you
Just give me the chance now
And we can see it through
If you'll be my woman
I'll be your one and only man
Gonna take me with you
Far away from hearts of stone
We'll live in the country
And raise some children of our own
I will be your lover
I will be your friend
I'll give you all my loving
On that you can depend
If you'll be my woman
I'll be your one and only man
And there'll be no more crying
I'll make your dreams come true
You know I'll never turn my back on you
And there'll be no more crying
I'll make your dreams come true
You know I'll never turn my back on you
Take you to the city
Girl, we're gonna buy some clothes
Dress you up so pretty
Then we'll take in all the shows
Find a place that's jumping
Where the music's tight
And we'll keep on dancing till the morning light
If you'll be my woman
I'll be your one and only man
Be my woman, I'll be your man
Know I'm gonna give you everything I can
Be my woman, I'll be your man
There'll be no more running, gonna make a stand
