His cows get loose and run right through the fast food parking lots
And Daddy gets calls from the mini-malls
When they're downwind from his hogs
When his tractor backs up traffic, the reception ain't too warm
The city's growing around him, but Daddy won't sell the farm
You can't roll a rock, up a hill that steep
You can't pull roots when they run that deep
He's gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm
He worked and slaved in '68, he bought these fields and trees
He raised his corn and a big red barn and a healthy family
He learned to love the woodlands, he can't stand to do them harm. There's concrete all
Around him, but Daddy won't sell the farm
You can't roll a rock, up a hill that steep
You can't pull roots when they run that deep
He's gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm
One day he's gonna leave it all to me and I'll start my own branch of the family tree
They'll get the message written on the roof of the barn, Daddy won't sell the farm
You can't roll a rock, up a hill that steep
You can't pull roots when they run that deep
He's gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm
We're gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm. Oh you know a country boy can survive
