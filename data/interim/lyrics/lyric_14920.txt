Listen up to my story
Of all the pain and the glory
Of a boy with a heart
'Cause, baby, I think I'm ready to start
If I were king for just one day
And have fame, fortune and money
I'd still have to say not good enough
Because money can't buy me love
Oh, no, no

Searching the world

Been to places of plenty
And all the girls are so trendy
And willing to be your friend
As long as you had a Porsche or a Benz
I remember my mama told me
One day, you will find the only girl
Who will love you
And keep you feeling right
Every day and every single night
Oh, no, no

I'm searching all over the world, yeah
For the serious
For the serious kind of girl for me

Searching the world, yeah

Looking for you, baby
Searching for you, baby
Could be you
You
Could be you
You
I've been searching for, oh, so long
And it seems like it's all in vain
But somehow I know my heart's not wrong
If she's out there
I'll find her someday
