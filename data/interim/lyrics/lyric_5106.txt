When you look into his eyes
And he turns away
When you're at a corner table
And there's nothing much to say
Does he have to draw you pictures?
Does he have to spell it out?
Face it girl, it's over
Whoa, yeah, it's over
When he glances at his watch
And it isn't late
And you try to amuse him
But he doesn't concentrate
Just how plainly can he tell you
Does he have to shout out loud?
Face it, girl, oh yeah, it's over
 What's the use in hanging on
While he slowly slips away from you?
Don't go along for the ride
Keep some semblence of pride
There's really nothing else you can do
There ain't nothing you can do, girl
There ain't nothing you can do, girl
Well, the time has come, I know, for our last goodbye
Guess I'll have to go on living, when it's easier to die
Give me strength enough to take it
Take it like a woman should
Give me the strength I need to take it
Gotta go on, I gotta make it
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know it's over
It's over
Give me the strength I need to take it
Gotta go on, I gotta make it
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know it's over
It's over
