Give her back shots 'til her back hurt 
Thumb through the money 'til my hands hurt 
Wanna go on a date? You gotta dance first 
Take it to the paint, I gotta slam first 
She be actin' stiff with the booty 
Feelin' like I'm Biggie rockin' Coogi 
Draco make you put up that lil' Uzi 
I don't want no features, niggas groupies 
Pass her to the gang, quarterback sneak 
I was in my feelings, now it's, "Fuck Kiki" 
Let lil' Tip hit that bitch, on GP 
Smokin' gas, nigga, I re-up at the BP
Five foot five , she my ride or die 
Never tell a lie , we like Bonnie and Clyde 
Lookin' at her thigh , like, "Do it come with rice?" 
She don't like FaceTime, she would rather Skype
But I'm out for the night 
Out for the night 
Out for the night 
Out for the night 
Yeah, I'm out for the night 
Out for the night 
Out for the night 
Out for the night 
Yeah, you workin' hard 
And I see you 
And your bills late 
And your rent due 
And you never need a man to defend you 
You already pissed off, on your menstrual 
And you been through 
'Cause he been through 
You a star player 
And he benched you 
In your corner, I'd never go against you 
Bought a foreign, now it's friends wanna text you 
You got off late 
And you worked out 
You ain't stunt his baby mama 'cause she burnt out 
You got rid of him and made sure that we worked out 
So I put a hunnid racks in your purse now 
Five foot five , she my ride or die 
Never tell a lie , we like Bonnie and Clyde 
Lookin' at her thigh , like, "Do it come with rice?" 
She don't like FaceTime, she would rather Skype
But I'm out for the night 
Out for the night 
Out for the night 
Out for the night 
Yeah, I'm out for the night 
Out for the night 
Out for the night 
Out for the night
