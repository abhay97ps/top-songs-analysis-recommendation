We were young, maybe twenty
You wore a white dressing gown
Drinking wine and dancing slowly
On the night I laid you down
And the moonlight revealed your body
As the radio played some old Phil Collins songs
And we believed in something holy
On the night I laid you down
We had love in our eyes
We passion in our souls
There was fire in our kisses
But it was not a Phil Collins song
It might have been like Mike + The Mechanics 
Yes, you do, he was the other guy in Genesis
Mmmm, I'm pretty sure that it was Phil Collins 
On the night I laid you down
Any way 
Doesn't matter 
We made love 
'Til the dawn
Two hearts beating 
Is all we heard 
Besides that old 
Phil Collins song
Well, it might have been that song from the movie with the jambox 
That's the one 
Well fuck you, I guess I'm no expert 
In fucking Nineties music 
Whatever
On the night I laid you down
On the night I laid you down
Courtney: Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins were in Genesis. Did you know that?
Stephen: Exactly. Yes. Which is why...
Courtney: But, Phil Collins was the drummer and Peter Gabriel was not the drummer
Stephen: No, he was the bassist. Until he was replaced...
Courtney: But his music is so much different than Phil Collins
Stephen: You didn't let me finish. By... ummmm
Courtney: 
Stephen: Okay I don't know that much about Genesis. But I know Invisible Touch had a cool hand on the cover
Courtney: Unbelievable. You are so not hip
Stephen: And I know that Phil Collins had an album called "No Jacket Necessary."
Courtney: No Jacket Re- Required. Thank you
Stephen: It was called No Jacket Re-re-re-re-required? I've never even heard of that
Courtney:  Fuck you
Stephen: Is that how he got Su-su-sudio?
Courtney: Someone save me
Stephen: You mean someone sa-sa-save me? "In your eyes..."
Courtney: No! No!
Stephen: That's Phil Collins!
Courtney: That's Peter Gabriel!
