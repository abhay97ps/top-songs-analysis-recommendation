Rock steady, baby!
That's what I feel now
Let's call this song exactly what it is
Step and move your hips
With a feeling from side to side
Sit yourself down in your car
And take a ride
And while you're moving
Rock steady
Rock steady, baby
Let's call this song exactly what it is
It's a funky and low down feeling'
In my hips from left to right
What it is is I might be doing
This funky dance all night
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
(What fun to take this ride
Rock steady will only slide)
Rock steady — rock steady, baby
Rock steady — rock steady, baby
Step and move your hips
With a feeling from side to side
Sit yourself down in your car
And take a ride
While you're moving rock steady
Rock steady
Let's call this song exactly what it is
It's a funky and low down feeling'
In my hips from left to right
What it is is I might be doing
This funky dance all night
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
(What fun to take this ride
Rock steady will only slide)
Rock steady, baby
Rock steady ... woo!
Rock steady
It's a funky and low down feeling'
In my hips from left to right
What it is is I might be doing
This funky dance all night
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
(What fun to take this ride
Rock steady will only slide)
Rock steady
Steady, baby!
Rock...rock steady, baby
Baby
Baby baby
Baby
Baby...
