Can't you see me runnin'
I am really runnin'
For my life
Guess from where I'm
Comin'
Guess why I'm runnin
For my life
Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch by my side
Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch by my side
Can't you see my deathfear
I can hear her voice
Shoutin' everywhere
Who know what I've could done
It must be so bad
That a witch does care
Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch by my side
Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch by my side
