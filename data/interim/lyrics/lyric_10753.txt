Take them for the ride
Let them feel the energy you can provide
Roll it through the times
Make it feel like real emotion this time around
You're so physical very intellectual
Can't stop asking why
Running with the changes I'm a social institution
Don't stop driving them wild, wild, wild
 rock me
Touching with your eyes
Make contact for the moment
Where you think you'll survive
Take them for the ride
Although young
Tomorrow wants to know your surprise
 rock me
