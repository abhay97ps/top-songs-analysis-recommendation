Faster than a speeding bullet
You're able to leap the tallest building in a single bound
More powerful than a locomotive
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere, I'm always around
Well I'll be your Superman
Give you super lovin' every chance that I can
Well I'll be your Superman
Grab a hold of my super hand
Take you to a never never land
Great Caesar's ghost, I'll be your Superman
If you're a damsel in distrеss now
Hop inside my phone booth and I will change for you
But if you'rе a devil in a dress now
My little X-ray eyes will see right through you
My name is Superman
Give you all the super lovin' that I can
Well, I'll be your Superman
Take a hold of my super hand
Take you to an ever, ever land
Great Caesar's ghost, I'm your Superman
