You had your fill and now you're on your way
Searchin' for what nobody knows
You think you can go Just anywhere
And toy with any willin' soul
You play with love as though it's a game
Leavin' a string of broken hearts 
But soon the day will come, then you'll learn
The love that you waste
You're gonna need it
Again and again and again 
Oh baby, you don't know it now
You're gonna know it someday
You're throwing a good love away
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You don't know it now
You're gonna know it someday
You led me to believe that someday we would be
Walking together down the aisle 
And now you'rе telling me it's all a big mistake
I'm not thе apple of your eye
Baby, you play with love as though it's a game
Leavin' a string of broken hearts
Now we're down the road
But, don't wanna love me
But soon the day will come and then you'll learn
The love that you waste, you're gonna need it
Again and again and again 
Oh baby, you don't know it now
You're gonna know it someday
You're throwing a good love away
I'm a good man
You don't know it now
But you'll know it someday
You play with love as though it's a game
Leaving a string of broken hearts
Uh huh, mmmhh
But soon the day will come and then you'll learn
That the love that you waste
You're gonna need it
Again and again and again 
Woah-woah! You don't know it now
But you'll know it someday
You're throwing a good love away
Baby, you don't know it now
But you'll know it someday
You're throwing a good love away
I know, I'm gonna miss you woman
Till your well runs dry
Girl, you're gonna cry, one day
Oohhh baby 
You know life is funny sometimes
The same one that said 'I love you, '
Can refuse you
Try to use you, sometime
I gotta know, will you stick with me, baby?
Woah! Hey, I know that you're a young girl
Freedom's new to your world
But honey, you're throwing a good man down the drain
A good man away... hey-hey!
You don't know it, baby
Yes, yes you are! Yes you are!
Yes you are, baby! 
You're throwin' my love away! 
Save it for a rainy day, ahhh! 
I wonder, I wonder
If I showed you the way 
Would you love me today 
Somewhere in your future? 
Ahhhh baby, ahh, you don't' know 
YOu don't' know, you don't' know 
No no no no no no, no 
I'm a good man
I love you you, ahh ahh ahh 
Woah, I'm a good man, ask your friends 
Oh, they've seen me when I was walking around 
Oh, yes sure mister! 
Well, I love you and I'll settle down 
Hey! Create me a family somewhere in the future 
Hey! Hey! Ey! 
Yes you are! 
Yes you are! 
Yes you are! 
Throwing our love away! 
Don't want me around 
I've been a good man 
A good good good good man

Woah oh oh oh!
