From the day I have laid my eyes on you
You make me want to do the things that lovers do
Let's go shopping, I'll take you to your favourite place
First we'll go dancing and share this romance
Stronger than the  on every summer day
Kissing and then the dark went over and looked our way
Let's make our way to France or to the South of Spain
I don't care where we go now that you're here
In this world of mine
You're my Valentine
In this world of mine
I'm gonna take my time, baby
I'm gonna love you right
And bring back that old school love 
That old school love
For my baby, mh-mh
I'm talking about my baby, mh-mh
Let's go dinner, I'll take you to your favourite place
Then will make the club and dance the night away
There's no price of love, so who cares what I pay
You are my queen and you better feel free
Breakfast at your bed when you open your eyes
You only get the best of what I have inside
I'll take you to the top, with me you'll touch the sky
And then we'll fly to wherever you'd like 
In this world of mine 
You're my Valentine 
In this world of mine 
I'm gonna take my time, baby 
I'm gonna love you right
And bring back that old school love 
That old school love
For my baby, mh-mh
I'm talking about my baby, mh-mh
What we talking about?
What we talking about, the queen I like
It's a dream, I'm on so it just feels alright
So, as long as I got my liefde, I'ma be alright
Lenyalo bells, time will tell
Everytime I met her, tell her a ntlogele
I'm on my own world feeling like 
Bring the beat back, let's propel
I don't care where we go now that you're here
In this world of mine
You're my Valentine 
In this world of mine
I'm gonna take my time, baby 
I'm gonna love you right
And bring back that old school love 
That old school love
For my baby, mh-mh
I'm talking about my baby, mh-mh
And then we'll fly to wherever you'd like 
In this world of mine 
You're my Valentine 
In this world of mine 
I'm gonna take my time, baby 
I'm gonna love you right
And bring back that old school love 
That old school love
For my baby, mh-mh
I'm talking about my baby, mh-mh
