Well, I'm goin' out west where I belong
Where the days are short and the nights are long
Where they walk and I'll walk
They twist and I'll twist
They shimmy and I'll shimmy
They fly and I'll fly
Well, they're out there a-havin' fun
In that warm California sun
Well, I'm goin' out west out on the coast
Where the California girls are really the most
Where they walk and I'll walk
They twist and I'll twist
They shimmy and I'll shimmy
They fly and I'll fly
Well, they're out there a-havin' fun
In that warm California sun
Well, the girls are frisky in old 'Frisco
A pretty little chick wherever you go
And they'll walk and I'll walk
They'll twist and I'll twist
They'll shimmy and I'll shimmy
They'll fly and I'll fly
Well, they're out there a-havin' fun
In that warm California sun
Yeah, they're out there a-havin' fun
In that warm California sun
