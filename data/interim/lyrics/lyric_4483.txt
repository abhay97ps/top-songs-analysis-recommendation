Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
When through the sleepy haze I see her lying there
Soft as the rain that falls on summer flowers
Warm as sunlight shining on her golden hair
When I awake and see her there so close beside me
I want to take her in my arms the ache is there so deep inside
Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
Chasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away
And when she turns to touch me I kiss her face so softly
And my Mary wakes to love another day
And Mary's there in sunny days or stormy weather
She doesn't care cause right or wrong, the love we share
We share together
Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the evening
Kissed by the shades of night and starlight in her hair
And as we walk, I hold her close beside me
All our tomorrows for a lifetime we will share
