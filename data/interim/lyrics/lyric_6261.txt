Oh happy day oh happy day
When Jesus washed oh when he washed
When my Jesus washed he washed my sins away
Oh happy day oh happy day oh happy day
When Jesus washed oh when he washed
When my Jesus washed he washed my sins away oh happy day
He taught me how to walk fight and pray fight and pray
And in rejoicing in rejoicing every every every day every day
Oh happy day...
