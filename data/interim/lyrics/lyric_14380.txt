The Tupamaros got a platinum card 
I got a heart of gold and it's time to get hard 
A Moto Guzzi I gotta way to get rich 
I gotta library and a seven day itch 
I got money oh I got around but my life was going nowhere
I was looking for love and I want your love baby love
When you gonna get me Boom! there she was
I was looking for love and I want your love baby love
When you gonna get me Boom! there she was - for me
The Tupamaros an immutable truth 
I got a razor blade an' a beautiful youth 
A Moto Guzzi an' a Gaultier pants 
I got a reason girl, was Immanuel Kant's 
I got money oh I got around but my life was going nowhere 
I was looking for love and I want your love baby love
When you gonna get me Boom! there she was
I was looking for love and I want your love baby love
When you gonna get me Boom! there she was - for me
(baby baby baby
Ooh yeah
There she was
Drivin me out
There she was)
Pharmacopoeia - I got a way with the word 
I got an' alphabet that you never have heard 
I got money oh I got around but my life was going nowhere 
I was looking for love and I want your love baby love
When you gonna get me Boom! there she was
I was looking for love and I want your love baby love
When you gonna get me Boom! there she was - for me
I was looking for love and I want your love baby love
When you gonna get me Boom! there she was
I was looking for love and I want your love baby love
When you gonna get me Boom! there she was - for me
