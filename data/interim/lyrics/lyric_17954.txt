Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh
Lying in your arms, so close together
Didn't know just what I had
Now I toss and turn 'cause I'm without you
How I'm missing you so bad
Where was my head? Where was my heart?
Now I cry alone in the dark
I lie awake, I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy
Thinking of you
Made a mistake when I let you go, baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
I was such a fool, I couldn't see it
Just how good you were to me
 Oh yeah
You confessed your love
Undying devotion
I confessed my need to be free
And now I'm left with all this pain
I've only got myself to blame, no
I lie awake, I drive myself crazy 
Drive myself crazy
Thinking of you
Made a mistake 
Let you go, baby 
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
Why didn't I know it?
How much I loved you, baby
Why couldn't I show it?
If I had only told you
When I had the chance
Oh, I had the chance, oh oh oh!

All: La la la la, oh oh oh oh
I lie awake, I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy
Thinking of you
Made a mistake 
Let you go, baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
I lie awake, I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy
Made a mistake  
Let you go, baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
