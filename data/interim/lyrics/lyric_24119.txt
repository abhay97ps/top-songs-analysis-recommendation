Dun, dun, da-da-dun
Water, ah, huh
Mwah!
Rob $tone, two damn phones, babylons can't crack the code 
Used to sip out styrofoam but figured I should stick to dro 
Backwoods overload, don't like to smoke them Swishers, ho
If you hit my liquor store, it's 50 cents for single Ports
Said she wanna roll with me and smoke up all my weed
I said, "Baby just buy Dutches 'cause you can't smoke for free
I got some loud but no money, babe, buy me a Fiji"
She said, "You need a job", bitch, fuck a job, I still get cheese
Two cell phones, Mr. Mothafuck A Thot
Mr. I Be On That Block, 1207, fuck an opp
They hear my name, they see my squad, rollin dope up on the spot
I'm with your bitch, she on my jock, ain't got no time to love a thot
Got niggas mad my flow so hot, got niggas mad my squad won't stop
We in the game, won't take no loss, I'm sippin' water out the Voss
Got lean all in my fuckin' Sprite, turnin' up on fuckin' sight
Mr. Kenny Powers 'bout to take your girlfriend home tonight, bitch
And I'm smokin' on that widow when you see it out the window
Got a dusty old tee, lookin' bummy, leave it simple
Growin' up, I was always in the middle
So I gotta hold it down for my older and my little
And my brothers beside me, so fuck it, we mobbin' deep
Always grimy, no findin' me, but I be in LG
If your lil' fuckboy lame ass wanna creep
I live by the lemon 'cause that fucker chose me
Said she wanna roll with me and smoke up all my weed
I said, "Baby just buy Dutches 'cause you can't smoke for free
I got some loud but no money, babe, buy me a Fiji"
She said, "You need a job", bitch, fuck a job, I still get cheese
Yeah, got 1207 in this bitch, God
