Love is all we need
When did you know that we can
That we can get along
You and me, we can only get better
Building a love that is strong
But then you went and you lied to me
And I don’t know if I’ll ever believe again
It is just something inside of me
But it’s you, you’re deceiving
Sweet honesty, yeah
Won’t you believe you could be the one
Be the one
Sweet honesty, yeah
Won’t you believe you could be the one
Be the one for me
Need your sweet honesty
Can you give it to me
All the love that we had
And I’m down on my knees
Cause I’m walking today
If you treat me this way
Need your sweet honesty
Oh yeah, honestly
Love is all we need
But I’m learning that love can
That it can break my heart
I had faith when you made me the promise
We’d never be apart
But then you went and you lied to me
And I don’t know if I’ll ever believe again
It is just something in side of me
But it’s you, you’re deceiving
Sweet honesty, yeah
Won’t you believe you could be the one
Be the one
Sweet honesty, yeah
Won’t you believe you could be the one
Be the one for me
Need your sweet honesty
Can you give it to me
All the love that we had
And I’m down on my knees
Cause I’m walking today
If you treat me this way
Need your sweet honesty
Sweet honesty, yeah
Won’t you believe you could be the one
Be the one
Sweet honesty, yeah
Won’t you believe you could be the one
Be the one for me
