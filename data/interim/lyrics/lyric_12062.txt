I know she'll never understand
I gave my word before we met
So I just can't go breaking it
She'll say she thinks I'm out of touch
I've let my duty, honorbound, come between the love we've found
Chorus:
How can I live without her when she's all I'm livin' for? (I'm livin'
For) How can I live without her, live like I did before? Now I can see
Through her eyes how good love could be How can I live without her
When she's gone?
No matter what the future brings
I'll hold the memories in my heart
No matter how long we're apart
She'll always be the only one
Her name forever on my lips
She's slipping through my fingertips
Chorus
