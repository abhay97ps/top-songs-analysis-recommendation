Here I go again
Hear that knocking, won't you let me in?
Only want that same old thing
Yet it's me here ring, ring, ring
I want your love, wake up my love and let it in
Well, you know it's me out here
Can't give up now, let us make that clear
All I've had's the run around
Though I'm barking like some hound
I want your love, wake up my love and let it in
I want your love, wake up my love and let it in
My life's been so many ways
Too much darkness gets me crazed
All around us people fight
Christ, I'm looking for some light
Inside your love, wake up my love and let it in
I don't have no friends of mine
Who can swing me down that vine
Not much sense in what they do
That is why I'm calling you
Inside my love, wake up my love and let it in
I want your love, wake up my love and let it in
Wake up my love, wake up my love and let it in
Oh I need you, Lord
Oh I need you more
There's this emptiness outside
You know Lord, it drives me wild
I got tired of wrong and right
You can see I need your light
And that's me knocking on your door
And it's you I'm looking for
Oh, Lord
Oh, Lord
Wake up my love, let it in
I want to love, wake up my love and let it in
I want to love, wake up my love and let it in
