Umm just a little just a little just a little
Don't you love me just a little don't you want me, just a little
Can't you thrill me just a little
Umm say you love me just a little just a little
Can't you kiss me just a little don't you miss me just a little
Don't you love me just a little
Umm say you want me just a little just a little
I told you baby a million times you're just about to make me lose my mind
I'm gettin' tired of playing second fiddle umm just a little
Say you love me just a little say you want me just a little
Can't you thrill me just a little umm say you love me
I told you baby a million times you're just about to make me lose my mind
I'm gettin' tired of playing second fiddle umm just a little
Say you love me just a little say you want me just a little
Don't you love me just a little umm don't you need me just a little
