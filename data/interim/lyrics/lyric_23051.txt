Ooh, oh
Oh, yeah, mmmm
A hundred and five is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I want to be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That's precisely what I plan to do
And you know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all of the finer things in life
We'll forever be in love so there ain't no need to rush
But one day I won't be able to ask you loud enough
I'll say will you marry me?
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me?
Singing, oh-woah
Oh, oh-woah
Oh-woah
Oh, yeah
How many girls in the world could make me feel like this?
Baby, I don't ever plan to find out
The more I look, the more I find the reasons why
You're the love of my life
You know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all of the finer things in life
We'll forever be in love so there ain't no need to rush
But one day I won't be able to ask you loud enough
I'll say will you marry me?
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me?
And if I lost everything
In my heart it means nothing
'Cause I have you, girl, I have you
To get right down on bended knee
Nothing else would ever be better, better
The day when I
I'll say will you marry me?
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me? 
I'll say will you marry me? 
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me? 
Got me singing, oh-woah
Got me singing, oh-woah
Would you marry me, baby? Oh-woah
Oh-woah 
Oh-woah 
A hundred and five is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I want to be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That's precisely what I plan to do
