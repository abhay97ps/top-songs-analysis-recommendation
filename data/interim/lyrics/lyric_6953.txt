I'm never gonna stray away, baby
Never gonna stray away
I'm never gonna stray away, baby
Never gonna stray away
In these changing times
There's no one can make me
Change my mind, no
In these changing times
How much of a sinner do you see 
Mind you, how you miss the scenery
That's why the day
The love don't last
Makes life movin'
Much too fast
Never, never, never ever leave
Oh, no
Oh, in these changing times
There's no one can make me
Change my mind, no
In these changing times
Like a rock
You're always by my side, girl
Now listen
Some men are never satisfied
Even with the right woman
By his side
Changes women
Like the coins in his hand
But I know
That ain't really the measure of a man
I'm too much a part of you
To be a part of someone else
If I cheat on you, girl
I'd be cheating on myself
So, in these changing times
There's no one can make me
Change my mind, girl
In these changing times
Like a rock
You're always by my side, girl
No, I'll never, never stray
Oh, no, no, no, no, no I'll never
In these changing times
There's no one can make me
Change my mind, girl
In these changing times
Like a rock
You're always by my side, girl
In these changing times
There's no one can make me
Change my mind, girl
In these changing times
Like a rock
You're always by my side, girl
In these changing times
