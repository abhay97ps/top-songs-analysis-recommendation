I'm doing me like Siamese incest
We're about to raise up the roof like bench press
All the pretty girls in the place start dancin'
And all the nerds in the place start spazzin'
No gown, no gavel, no judgment
And baby girl swallows like it's Robitussin
Ugh
Now that's distasteful
And niggas talking trash and that's just wasteful
I don't need to say how I'm a great MC
I'll just sit back and let my words speak for me
Do re mi fa so la ti do
That's fake orange juice I call that Tarentino
And that's Pulp Fiction
You found a new addiction
Comeback Music's what you've been missin
McCloud
David is the 1st name
Similar to Bruce Wayne
I'm on fire where's the Propane
x2
New kids on the block we're fresh to undeath
Cooking up beats call us the Iron Chef
Dancing on the floor can you keep up girl
All they can say is let me catch my breath
All they can say is let me catch my breath 
Give me a second let me catch my breath
Oh no it's the kids are back off the shelf
Making new sounds that you have never felt
Vibrating on rhythm yes its a new culture
The nerd is back guess I'm the one who told ya
So come on girl move those hips around
Whenever the kids are coming back in town
Taking shots, who called in the firing squad
I make music just to hear the crowd applaud
Why am I lying I make music cuz I love it
So much to the point that no one I know is above it
Enjoying the party when the music turns on
Keep it going on night like a bedroom marathon
I beat the drums real hard
Let me stop now before I take it too far
To the next level is where this song's taking me
Regenerating my power like I took a hit of V
Cuz yes I'm a monster, we've established this
Vampire teeth showing, would you like a kiss
From the sin-inspiring creature that I am
Girls only know me cuz I make them go Ka-Blam
At the end of the night, they're melting like Melt-Man
Brusing up the skin, changing them like a sun tan
Girls say I'm smooth so they call me lotion
Hey what can I say, Sinsation is the man
x2
When I walk in you bitches know I'm here to smack face
Do it on the 1st try, never hit a backspace
Wanna blow me, now you should've done it in the 1st place
Praising the Lord but you're living on my grace
I can screw girls who wouldn't let you get to 1st base
Word around the campfire, rapper's saying I'm fake
Acting like It's my fault I'm whiter than a milkshake
But I get all the love cuz I get them so baked
