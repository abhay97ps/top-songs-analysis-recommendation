It's been a while, how have you been
It's really good you know to see you again
You'd think by now those old feelings had died
But it only takes just one look in your eyes
And it's all I can do to talk about the weather
To keep myself together when I'm fallin' apart
And it's all I can do to smile and say I'm fine
When I'm really losin' my mind
It's all I can do 
To keep this heart from just breaking in two
To see the lips I used to kiss
Doesn't make it easy to just stand here like this
I get to thinkin' I'm doin' all right
Then I see the arms that once held me so tight
And it's all I can do to talk about the weather
To keep myself together when I'm fallin' apart
And it's all I can do to smile and say I'm fine
When I'm really losin' my mind
It's all I can do 
It's all I can do
To keep this heart from just breaking in two
