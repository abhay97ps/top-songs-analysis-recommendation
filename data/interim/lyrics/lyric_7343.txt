Mama said to me: "We gotta have your life run right
Off you go to school where you can learn the rules there right
Be just like your dabbling father when it seems tradition
Never go astray and stay an honest, lovin' son"
Son of my father
Moulded, I was folded, I was free from draft
Son of my father
Commanded, I was branded in a plastic vac'
Surrounded and confounded by statistic facts
Tried to keep me in but I jumped out of my skin in time
I saw through the lies and read the alibi signs
So I left my home, I'm really on my own at last
Left the trodden path and separated from the past
Son of my father
Changing, rearranging into someone new
Son of my father
Collecting and selecting independant views
Knowing and I'm showing that a change is due
Son of my father
Moulded, I was folded, I was free from draft
Son of my father
