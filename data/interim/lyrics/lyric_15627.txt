 Our lovers' quarrel
 Hurts more than I can say
 All night
Help me here 
Help me here 
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams 
Doing really nasty things 
Damn, you were in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams
We could be caught 
We're both convicted criminals of thought 
Let's white 
Glove the bed 
Help me here 
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do 
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams 
Doing really nasty things 
Damn, you were in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams
Don't stop the party 
Let's keep it naughty, yeah 
Watch me act a fool 
Tomorrow when I run into you, tomorrow when I run into you
You could turn to stone or the color of men petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and... oh my God!
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams 
Doing really nasty things 
Damn, you were in my sex dreams 
Last night
Don't stop the party 
Let's keep it naughty, yeah 
Watch me act a fool 
Tomorrow when I run into you
