I know you can control it, babe
I know you can control it, babe
I know you can control it, baby
Ooh, yeah
Sweet, sweet temptation
For my soul sensation
I just got to have you all to myself
Give it up
A fact's a fact
Too late now for turning back
Every calculation comes up with you
I gotta feel the fire, baby
I guess I'll never learn
I need you to get closer
And love me all up
I ain't through
So get back here
And love me all up
I'm wild for you, baby
You got me going crazy
I need something different
A new kind of thrill
Reflections of your heart and soul
In my kiss
I'll make you whole
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll satisfy you
I got a one track mind, baby
And you just crossed my line
I need you to get closer
And love me all up
I ain't through
So get back here
And love me all up
I need you to get closer
And love me all up
I ain't through
So get back here
And love me all up
You're the stars in the night
You're the dream I can touch
Baby, don't be afraid
You can love me tonight
I need you to get closer
And love me all up
I ain't through
So get back here
And love me all up
I need you to get closer
And love me all up
I ain't through
So get back here
And love me all up
I know you can control it, babe
I know you can control it, babe
I know you can control it, baby
I know you can control it, babe
I know you can control it, babe
I know you can control it, baby
