Well I have felt it and I have held it
I have known a woman's love
And I have tasted and I have wasted
A woman's love
And I know, I know I'll never understand
All the little things that make it grand
A woman's love
And I know, I know I'll never come face to face
With anything that takes the place
Of a woman's love
Well, I have kiss it, tried to resist it
I have missed a woman's love
And I have hated, taken for granted
A woman's love
And I know, I know I'll never understand
All the little things that make it grand
A woman's love
And I know, I know I'll never come face to face
With anything that takes the place
Of a woman's love
Well I have needed and I have pleaded
And I have lost a woman's love
And I have worshipped and I have cursed it
A woman's love
And I know, I know I'll never understand
All the little things that make it grand
A woman's love
And I know, I know I'll never come face to face
With anything that takes the place
Of a woman's love
Well I adore it and thank God for it
A woman's love
