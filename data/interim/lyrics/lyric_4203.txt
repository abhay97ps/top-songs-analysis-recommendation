Find me a rose that never fades and dies
And I'll show you a man who never ever cheats and lies
Find me a star and if you can prove
The star you've found just never disappears
I'll show you a man who'll
Never, never, ever, ever bring you tears
Another night when I'm all alone
Another night without him
Another night when I stay at home
I worry so about him
Oh, I love him, and my love makes me proud
I need him, if he doesn't come back
I know I'll surely die
Find me a cloud that never brings you rain
And I'll show you a man who never, ever brings you pain
Find me a bird and if you can prove
That bird you've found has no wings but still can fly
I'll show you a man who'll
Never, never, ever, ever leave you high and dry
Another night when I'm all alone
Another night without him
Another night when I stay at home
I worry so about him
Oh, I love him
And my love makes me proud
I need him, if he doesn't come back
I'll die
And he'll never, never, ever take me in his arms
Another night when I'm all alone
Another night without him
Another night when I stay at home
I worry so about him
Another night when I'm all alone
Another night without him
Another night when I stay at home
I worry so about him
Another night when I'm all alone
Another night without him
Another night, another night
I worry so about him
