Used to be sleepin' on itchy beds 
Bed bugs in the motel 
Now your bitch give me head 
Twenty bitches in the hotel 
On a ramen noodle diet 
Tour life wasn't so well 
All my niggas starting riots 
Moshpittin' on your toenails 
Uncle T doing so well 
First class from a old jail 
T Ferg did fifteen 
In the feds, getting no mail 
My daddy died and my cousin too 
They didn't let them out of no cell 
Provide jobs for my whole block 
I cannot slow down 
Nigga, I won't stop now 
Mothafucker, this is my town 
Take the block, make it hot now 
143rd with the drop down 
Icy chain with the watch now 
Third piece full of rocks now 
Niggas squint when they watch now 
Leveling up to the top now

All my niggas put in work, hey

Man and went to see my jeweler, woo and I re'd up
Went and bought some new jewels
Hit the car dealer, woo-woo, re'd up
Who knew we would blow up like nitro?
Now these bitches need us
Ooh, I just tasted molly on me
Lord knows I just re'd up
Dip and dabbin' in some new designer
I just dipped and dabbed with the semi tucked
You on the red carpet surrounded by pop stars tryna act tough
I gotta Actavis on me, nigga, and I po'd up
They say that we couldn't smoke in this bitch
And we fucked around and still rolled up
I'm on a new level

Daddy lookin' down, I know he see me blowin' up
My grandma would be so proud 
Up in Heaven, Yamborgini, know my brother see me
I'ma make my bro proud 
Tell his mama I'ma take her outta work
Know that I'ma hold my bros down 
A$AP 'til a nigga die
If you didn't know, well, you know now
I gotta get in my zone now
I gotta get in my zone now 
Only a couple-a more down
Momma gon' get a new home now 
Teach Marty Baller how to be a boss 
So none of us ever go broke now 
I'ma bring you to the water, swim, nigga
I cannot bring you the boat now
I'm on a new level
