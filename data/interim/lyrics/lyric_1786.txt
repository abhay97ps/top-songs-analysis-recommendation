Going through the Mushroom Kingdom
I'm gonna save the Princess, bitch
I got a red hat, red shirt, suspenders on
Wait, I guess I'm black and white in this shit
I got my fireballs bouncing, hit you dead in the jaw
Take down the boss 'cause he's breaking the law
Kick the turtle shell, oh wait, shit, nah
They explode in this, fucking burnt my balls
Now I'm small, and I'm running like I just don't care
Jump in the plane and fly around in the air
Take Tatanga down, bitch, I ain't scared
Do you like Captain Lou and hit your face with a chair
It's the Goomba stomping, Mushroom popping mustached man
Koopa clomping, body dropping, fireball in my hand
Run and jump, duck and slide, to get the box on the other side
Breaking bricks with my fucking fist, bitch, I'm coming inside
Through the castle, no hassle, on my way to the end
Daisy went and got kidnapped again
It isn't Koopa, but they might be friends
I'm gonna whomp you, motherfucker, don't even pretend
Oh, Mario...
I'm not the Princess, I'm a bad guy, bitch
I just wanted to get your hopes up, man, forget it
Either way, I'm outta work, it's time to clock out
You got one more level, goodbye for now
See ya!
It's kung-fu land, I got fire in my hand
For that weird jumping motherfucking kung-fu man
If you don't like this track, I guess I understand
But I get to fight Wario in the next Land, so...
Off to Daisy I go one more time
Get your hands off her, Tatanga, she's mine
Jump in the plane and fucking go for a ride
Shooting at motherfuckers as I fly by
Look at me, way up in the sky
Collecting coins as I spit my rhyme
This kung-fu faggot won't fucking die
Throw my fireball and hit him dead in the eye, bitch
What the hell? It's a fucking cloud!
Dodge the lightning, shoot fire in his mouth
As he crumbles, I hear the rumble as the boss flies in
Let the final battle begin, motherfucker
Mario, I hope you're ready to die
My spaceship shoots three balls at a time
Your aircraft can't compare to mine
You're never going to leave my castle alive
What the hell, man, damn, what the fuck are you anyway?
It's sad you never made it past these Game Boy games
I'll laugh, dodge your bullets, shoot your spaceship in half
Rescue Daisy and go take a nap, yeah
I'm here to stay
Right behind this controller, I'll still play
'Til the world is safe for you and me tonight
Day after day
If it takes forever, Daisy, I'll stay
And hold your hand, please stay with me tonight
