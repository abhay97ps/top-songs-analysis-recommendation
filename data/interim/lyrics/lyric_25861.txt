Yeah, ha
Big speaker, one thing about it I'ma stand  
I'm not the one I think you should fuck with
Just lettin' you know in advance 
I got a goon holdin' a burner
You can get left with a tan 
He a junkie for the dumb shit 
Want all the smoke like a strand 
Just protecting the brand 
Too much to count right now, I don't got enough hands
They dissin', I know that they wishin' I give 'em a chance
You reach, I blank, you stank, I'm goin' to the can 
For protecting the brand 
Just protecting the brand 
Get the drop, go hit up his block 
The chopper hold ninety-nine plus one
That's a 100 some shots for a opp 
Put on for my city every time I drop
Couple niggas stuck and they mad that I'm not
Hate that I'm hot like what's under the pot
Got 'em where I want 'em, I hear that a lot
Big speaker, big stepper, still in rotation with the trappers and the jackers
Hot boy ridin' with the pump, asthma
Double R truck, red seats, plasma
I'm hittin' a bitch from the back, got her sayin' the brand
And free all the bros out the can 
Never see him, so we clappin' his mans like hands
Why would you play with the clan?
F and the N, A and the R
Infrared beam, it glow in the dark
Put in the work and don't tell what you saw
I'm a big driver, controllin' the car 
They ridin', I'm wrong or right 
Lil' niggas tote choppas my height 
I flooded the brand' in ice 
You reach, you playin' with your life 
Big speaker, one thing about it I'ma stand  
I'm not the one I think you should fuck with
Just lettin' you know in advance

Too much to count right now, I don't got enough hands
They dissin', I know that they wishin' I give 'em a chance
You reach, I blank, you stank, I'm goin' to the can 
For protecting the brand 
Just protecting the brand 
You know the brand, we winnin' 
Better ask 'bout DaBaby and see what they say
That lil' nigga ain't playin', he wit' it 
Nigga know I keep fire on me 24/7
You get cooked like a pan, a skillet by protecting the brand
How you standin' on that? I come step on you like you a pair of tennis 
Ain't that what they call it in Memphis? 
Know a few niggas ballin' in Memphis 
Got a bag, I'm with Bagg, I'ma let you know 
If I pull that bitch out, I'ma let it blow 
Nigga, you know I'm hot, and my bitch a hot girl
We'll pop out like we Meg and Yo
It was time to go right by the brand and your boy showed his hand
That lil' nigga was scared to go
I think these niggas scared of the label
Got a brand with my brand, way ahead of your label
We made niggas famous
Put one of yo ass on the news, now your mama scared of the cable
Ayy, baby, what you gon' do if a nigga walk down
And he caught himself checkin' the label?
Tell my lil' brother, "Pass me that AR"
Like I'm askin' for salt and pepper at the table
'Cause I'm a
