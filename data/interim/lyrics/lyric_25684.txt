Yeah, oh, whoa, ooh
Yeah, yeah
Said you needed a ride, but you wanted my car
Without that face, girl, you wouldn't get far
I really like you, despite who you are, oh 
You see me on TV, you know I'm a star
You say you don't know me, but I know that's false
I'll pay the price, girl, whatever that cost, oh 
You make my life so hard
But that's what gets me off
I had a thousand bad times
So what's another time to me? 
You try to burn my house down
But what's another house to me? 
'Cause I can take anything that you give me 
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch
So thank you for the grave 
I needed me a place to sleep 
And I don't wanna meet your mama 
She prolly crazier than you 
I'm gonna need some thicker armor 
To spend another night with you 
Baby, I know just what to do
Every time you fuck me over, I'll come back to you
Baby, I don't want to know the truth 
I ignore them when they tell me all the shit you do 
I always get my heart broke like I needed the practice 
Foot on my throat 'til my world is collapsin' 
But this what I chose, it's the law of attraction, yeah 
Girl, you make my life so hard 
But that's what gets me off
I had a thousand bad times
So what's another time to me? 
You try to burn my house down
But what's another house to me? 
'Cause I can take anything that you give me 
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch 
So thank you for the grave 
I needed me a place to sleep 
I should get out, but I still want more
I should get out, what am I waitin' for?
It's all the same to me, it's all a game to me
It's all the same to me, it's all the same
I had a thousand bad times
So what's another time to me? 
You try to burn my house down
But what's another house to me? 
'Cause I can take anything that you give me 
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch 
So thank you for the grave 
I needed me a place to sleep 
We go there, oh
