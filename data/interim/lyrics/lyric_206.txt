Forever my darling our love will be true
Always and forever I'll love just you
Just promise me darling your love in return
Let this fire in my soul dear forever burn
My heart's at your command dear to keep love and to hold
Making you happy is my desire dear keeping you is my goal
I'll forever love you the rest of my days
I'll never part from you and your loving way
My heart's at your command dear...
