Baby, I believe in you
Hope that you believe in me, girl
Baby, I believe in you
And every little thing you do
Every time we kiss
It always feels like this
I believe in you
Oh, maybe I might sound crazy
For the way I feel about you
Baby, you're just so amazing
That I'm so in love, girl
I believe in you
I believe in you
There's something about you
Baby, I believe in us
And every little inch of our trust
Whether I'm around
You never let me down
I believe in you
Maybe I might sound crazy
For the way I feel about you
But, baby, you're just so amazing
That I'm so in love, girl, with you
I believe in you
I believe in you
There's something about you
Baby
Why, close to you
My love, I believe in you
I believe in you
There's something about you
I believe in you
There's something about you
I believe in you
