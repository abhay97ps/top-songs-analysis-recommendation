You know, I waited so long
So long to let you know how I really feel
I've always wanted to let you know
I've always cared for you
I'm still in love with you
You're the only one in this world
I consider my first true love
And if you come back to me
I'll always be waiting
Today, tomorrow and forever
I've always wondered where you are
Knowing that I'm so in love with you
I hope you'll come back to me someday
I'll always be waiting in a special way
First true love
Is the one that I'm thinking of
It's because it's my first true love
And, baby, it's you
First true love
Is the one that I'm thinking of
It's because it's my first true love
And, baby, it's you
I wonder if you feel the same
Always thinking of me day by day
I hope you're in love with me
And hope you're not blind to see
The possibility of you and me
First true love
Is the one that I'm thinking of
It's because it's my first true love
And, baby, it's you
First true love
Is the one that I'm thinking of
It's because it's my first true love
And, baby, it's you
I see the people standing all around me
They feel the music
Baby, they have found me
But I know the truth and, baby, it is you
Oh, baby, can't you see that I am crying?
My heart is hurting
Please now help me find the love I had
When I was with you
First true love
Is the one that I'm thinking of
It's because it's my first true love
And, baby, it's you
First true love
Is the one that I'm thinking of
It's because it's my first true love
And, baby, it's you
