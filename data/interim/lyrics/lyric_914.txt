She's my transistor sister
Ah, with a radio on her arm
No one can resist her
'Cause she's loaded with a musical charm
It's Presley, Darin and U.S. Bonds
And it's Fats and Connie and Orbison
She's my transistor sister
Playin' her radio
Yeah, now early in the mornin' 'til late at night
She's in tune with the local DJs
Sings all the words to the latest hits
Right along with the records they play
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Transistor sister
Transistor sister
Transistor sister
Playin' her radio
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
She's my transistor sister
Boy, you've got to love her a lot
The guys just can't resist her
Oh, with a 15,000 watt
If you got it right you get no static
The time and weather is automatic
My transistor sister
Playin' her radio
Yeah, now early in the mornin' 'til late at night
She's in tune with the local DJs
Sings all the words to the latest hits
Right along with the records they play
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Transistor sister
Transistor sister
Transistor sister
Playin' her radio
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Transistor sister
Playin' her radio
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Transistor sister
Playin' her radio
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Transistor sister
