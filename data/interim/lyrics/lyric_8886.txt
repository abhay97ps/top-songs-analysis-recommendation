Losers and winners
Everyone must play fair
All you beginners know
That you've got to start somewhere
 Whether you're saints or sinners
 Smile and share
 Sunlight as well as shadows
While you learn that everyone cares 
Everyone out there 
Has a cross to bear 
And we'll never dare to live alone
'Cause we're not stones rolling down a mountainside
We all count and we've got strength and we got pride
'Cause God is on our side 
Mmm, hmm, God is on our side, hmm, hmm
Winners and losers
Fight when you know you're right
You'll get some bruises but
Some fool see the light
 So when you talk confused, yeah
 Keep your pride
 Smile and you'll make them listen
While you teach, then we'll be alright 
Birds will stay in flight 
Day will follow night 
So keep the truth in sight
But no, no, no
'Cause we're not stones rolling down a mountainside
We all count and we've got strength and we got pride
'Cause God is on our side , baby, girl
God is on our side 
I said  we're not stones, no, no
Hey, baby, hey 
Mmm, hmm, mmm, hmm 
God is on our side 
Hey, we ain't stones, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
Givers and takers , whoa, you heart breakers 
We could break or make up, God is on our side, yeah
Come on, mmm... hmm... hmm...
Come on, yeah, yeah
Rolling down a mountainside
Rolling down a mountainside
Rolling down a mountainside
Rolling down a mountainside
Rolling down a mountainside
Rolling down a mountainside
