Desmond has a barrow
In the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly
Girl, I like your face
And Molly says this as she
Takes him by the hand
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, yeah
La la, how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, yeah
La la, how the life goes on
Desmond take a trolley
To the jewelery store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly
Waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her
She begins to sing
In a couple of years
They have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids
Running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones
Happy ever after
In the market place
Desmond lets the
Children lend a hand
Molly stays at home
And does her pretty face
And in the evening
She's still singing with the band
In a couple of years
They have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids
Running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones
Happy ever after
In the market place
Molly lets the
Children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home
And does his pretty face
And in the evening
She's still singing with the band
Everybody
