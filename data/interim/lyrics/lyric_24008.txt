Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
She's stacking money, money everywhere she goes
You know, pesos out of Mexico
De uno, commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up, she professional
She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy
She love the way it tastes, that's her recipe
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy 
She already made enough, but she'll never leave
Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
She works for the money, she work for the money
From the start to the finish
And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar
And she worth every minute
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She stack her money, money everywhere she goes
She got that Sake, her Yamazaki straight from Tokyo
Oh baby, you know, she got them commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up 'cause she professional
Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn 
She murdered everybody and I was her witness 
She works for the money 
She work for the money 
From the start to the finish 
And she worth every dollar 
She worth every dollar 
And she worth every minute
Stars in her eyes
She fights for the power, keeping time
She grinds day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Work from Friday to Sunday, oh
She gon' slang
She too smart to crave material things
She pushing herself day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Work from Friday to Sunday, oh
Stars in her eyes
She fights and she sweats those sleepless nights
But she don't mind, she loves the grind
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday, yeah, yeah
She gon' slang
Too smart to crave material things
Stacking her paper, stacking her cake up
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday
Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
She works for the money, she work for the money
From the start to the finish
And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar 
And she worth every minute
Ooh, boy, I'll make you feel
You'll always come back to me
Come back, come back
Come back, come back
Come back, come back
