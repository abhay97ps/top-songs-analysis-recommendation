First I get cold and hot
Think I'm on fire, but I'm not
Oh, what a pain I've got
It must be love
There's nothing I can do
All that I want is you
Look what I'm goin' through
It must be love
It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
And fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreamin' of
Oh what a feelin'
It must be love
Something is wrong or right
I think of you all night
Can't sleep 'til morning light
It must be love
Seeing you in my dreams
Holding you close to me
Oh, what else can it be?
It must be love
It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
And fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I been dreamin' of
Oh what a feelin'
It must be love
It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
And fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I been dreamin' of
Oh what a feelin'
It must be love
It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
And fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I been dreamin' of
Oh what a feelin'
It must be love
It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
And fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I been dreamin' of
Oh what a feelin'
It must be love
It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
And fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I been dreamin' of
Oh what a feelin'
