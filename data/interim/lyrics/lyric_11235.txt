When you wake up in the morning
And the light is hurt your head
The first thing you do
When you get up out of bed
Is hit that streets a-runnin'
And try to beat the masses
And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Spied a little thing and
I followed her all night
In a funky fine Levi's and her
Sweater's kind of tight
She had a west coast strut
That was sweet as molasses
But what really knocked
Me out was her cheap sunglasses
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Now go out and get yourself
Some thick black frames
With the glass so dark
They won't even know your name
And the choice is up to you
Cause they come in two classes
Rhinestone shades
And cheap sunglasses
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
