Living in the city, I've been abused 
The jobs I keep, the people I meet
Don't do more than make me amused
Everywhere I turn now, just more bad news
So don't look now and don't ask how
We're gonna find me a way to the animal zoo
Oh no, something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey hey, you got too much to lose
Gotta get on back to the animal zoo
Hey hey
Looking at my body, I'm slipping down 
The air I breathe and the water I drink
Is selling me short and turning me around
Everyone I see now on their way too 
So don't look now and don't ask how
We're gonna find our way home to the animal zoo
Oh no, something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey hey, you got too much to lose
Gotta get on home to the animal zoo
Hey hey
Look out
Oh no, something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey hey, you got too much to lose
Gotta get on home to the animal zoo
Hey Hey ow
Oh no, something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey hey, you got too much to lose
Gotta get on home to the animal zoo
Much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long...
