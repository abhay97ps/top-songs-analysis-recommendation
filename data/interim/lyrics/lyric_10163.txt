Oh baby, this time it's goodbye
And you can be sure that I won't cry
Our love is just a faded story
I'm walking down the road
And you just got to let me go 'cause
I can't hold on
I can't hold on
I can't hold on anymore
Well, what was that sweet lullaby
And were all those promises just lies
Well, I was just a fool to love you
I knew it all along
I can't look down, I know I'm falling
'Cause I can't hold on
I can't hold on
I can't hold on anymore
When you act the way that you do
I want to scream and shout
You keep on playing games
I walk around the block and I think maybe you'll change
But just when it seems we've got it all worked out
You start naming names
I don't believe that I was the one to blame
And maybe next time you'll cry
When someone like me says goodbye
You'll wake up when she's gone and wonder
How you could let her go
But look at me, I'm going under
'Cause I can't hold on
I can't hold on
I can't hold on anymore
No
I can't hold on
I can't hold on
I can't hold on anymore
