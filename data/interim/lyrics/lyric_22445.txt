Ow, ow
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
But is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
Hee, ah
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told about equality
Ain't it true, either you're 
Woo 
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Hee
Don't bet
Heehee
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So, when the going get rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going get mean
Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking 
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo
Black or white
It's black, it's white 
{It's tough for you to get by} 
It's black, it's white  
 Yeah, yeah
It's black, it's white, woo
It's tough for you to get by  
It's black, it's white 
It's black, it's white, woo, come on
It's tough for you to get by 
It's black, it's white , 
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by 
It's black, it's white
