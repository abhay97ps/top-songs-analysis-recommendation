She was pretty, she was smart
She was witty, yeah, she had charm
Cupid shot me, that's what got me down the aisle
But that match made in heaven went straight to hell
Split up our possessions, put the house up for sale
And I learned a lesson I won't be forgetting
The next time around
I'm gonna marry for money
I'll be so damn rich, it ain't funny
I'm gonna have me a trust fund
Yacht club, hot tub, piece of the pie
Find me a sweet sugar mama
With a whole lot of zeros and commas
Don't really care if she loves me
She can even be ugly
I'm gonna marry for money
I won't have to love her family
I won't have to like her friends
And if it works out like I planned it
I won't ever have to work again
I'm gonna marry for money
I'll be so damn rich, it ain't funny
I'm gonna have me a trust fund
Yacht club, hot tub, piece of the pie
Find me a sweet sugar mama
With a whole lot of zeros and commas
I don't care if she loves me
She can even be ugly
I'm gonna marry for money
Show me the money
Cha-ching
Y'all, I'm gonna fly to Hawaii
On a Learjet the old lady buys me
I'll call her sweetheart and honey
If she's a hundred and twenty
I'm gonna marry for money
I don't care if she loves me
She can be really ugly
I'm gonna marry for money
Oh, cha-ching
Mucho dinero
Come on over here, you good looking thing you
There's your walker in the corner
Over there, over there
