Tonight I'm gonna have myself
A real good time, I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it
Inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy
So, 
 'Cause I'm having
A good time, having a good time
I'm a shooting star leaping
Through the sky
Like a tiger defying
The laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing
By like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go
There's no stopping me
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why
They call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic
Man outta you
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call
'Cause I'm having a good time
Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah
I'm a rocket ship on my way
To Mars on a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode!
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why
They call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic
Woman of you
(Don't stop me, don't stop me
Don't stop me) Hey, hey, hey
(Don't stop me, don't stop me
Ooh, ooh, ooh) I like it
Have a good time, good time
 Woah
Let loose, honey, all right
Oh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why
They call me Mister Fahrenheit, hey
Travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic
Man outta you 
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call 
'Cause I'm having a good time 
Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all
Ah, da da da da
Da da ah ah
Ah da da, ah ah ah
Ah, da da
Ah, da da ah ah
Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
