Daddy waited up
In the kitchen by himself
I came stumbling in that night
With liquor on my breath
He said son I know u live here
But this is still my home
Its my way or the highway
So I said alright Im gone
Pre chorus:
And before i slammed that door
I said i hate u
He just shook his head
And said ok
Chorus:
But u can't stop my love for u
Itll be here thats a given
As long as i am livin on this earth
One thing is true
U can turn away, forget me
Curse my name
But love will never let u go
Son my love is unconditional
Life is like a circle
Slowly turning on itself
But girl it took losing you
To finally know how bad it felt
We stood in this bedroom
A year ago today
Hangin onto pride and anger
As we threw our love away
Pre Chorus:
And before u slammed that door
U said i hate u
But tonightif u could only hear me say
Chorus:
U can't stop my love for u
Itll be here thats a given
As long as i am livin on this earth
One thing is true
U can turn away, forget me
Curse my name but love won't let me let u go
Girl always know
My love is unconditional
Tag:
U could turn away forget me
Curse my name
But you can't even let me go
Girl but you need to know
My love, is unconditional
