Day by day
And night by night
I see you in my mind
It happens all the time
You know, my daydreams stop
But my heart beats on
I can't take it anymore
It's you I live for
Oh, baby
You — are in my system
I just want you to know that
O-oh, you're in my system
Got me burnin', burnin', baby
O-oh, you're in my system
O-oh, you're in my system
Don't you, don't you, don't you know that, baby?
I will keep on pushing, pushing
Until I get through
My main objective baby
Is to get to ya
To turn your mind around
I know will take time
But you know I can't wait, no
You're on my mind
You — are in my system
I just want you to know that
O-oh, you are in my system
Got me burnin', burnin' baby
You — are in my system
I just want you to know that
O-oh, you are, you're in my system
I'll keep on pushing, baby
You're in my soul
Love's got control
Just can't get enough
Of your loving touch
It's a romantic vision
Of me and you
Holding hands on Sunday
And Monday, too
There's no doubt in my mind
That I'll be true, baby
You know, I'll take you out
And I'll keep love new
Oh, baby
You — are in my system
I just want you to know that
O-oh, you are, you're in my system
Got me burnin', I'm on fire, baby
'Cus you're in my system
Want you to know that
O-oh, you are, you're in my system, system
Got me burnin'
O-oh, you are, you're in my system
I just want you to know that
O-oh, you are, you're in my system
Everything you need
O-oh, you're in my system
You keep my body alive, baby
O-oh, you are, you're in my system
I see you day and night, and night now
O-oh, you are, you're in my system
Everything you need
O-oh, you are, you're in my system
All I need to survive, baby
