I'm still young, wasting my youth
I'll grow up next summer
I'm back on those drugs I quit
I kept my dealer's number
I'm still young, wasting my youth
I'll grow up next summer
I'm back on that girl I quit
I should've lost her number
I'm overcompensating for heartbreak
I swallowed a pill that was in a heart shape
Her hands on my chest, feelin' my heartbeat
She spillin' her drink all on my car seat
She'll get attached and then trap me
Then I gotta act like I'm happy
She posts pics to get at me
Déjà vu, it's like last week
I'm still young, wasting my youth
I'll grow up next summer
I'm back on those drugs I quit
I kept my dealer's number
I'm still young, wasting my youth
I'll grow up next summer
I'm back on that girl I quit
I should've lost her number
Pedal to the floor, yeah, I can't brake
The floor of the hotel's my ashtray
She opened the door and walked past me
I'm a Hollywood whore, I don't ask names
Yeah, let's get high as fuck
I've tried to cover up
Eyes that have seen too much
I'd go blind for her touch
I'm still young, wasting my youth
I'll grow up next summer
I'm back on those drugs I quit
I kept my dealer's number
I'm still young, wasting my youth
I'll grow up next summer
I'm back on that girl I quit
I should've lost her number
I'm still young
I'm wasted and I'm not getting younger
I'll grow up
I promise that I'll grow up next summer
I'm still young 
I'm wasted and I'm not getting younger
I'll grow up 
I promise that I'll grow up next summer
I'm still young 
I'm wasted and I'm not getting younger
I'm still young 
I promise that I'll grow up next summer
