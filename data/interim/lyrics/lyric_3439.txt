Whose hairstyles are out of this world
Whether it's straight or bouffant or it's curled?
My baby , hey hey hey
My baby, baby, pretty baby
Hair soft like a baby lamb and I love to run my fingers through it
I hope she digs me the way I am, but if I have to change
You know I'm gonna do it for my baby
Personality contains more gold
Than any bank in this world could hold
My baby , hey hey hey
My baby, baby, pretty baby
Enough gold in her personality to set Fort Knox to shame
This golden girl belongs to me
Let nobody try to stake his claim
 She's cute as can be
 This girl's got a hold on me
 Has a kiss so sweet, it knocks me off my feet
She makes my life complete
Oh yeah, she's my baby
Oh yeah, she's my baby
And I love her so
Yeah, I love my baby so
 She's cute as can be
 The girl's got a hold on me
 Has a kiss so sweet, it knocks me off my feet
She makes my life complete
Who has my mind in a kind of a haze?
Who has me walkin' around in a daze?
My baby , hey hey hey
My baby, baby, pretty baby
She gives me a feeling I can't explain
She sets my soul on fire
But I don't feel hurt and I don't feel pain
All I feel is a strong desire for my baby
Oh yeah, my baby, got personality to satisfy me
Oh baby, that's my baby, my baby, my baby
