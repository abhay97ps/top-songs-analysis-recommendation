She was crying
And I was lonely
And a band was playing
Some old love song
Someone had hurt her
And someone had left me
And We both needed something
To hold on to
Who knows
Tomorrow it might all end
But tonight I love my friend
I love my friend
And we'll make it
Maybe
Just maybe
Even though we're going to share the night
In each other's arms
I'll treat her like a lady
And I'll call her baby
Cause I love my friend
We'll make it
Maybe
Just maybe
Tomorrow when we start another day
And we don't know the way
I'll still treat her like a lady
Still call her baby
Cause I love my friend
And we'll make it
Maybe
