Take me
Take me, girl, I'm ready
Oh please, oh please
Please don't change your mind
Take me
Take me, girl, I'm ready
Oh please, oh please
Please don't change your mind
For my wrongs, I've no excuses
I couldn't blame you if you refused me
Girl, you caught me in my childish games
But I'm a new man, girl, I've changed, oh
I'll be a yo-yo on your finger 
You can bounce me up and down honey 
I'll do anything to win you 
Ah, but don't let me hit the ground, oh, come on
Take me
Take me, girl, I'm ready 
Oh please, oh please
Please don't change your mind 
Take me
Take me, girl, I'm ready
Oh please, oh please
Please don't change your mind
Girl, I know you don't want me back
But what can we gain by that?
If your love is still the same
Don't make me wait in vain, oh
We are losing while we're waiting 
This love we know so well, honey 
So why are you hesitating? 
Why you want to put me through this hell?
Come on honey
Take me
Take me, girl, I'm ready 
Oh please, oh please
Please don't change your mind 
Take me
Take me, girl, I'm ready
Oh please, oh please
Please don't change your mind
Take me
Take me, girl, I'm ready
Oh please, oh please
Please don't change your mind
