Ahhhh!
Here we go again falling on my bed and pulling on a pillow
Well, I think you got what it takes to get me boiling like a kettle
Here everything's boiling up
I boil to the maximum, yeah
Well, I do believe, babe, you boil me bubbling
You get me in so much trouble
Oooh, and baby, someday soon
I will take you there
I promise you the moon
And then he pulled a seam and it went all the way
Oooh, yeah, such a pretty mess
He made such a pretty mess on my dress
Oooh, yeah, such a pretty mess
Oh, such a pretty
Here we go again pulling on my hair
I'm dripping like a hot tea
I'm aware if you drip it too hot
It just might spill all over this lovely
Here everything's boiling up
I boil to the maximum, yeah
Well, I do believe, babe, you boil me bubbling
You get me in double trouble
Oooh, and baby, someday soon
I will take you there
I promise you the moon
And then I took a drink and it went all the way
Oooh, yeah, such a pretty mess
He made such a pretty mess on my dress
Oooh, yeah, such a pretty mess
Oh, such a pretty.  Oooh!
Here we go again crawling through the kitchen
Oh, ho, ho, hum
Well, I think you got what it takes to get me into a living room position
Oooh, and baby, someday soon
I will take you there
Oooh, promise you the moon
And then he found a hallway that went all the way
Oooh, yeah, such a pretty mess
He made such a pretty mess on my dress
Oooh, yeah, such a pretty mess
Oh, such a pretty.  Oooh!
