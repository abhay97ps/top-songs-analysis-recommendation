'Cause you're sweet
Sak pasé? 
Wah yah seh? 
Run it up , all this cake 
Bag it up , den come right away 
'Cause you're sweet 
What's your status? 
Yah, might hit your address, if I'm on them Addys 
Jet right to you, I can't do no traffic 
I can't do no lacking 
'Cause you're sweet—sweet—like cocoa
But all you wanna do is the coco 
Hangin' out with you is a no go 
'Cause you're sweet , like cocoa
But all you wanna do is the coco 
Hangin' out with you is a no go 
'Cause you're sweet 
Like my time, like my juice 
We been downstairs in the basement with the moves 
Shout my town, shout my troops 
Shout my jeweler, made my chain look like Froot Loops, yuh 
Come get a taste, come get a scoop 
I done made it out the hood through all the hoops 
I done finally found a way to make the loot 
Link up all my niggas and my Jewels, yuh 
Link up, link up, yuh, link up, pour my syrup 
Diamonds, yeah, they link up, link up
Go berserk, do some shit you think of 
Lean, lean, lean, all this lean, lean, lean
We might lean, lean, lean 
Smoke all my shit 
Stop it, start again 
'Cause you're sweet , like cocoa
But all you wanna do is the coco
Hangin' out with you is a no go
'Cau-, 'cause sweet, yuh
Sak pasé? 
Wah yah seh? 
Runnin' up , all this cake 
Bag it up , den come right away
When I ask who bigger 
Ain't tryna argue with ya, I'm tryna figure 
Who you with, who your team, what your side? 
How you, how you, how you ride? 
How you use me to survive? 
Yuh, 'cause we up, lit at five 
At the crib goin' live, oh, so live 
Eric hit the strippers, yuh, order V Live 
Order wings, told em' hold it 
'Cause you're sweet , like cocoa 
But all you wanna do is the coco 
Hangin' out with you is a no go 
'Cause you're sweet like cocoa
But all you wanna do is the coco
Hangin' out with you is a no go
'Cause you're sweet
