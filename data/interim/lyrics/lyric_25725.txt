I got room in my fumes 
She fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room 
Hope I make it outta here 
She saw my eyes, she know I'm gone 
I see some things that you might fear
I’m doin' a show, I'll be back soon 
That ain't what she wanna hear 
Now I got her in my room 
Legs wrapped around my beard
Got the fastest car, it zoom 
Hope we make it outta here 
When I'm with you, I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie 
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side 
Case it’s fumes 
She fill my mind up with ideas 
I’m the highest in the room 
Hope I make it outta here 
We ain't stressin' 'bout the loot 
My block made of quesería
This not the molly, this the boot
Ain’t no comin' back from here
Live the life of La Familia
It's so much gang that I can't see ya 
Turn it up 'til they can't hear 
Runnin', runnin' 'round for the thrill
Yeah, dawg, dawg, 'round my real 
Raw, raw, I been pourin' to the real 
Nah, nah, nah, they not back of the VIP 
Gorgeous, baby, keep me hard as steel
Ah, this my life, I did not choose
Uh, been on this since we was kids
We gon' stay on top and break the rules
Uh, I fill my mind up with ideas
Case it's fumes
She fill my mind up with ideas 
I'm the highest in the room 
Hope I make it outta here
