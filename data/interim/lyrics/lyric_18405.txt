Maybe I could be the one they adore
That could be my reputation
It's where I'm from that lets them think I'm a whore
I'm an educated virgin
Now sleepwalker don't be shy
Now don't open your eyes tonight
You'll be the one that defends my life
While I'm dead asleep dreaming
Cupid don't draw back your bow
Sam Cooke didn't know what I know
I'll never be your valentine
The sleepwalker in me
And God only know that I tried
Now Let me in, Let me drown or learn how to swim
Just don't leave me at the window
I could be the one to be your next best friend
You may need someone to hold you
Sleepwalker take this knife
You may see someone tonight
You'd be the one who saves my life
When I'm dead asleep dreaming
Cupid don't draw back your bow
Sam Cooke didn't know what I know
Never be your valentine
The sleepwalker in me
God only know that I tried
I'm in your movie and everyone looks sad
But I can hear your voice in the laughtrack
But you never saw my best scene
The one where I sleep
I sleepwalk into your dreams
Now sleepwalker what's my line?
Now it's only a matter of time
Until I learn to open up my eyes
When I'm dead asleep dreaming
Now Cupid don't draw back your bow
Sam Cooke didn't know what I know
Never be your valentine
The sleepwalker in me
Now the sleepwalker in me
Now the sleepwalker in me
And God only knows that I've tried
