Darlin', don't stay too long
Pretty baby
I know you're working hard for me
Darlin', don't stay away too long
Pretty baby
Save the overtime for me
I walk around
Tryin' to find something to do
Baby, until your return
Turn on TV
Or play some solitaire
It does the job for a while
But nothing takes the place of you
No, just ain't no substitute
'Cause you're all that I want and need
Only you can set me free
Darlin', don't stay too long
Pretty baby
I know you're working hard for me
Darlin', don't stay away too long
Pretty baby
Save the overtime for me
My love starts to come down hard on me
And I just can't find no relief, no
Only until I see your face again
I'm gonna be in such misery
Runnin' to the door
Peepin' out the window
Hopin' to see only you
Listen for the phone
Checkin' out the clock
Countin' every second down, hear me now
Five, four, three, two, one
Darlin'
Don't stay too long
Pretty baby
I know you're working hard for me
Darlin'
Baby, don't stay away too long
Pretty baby
Save the overtime for me
For me
Ooh, baby, baby
Save the overtime, save the overtime
Save the overtime, save the overtime
Oh, I know that you got your eight hours to do
But I just don't feel good here without ya
Oh, how I'm missin' you
Oh, feelin' blue
I know it's crazy
But I, I walk around
Tryin' to find something else to do
Pretty baby, until your return
Turn on the TV
Or play some solitaire
Does the job for a while
Find myself runnin' to the door
Peepin' out the window
Hopin' to see only you
I'm listenin' for the phone
Checkin' out the clock
Countin' every second down, hear me now
Five, four, three, two, one
Darlin'
Don't stay too long
Pretty baby
I know you're working hard for me
Darlin'
Baby, don't stay away too long
Pretty baby
Save the overtime for me
Darlin', don't stay too long
Pretty baby
I know you're working hard for me
Darlin', don't stay away too long
Pretty baby
Save the overtime for me
