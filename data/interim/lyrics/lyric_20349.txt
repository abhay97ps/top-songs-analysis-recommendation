You are fine, you are sweet
But I'm still a bit naive with my heart
When you're close, I don't breathe
I can't find the words to speak
And I feel sparks
But I don't wanna be into you if you're not looking for true love
Oh, whoa
No, I don't wanna start seeing you if I can't be your only one
So, tell me...
When it's not alright
When it's not okay
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? 
Will you say OK? 
Will you stick with me through whatever, or run away?
Say that it's gonna be alright
That it's gonna be okay 
When you call, I don't know if I should pick up the phone every time 
I'm not like all my friends, who keep calling up the boys
And so shy
But I don't wanna be into you if you don't treat me the right way
See, I can only start seeing you if you can make my heart feel safe
Feel safe
When it's not alright 
When it's not okay 
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? 
Will you say OK? 
Will you stick with me through whatever, or run away?
Say that it's gonna be alright
That it's gonna be okay
Don't run away
Don't run away
Let me know if it's gonna be you
Boy, you've got some things to prove
Let me know that you'll keep me safe
I don't want you to run away, so
Let me know that you'll call on time
Let me know that you'll help me shine
Will you wipe my tears away?
Will you hold me close and say?
When it's not alright 
When it's not okay 
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? 
Will you say OK? 
Will you stick with me through whatever, or run away?
Say that it's gonna be alright, that it's gonna be okay 
Don't run away  
Say that it's gonna be alright, that it's gonna be okay
Don't run away
Will you say OK?
Say that it's gonna be alright, that it's gonna be okay
Don't run away
Will you say OK?
