Loneliness is a cloak you wear
A deep shade of blue
Is always there
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always cloudin' your eyes
When you're without love
Baby
Emptiness is a place you're in
With nothin' to lose
But no more to win
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always cloudin' your eyes
When you're without love
Lonely without you, baby
Girl, I need you
I can't go on
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always cloudin' your eyes
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
When you're without love
Baby
 Not anymore
 Baby
 Baby
 Woo, ooh, ooh, ooh
 No, no, baby
 Baby
