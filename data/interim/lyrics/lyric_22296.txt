See the people walkin' down the street
Fall in line just watchin' all their feet
They don't know where they wanna go
They're walkin' in time
Rachel & New Directions!

All the kids just gettin' out of school
They can't wait to hang out and be cool
Hang around 'til quarter after twelve
That's when they fall in line

Go-go music really makes us dance
Do the pony, puts us in a trance
