Days go by time moves on
Hearts can beat to a different drum they say
You might think we're the perfect one
The best laid plans come undone someday
You've got to believe in love
Don't look back, you can never look back
Keep on moving, face the facts
No more the innocent child
No more lonely heart
No more those innocent days
I'm changing, I'm changing
No more the innocent child
I'm strong when we're apart
Time won't wait, you can't change fate
Time won't wait
The world keeps turning round and round
Love can't breath tied and bound no way
We can take this time tonight
Tomorrow see it in a different light of day
You've got to have faith in love 
Don't look back, you can never look back
Keep on moving, face the facts
Time won't wait, we can't stand still
We must go on and on and on and on and on and on
No more the innocent child
No more lonely heart
No more those innocent days
I'm changing, I'm changing
No more the innocent child
I'm strong when we're apart
Time won't wait, you can't change fate
Time won't wait
