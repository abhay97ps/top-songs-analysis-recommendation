Absurd Dreamer
Flowers
Deadly Tina
Woke up from the dreams
Now no shit I'm on a jeans
Running wild and running free
Between bushes and by trees
Capriccio Violin
Am I scary
In my dream?
What the hell
I'm turning mean
Shit I'm blue just like my jeans
Going further in the scene
What the hell is going here?
I think now I can see
Little girl she's in my dream
Zooming zooming in
I don't like what I see
Come closer and you'll see
The damned, it is right in front of me

Exterior - Green Fields 
The man reached the girl
He opens his thing
Puts his hand in
One flower, two flowers
Three flowers, many flowers
Oh shit
He dies
