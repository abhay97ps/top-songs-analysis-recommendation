Keep it real, this how I'm comin' in it from the jump
You're so beautiful, I kiss and hit it from the front
Take you everywhere with me 'cause I love to stunt
Money everywhere, baby, 'cause you love to stunt
Hit the strip club with me, make ten G's
We'll be runnin' up the bag 'til it empties
Got a temper 'cause she bad, don't tempt me
Shawty, I'm a different man off the Hennessy
Tryna hit it so good you remember me
Pussy good like
Fuckin' your body, I let it go down
I make it ring like the Neptunes song
You hold it down like a stunner, you done cleaned that
You hold it down every summer in Celine bag
Oh, when you're givin' me love, you never keep that
You never give me enough, knowin' I need that
We gon' fuck up the sheets, send 'em to the cleaners
We might smoke weed on the way and catch a misdemeanor
I'm a young nigga that wanna get with you and beat it
My ex hate when I'm with you, it's gettin' her heated
'Cause you're so beautiful
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
What can I say to you that you ain't never heard?
I'm breakin' it down, shawty, I'm talkin' 'bout every word
Observe how I splizz-erve, slick like a iceberg 
Cold with the wizz-ords and lit like my izz-erd 
Of course it all matters if you with it or not
'Cause if you don't, you won't, but if you get it, you got
Ain't nothin' wrong with this, now peep it out
And if it's too hard, then go ahead and bleep it out
See, I'ma tell you what I see 'cause what I see is all I know
I'll wrap you up with a bow, lay you out on the floor
And let Tory tell the story 'cause you know how it go
Then hit the switch in my blue '64, mmh-mmh
Beautiful
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Said you're beautiful
Oh, oh
You know how to let me know if I done enough
Touch down in it, put them numbers up
You wanna leave 'cause he don't make you cum enough
Well, guess what? I'm the next runner-up
Big bank, baby, and I spend it all on you
Fuck it up in here, that's what we ought to do
A lot of options, I could call 'em through
I switch her option like an audible
Bentley Bentayga, girl, you gets paper
They be pocket watchin' the money you get paid
I wanna fly you to the sand in Jamaica
You damaged your makeup, still managed to make it, yeah
Humble as ever, but stunt with the cheddar, yeah
You grind with me, we gon' come up together, yeah
Pretty days, we gon' stunt it together
'Cause the Rolls Royce I drive, it come with umbrellas
I don't talk no shit 'cause I just back that shit up

I'ma sink my teeth in it deep, Dracula
Pretty Rick when I hit it, have you spectacular, uh
