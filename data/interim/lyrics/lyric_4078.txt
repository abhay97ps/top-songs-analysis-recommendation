Dommage, Dommage
Our love was once exciting
Now it's just a game we play
Too bad, too bad
But nothing lasts forever
All at once we lost our way
Hello, goodbye
And suddenly it's over
And there's nothing we can do
Dommage, Dommage
Too bad we couldn't make our dreams come true
Hello, goodbye
And suddenly it's over
And there's nothing we can do
Dommage, Dommage
Too bad we couldn't make our dreams come true
