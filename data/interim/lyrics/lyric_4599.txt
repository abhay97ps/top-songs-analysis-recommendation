I hear you're telling everybody
That you're glad I'm gone
Do you tell them how you cried
Whenever you were all alone?
We both know for us
There'll never, never be another
So forget about your foolish pride
And let's get back together
Listen
Who cares who was right or wrong? 
I just know I need you
And by your side is where I belong
Don't you miss me a little bit, baby?
'Cause I'm missing you
Say you miss me a little bit, baby
You think if you take me back
People will call you a fool
Deep down inside you know you need me
As much as I need you
Because of your pride
You're letting two hearts suffer
Baby, can't you see
You're only making things tougher?
Who cares who was right or wrong? 
Please take me back, baby
'Cause by your side is where I belong
Don't you miss me a little bit, baby?
Please tell me that you do
Say you miss me a little bit, baby
Girl, I walk these streets day and night
Alone and downhearted
Every doggone day baby
Since we've been parted
Aimlessly with no sense of direction
Baby I'm trying to tell you
I need your sweet love and affection
Yes, I do 
Can't make it without you 
Oh, yeah 
Uh, this loneliness and separation
Makes too high a price to pay
When two people love each other the way we do
Should nothing stand in their way
You're making a mountain out of a molehill
Because of your pride
You're letting a little misunderstanding
Push true love aside
Who cares who was right or wrong? 
Just say you want me back, baby
And I'll come running, running back home
Don't you miss me a little bit, baby?
Please tell me that you do
Life ain't worth living without you, baby
Girl, just take me back, forget your pride
I need you, baby, by my side
Can't stand this being away from you
Can't you see what I'm going through?
Please say you miss me, baby
Say you miss me, baby
