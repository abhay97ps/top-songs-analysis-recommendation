Why am I in such a hurry?
Always getting up too early
So fast everything is blurry, oh-oh
It's like the clock is always racing
But my time is not for wasting
Someone else can do the chasing
'Cause I'm chasing the sun
I'm chasing the sun
I'm chasing the sun
Won't miss out on the fun
Gotta get it while our hearts are young
I'm chasing the sun
On my pursuit of happiness
I realize that more means less
If I got love, then I am blessed, oh, I know
So I'll start living while I can
And hold the moment in my hands
I'll fly until I learn to land in my home
'Cause I'm chasing the sun
I'm chasing the sun
I'm chasing the sun
Won't miss out on the fun
Gotta get it while our hearts are young
I'm chasing the sun
Love the life I live and I will live the life I love
Open up my eyes and I will take whatever comes
I'm chasing the sun
I'm chasing the sun
I'm chasing the sun
Won't miss out on the fun
Gotta get it while our hearts are young
I'm chasing the sun
'Cause I'm chasing the sun
I'm chasing the sun
I'm chasing the sun
Won't miss out on the fun
Gotta get it while our hearts are young
I'm chasing the sun
