I can tell by the look in your eyes
You've been hurting
You know I'll never let you down
Oh, no
And I'll try anything
To keep it working
You gave me time to find out
What my heart was looking for
And what I'm feeling inside
In your eyes
I want to see your love again
In your eyes
I never want this feeling to end
It took some time to find the light
But now I realize
I can see the heaven in your eyes
Can't you see
I'm finding it hard to let go?
All the heartaches we've been through
I never really thought
I'd see this love grow
But you helped me see
Now I know
What my heart's been looking for
And what I'm feeling inside
In your eyes
I want to see your love again
In your eyes
I never want this feeling to end
It took some time to find the light
But now I realize
I can see the heaven in your eyes
We've been living on the edge
Where only the strong survive
We've been living on the edge
And it's something
That we just can't hide
Oh, this feeling inside
In your eyes
I want to see your love again
In your eyes
I never want this feeling to end
It took some time to find the light
But now I realize
I can see the heaven in your eyes
Oh, yeah
I can see the heaven in your eyes
Oh, yeah
I can see the heaven in your eyes
I can see the heaven in your eyes
Heaven in your eyes, oh
Heaven in your eyes
I can see the heaven
Heaven in your eyes
Heaven in your eyes
