I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You think you know the smile on her lips the thrill at the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss in each caress each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You stole her love from me one day you didn't care how you hurt me
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be
You think she's yours to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold
That I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
