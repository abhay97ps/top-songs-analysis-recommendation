Back it up, drop it down 
Get low and scrub the ground 
Push it up, push it up

Hey big girl! Make 'em back it up  make 'em back it up
Hey big girl! Make 'em back it up  make 'em back it up
Hey big girl! Make 'em back it up  make 'em back it up, back it up, back it up
I got 'em shakin they boobies like congos
Man I'm shakin the city like quakes 
The haters blue in the face, like Gonzo
Cause I'm baking a cake so let's bake 
I'm taking the game, the game's mine 
Y'all witness the change, it's my time 
Y'all new to the game but y'all might wanna
Save ya whack raps, daylight saving time 
I can dance homey, I don't two-step
Y'all lookin at somethin like a true player
A girl told me that a man that could dance
Might could possibly get down with the tool in his pants
Now all my ladies let me see you vibrate
And when it's over you ain't gon' need ya vibrator 
Cause I'm a pro, make you bend your back low
Then I pound it real fast just like the perculator
Wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble 
Wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble 
Wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble 
Wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble 
Get in there!

Hey big girl! Make 'em back it up  make 'em back it up, back it up, back it up
Girl wobble it  and I'mma gobble it
I seen you moving your head, your head bobbling 
We can cradle the bed, I'm straight racking it
The girls say my head like the head of a rocket ship 
God damn I'm so explicit
But I can't help it my flow ridiculous
Boy got a gift like it gotta be Christmas
Swag don't miss like he gotta be gifted
The girls brought cameras and they want pictures
And they gon' frame 'em, to see that nigga
Led 'em to the bed while I'm sayin my scriptures
Cause I leave ya holy like you pray in the temple
Want beef? I move with the led of a pencil
And mine won't miss you, goodnight kiss you
Take it there and back, cause you got pistols
And I don't think Donnie Vick can run these issues
