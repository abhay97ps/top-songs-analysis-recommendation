Hit 'em
Verse 1
A.jay
A. jay, El Kamo, Lets Go
Some shit blowing up my mind mayne Im a pro
I'm sick standing on my grind, i lit the dro
I'm home livin in my zone, i need to bone or bang bleeding chicks and hoes up in my zone
Coughing up da money like i'm rolling with a genie
I'm rolling up a spliff and thinking how to get the lucci
They talking bout skrilla, well i'm talking bout broccolli
And rap is gettin dark, man its time to make it sunny
I got this game tight, sweeter than red lips
The name A. Jay, the mac u ain't messing with
I got the bad bitch blushing well im fly in that outfit
Blessed the mike with holy water acting like John the Baptist
My name up on the list, we gotta lay the facts straight
Stepped my foot in this game, and competition got erased
Dem boys talking crap, cruising with all those lames
But i'm finkin real big, doin like Alkazane
Big dummy ass, crack fool you
Whooping ya bloody ass, lyk rap kung fu
Slitting ya bleeding wrists lyk sucide dudes
Now i feel lyk i'm king jay spitin of the hook
Still cooking up the rhymes in the rap kitchen
You said u real, but i still believe u all fiction
When it comes to this game, im a lyrical thug
So rap sick u can't heal me with a miracle drug
The haters all in hell lyk i burnt dem all
My name going further, i just fank u lord
Got the game so bad that i took the spot
Im so high, i dont know what label i'm on
I got the game so bad that i took the spot
Im so high, i dont know what label i'm on
Chorus
A.jay
Lyk i hit em with the mike, hit em with the bike
El Kamo
Real pissed lyk i pushed them to the side
Cos i punch real bad lyk i hit em with the mike
Go slooooooow, when u hit em with the mike 2x
Cos a punch real hard might take away his life
Verse 2
El Kamo
El Kamo, rise to the ranks
Got a lot of shine, lyk i'm movin thru the mines
Killin from the start, mayne i'm blowing up their minds
With the A. Kay, tell a hater, this is no child play
Killin competition, with my vision on the D-day
MURDER, I could be doing this lyk all day
Put me behind bars, i do it again lyk its a replay
Burning stages, its the Kamoflage with A. Jay
Stop trippin, message to those who wanna be me
Recognize fact i'm the dope, whose gotta king me
Haters strugglin, tryna make it on my team B
And my flo, still given spin to CDs
I got the game on another level, on trees, High
The position that was unlikely, but i'm still placin fings right like i'm Henry
Yeah, im on dough like a baker, i mean, i'm on stacks like a banker
The topic for discussion lyk an issue for debators
Still no competition lyk a camel in the deserts
Still kill the streets with class, didn't say it, ask mercedes
Murder everybody, that be braggin with the cities
Takin u bak to the days like old skul
You gonna need me real bad lyk O2
Putting haters aways just like old tools
When i walk out the door, u ain't got no clue
Chorus
A.jay
Lyk i hit em with the mike, hit em with the bike
El Kamo
Real pissed lyk i pushed them to the side
Cos i punch real bad lyk i hit em with the mike
Go slooooooow, when u hit em with the mike 2x
Cos a punch real hard might take away his life
Verse 3
A. Jay
Still on my grind, I got mouthpiece and the skrilla
Still the bollaholic, bukin wild on the rilla
Gettin ma groove on, grindin rilla and throwing chedda
Thats why they can't chill, they all up on my bumpa
Man, im crusing with my click, checking wats burbalatin
I keep blowin up the chronic, getting high levitating
And i'm messin up the game, haters jux keep on falling like humpty dumpty and rain, ya pain keeps escalatin
Be my ICE cream man and pass the brocolli
On ya lips is a spliff, i hold it happily
And now my crew goes wild, cos its lyk i'm getting bad, so i light another dro lets go like OD
You need to say a long prayer, confessin all ya sins
Cos you bang ripnuts and keep donating benjamins
She's the next sexy fin i saw, she lyk blings
Not u sweety, step aside, i luv this cars rims
El kamo

I see other rappers all murmuring, all over
Cos they see whats comin, Kamo take Over
If you have a dream, DAMN it, it Over
Im the undertaker, ima ima record breaker

And i get u hot like i was your baker

U see, u gotta spit and first next, comes the paper
See me in my crib, next its bigger

We ain't playing, we praying for that castle dream wish

Punchin your heart, is my words in ya face
