I didn't wanna say 'I'm sorry' for breaking us apart
I didn't wanna say 'It was my fault'
Even though I knew it was
I didn't wanna call you back
'Cause I knew that I was wrong
Yeah, I knew I was wrong
One in the same, never to change
Our love was beautiful
We had it all, destined to fall
Our love was tragical
Wanted to call, no need to fight
You know I wouldn't lie
But tonight, we'll leave it on the line
Listen, baby
Never would've said 'forever' if I knew we'd end so fast
Why did you say 'I love you' if you knew that it wouldn't last?
Baby, I just can't hear what you're saying
The line is breaking up
Or is that just us?
Or is that just us?
One in the same, never to change
Our love was beautiful
We had it all, destined to fall
Our love was tragical
Wanted to call, no need to fight
You know I wouldn't lie
But tonight, we'll leave it on the line
I try to call again, I get your mailbox
Like a letter left unread
Apologies are often open ended
But this one's better left unsaid
One in the same, never to change
Our love was beautiful
We had it all, destined to fall
Our love was tragical
Wanted to call, no need to fight
You know I wouldn't lie
But tonight, we'll leave it on the line
We'll leave it on the line
Yeah, oh yeah
We'll leave it on the line tonight
