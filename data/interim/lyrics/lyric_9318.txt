Don't go to bed with no price on your head
Don't do it
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
Keep your eye on the sparrow
When the going gets narrow
Don't roll the dice if you can't pay the price
Don't do it
Don't run your feet down a dead-end street
Don't do me dirt or you're gonna get hurt
Don't do it
Don't run away till you hear what I say
Ain't gonna fight with no thief in the night
Won't do it
I'm gonna go where the cold wind don't blow
