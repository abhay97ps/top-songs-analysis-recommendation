Man, this shit's unflatterin', all up in my head again
I don't feel myself right now, maybe I should just lay down
If vanity's my vitamin, well, I don't feel the difference
I don't like myself right now, gotta find a way out
What you feel is natural
But I don't wanna feel this anymore
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor
What you waitin' for?
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl
Draw your comparisons, tryin' to find who's lesser than
I don't wanna wear your crown, there's enough to go around
What you feel is natural 
You don't gotta put up with this anymore 
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor 
Tell me what you waitin' for?
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl
Girl, don't hang your head low
Don't lose your halo, don't lose your halo
Girl, don't hang your head low
Don't lose your halo, oh
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl, won't you stop your cryin'? 
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay 
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay 
Baby girl
Everyone's gonna be okay, baby
Mm mm mm, mm mm mm
Hoo hoo hoo, hoo
