Let's get together, yay-yay-yay
Why don't you and I combi-ine
Let's get together, what do you say
We can have a swingin' ti-ime
We'd be a cra-a-azy team
Why don't we ma-a-ake a scene
Together, oh oh oh oh
Lets get together, yay-yay-yay
Think of all that we could sha-are
Lets get together everyday
Every way and everywhe-ere
And though we haven't got a lot
We could be sharin' all we've got
Together
Oh, I really think you're swell
Uh-huh, we really ring the bell
Oo-wee, and if you stick with me
Nothin' could be greater, say "hey alligator"!
Let's get together, yay-yay-yay
Two is twice as nice as o-one
Let's get together, right away
We'll be havin' twice the fu-un
And you can always count on me
A gruesome twosome we will be
Let's get together, yay-yay-yay!
