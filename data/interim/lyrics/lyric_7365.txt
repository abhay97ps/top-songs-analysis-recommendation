Great jubilation with some
Celebration beginning
Total rejection to lies
And deception and sinning
Sinners, take heed
For the life that you
Lead is deceiving, yeah
Nothing replaces a man
That embraces believing, no
People take heart
It's the time to be smart
To be honest
Show the reunion there's
One mass communion upon us
Sinners, take heed
For the life that you
Lead is deceiving, yeah
Nothing replaces a man
That embraces believing, no
I'm betting
Betting on Jesus
I'm hoping
Hoping hell freezes
I'm hoping
Hoping it displeases
The devil, the devil
As for the children
God bless and God will
They'll know sorrow
Spare the confusion
And life's disillusion tomorrow
Sinners, take heed
For the life that you
Lead is deceiving, yeah
Nothing replaces a man
That embraces believing, no
I'm betting
I'm betting on Jesus
I'm hoping
Hoping hell freezes
I'm hoping
Hoping it displeases
The devil, the devil
Great jubilation with some
Celebration beginning
Total rejection to lies
And deception and sinning
Sinners, take heed
For the life that you
Lead is deceiving
Nothing replaces a man
That embraces believing
Great jubilation
Instead of some celebration
Total rejection
Whoa, the lies and deception
