You ain't never been loved
Like I'm going to love you
You ain't never had done
What I'm going to do
I'm going take love, sweet love
And wrap it around you
You'll know you've been loved
Before I get through
Funny how I answer
Every time you call
Funny how no one else
Matters at all
Funny to see me to do
Things I never would
Funny to have a feeling
So natural, so good
