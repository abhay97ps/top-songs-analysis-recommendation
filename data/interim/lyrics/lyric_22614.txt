Well, I smoke and I fish
But not near enough to satisfy an itch
Of a girl, understand
I need something to do with my hands
I don't work, on a car
And I'm as bad at pool as I am at throwin' darts
And golf, not a fan
But I need something to do with my hands
So maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair and we can get to rockin'
There you are, and baby, here I am
And I need something to do with my hands
I can play you a song
On this old guitar, if it turns you on
If you want, we could dance
But I need something to do with my hands
So maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair and we can get to rockin'
There you are, and baby, here I am
And I need something to do with my hands
Go!
Top off, in my jeep
And we can go for a ride and I could drive with my knees
I'll behave, best I can
But I need something to do with my hands
So maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair and we can get to rockin'
There you are, and baby, here I am
Yeah, maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair and we can get to rockin'
There you are, and baby, here I am
And I need something to do with my hands
I need something to do with my hands
With my hands
Something to do with my hands
