Oh, make me over
I'm all I wanna be
A walking study
In demonology
Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you've really made it
Hey, so glad you could make it now
Oh, look at my face
My name is Might-Have-Been
My name is Never Was
My name's forgotten
Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you've really made it
Hey, there's only us left now
When I wake up
In my makeup
It's too early for that dress
Wilted and faded
Somewhere in Hollywood
I'm glad I came here
With your pound of flesh
No second billing
'Cause you're a star now
Oh, Cinderella, they aren't sluts like you
Beautiful garbage
Beautiful dresses
Can you stand up or will you just fall down?
You better watch out
Oh, what you wish for
It better be worth it
So much to die for
Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you've really made it
Hey, there's only us left now
When I wake up
In my makeup
Have you ever felt so used up as this?
It's all so sugarless
Hooker, waitress
Model, actress
Oh, just go nameless
Honeysuckle, she's full of poison
She obliterated everything she kissed
Now she's fading
Somewhere in Hollywood
I'm glad I came here with your pound of flesh
You want a part of me?
Well, I'm not selling cheap
No, I'm not selling cheap
