(Little beach girl, little beach girl
Little beach girl, little beach girl)
Little girl, he's hurt you before
But now he says you won't cry anymore
 take him back
He'll kiss your tears away
 little girl
He's coming home to stay
 and when you're scared now
 he'll be right there now
He'll make you smile when
You feel like crying
 and when you're scared now
 he'll be right there now
He'll make you smile when
You feel like crying
 run to him
It's the only thing to do
 don't break his heart
He's so in love with you
