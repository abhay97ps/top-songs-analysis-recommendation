I never lived my days
Like this
I wake up in the morning
She greets me with a kiss
The lord has gifted me with such happiness
Said it feels like heaven
Woooow
Heaven
Well
Heaven
I've got heaven right here on earth
I've got heaven right here on earth
I've got heaven right here on earth
Feels like heaven right here on earth
I walk around with a smile on my face
You have made my world a better place
This must be heaven
You here with me
Heaven, heaven
I've got heaven right here on earth
I've got heaven right here on earth
I've got heaven right here on earth
Feels like heaven right here on earth
Now that I've finally got your love here with me
I must say that I, have never felt this way
I thank the lord for bringing your love to me
Your love just lifts me up
And it takes me away
Hello baby
I hope you're doing just fine
You know last night before I went to bed
I fell to my knees
And I prayed for a long lasting relationship
So that you and I will always be together
Heaven
Heaven
I've got heaven right here on earth
I've got heaven right here on earth
I've got heaven right here on earth
Heaven right here on earth
