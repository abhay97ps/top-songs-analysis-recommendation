Something happen in here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware
It's time to stop, children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind
It's time to stop, children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
What a field day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say, hooray, for our side
It's time to stop, children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It hurts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the man comes and takes you away
It's time to stop, children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
