You don't know
How I feel
You never know
How I feel
When I needed you
To come around
You always try
To put me down
Well I know girl
Believe me when I say
That you
Are someday gonna pay
Girl but it's alright
Alright girl
You hurt me
But it's alright
Hey now one day
You'll see
You'll never find
A guy like me
Who'll love you right
Both day and night
You never have to worry
'Cause it's alright
Oh what I'm tellin you girl
And we both know it's true
I am so mixed up over you
Girl but it's alright
All right girl
You hurt me
But it's alright
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
My my my baby
I said it's alright
Alright girl
Hey now it's alright
Alright girl
Now everything
I wanna say
You'll meet a guy
That'l make you pay
He'll treat you bad
And make you sad
And you will ruin
The love you had
Oh but I'd hate
To say I told you so
Baby
You got to got to reap what you sow
Yeah but it's alright
Alright girl
You are payin' now
But it's alright
Goodbye love
Goodbye girl
You're payin' now
But it's alright
You hurt me once
You hurt me twice
Oh baby
