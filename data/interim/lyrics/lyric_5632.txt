I love you mercy, mercy
Oh, you know, you're such a beautiful thing
You're laying kisses on me girl
All you know all the pleasure it brings
Ah, ah, ah, ah
You're spending all my money
And you're making me crawl up the wall
Mercy, mercy
You're doing me without any mercy at all
And I'm calling you:
Have mercy, mercy have mercy on me
Have mercy, mercy, mercy on me
A man's supposed to be stronger
And is used to getting his way, ah
But mercy girl you got my number
And I'll do any thing that you say
But stop playing with me
Have mercy, mercy have mercy on me
Have mercy, mercy, mercy on me
