We can do an album
Or we can do it viral
Spread it like an S.T.D
You got back in high school
I could run for president
Or just run the block
I could be a stoner or â€” shit I forgot
I could be an athlete
I could be a New York cabby
I could be your boyfriend
In the backseat
Pass me a beer
Or a bottle of gin
And shit, I could be your best friend
I ain't gonna take no shit from no one
I ain't gonna take no lip from no one
You ain't gonna try to get me to hold on
It's golden now
Why would I slow down?
I can do anything, anything, anything I want
Anything, anything, anything I want
Anything, anything, anything I want
It's golden now
Why would I slow down?
I could be your dad
Actually, I probably am
I could drive a Ferrari
Or be fixing a Trans-Am
I could write bad checks
I could smoke cigarettes
I could be valedictorian
Havin' no sex
I could smell the roses
Or watch as it decomposes
I could be one of those models shovin' coke up their noses
I could live in the streets
Or I can rot in a mansion
I could live off the beach
So I could die from the dancing
I ain't gonna take no shit from no one
I ain't gonna take no lip from no one
You ain't gonna try to get me to hold on
It's golden now
Why would I slow down?
I can do anything, anything, anything I want
Anything, anything, anything I want
Anything, anything, anything I want
It's golden now
Why would I slow down?
'Cause I can do anything, anything, anything I want
Anything, anything, anything I want
We won't ever stop
We won't ever stop
'Cause I can do anything, anything I want
I ain't gonna take no shit from no one
I ain't gonna take no lip from no one
You ain't gonna try to get me to hold on
It's golden now
Why would I slow down?
I can do anything, anything, anything I want
Anything, anything, anything I want
Anything, anything, anything I want
It's golden now
Why would I slow down?
I ain't gonna take no shit from no one
I ain't gonna take no lip from no one
You ain't gonna try to get me to hold on
It's golden now
Why would I slow down?
I can do anything, anything, anything I want
Anything, anything, anything I want
Anything, anything, anything I want
It's golden now
Why would I slow down?
I ain't gonna take no shit from no one
I ain't gonna take no lip from no one
You ain't gonna try to get me to hold on
It's golden now
Why would I slow down?
I can do anything, anything, anything I want
Anything, anything, anything I want
Anything, anything, anything I want
It's golden now
Why would I slow down?
