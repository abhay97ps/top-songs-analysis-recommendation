My nigga Nice hit my jack like, "Red, John John really believe he the GOAT of the PG's. That nigga gotta be playin’ wit' us
He called hisself Ervin Johnson. Is he fakin' or what?"
I said, "Nah that’s real shit. He ain't makin' it up
He definitely Ervin Johnson...the one that played for the Bucks."
You ass Johnny, it's nothin' you can do wit' this, I'm the ruler bitch, it's too legit
If four eyes  goin’ off it’s a Luda' skit
Ruger grip, feelin’ like Smack White when I seen him last
Know why? Cause right after I give him a Hollow, what he gon' be seein'?
RED!
Worried nigga, rose gold 30, do you dirty nigga
Tay Tay swag, it's some  shit on the Jersey nigga
Rockin’ you, tool poppin' you, a few droppin' you
Clip a bomb then split a John like two prostitutes
You hoe ass nigga, you ain't poppin' the fifth
Black Ink Crew, we all know Da Don is a bitch
Call the grip "Vagina Slayer" I'll Alex ya shit
I'll roll up in your restroom and then Da Don'll get hit
Soon as I aim the toast, shot in the bathroom
That lame approach, don't ask why I did him like that, I made him famous Los'
Just for actin' mighty, smack ya wifey, ain't rappin' like me
Llama buck 'til the Da Don is  fucked, the goddess Aphrodite
How I feel? Beyonce
Fuck J , you ain't tough J
Word to Chicago I Bump J
Son gay
Me? I'm Paul George with the gun play
For a PG I switch two .4's  to one tre 
I slide up-
I said yo, the nigga with the baldy and the robe, right?
I said you lucky you ain't got ya glasses boy
Swear to God I would've set that tool here nigga
And did a number on ya frames; happy New Year nigga
BAOW! BAOW!
They'll find him dead in the river when I burst cannons
BAOW! I'll lake a  nigga wit' glasses; Kurt Rambis
Me and Johnny beefin'? Not at all
Shit, Johnny vegan
I side step him and leave a nigga where Johnny leakin'
Think Rowan Atkinson, if I don't like what Johnny speakin'
I'll pull a bullet in Mr. Bean for Johnny English
So you know what that mean, right?
You'll be on the scene next to a Ghost like Tommy Egan
I said muzzle on the ratchet, give Johnny the silent treatment
Stomach shot, bring the faggot out him quick
With the strap I got from my homie primadonna  be actin' like a bitch
I'll walk in his crib, and give this faggot wife the dick
Like, "A. , run the bath I'ma fuck you in the tub
Then B.  givin' you back shots all over the rug
You'll C.  just how I do it when I'm all up in them guts
Soon as I showed her the D, she wanted all of thee above
But y'all know what I told her, "First you gotta suck the dick 'til it's fed."
The neck trash, ain't nothin' gettin' slid in them legs
So whether or not Red get ya bitch on the bed
And nail player, Hellraiser da pins  on the head
He don't even understand why I'm flippin' this man
In case you ain't know, that ball head bar geek was talkin' shit like a Stan
He's the reason why I'm killin' you fam'
Death At A Funeral you Tracey Morgan, Danny got some shit on ya hands
But I get it, y'all think y'all gotta 
Two bald bitches with auburn beards and a face full of decimals
Both of y'all will get face shots when I let the weapon shoot
I'll let 'em loose, like Judy Bloom, I'm makin' Freckle Juice
Shout out to you silly Ninja Turtle
All on John dick, just prayin' and hopin' the Da Don will tell you  some hot shit
But he won't cause when I unload it dawg, I'm smokin' frauds
He be dozin' off, make Jonathan skate with a steel round, it's Rollerball
Ya heard me?
Jersey
Them folks said I should sleep on O-Red
Shit, I just woke up
Ain't this robe tough?
Shout out to Al Kapone, leave  if you got no guts
No luck? Wearin' this? They said it's a curse
So let me put some clothes on and get ready for work
You from Jersey, so I hit Budden  up
Ask what he thought of this
He said, "If URL don't cuff the links, you takin' all the risks 
I'm on you Jersey niggas
Twork and Surf got a bag comin'
But don't let what I'm doin' distract you
This ain't the last button
You wanna see me slack? I got you my nigga
But if we pull up and show da  straps then they gotta suspend us 
Whoever y'all plan to bring around next , won't be a tie
Find a loophole, to give wins or  it's not  gonna slide
Aye, if you loss, follow suit if you can
I mean, why flip flop? When I'd rather address  you like a man
How this mechanic don't know shit about attire ? He never bought clothes
Cause the Versace is the trophy for a body...a war robe 
I ain't take this cause I was bound to, and ain't nobody hound you
I was told, "You and O  can change the game with this card", I made a wild move
We should've did this in a loud room!
So Do The Right Thing or die like Radio Raheem for not turnin' down the Volume
Do The Right Thing? Radio Raheem? See how that correlatin'?
If this a fade in the ring then every punch you either love or hate, what a waste?
I seen him slackin' off since he lost the belt
Nigga let DNA floss on him, when the nigga can barely floss himself
, right? Sounds like you Muslim and Islam is life
Well I'll be nice and do my best to send you to Allah, tonight
Trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers, still not the violent type
I'll tie son  outta fury then draw, make it a Wilder fight
I'll murk this man, you think his Jersey fam' gon' run down on me?
Nigga Surf's so scared, he's somewhere fillin' up that shit bag soon as he hear the sound of me
Aye, me and Ars' like this
Suge, you know what it is
No?
You see how he gave that pound to me?
Ironic they all Crips so if I tell 'em, "Red is dead, that'll make ya niggas proud of me
And if Jeruz bangin' witcha, I'll still be unbothered
With Twork all in my face, I'm a faithful nigga
You flamin' nigga? Bangin' colors is dead but you real, right blood?
BAOW, now you covered in Red
Nigga the tool tuck, make a move, but
For lettin' Twork amp you, good luck gettin' past the  bucks without the church scandal
See on God y'all wasn't listenin' close
"Church", "scandal" in other words, if O live he a pope, I'm really the GOAT
Facts nigga, snappin' like a bad temper
You struggle with Iron Man and you damn near let Ave end ya 
Wait, I brought a gauge in case Suge came to crash witcha
Like you call "Shotgun", you got {gun clicks} now you gon' pass injured 
I caught him lyin' vs Iron like he a gat squeezer
What he say, "I clap Nina's, two black heaters, Ray Solomon, King David/Bathsheba."
But when I seen you hold a gun like this, knew you wanted no parts
That's how I knew I could wash money, I seen O's arc 
Remember when I battled Reed Dollaz and left his bag zipped?
And how I told him I would turn Reed read  to make him past tense?
Well catch this, cause you gon' end up deader than him
This time I'm turnin' read  into Reed  but you will never be present again
Two Clips, one the Pusha but, this here Malice
I ain't leavin' no prints  Charles, I'm the king of this here palace
Remember that center from the Pistons? Yeah I've been here wildin'
Give O 9  from one .9  this the Ten Year Challenge
I'm only here cause
Nah, cause this was an order from Smack
Soon as Surf feel like battlin' again, they not callin' you back
King of the small rooms, right?
It's perfect that they call you that
Cause you goin' in a box, the room don't get no smaller than that!
1-0 nigga!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
You said round 2 on who?
Damn Smack son wildin', now I'm feelin' dumbfounded
Accordin' to Johnny I thought this was a one rounder
You said, "The PG's should call you 'Hov' cause you gave them that 'Blueprint' work?"
Respect, but I'm KRS I made the 'Blueprint' first
You are a carbon copy, I'm the pilot show, you a spin off
A Volume 3 Solomon shirt, a Red rip off
I'll attack ya little...I ain't gon' tap ya little pockets
Little bitch, ain't shit in them little pockets
What you got? $77 dollars you Luka Doncic
Nah, nah you been Ben Simmons
You a threat when you play
The biggest PG in the game, but nobody respectin' ya J
What you gon' say?
All I talk 'bout is sports?
So? I still be leavin' you stupid niggas slumped
You just mad cause you 6'5" and can't shoot or do a dunk
I be doin' what I want
They wouldn't boo this  with a monk
Naked nigga, sky divin' you knew this  from the jump
Smack White got John  vs Ella in this bitch
Translation, we both trip but I'm better with the shit
Y'all really think this sucka's rhymes is touchin' mine?
You buggin' slime, take a vow of celibacy, you out ya fuckin' mind
Look at him, look at him
We all know he don't bang .9's or slang dimes
I see Eric all in ya DNA, you a St. John
Ask Clips how I rock in the hood
Already left Chuck buried , you niggas better tell 'Johnny Be Good'
I rock different
Every statement I make adjacent to greatest
You fakin', these rappers hatin'
Complacent with bein' basic
Feel like a doctor who on vacation
Smack it's hard to relax when another nigga testin' ya patience 
So I pulled up in the old school Bronco
With a John L waitin' , they saluted me when I touched down; Terrell Davis
The infamous, bring that line backer, I'm Von Miller, rhyme killer
Sendin' this John nigga to John Denver
Y'all see how I took the Broncos and intertwined John Denver?
Shit like that where me and John differ
You a rhyme flipper, habitual stealer, I'm iller
Don't breathe, rob me blind, you'll still die nigga
How the fuck you throw a Pay Per View with Smack prices for one rounders
Broke ass nigga think he ever so slick
Janky promoter, get off that Russell Red and Jelly Roll shit
That shit is crazy he got that warrior mentality
He just out here robbin' niggas
Now all the fans feel like OKC, you took 35 from a lot of niggas
Look at him, look at him, salty
Jonathan don't like me tonight
Tank top screamin' loud "I don't think-" I got wife beater tight
Take a step back and look at yaself
You really felon like the degenerate identity thief
You took an L and- you stealin' niggas bars, stealin' niggas tricks
Stealin' niggas names, prolly stealin' niggas whips
Did a Pay Per View event and you was stealin' niggas grip
Even created a slogan after stealin' on his bitch
She say some shit he don't like he throw the swiftest of jabs
Shawty eat it, shake it off and continue to spaz
He like, "Bitch! When you get done gettin' me mad...
It's still two more rounds of me whippin' yo' ass"
Yo, so what I watch Bigg K vs O-Red while I was gettin' slow head?
I'm sorry for bein' outspoken
Truth be told it wasn't my idea, it was hers, she wasn't to see who could go the longest without chokin'
Huh? Geechi? Sound stolen?
Geechi
Geechi said something like that?
'Kay y'all got me
I just figured if I'm Da Don, he screamin' "Mafia" , basically you owe it to John, Gotti
Aye, ah fa, ma na, ya ga, bye bye
Never know what this man sayin'
I guess it only land for the field niggas like plantations
But I don't wanna keep the fans waitin'
I said, "If I fire my .9 y'all die, BAOW BAOW!" Here go ya translation!
Classic? Man, I made ya dinner
Watch me style on Red, I make the target low, go, then get a round on Red
These leagues don't book you for the crowds nor bread
Businessmen don't like owin' shit, that's why nobody'll count on Red
Aye, is this the league that Matt adore ?
Y'all couldn't pitch him these cards
Y'all put Red in front of a Bull, knowin' there's a race you'll get charged
This man pen'? San Quin', the most vicious of bars
But I can tell you why you'll never be considered a star
What's an O-Red moment?
...Exactly, you're so forgettable
And what I write will get Red easy, that makes it legible
No strong pops, fast run, women reach, heard what I said to you?
In addition he's not that fire, baby how Incredible?
You wasn't even a challenger, 'til Champion put you on that pedestal
But ever since you wore that hoodie dress vs Ave, I sent a pray above to check for you
Your stock plummet, so stop frontin' like it ain't upsettin' you
But I guess you gotta act like everything's all right there's nothin' left for you
I should flag ya IG cause ya image is unacceptable
And you look like ya stylist did the Bird Box Challenge when she was dressin' you
Any bitch that would have sex with you, I bet nothin' below their neck can move
That's why I brought Nina, to make O, and she can turn Red vegetable
Security!
That's what you mean you got work, Aak?
You'll never get this high earned stock bein' a part time church cop
You think you equal up to my worth? Stop
I mean you prolly could be rich, if you picked up every dime Surf dropped
It makes sense, screamin' "Jersey" when you stoppin' ya rhyme
From you bitchin', Tsu snitchin', all you niggas got a problem with time
But it's fine, y'all got a cool startin' five
Just need a better bench
Ain't it funny he heard, "Ain't no cryin' in the URL", and been droppin' tiers  ever since
There's Arsonal, Shotgun, Twork, Surf, Serius Jones and then you
But if I go in this arsenal and get this shotgun to work and then get serious Jones and then sue
Once you Jersey battlers get ID'd  Boom
The fo' fo' go, but you'll need more than ya Lady Luck if I catch O-Solo
You know O? You should be a part of my league
Cause I can really help you become the biggest star you can be
Look at Loso, Bad Newz, Clone, free Clone, let's just start with those three
Yeah they've been on other platforms but let's agree they've gotten farther with me
How 'bout joinin' a crew? I'm just thinkin' of a marketin' scheme
Cause how you gon' put Jersey on if you not part of a team?
They say the Crips run battle rap, right?
They owned every card so it seems
That most his  staff, shouldn't Red take part in  the C's ?
Freddy Kruger glove couldn't get this sharp in his dreams
You don't wanna lose one of ya sons  don't get Heartless with me
Chest shot, I'll make him really wear his heart on his sleeve
Ya .9 showin'? Mine blowin' like it's hard to believe
Hold on
{Fake chokes}
Aight y'all I got it, I apologize for the sloppy cadence
But y'all know damn well I wasn't chokin', y'all just ain't peep the body language
I did this, this, this then this, you needed more said?
Well see what happens next  is I'm grippin' arms and aimin' for heads 
This boy dead!
I'm only here cause- nah, cause this was an order from Smack
Soon as Surf feel like battlin' again, they not callin' you back
King of the small room, right? It's perfect that they call you that
Cause you goin' in a box, the room don't get no smaller than that!
Round 2 man
You run wit' Christians and Bow Wow, somethin' ain't addin' up
Four Horsemen, Shad Moss, I count at least seven faggots bruh
You said I should join ya squad? Why?
Your league? The Bullpen shit? For what?
They remind me of the '05 Marlins when tragedy struck
Cause if a nigga on the Don trail  will this Bullpen back him up?
I doubt it, I'm sure Loso know, I'm a Ruger sparker
John artists  can get bagged wit' 'em; Rubin Carter
Tell this faggot chill, I clap the steel he pushin' daffodils
You get the shot right after John pass, you Bradley 
When I'm shootin', God better lift your soul off of Mother Earth
Silencer, you won't here shit when I let a couple burst
Christ himself couldn't save ya from this muzzle work
He intervene I pop Jesus; Jake Shuttlesworth
Forgive me Lord that line outta line, back to this fuckin' jerk
I got the sweetest girl, she ready to pop, get to singin' like Lauryn Hill, if you 'Ready Or Not'
For a few G's , you get pistol whipped with my TEC-9, split ya shit
Your bottom lip will get the Wyclef, John
It's no reason to call '911', do not bother cock rider
Get smacked with the five like a fly swatter
I'm a rottweiler, beam on top when the gwap holla
A top shotta, the original Don Dada
Close range, let that shit bang in his chin
{Fake chokes}
I know y'all don't think I'm chokin'
That was my way of sayin' when I aimed at his chin
Close range, BLAOW! He'll never body language again
Yo, but what the fuck you just say?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, whatchu just say, the whole shit about, oh, you feel like, uh, muhfuckin', you John and Gotti?
That what you just said? You find you John Gotti?
You'll never be John Gotti, you the type to fuck up a classic, you Rob Zombie
He escaped that Rum savage
But all of this dick suckin' tryin' to get Surf to battle you, not at all, son average
Just face it, givin' Tsu J is "just" backwards
You  J "just" backwards? Pump action
Got all kinda kicks like a punt package
Run faggot, you get held down when I lift the weapon
If the first meal don't fill him up, I give him seconds
Get an entry wound and an exit wound from the Smith & Wesson
I'll turn that multiple choice into an open ended question
I body shit, close range, for real
I got that .9 palmed on me
Uh huh, you'll do this shit like your Rum Nitty battle
Y'all don't get it?
That mean I'm givin' the shirt off John John for you
He'll literally go from John John Da Don to 'Living On A Prayer'
Jon Bon Jovi
Look at him, he know he gettin' murked
There was no other option, I had to throw him in the dirt
Tonight I can admit, you wasn't murder in the first
But that murder in the third will lead to the same hearse
Ya heard me?
Jersey
Now I know to be in my position is tough to get to
But to take the disrespect I've been givin', disrupts the mental
You see there's more on my agenda than winnin' and punchin' witchu
So if you don't mind, I need some time to address a couple issues
Before Spit Dat Heat there was Grind Time George, no shade, I'm just statin' facts
Laid the foundation for Atlanta battle rap
And guess what? I was the face of that
Made my way to Smack, Grind Time collapsed, shit gets real now bro
If I never moved to the south and Spit Dat Heat, for real you might've never seen me Miltown Bloe 
John John Da Don vs T-Top, to this day, the most views on that platform
It ain't my fault niggas came to Bullpen cause they got tired of gettin' back doored
So when you say we stole all their talent, you must be bored bored
Cause how I take from a league, I literally open and closed the door for?
Bullpen over bullshit, you know what that's for?
You see Bullpen, that's the south's #1 battle rap platform
And the bullshit? Payin' Norbes to host ya event but he chillin' on the back porch
And y'all wonder why the GZ process is such a crash course
Chef Trez!
Where he at?
Can't believe you be talkin' all this shit you do
When you asked around to come to Bullpen? I never sent for you
Still have you Syah, DNA, Bad Newz, them fights was big for you
And you ain't even have to travel, the move was pivotal
But here we are, and let me guess, you leave that match
Just admit, I played a big part where he's at, facts
I invested so I need that back
You let him bite the hand that'll- wait, I thought you couldn't eat that Smack
And now the bloggers wanna say I robbed the culture? So I'ma dumb out
All because I did one event and didn't tell 'em it was one round?
Well gather 'round cause the solution to the problem has been found
Y'all wanted three rounds, {pop pop, pop} you happy now?
I was the one that risked my rep
Goin' to URL to 106, so I was the one that showed BET Network that real battle rap does exist
How you think Smack got UFF? That birthed some of the best talents we got
So without me there may be no Ill Will, no Brizz, no T-Top
No Chess, Xcel, no Saga, no Dot and off the top
No Prep like a battle that's on the spot
And I introduced Jermaine Dupri to this shit, on my dime!
So if I brought battle rap to rap game, shouldn't this culture owe me for a lifetime
But this the type of thanks I get?
I'm pissed, you my son, I'm the reason you here, thank my dick
Sorry, all your other siblings got swallowed, thank my bitch
If I gotta die to put Tsu aside  I'll take my risk 
You ready O? One false move and the Dessy blow
And when it rain, noodles and red sauce, uh oh you Spaghetti O
Just let me know, is this the type of smoke you prepared for?
Cause I have his baby mother drop her son off a plane, now that lil' nigga airborne
Yeah you was there, when Hollow nigga's tried to jump me
Should've been dead then, but I'll wait 'til his cousins wit' him then I'm washing ten or Red's kin
Wait, Cousins? Washington? Redskin? Yeah that ain't take no hard thought
That's why your career's all backward now, cause all you bring is sports bar to this bar sport
You lost your voice at Summer Madness for real? Who would've thought?
Ain't it funny how Mr. R went horse and couldn't talk?
They gave him Halls, coffee, tea, ginger and oil
You still couldn't finish ya round, right?
BAOW! I'll finish it for you!
Nigga you spoiled
As you can see I came for a fight
Cause you way too dark for me to be takin' you light
Please don't say the John if you ain't sayin' it twice
And if you don't add Da Don you ain't sayin' it right
Just came to talk man
