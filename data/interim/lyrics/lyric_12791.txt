No intentions
Whatsoever
I was gone for a night
Nothing's forever
The cruel daylight
Brought me back to my senses
Got caught in here
Under false pretenses
No way out
None whatever
I made up the story
Thought it was clever
She didn't ask
And I got no reply
But later that night
I heard her cry
No way out
She doesn't buy my story
No way out
She doesn't buy my story
No way out
She doesn't buy my story
No accusations
Whatsoever
But can she forget
Nothing's forever
Since yesterday
She's a little bit colder
Won't happen again
What could I've told her
No way out
She doesn't buy my story
No way out
She doesn't buy my story
No way out
She doesn't buy my story
Doesn't buy my story
How can she tell the truth from the lies
How does she know when to close her eyes
She doesn't want to lose me
So she only sees what she wants to see
No way out
She doesn't buy my story
No way out
She doesn't buy my story
No way out
She doesn't buy my story
No way out
No way out
No way out
