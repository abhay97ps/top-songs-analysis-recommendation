Oh
Little Jackie
Alright
Oh
Little Jackie
She wants to be a star
She got off a Greyhound
In search of fortune and fame
Hoping to find a better way
And leave her troubles behind
But little did she know
That life was sometimes touch and go
Some never get it
Open your eyes
Or you'll learn to regret it
Oh
Little Jackie she wants to be a star
She's caught in the middle
Oh
Little Jackie she wants to be a star
Oh
Growing up
Times Square
Is there where she makes it
Then she met a guy
But he wants to buy nothing but a $5 high
Jackie, say no
Or rearrange you
Remember what your mama done told you
Never ever take gifts from a stranger
I'm talking bout
I said I'm talking 'bout Jackie
Oh, wah, wah, me
Oh, yeah
All that glitters ain't gold
You're only 16 years old
You never meant to be a runaway
Oh, no, no
No, no, no, no, ho
There's got to be a better way today
Today
Talking about Jackie
(If you believe in yourself
I really think you're gonna make it)
Ho, ooh, oh
Ooh, yeah
Talking about Jackie
(If you believe in yourself
I really think you're gonna make it)
I believe you
I believe you
I believe you
I believe you
Oh
Little Jackie
She wants to be
She wants to be a superstar
(If you believe in yourself
I really think you're gonna make it)
Woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo
