One, two, three
She got a shack
Floating down the Pontchartrain
With the water rollin' in
We got to swim
To where the levees start to crack
Another day
Another dollar down the drain
You go to town
No one's around
'Cause if you drown
There ain't no hope for comin' back
It ain't no big thing if you lose your faith
They kinda like to keep you in your place
You never know what might be comin' your way
Oh, everybody
Devil take your money
Money's got no hold on me
Oh, oh, everybody's makin' love
'Cause love is free
You go to church
And pray to God for no more rain
A Cadillac
A paper sack
Well hey there Jack
You want some bourbon for the pain?
Hey tambourine
Ain't no rhythm on the street
With the voodoo
What do you do
When the radio just plays on anyway?
Those greasy fingers in your jelly jar
They'll jack your money
While you sleep in you car
They got the karma
They ain't getting too far
Oh, everybody
Devil take your money
Money's got no hold on me
Oh, oh, everybody's makin' love
'Cause love is free
Everybody come together 
Everybody come together 
Everybody come together 
Everybody come together 
Oh, everybody
Devil take your money
But money's got no hold on me
Oh, oh, everybody's makin' love
'Cause love is free
Oh, everybody
Devil take your money
But money's got no hold on me
Oh, oh, everybody's makin' love
'Cause love is free
Love is free
Love is free
