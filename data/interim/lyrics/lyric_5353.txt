What you want girl? You can have it
Look up the stars, go 'head and grab it
What you want girl? You can have it
Them perky's turned me to a savage
And last night we made magic
And girl I know, I know, I know
Let's take a trip, where would you wanna go?
Come have a sip, tryna put you on go
Just popped a pill, that shit got me in my zone
Just cracked the seal, finna be moving slow
We gotta drill
Yeah, you already know I'm down to kill
I feel like just like Tadoe, and my niggas real
My niggas they on go, we in the field
We strapped like G.I. Joe, we in a field
We strapped like G.I. Joe
Baby girl I need you and you know you need me
Tell me what you wanna do, tryna come and see me
We can go hop in the coup, we can go hop in the Jeep
I'd do anything for you cause you do anything for me
