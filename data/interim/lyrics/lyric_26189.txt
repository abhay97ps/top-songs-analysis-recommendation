You can drink my liquor, you can call my lady
You can take my money, you can smoke my blunt
Scuff these Jordans, you can say you hate me
You can call me crazy, but
Don't touch my truck 
Skrrt , skrrt
Don't touch my truck 
Skrrt , skrrt
Don't touch my
V8 engine with the windows tinted
Boy, we came from the bottom, got it out the mud
Whole block jumpin' 'cause the subs stay hittin'
If they roll up on me, know I keep one tucked 
Tell them boys come and get me
I be ridin' through the city
Young, rich, and I'm pretty
Homie, don't get it twisted
Keep a semi in the hemi 
Red cup full of Henny 
My hitters come in plenties, for real
You can drink my liquor, you can call my lady
You can take my money, you can smoke my blunt
Scuff these Jordans, you can say you hate me
You can call me crazy, but
Don't touch my truck 
Skrrt , skrrt
Don't touch my truck 
Skrrt , skrrt
Don't touch my
Woodgrain dash with the matte black finish
And it match my shawty with the big ol' butt
Know them boys soft 'cause they got hard feelings
You can try me if you wanna go and test your luck 
Tell them boys come and get me 
I be ridin' through the city 
Young, rich, and I'm pretty 
Homie, don't get it twisted 
Keep a semi in the hemi 
Red cup full of Henny 
My hitters come in plenties, for real
You can drink my liquor, you can call my lady
You can take my money, you can smoke my blunt
Scuff these Jordans, you can say you hate me
You can call me crazy, but
Don't touch my truck
Skrrt, skrrt
Don't touch my truck
Skrrt, skrrt
Don't touch my truck
Woo, ooh, woo, ooh, woo, ooh
Don't touch my truck 
Don't touch my truck
