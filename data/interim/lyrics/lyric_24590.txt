Baby, come give me something new 
'Cause I can't stop lovin' you 
Since I got a taste of your love 
Baby, come give me something new

Like, if you show love, you gon' get it back
Like, if you fuck good, you gon' get it back
Like, if you cook, wanna a real nigga that
Gon' rap 'til that pussy like 
We can go and get a private room
We can fuck for one night, ain't gotta jump the broom
Say your nigga, chill

'Cause I can't stop lovin' you 
Since I got a taste of your love
