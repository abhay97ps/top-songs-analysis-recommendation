I never knew the power of a song
Until I heard the music playing the day mama passed on
Never knew what innocence was about
Til the first time I laid eyes on the face of a new-born child
Chorus
I never knew love
No, I mean real love
I never knew that kind of love
Til this moment with you
I never understood the meaning of home
Til I pulled into that old dirt drive after being gone too long
I didn't know what serenity really was
Til I stopped one day to listen to that river gently run
Chorus
And I never knew love
No, I mean real love
I never knew that kind of love
Til this moment with you
I've known the hunger before tonight for other love
I felt the yearning I felt the fire, in their touch
This goes deeper than any thing i've ever known
Beyond my heart, clear down to my soul
I never knew what beauty could behold
Til you looked at me and I could see forever unfold
Oh you made me whole
Chorus
I never knew love
No I mean real love
I never knew that kind of love
Til this moment with you
Til I was loved by you
