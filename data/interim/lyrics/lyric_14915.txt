The time has come in my life for me to move on
And get on with my life, my life
Oh, but I don't regret, no
Every precious moment that we spent
They were well spent
Oh girl, yes they were.  
Don't be sad, don't be blue
You got your whole life ahead of you
Love was here, now it's gone
So it's time you keep moving on
Don't take it personal
Take the bitter with the sweet
Easy come, easy go
Don't take it personal
Take the bitter with the sweet
Some good things come to an end
No blame, no shame
It was nice, but sometimes things do change
We change, but we can still be friends, be friends
Oh girl, you have so much to offer to someone else in their life
If you reach out, oh girl, yes you can.  
Don't be sad, don't be blue
You got your whole life ahead of you
Love was here, now it's gone
So it's time you keep moving on.  
Don't take it personal
Take the bitter with the sweet
Easy come, easy go
Don't take it personal
Take the bitter with the sweet
Some good things come to an end
Don't take it personal
Take the bitter with the sweet
Easy come, easy go
Don't take it personal
Take the bitter with the sweet
Some good things come to an end
So long, so long, my love
It seems the time has come to go our separate ways
Since we're not going to be lovers anymore
Let's be friends
Don't be sad, don't be blue
You got your whole life ahead of you
Love was here, now it's gone
So it's time you keep moving on.  
Don't take it personal
Take the bitter with the sweet
 Easy come, easy go
Don't take it personal
Take the bitter with the sweet
Some good things come to an end
Don't take it personal
Take the bitter with the sweet
Easy come, easy go
Don't take it personal
Take the bitter with the sweet
Some good things come to an end, baby
Don't take it personal
Take the bitter with the sweet
Easy come, easy go
