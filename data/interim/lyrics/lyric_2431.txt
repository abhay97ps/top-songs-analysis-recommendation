Doc Butcher’s on the beat, y’all
Breez is on the rhyme, y’all.  Rob
Swift is on the cut, y’all.  And
This is how we do it 
 We did it one more time 
 We did it one more time 
 We did it one more time 
 We did it one more time 
Global Domination, sonic invasion
Flood mass markets like products from Asia
For the free, we gon’ politick major
For the green and we got it to blaze up
You got a fist?  We got it to raise up
Fuck the politricks.  We’re calling your days up
I’m not the soldier
I don’t rock boats.  I be dropping boulders
I know my folks where the jobs is frozen
Where all things glitter and they’re not the golden
It ain’t about the man.  It’s the knot he holding
He learned it from the man where the stocks is swollen
Got control and won’t give it away
Lock it down—Guantanamo Bay.  Say, “Word,” to
Pablo.  Word to hablo
Take out diablos that took out Diallo

I used to fiend for niceness
‘Til I seen what a beautiful thing this mic is
Y’all know.  Looking at it like this: no
Green, no steam, no cream, you’re lifeless
Y’all know.  Looking at it like this: no
Green, no steam, no cream, you’re lifeless
Y’all know.  Looking at it like this: no
Green, no steam, no cream
This rap
Hannibal over the top.  Scourge of the Romans
Prophetic omens through the surge of the Evahflowin’
Humbly holding.  In the same, I
Suppose is when Moses crumbled the golden
Idols be falser than American, resulting in
Arrogance that overcomes the globe and its inhabitants
Secret wars and directives conceal over
Four generations of Agent-Orange-infected
Even more projected, these wars is set to see
Man at the vanishing point.  You need more perspective?
Hand me a T-Square, protractor, compass
To foes, I’m a drawback, a throwback to conscious
To convert nonbelievers in concerts
Expand through the land of the creatures of comfort
The smoke hanging over the canopy, presenting the
Anatomy.  You’re rumbling the jungles of insanity
