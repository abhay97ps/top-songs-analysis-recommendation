Can I have this dance my you're looking pretty
Is there something wrong did he leave you hurting
I don't mean to pry but that tear in your eye gave you away
If you don't want to talk we'll keep it quiet
But sometimes a heartache hurts worse if you hide it
I think there's a chance one slow dance might ease the pain
You have the right to remain silent
Anything that you say as I hold you against me
Will forever be a secret between us two
I've been wanting you but you didn't know it
And now that he's gone at last I can show it
If your heart is tired for the rest of your life
Lay your love on me
So many times my eyes have held you
Tonight please give my arms that chance
If you don't feel the need for conversation
We'll just let our hearts talk while we dance
You have the right to remain silent
Anything that you say as I hold you against me
Will forever be a secret between us two
I've been wanting you but you didn't know it
And now that he's gone at last I can show it
If your heart is tired for the rest of your life
Lay your love on me
If your heart is tired for the rest of your life
Lay your love on me
