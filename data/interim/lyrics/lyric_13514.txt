If you would just be sensible
You'd find me indispensable
I pray deep down to destiny
That it places you with me
Whoa, wanting you here in the sheets
Wandering around incomplete
Waiting so long
To feel it again
I thought that this heart would never mend
To feel it again, I know it is the living end
To feel it again 
I thought that this heart would never mend
To feel it again, I know it is the living end
Another scratched or scribbled note
To handsome men in overcoat
Deception right in front of me
A jealous fantasy
Whoa, something that sets you apart
Tightens your grip on my heart
Don't ever let it go
Till I feel it again
I thought that this heart would never mend
To feel it again, I know it is the living end
To feel it again 
I thought that this heart would never mend
To feel it again, I know it is the living end
All that I know 
Is people will come and people will go
I don't really care 
As long as you're there
As long as you're there
To feel it again 
I thought that this heart would never mend
To feel it again, I know it is the living end
To feel it again 
I thought that this heart would never mend
To feel it again, I know it is the living end
To feel it again 
I thought that this heart would never mend
To feel it again, I know it is the living end
