In my life, there's been changes
But nothing seems to satisfy me the way you do, no
You make it easy, the way you please me
Everytime I'm close to you
All this temptation, I can't see wrong from right
It's a new sensation, you know I'm blinded by the light
 I'm walking on holy water
Feels like I'm walking on sacred ground, baby
 I'm walking on holy water, everytime  you come 'round
You were all I ever wanted
Never had a girl in my life 'til I met you, no no no
I got a certain feeling, you got my senses reeling
Whenever I get close to you
You're my salvation, I found you just in time
My one temptation, you know I can't believe you're mine
 I'm walking on holy water
Feels like I'm walking on sacred ground, baby
 I'm walking on holy water, everytime  you come 'round
Oh yeah, it's funny how it seems like yesterday
Lovin' of the first degree
One word was all I heard you say, ooh baby
It's funny what you've done to me
Just wanna see you run to me
Yeah, all this temptation, I can't see wrong from right
It's a new sensation, you know I'm blinded by the light
 I'm walking on holy water
Feels like I'm walking on sacred ground, baby
 I'm walking on holy water, everytime  you come 'round
