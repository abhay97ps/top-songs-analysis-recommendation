When you say love
You're telling every one your moment's come
And you've found what you've been looking for
When you say love
You said the only word that tells the world
You never will be lonely anymore
You've got a pretty rainbow all your own
And at last you found your pot of gold
You're completely satisfied
A feeling of contentment fills your soul
When you say love
It means you've found your special one
And that you care enough to give your very best
When you say love
There's not another word that says so much
'Cause that four letter word means happiness
Your heart is given wings to touch the sky
It's higher than an eagle dares to fly
If you took every thing you've heard, try to make a magic word
You'll find you said it all when you say love
When you say love
It means you've found your special one
And that you care enough to give your very best
When you say love
There's not another word that says so much
'Cause that four letter word means happiness
Your heart is given wings to touch the sky
It's higher than an eagle dares to fly
If you took every thing you've heard, try to make a magic word
You'll find you said it all when you say love
You'll find you said it all when you say love
When you say love
When you say love
