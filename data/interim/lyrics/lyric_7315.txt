What it is, what it is, somebody tell me
What it is, what it is, sure is funky
What it is, what it is, somebody tell me
What it is, what it is, sure is funky
Did I hear somebody say "Down with the system"?
Shut your mouth
Or I'll take your toy away
Children shouldn't play with bombs
Ain't no words to this song
You just dance and hum along
What it is, what it is, somebody tell me
What it is, what it is, sure is funky
What it is, what it is, somebody tell me
What it is, what it is, sure is funky
Did I  hear somebody say "Down with the system"?
Shut your mouth
Ain't no words to this song
You just dance and hum along
What it is, what it is, somebody tell me
What it is, what it is, sure is funky
What it is, what it is, somebody tell me
What it is, what it is, sure is funky
Don't try to figure out what this song is about
Ain't no words to this song
You just dance and hum along
What it is, what it is, somebody tell me
What it is, what it is, sure is funky
What it is, what it is, somebody tell me
What it is, what it is, sure is funky
Did I hear somebody say "Sing a song, soul sister"?
