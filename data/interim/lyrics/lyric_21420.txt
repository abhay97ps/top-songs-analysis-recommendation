Yeah, mmm...
Ohhh, yeah
Ohhh, no
Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain, we all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow
Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long 'til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on
Please swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
That you won't let show
So just call on me, brother, hey, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on
Oh, lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long 'til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on
Just lean on me!
You just call on me, brother, hey, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on
If there is a load you have to bear
That you can't carry
I'm right up the road, I'll share your load
If you just call me
Call me, I'm callin'
Call me, when you need a friend
Call me, call me
Call me, when you need a friend
Call me, when you need a friend
Call me, if you need a friend
Call me, anytime of day
Call me...
Oooh, it won't be long 'til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on, lean on, lean on me
Lean on, lean on, lean on me, when you need a friend...
I'm gonna need somebody to lean on
I'm gonna need somebody to lean on
Yeah... ohhh
Ohhh... yeah!
