Crusin' 'round 'round fell out of my boat
Swam around swam around started to float
Floated 'round 'round came in on the flow
There I found, there I found Sausalito
Drinkin' pea-green it's all in the view 
Every shade marmalade every hue
Houses on stilts grow out of the sea
Everything's growin' there, it's growin' for me
You gotta go there, everything grows there
When you get high on a mountain it snows there
Everything's groovy like in a movie
Sausalito is the place to go to
Sunnin' all day, lovin'all night
Write a bit, fight a bit got it just right
Music and flowers the sight and the sound
Fish a bit, wish a bit magic's all 'round
You gotta go there, everything grows there
When you get high on a mountain it snows there
Everything's groovy like in a movie
Sausalito is the place to go to . . . now
You gotta go there, everything grows there
When you get high on a mountain it snows there
Everything's groovy like in a movie
You gotta go there
You gotta go there
