{Intro}
Hi-de-ho
Hi De Hi
Gonna get me
A piece of the sky
Gonna get me
Some of that Old Sweet Roll
I'm Singin' Hi de hi de hi de hi de Hooooo
I've been down so low
Bottom looked like up
Once I thought that seconds saves
Was enough to fill my cup
So I offered all I got
And that ain't no way to live
Being taken by the ones who got
The least amount to give
Hi de ho
Hi de hi
Gonna get me a piece of the sky
Gonna get me some of that old sweet roll
I'm singing hi de hi de hi de hi de hooooo
Once I met the devil
He was mighty slick
Tempted me with worldly goods
Said -you can have your pick-
But when he laid that paper on me
And he showed me where to sign
I said thank you very kindly
But I'm in too good-a mood to mind
Hi de ho
Hi de hi
Gonna get me a piece of the sky
Gonna get me some of that old sweet roll
Singin' hi de hi de hi de hi de hooooo
Hi de ho
Hi de hi
Gonna get me a piece of the sky
Gonna get me some of that old sweet roll
Singin' hi de hi de hi de hi de hoooo
