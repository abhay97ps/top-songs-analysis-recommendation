We pull up to LIV in the Cullinan

I'm a Migo, I feel like a doctor 
Goin' surgical with the new chopper

We got all the work, we make your trap close 
Gang havin' loyalty, we ten toes 
Nah, nobody givin' up, why would the gang fold? 
We outside, we totin' them bangers, we not shootin' at strangers 
Say what you wanna say, long as it ain't us 'cause my niggas gon' hang ya 
Look at them young niggas goin' crazy-crazy, man, them niggas too dangerous

Shoot for the stars, aim for the moon
