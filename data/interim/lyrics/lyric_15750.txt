Sister, sister
It's the loneliness that's the killer
So you want
To be free
To live your life
The way you wanna be
Will you give
If we cry?
Will we live
Or will we die?
Oh
Jaded hearts 
Heal with time
Shoot that love 
So we can
Stop the bleeding, oh

And live our lives
The way we wanna be

Oh, love, love
Oh, love, love

There's no other love 
There is no other love, no other love like ours
There's no other love

There's no other love 
There's no other love 
There is no love

Racism in among future kings can only lead to no good
Besides, all our sons and daughters already know how that feels
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Love, love, love
