See ya on the strip, yeah-yeah
See ya, see ya

Band is gettin' ready
He's raving up the Chevy
His mama says his jeans are too tight, oooh!
He got to care the weather
The girls are into leather
And the feelin's pretty cool tonight
Now, listen, honey, I've got some money
And I know a place that's really hip
Put on some pretty old music
And we're going to the strip
On the strip, it's a beautiful night
On the strip, people feelin' alright
On the strip, we're gonna take you for a ride
On the strip, it's such a trip, on the strip
(See ya on the strip, yeah-yeah
See ya, see ya
See ya on the strip, yeah-yeah)
Red lights, green lights
Headlights, seems like everybody's got a set of wheels
We got sunshine in the night, ooh
That's how good it feels
Gotta get away!
On a Saturday!
Feels alright
On the strip, it's a beautiful night
On the strip, people feelin' alright
On the strip, we're gonna take you for a ride
On the strip, it's such a trip, on the strip
Hey, honey, move over, hey
Come on, give us a break, give us some room, man
Alright
Go, go!
Oooh!
On the strip, it's a beautiful night
On the strip, people feelin' alright
On the strip, we're gonna take you for a ride
On the strip, it's such a trip
It's such a trip, oooh!
On the strip, it's a beautiful night
On the strip, people feelin' alright
On the strip, we're gonna take you for a ride
On the strip, it's a beautiful night
On the strip, we're gonna take you for a ride
