You can't buy it at the store, try it on for size
Then bring it back if it don't feel right
No love, love ain't like that
You can't trade it in like an automobile
That's got too many miles an' rust on it's wheels
No love, love ain't like that
Love ain't that easy to define
You can't build it by design
It takes its own sweet time
It don't fall from the sky like a tiny drop of rain
That hits you right between the eyes one day
No love, love ain't like that
You can't put your money down an' just roll the dice
Think you're gonna win it all some night
No love, love ain't like that
Love, yeah
Love ain't that easy to define
You can't build it by design
It takes its own sweet time
You can't buy it at the store, try it on for size
Bring it back if it don't feel right
No love, love ain't like that
Love, no love, love, love, it ain't like that
Can't trade it in like an automobile
Too many miles and rust on the wheels
No love, no love, no, it ain't like that
Oh, love, love, oh, love, love, love
Oh, oh, love, love, love love, it ain't like that
It don't fall from the sky, you can't trade it in
Can't buy it at the store then take it back again
