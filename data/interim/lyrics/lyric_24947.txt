Southside on the track, yeah
Southside
Southside
Yeah
I just got some stupid dome from this hoe from the Southside
Long live Troup, my OG man, that nigga from the Southside
Shout out Deezy and them loc's who crippin' on the Southside
I get bags in for the low and send them to the Southside 
Yeah, I'm sellin' coke for real
I put the "d" in dope for real
Saint Laurent on my coat for real
That Draco, that Draco 
I'm with Derez in Clayco 
Shoutout to Clayhead, that nigga a real one
We had them bands in the neighborhood 
Temp fade, new J's 
All day, catch plays 
White tee, dope boy 
Move that dope, boy 
Trappin' out a bando 
Servin' out a window 
Tryna run our mills up 
That's what we pay the rent for 
Fuck it up in the Gucci store, them M's in 
Bad bitch lookin' like Bernice, I call her Slim Jim 
I just want push start on my car
Shoutout the hood, they know I'm a god
They know what we  bang wherever we are
I just took these cuts on stage
Look at these VVS' in my chain
I'm doing better, I can't even complain 
Bought it plain, then I blew out the brain 
Birkin bag, make the bitch go insane 
With the gang, I ain't switchin' the name 
Paper tag, got me switchin' these lanes 
Do anything to get me some chains
These niggas be fuckin' for fame 
I just got some stupid dome from this hoe from the Southside
Long live Troup, my OG man, that nigga from the Southside
Shout out Deezy and them loc's who crippin' on the Southside
I get bags in for the low and send them to the Southside 
Yeah, I'm sellin' coke for real
I put the "d" in dope for real
Saint Laurent on my coat for real
That Draco, that Draco
I'm with Derez in Clayco
Shoutout to Clayhead, that nigga a real one
We had them bands in the neighborhood
I'm doing shit that they wishing they could 
I'm the frontrunner, burning right through the hood 
They hated on me, but it's still all good 
Draco on me, and it's still all wood 
I'm on probation, they let off a fool
They on my drip, tryna see what I do
They takin' notes, tryna study my moves
They tryna do what I do 
All-Star weekend, I was gettin' the pack in
Heard you got your shit took, nigga you lackin'
Big body Benz "beep, beep" when it back in
Real street niggas buyin' bags with the backends
These niggas ain't authentic, they actin'
And I ain't get to the money, they cappin'
What happened? 
I thought you was a real one? 
Solitary stones in my ear, these the clear ones 
These diamonds dancin' too loud in my ear, so I don't hear them 
My homie got the stick, I got the glizzy
We don't fear them 
These niggas don't wanna play with us
I swear that we gon' kill them 
I just got some stupid dome from this hoe from the Southside
Long live Troup, my OG man, that nigga from the Southside
Shout out Deezy and them loc's who crippin' on the Southside
I get bags in for the low and send them to the Southside
Yeah, I'm sellin' coke for real
I put the "d" in dope for real
Saint Laurent on my coat for real
That Draco, that Draco
I'm with Derez in Clayco
Shoutout to Clayhead, that nigga a real one
We had them bands in the neighborhood
Yeah, on Southside
