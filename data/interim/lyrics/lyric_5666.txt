I can't do enough
To show how much I love you
I can't do enough
To show how much I love you
You were always around
While I went through my changes
At times, I thought you
To be a fool
What could your purpose be
What did you see in me
When did I discover how great
Your love for me must be
I can't do enough
To show how much I love you
I can't do enough
To show how much I love you
Deep in my heart, I know
I know, the lord had blessed me
For he has caused my
Foolish heart to see, oh, yeah
The heartbreak I've caused you
The wrong I can't undo
I'm so ashamed for all
The things I did to you
I can't do enough
To show how much I love you
I can't do enough
To show how much I love you
Oh
I can't do enough
To show how much I love you
I can't do enough
To show how much I love you
The wrong I've done to you
Will take a lifetime to undo
But I stand ready
To prove my love to you
No, no, no
Ah, ah
I can't do enough now, baby
No, no, no
