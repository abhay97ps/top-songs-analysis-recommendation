"You really don’t understand, do you? Hey, man, don’t you realize that in order for us to make this thing work, man, we’ve got to get rid of the pimps and the pushers and the prostitutes and then start all over again clean."
"Hey, look nobody’s pushing me anywhere, ok? I mean, not you not the cops, nobody now. I mean, you wanna get rid of the pushers, I’ll help you. But, don’t send your people after me."
"Oh, come on, John. Can’t you see that we can’t get rid of one without getting rid of the other? We’ve gotta come down on both of ‘em at the same time in order for this whole thing to work for the people."
" Hey, look. Nobody’s closing me out of my business."
Ooooh ooooooooh eee ooooh ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooh
We brothers gonna work it out
We brothers gonna work it out
Brother's gonna work it out 
Brother's gonna work it out 
Brother's gonna work it out 
Brother's gonna work it out 
Gonna get it now
Now don't give him no peace sign
If you don't mean it from your heart
United we can get over
But, yet we're still apart
Cause each man demands respect
And to get an equal share
And until you're givin' him that
There'll be no peace...
Brother's gonna work it out 
Brother's gonna work it all out 
Ooooh! We must all join hands
We can march across this land in peace!
Love, joy, with that understanding of truly who we are
Instead of brother turning on sister
Sister turning on brother
Now how you gonna get it together
Being against one another?
Shoot ups, live up so high
Till your world has turned to stone
How you can you deal with the truth
When reality's all gone?
Brother's gonna work it out 
Brother's gonna work it all out 
All brothers sing
Stop the pimps, the hustler and
The pusher man as fast you can
Open your ears and eyes to the facts
Of what's truly holding you back!
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoh
Brother needs your help
Now, can't you see?
Aw he's got to have it
Oh right on
Ohhhh yeah
Brother's gonna work it out 
Brother's gonna work it out 
Now, on the for real side:
All the answers to your problems you can find
Yet you stay locked behind defeat
Yet the key is in your mind
Brother to win your brother's trust
These five things you must
Stop your robbing, stealing, killing, cheating and lying
Brother's gonna work it out 
Oh brother's gonna work it out 
Brother's gonna work it out 
Brother's gonna work it all out 
Brother's gonna work it
