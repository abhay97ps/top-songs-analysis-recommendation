Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray for your love to keep
If you should leave before the dawn remember this
While you are gone
Sometimes I feel like your swinging door
Wth you walking in and out and in and out
Ive never been in so before and then I'd have to do without you
Guess I thought i could be strong
Guess I could not wait too long
Guess you just can't do no wrong
So baby could you
Chorus
Save some of your love for me
Save some love for me
Cause you know I need your love baby
The day and week and season change
And then you slip back into my world
I hate the thought it sounds so strange
But I, I want to be your number ne girl
Heaven helpme to let you go
Heaven help me to tell you no
Heaven help me I love you so
So baby could you
Chorus
Oh baby save your love
I need you wrong or right
Under the stars above
I'm wishing every night
What can I give to you
So that you have to see
So that you wil be true
And save your love for me
Chorus
