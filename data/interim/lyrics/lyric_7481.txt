Armstead-Ashford-Simpson
I don't need no doctor, because I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor, because I know what's ailing me, yes I do
I've been too long away from my baby
I'm coming down, I'm coming down with misery
I don't need no doctor, or prescriptions to be filled
I don't need no doctor, or prescriptions to be filled, no I don't
Only my baby's arms could take away these chills
Oh these chills
Well the doctor says I need rest
All I need is her tenderness
He put me on the critical list
When all I need is her sweet kiss
There can't be a medicated lotion
That can sooth, no no, my emotion
Well the doctor says I need rest
All I need is her tenderness
He put me on the critical list
When all I need is her sweet kiss
There can't be a medicated lotion
That can sooth, no no, my emotion
Well I don't need no doctor, because my will to live is gone
Well I don't need no doctor, because my will to live is gone
All I need is my baby
Baby please won't you come on home
Won't you come on home
I don't need no doctor, because I know what's ailing me
I've been too long away from my baby
I'm coming down, I'm coming down with misery
Coming down with misery
I don't need no doctor, I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor, I don't need no doctor
