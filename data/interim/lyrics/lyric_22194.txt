We slept in this room together
But now you're gone
And it's so quiet I turn the TV on
We lived in this room together
Remember, we painted the walls
Now time doesn't stand still
Though it crawls, it crawls
Baby, I'm afraid to sleep
Cause if I do, I'll always dream of you
Dreams are always deep
I miss you so, why did I let you go?
Baby, I'm afraid to sleep
Baby, I'm afraid to sleep
I never realized how much I was in love with you
Til' you started sleeping with some one new
Last night I dreamed again
December and you were there
I cried and you kissed my face
And you still care, you still care
But baby, I'm afraid to sleep
Cause if I do, I'll always dream of you
Dreams are always deep
I miss you so, why did I let you go?
Oh oh oh
Baby, I'm afraid to sleep
Lying alone in the darkness
With a memory in my head
There's a big hole where my heart is
And a lonely feeling rolling around my head
Baby, I'm afraid to sleep
If I do. I'll always dream of you
Dreams are always
I miss you so, why did I let you go?
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Baby, I'm afraid of sleep
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Baby I'm afraid to sleep
Baby I'm afraid to sleep
Slept in this room together and now you're gone
