I want everybody to get up off your seat
And get your arms together, and your hands together
And give me some of that old soul clapping
You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did
You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
But you did, but you did
If you took your love somewhere else
I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death
You made me feel like I've never felt
Kisses so good I had to holler for help
You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
But you did, but you did
You didn't have to hold me like you did
But you did but you did
Every day it's something new
You pull out your bag and your fine to-do
You got me trying new things too
Just so I can keep up with you
You didn't have to shake me like you did
But you did, but you did
You didn't have to make it like you did
But you did, but you did
All my life I've been shortchanged
Without your love, baby, it's a crying shame
And now I know what the fellas are talking about
When they say that they been turned out
I want to thank you 
Thank you 
Thank you baby 
Oh baby 
Got to say
You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did
You didn't have to hold me like you did
But you did, but you did
Thank you 
Baby 
Baby 
Thank! I've! Got! I've got to 
Thank you, baby 
Thank you, baby 
Thank you, oh baby
Thank you
