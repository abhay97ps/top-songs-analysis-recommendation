I kn-kn-know a girl, she gets what she wants all the time
Cause she's fine
But for an angel, she's a hot hot mess
Make you so blind, but you don't mind
Cause she's an uptown, get-around, anything-goes girl, girl
She's a hardcore, candy-store, gimme-some-more girl, girl
She'll make you take her to the club, but then she leaves with her friends
She likes to stay late at the party, cause the fun never ends
And all her clothes are on the floor and all your records are scratched
She's like a one-way ticket cause you can't come back
Saying yeah... you want her, but she's so mean
Yeah... you want her, but she's so mean
You kn-kn-know that if you don’t shut your mouth, she’ll freak out
You better get your shit together, ‘cause she’s bringing you down now
Yeah boy you better, you better
Cause she's an uptown, get-around, anything-goes girl, girl
She's a hardcore, candy-store, gimme-some-more girl, girl
She’s got a wicked sense of humor, can’t believe what she says
She drinks Bacardi in the morning ‘til it goes to her head
And all you want is just to hold her, but she don’t go for that
She has a hard time coming when she can’t hit back
Saying yeah... you want her, but she's so mean
Yeah... you want her, but she's so mean
Every now and then, she makes you just a little bit crazy 
She’ll turn a knife into your back and then she’s calling you baby, crazy
She'll make you take her to the club, but then she leaves with her friends
She likes to stay late at the party, cause the fun never ends
And all her clothes are on the floor and all your records are scratched
She's like a one-way ticket cause you can't come back
Saying yeah... you want her, but she's so mean
Yeah... you want her, but she's so mean
Yeah man, I know how you want her 
Yeah man, I know how you want her 
Yeah man, I know how you want her
But she's so mean
