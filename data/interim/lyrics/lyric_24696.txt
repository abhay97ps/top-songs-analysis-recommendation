Yeah, ayy, uh
I do this shit 'cause I-
Turn, turn it up a little bit
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta blap
Yo, yo, yo, ayy
I might go fuck up these bands 
I do this shit 'cause I can 
I just took care of my fam 
Thought this was always the plan 
I might go fly to Japan 
Honolulu, get a tan 
To the beach I don't bring sand 
Thought that was always the plan 
Growed up, now I am the man 
It's shit you don't understand 
Popeye just opened the can
I don't fuck with no fufu that's not on my brand 
Call me when you need a hand 
In the Bay, I'm Superman 
YSL on me, goddamn
Tell me, why is your girlfriend my number one fan? 
Always scrutinized
Bags are supersized, why are you surprised?
Must have mixed us with a different group of guys
Spot the truth or lies, I mean business but I'm not in suit and ties
Just been prophesized 
This shit fell right into place 
Indy 500 my pace 
Drinking it straight to the face
Liquor and women, two things I don't chase 
Don't got a minute to waste 
Mask off, I'm showing my face 
Shout-out Dakari, my ace 
They hate so much, it's a disgrace 
I put 'em back into place 
I put your bitch in a Wraith
I just snatch her, she's vanishing without a trace 
I might go fuck up these bands 
I do this shit 'cause I can 
I just took care of my fam 
Thought this was always the plan 
I might go fly to Japan 
Honolulu, get a tan 
To the beach I don't bring sand 
Thought that was always the plan 
Thought that was always the plan 
Thought that was always the plan 
Did it, I do it again 
Thought that was always the plan
I might go fuck up these bands 
I do this shit 'cause I can 
I just took care of my fam 
Thought this was always the plan 
Ten years, this shit has been brewing 
I'm like "The fuck you been doing?" 
Hall of Fame, Gerald's a shoe in
You'll never be Jordan, you're more Patrick Ewing 
Number one spot, I'm pursuing 
Exclusive like "Who done let you in?"
Money talks, I speak it fluent
Got tired of my bitch, I went got a new one
Quick swish that, this bitch whack
Pack, flip that, making quick stacks
This shit blap, G did that 
Taking a quick trap nap 
I go all night and shit, ain't gotta hide this shit
This shit's a freestyle, I ain't even write this shit
Roll me some Marty and Iâ€™m finna light this shit 
They finna bite this shit, ayy 
Like Jaws swimming on South Beach, this is shit that they don't teach
Don't go too far, don't try too hard, bitch, don't reach like 
Drugs got me on a level, lockjaw, I got slow speech
I'm courtside, I got floor seats next to Rihanna like "Oh sheesh!"
I might go fuck up these bands 
I do this shit 'cause I can 
I just took care of my fam 
Thought this was always the plan 
I might go fly to Japan 
Honolulu, get a tan 
To the beach I don't bring sand 
Thought that was always the plan 
Thought that was always the plan 
Thought that was always the plan 
Did it, I do it again 
Thought that was always the plan
I might go fuck up these bands 
I do this shit cause I can 
I just took care of my fam 
Thought this was always the plan 
I thought this was always the plan
What were you doing? What do you mean?
There's only one way, there's only one option
There's only one route to get there, you know?
It's not gon' make itself
When you wake up and check the Chase app
And this shit got more and more digits than a license plate
Them seven-eight figures don't make themselves, yadadamean?
You gotta get it! This was always the plan
