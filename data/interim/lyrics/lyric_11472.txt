Oh, I won't let you down
I'll be back to give all my love to you
Baby, hold on
No, you won't fade away
In my mind you'll be with me every day
Baby, be strong
And just hold on
Keep your feelin' strong
And you'll never find a day
I'm not with you every way
Don't you ever hide away
Our love, hold on
But if you let me down
I'll be strong and give all my love to you
Baby, hold on
'Cause you won't fade away
In my mind you'll be with me every day
Baby, be strong
And just hold on
Keep your feelin' strong
And you'll never find a way
I'm not with you every day
Don't you ever hide away
Our love, hold on
Baby, hold on
But if you ever doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it
'Cause all I ever wanted to do
Is give my lovin' to you
So just hold on
Keep your feelin' strong
And you'll never find a day
I'm not with you every way
Don't you ever hide away
So just hold on
Keep your feelin' strong
And you'll never find a day
I'm not with you every way
And don't you ever hide away
Our love, hold on
Baby, hold on
Baby, hold on
Baby, hold on
Baby, hold on
