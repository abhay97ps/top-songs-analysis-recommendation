Who draws the crowd, and plays so loud
Baby, it's the guitar man
Who's gonna steal the show, you know
Baby, it's the guitar man
He can make you love
He can make you cry
He will bring you down
Then he'll get you high
Something keeps him going
Miles and miles a day
To find another place to play
Night after night, who treats you right
Baby, it's the guitar man
Who's on the radio
You go listen to the guitar man
Then he comes to town
And you see his face
And you think you might
Like to take his place
Something keeps him drifting
Miles and miles away
He is searching for the songs to play
Then you listen to the music
And you like to sing-along
You want to get the meaning
Out of each and every song
Then you find yourself a message
And some words to call your own
And take 'em home
He can make you love
He can get you high
He will bring you down
Then he'll make
Make you cry
Something keeps him moving
But no one seems to know
What it is that makes him go
Then the lights begin to flicker
And the sound is getting dim
The voice begins to falter
And the crowds are getting thin
But he never seems to notice
He's just got to find another place to play
Any way
Got to play
Either way
Got to play
