Here I am with my head in my hands
With a tear each day of the year
This is not, not at all what I planned 
How to say what cannot be clear
I'm going away from you
If I have to go away 
There'll be time enough to say
Why I ruined a good thing, I'll never know
How I loved and lost the thing I wanted most
Most
There you are, you're so near, yet so far
Out of reach to one who can't speak
Just the past makes me silent and more 
Makes my mind unable to think
I'm going away from you
If I have to go away 
There'll be time enough to say
Why I ruined a good thing, I'll never know
How I loved and lost the thing I wanted most
Most
If I have to go away 
There'll be time enough to say
Why I ruined a good thing, I'll never know
How I loved and lost the thing I wanted most
If I have to go away 
There'll be time enough to say
Why I ruined a good thing
