This is ponderous, man, really ponderous
I had this dream the other night
I went to work one day
And nobody remembered who I was
So, I decided to take the day off
On my way out
I run into my boss and he says
Hey, you look familiar
I said, thanks, people say that
A lot in these dreams
Then the horns kicked in
And my shoes started to squeak
Then all of a sudden
I'm standing on a beach
In some tropical part of the world
And there's this sign that says
'Aren't you supposed to be at work'
Sort of screamed out at me
Then I remembered
I'd been here in other dreams
But usually there was a water polo game
And a girl who could talk with her eyes
And she'd say
'Can you see what I'm saying'
Then the horns kicked in
And my shoes started to squeak
Before I knew it
I was walking near a lake
When a phone rings
And the operator speaks to me
In a language I don't understand
Oom papachucka maka nanu singow
Meling kapalana wani domo chingpow
Heddy kapalua cuma jenising tea
Oomama chucka pana one is now three
Then the horns kicked in
And my shoes started to squeak
Before long, I was coming up
On this really weird part of my dream
You know, the part where
I know how to tap dance
But I can only do it
While wearing golf shoes
Now, I'm back on the beach
Walking with this girl
Who talks with her eyes
This time she says
'I think you see what I'm saying'
Then just before I woke up
It started to rain in Southern California
Oom papachucka maka nanu singow
Meling kapalana wani domo chingpow
Heddy kapalua cuma jenising tea
Oomama chucka pana one is now three
A girl who could talk with her eyes
'Can you see what I'm saying'
Aren't you supposed to be at work
This is ponderous, man, really ponderous
