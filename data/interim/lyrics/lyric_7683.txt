When I first came to the city
I had a twenty dollar bill in my jeans
And I thought that I must be in heaven
'Cause I found the little girl of my dreams, yeah
I was just new in the city now
And she was so young and pretty now
She showed me a brand new world
Oh Sally, Sally was a good time girl
Well, I showed her all of my money
And she showed me a real good time
I mean I took her out, she took me in
Oh Sally was a friend of mine
Well I was just new in the city now
And she was so young and pretty now
She showed me a brand new world
Oh Sally yeah, Sally was a good time girl
Hey yeah, alright, hey
Well, it turns out Sally had a roommate
And Sally's roommate had a gun
Well, he look like he might've played football
Hell, sure glad he couldn't run 
Last time I saw Sally
Well, it wasn't any time for goodbyes
But I know that I'll remember
Oh Sally was a friend of mine, yeah
Well I was just new in the city now
And she was so young and pretty now
She showed me a brand new world
Oh Sally, Sally was a good time
Sally, hey, sally
Oh Sally was a good time girl
Sally, hey now 
I'll always remember 
Sally was a good time
Sally, talking 'bout Sally, yeah 
Sally was a good time
Sally was a good time
Sally was a good time girl
