Know what I'm sayin'?
Fuck what y'all niggas doin'
What you got goin' on, what's happenin'?
Yeah, know what I'm sayin'?
Real niggas in this mothafucka, mane
Hell yeah, y'all niggas lame as hell
Y'all niggas, man, know what I'm sayin'?
Hey!
Ain't no complaints 
Racks in the bank 
Fuck what you think 
We got some rank 
Leave your ass stank 
Robbin' the bank 
Pull out the banger 
You was a stranger 
We don't relate 
Racks in the... 
Racks in the safe 
Steak on my plate 
My sons are Dons 
My bitch Amazon 
My plug is hund 
She fuckin' for some 
I wanna be like Muhammad Ali 
Hang on the ropes and I beat you to sleep 
Taught to get money 'cause talk is too cheap 
Quarter million when you open my brief
Celebrity status so keep this shit brief 
Draco by me 'cause I keep it in reach
Know niggas didn't do that shit like that boy Meech 
That's word on the street, let me preach, let me preach 
Listen, lil' nigga, sometimes you don't speak
Pull out that stick and I'm sweepin' the street 
I make a quarter million every week 
She sucked out my soul, it's makin' me weak 
I've been on Percocets for the last week 
Sippin' on lean, I'm sleep, geeked 
Move out the way, beep, beep 
Quit ridin' the waves, the sea deep 
Ain't no complaints 
Racks in the bank 
Fuck what you think 
We got some rank 
Leave your ass stank 
Robbin' the bank 
Pull out the banger 
You was a stranger 
We don't relate 
Racks in the... 
Racks in the safe 
Steak on my plate 
My sons are Dons 
My bitch Amazon 
My plug is hund 
She fuckin' for some
At 17, I wanted everything that was in store
At 23, I bought it all just to make sure, yeah, yeah
Fuck a delay 
They gotta pay 
Like it's back in the day 
Racks in the 
Racks in the safe 
Look at my face 
Up there with the greats 
Steps that I take
You can't retrace 
Young Metro on bass 
Me, I'm just based 
Can't afford no mistakes
Everything just in case
Billboard where I play
They welcome me, I overstay
I'm a huncho, I'm the boss
My set takin' off
Polo used to be Lacoste
Water used to be the tap, nigga, not the Voss
Damn, things changed 
I'm so awake 
You take the bait 
You get replaced
You do the math, nigga
On 88 dates 
The take-home was crazy
I take home your baby, yeah!
Ain't no complaints 
Racks in the bank 
Fuck what you think 
We got some rank 
Leave your ass stank 
Robbin' the bank 
Pull out the banger 
You was a stranger 
We don't relate 
Racks in the... 
Racks in the safe
