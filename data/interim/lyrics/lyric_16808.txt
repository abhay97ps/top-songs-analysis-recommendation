I was made in England
Out of Cadillac muscle
I had a quit-me father
I had a love-me mother
I had Little Richard
And that black piano
Oh, that sweet Georgia Peach
And the boy from Tupelo
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
I was made in England
Out of Cadillac muscle
Face down on a playground
Crying, 'God, send me a brother'
Not a bloody nose
For rock 'n' roll
Give me that sweet Georgian Peach
And the boy from Tupelo
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Yeah!
I was made in England
Like a blue Cortina
But a Yankee summer
Had a way about her
You had a scent for scandal
Well here's my middle finger
I had forty years of pain
And nothing to cling to
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
If you're made in England
You're built to last
You can still say 'homo'
And everybody laughs
But the joke's on you
You never read the song
They all think they know
But they've all got it wrong
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England 
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Yeah!
I
Was
Made
In
England!
I
Was
Made
In
England!
I
Was
Made
In
England!
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, oh
Oh
I was made in England
Whoa, rock on, boy, yeah
Hey
