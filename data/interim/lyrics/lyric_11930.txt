Strolling down the lane at midnight
Old fashioned love
Steal a little kiss in the moonlight
Old fashioned love
You’re the love of my life
The girl of my dreams
I count on you
You can count on me
We got an old fashioned love
It’s so hard to find
This one of a kind
Old fashioned love
Gotta be true to each other
Old fashioned love
Never hurt one another
Old fashioned love
Just like in the movies
But we’re not pretending
Always and forever
Our love’s one happy ending
We got an old fashioned love
It’s so hard to find
This one of a kind
Old fashioned love
