Chorus:
You gotta lick it 
Before we kick it 
You gotta take that extra step so we can kick it 
Alternate Chorus:
You gotta lick it 
Before we kick it 
You gotta get it soft and wet so we can kick it 
Chorus
Boom  
Baby work it
I met a real cutie
He had a nice tight booty
He semed to be the frequent lover type
Let's cut right through the chase
Come on and get a taste
You've got to face it so that I can get high
Chorus 
Boom  
Baby work it
My lips are sweet as candy 
I need a man that's handy 
Don't be a tease
Just give me what I like
I'm full of freakiness
So come and get with this 
And make me purr 
So we can do this right
Chorus 
Boom  
Baby work it
You know men are dogs
So go bark up someone else's tree
Here boy!
Come and get it
Chorus 
Boom  
Baby work it
