She got the call today
One out of the grey
And when the smoke cleared
It took her breath away
She said she didn't believe
It could happen to me
I guess were all one phone call from our knees
We're gonna get there soon
If every building falls
And all the stars fade
We'll still be singing this song
The one they can't take away
We're gonna get there soon
She's gonna be there too
Cryin' in her room
Prayin' Lord come through
We're gonna get there soon
Oh, it's your light
Oh, it's your way
Pull me out of the dark
Just to show me the way
Cryin' out now
From so far away
You pull me closer to love
Closer to love
Meet me once again
Down off Lake Michigan
Where we could feel the storm blowing down with the wind
And don't apologize
For all the tears you've cried
You've been way too strong now for all your life
We're gonna get there soon
She's gonna be there too
Cryin' in her room
Prayin' Lord come through
We're gonna get there soon
Oh, it's your light
Oh, it's your way
Pull me out of the dark
Just to show me the way
Cryin' out now
From so far away
You pull me closer to love
Closer to love
'Cause you are all that I've waited for
For all of my life 
'Cause you are all that I've waited for
For all of my life
Closer to love
Closer to love
Closer to love
Pull me closer to love
Closer to love, oh no
Closer to love
Closer to love, oh yeah
Pull me closer to love
