I've got someone to take...
You know the night time is the right time
To be with the one you love
With the one you love, with the one you love
Oh, my darling, ainâ€™t you better I think enough
You know the night time, yeah, yeah, is the right time
To be with the one you love
With the one you love, you, darling 
Baby, baby 
Baby 
Walk to me there 
You know I love you
You know I love you
Now hold me tight
I'll make everything alright
Because the night time, you know is the right time
To be with the one you love
I want it one more time, darling!
Please me 
Please me 
Please me 
Oh, please me 
Oh, baby! 
Take my hand 
I don't need 
That I know, babe 
That the night time, you know is the right time 
To be with the one you love 
I say it right, yeah 
With the one you love
With the one you love
With the one you love
With the one you love
With the one you love, with the one you love 
With the one you love...
With the one you love...
