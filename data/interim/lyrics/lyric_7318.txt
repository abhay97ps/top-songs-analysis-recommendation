I used to live in the country, brought up by the old folks' rules;
My pa was a preaching pastor, and my ma taught Sunday school...
I was told about devilish people who lived just to do no good;
All I knew was my religion, and how to serve the best I could...
I always knew about the son of evil - could lead a woman to no good...
Mm-hmm...
He used to get me from the church window, telling me I wouldn't be missed
Promising we'd just hold hands, and maybe just one little kiss...
It was hard on me, backsliding - I'm disowned by my family
But I'd do it all over again, that's how good it is to me...
But now, I'm the daughter of evil, and I'm trying to get you up in heah, up in heah...
Oh, up in heah, up in heah...
Up in heah!  Oh, up in heah... 
Up in heah!  Oh, oh... 
It's hard on you when you leave home, and your people say you're on your own
When you're walkin' in the streets, and you haven't a meal all week...
Oh! Oh, oh...
Oh, up in heah!  Up in heah... 
It's cold on this path of evil - the dew falls heavy and hard;
While I wait at bars and grills, commercial love, commercial thrill...
But I remember the righteous living, and doing all I knew for good;
If I could change this corruption, you know I would if I only could...
But now, now, I'm the daughter of evil, and I'm trying to get you up in heah, up in heah....
Oh, up in heah... 
Up in heah!  Oh, up in heah... 
Up in heah!  Oh, oh... 
Up in heah, up in heah, oh, up in heah... 
Woo, up in heah!  Up in heah... 
Oh! Oh, oh, oh...
