Dear Dad, don't get mad, what I'm asking for
Is by the next semester can I get another car?
This one here is sickning on a wide dual road
I might as well be walking as to drive this old Ford
Almost every time I try to go and pass a truck
If I ain't going downhill, Dad, I'm, out of luck
And even if I get by it's still a rugged risk
The way this old Ford keep a hitting and a miss
Last week when I was driving on my way to school
I almost got a ticket about a freeway traffic rule
It's now a violation driving under forty-five
And if I push to fifty this here Ford will nosedive
Dad, I'm in great danger out here trying to drive
The way this Ford wiggles when I'm approaching forty-five
I have to nurse it along like a little stubborn pup
And cars whizzing by me, Dad, look like I'm backing up
She just don't have the appetite for gas somehow
And Dad, I got four carburetors hooked up on it now
I tried to hook another to see if it'd do a little good
But isn't no place to put it unless I perforate the hood
So Dad, send the money, see what I can see
Try to find a Cadillac, a sixty-two or three
Just something that won't worry us to keep it on the road
Sincerely, your beloved son, Henry Junior Ford
