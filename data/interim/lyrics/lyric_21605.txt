I'm riding in your car
You turn on the radio
You're pulling me close
I just say no
I say I don't like it
But you know I'm a liar
Cause when we kiss
Ooh, fire
 fire
Late at night
Ooh
You're taking me home
You say you wanna stay 
{I say I} wanna be alone
I say I don't love you
But you know I'm a liar
Cause when we kiss
Ooh, fire
Fire
You had a hold on me right from the start
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin', actin' like a fool
Your kisses, they burn
But my heart stays cool
Well, Romeo and Juliet
Samson and Delilah
Oh, baby, you can bet
A love they couldn't deny
My words they say split 
But my words may lie 
Cause when we kiss
Ooh, fire
 fire
You had a hold on me right from the start
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin', actin' like a fool
Your kisses they burn
But my heart stays cool
Fire
 Fire
{Woah, ooh} Fire
 what you're doin' now, fire
 {Touchin' me}
Touchin' me, burnin' me
Take me home
Fire
{Woah, ooh}
Fire
