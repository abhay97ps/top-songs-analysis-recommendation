Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it 
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted 
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
It's the last time I let you hurt me
Fuck you, goodbye, I did not deserve it
None of this bullshit was ever really worth it
You blame me like I know I ain't perfect
I tried with you, and I lied for you
Many times, put my life on the line for you
I really wanted to get it right with you
I always saw the better side of you
And now it's fuck you for life
I'm doin' better, you right
I was wrong 'bout you, I guess I finally realized
You brought the dark to my light
I'm with a new one tonight
But there is one last thing I want to tell you tonight
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it 
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted 
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
Wait, that was a lie
Because I cannot erase you like eternal sunshine in a spotless mind
Red in the eyes, lately I've been on a cocaine diet
I've been tryin' to feed my high
Your things are still in the box that you left in the bedroom
You'll leave, and I'm here
With no heart, guess I'll be dead soon
Ghost in a shell, stoned like a cemetery
Scars don't heal, I got these in February
Broke your spell, love is only temporary
Highway to hell, I'm hangin' out the roof, yellin'
Fuck you, goodbye 
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it 
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted 
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
