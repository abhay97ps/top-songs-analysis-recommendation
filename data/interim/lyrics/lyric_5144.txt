Well, they’re dancing on the ceiling, they’re dancing on the floor
Come on baby we’re coming through the door
They know it’s party going on
Gonna dance and romance all night long
I know it’s cold outside
Come on in I’ll keep you satisfied
All you gotta do is move 
Every time you feel the groove
Ain’t nothing but a party 
Ain’t nothing but a house party 
Ain’t nothing but a party, baby 
Ain’t nothing but a house party 
Come on dig that revelous soul
I know you’re gonna lose control
You can do the boogaloo
Anything that you wanna do
I know it’s cold outside
Come on in I’ll keep you satisfied
All you gotta do is move 
Every time you feel the groove
Ain’t nothing but a party 
Ain’t nothing but a house party 
Ain’t nothing but a party, baby 
Ain’t nothing but a house party 
 I know it’s cold outside 
Come on in I’ll keep you satisfied
All you gotta do is move 
Every time you feel the groove
Ain’t nothing but a party 
Ain’t nothing but a house party 
Ain’t nothing but a party, baby 
Ain’t nothing but a house party
