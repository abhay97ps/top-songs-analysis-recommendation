H-h-however much I push it down
It's never enough
H-h-however much I push it around
It's never enough
H-h-however much I make it out
It's never enough, never enough
H-h-however much I do
H-h-however big I ever feel
It's never enough
Whatever I do to make it real
It's never enough
In any way I try to speak
It's never enough, never enough
However much I try to speak
It's never enough
However much I'm falling down
It's never enough
However much I'm falling out
It's never enough
Whatever smile I smile the most
It's never enough, never enough
However I smile I smile the most
So let me hold it up, just one more go
Holding it up for just once more
One more time to fill it up, one more time to kill
Whatever I do is never enough
It's never enough
So let me hold it up, just one more go
Holding it up for just once more
One more time to fill it up, one more time to kill
Whatever I do is never enough
It's never enough
So let me hold it up, just one more go
Holding it up for just once more
One more time to fill it up, one more time to kill
Whatever I do is never enough
It's never enough
