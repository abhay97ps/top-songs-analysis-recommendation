I just want to tell you all the things you are
And all the things you mean to me
When I find myself believing there's no place to go
When I feel the loneliness inside my heart
You're the answer to my prayer
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need to know
Tonight...
Life is just a moment, we're blowing in the wind
We're trying to find a friend
And only time can tell us if we win or if we lose
And who will stand beside us
When there's darkness all around me, you're the light I see
When I need someone to ease my troubled mind
You're the answer to my prayer
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need to know
Oh, tonight
Oh, you're my angel, aha
All I need tonight
You're my angel 
You're the answer to my prayer
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, my miracle
You're all I need to know
Tonight 
You're all I need tonight
All I need tonight
You're all I need to know
Oh, you're my angel
My angel, my, my, my, my, my angel
My angel, my angel
