If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't want it
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, don't want it
Think about it all the time
Thinking only makes me smile
And say, hey
I don't wanna shake it
I love the love you're making
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't want it
If there's a remedy
I'll run from it, run from it
Think about it all the time
Never let it out of my mind
'Cause I love you
Got the sweetest hangover
Sweetest hangover, yeah
I don't wanna get
I don't wanna get
I don't wanna get over
I don't wanna get over
I don't wanna get over
I don't wanna get over
I don't need a cure for this
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it, don't need it
I've got a love hangover
I've got a love hangover
I've got a love hangover
'Cause if there's a cure for this
I don't want it, oh, baby
If there's a cure for this
I don't need it, oh
Don't need no doctor
Don't need no lawyer
Don't need no preacher
Don't need no teacher
Don't need no doctor
Don't need no lawyer
Don't need no preacher
Don't need no teacher
Don't need no doctor
Don't need no lawyer
Don't need no preacher
Don't need no teacher
Don't need no doctor
Don't need no lawyer
Don't need no preacher
Don't need no teacher
I think about all the while
'Cause you're the only one
That makes me smile
You've got me shaking
Ooh, sweet love you're making
Ooh, love me, love me, baby
Ooh, love me, love me, sweet baby
Love me, oh, oh
I've got a love hangover
The sweetest hangover
Well, well, well, well, well
