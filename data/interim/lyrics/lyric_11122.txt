I told myself when you smiled at me
This time it's gonna be forever
I didn't know you would hurt me so
But from the very start
You are the one who would break my heart
'Cause I was looking for someone to love
And, oh, the heartaches I found
I was looking for someone to love
But you were just looking around
You led me on pretendin' you could care
Promisin' the love we'd share together
I've closed the door, I can't take it anymore
Love will never be the same
You turned it around, and you made it a game
'Cause I was looking for someone to love
And, oh, the heartaches I found
I was looking for someone to love
But you were just looking around
