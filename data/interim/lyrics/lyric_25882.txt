Yeah, like that
Okay, yeah
Say, bro,  where you get them from?
Detroit?  That machine gun, spray boy
And it's gon' hit some
New coupe?  Been whippin' 'em
New boobs?  Where you get them done?
Payroll , might put you on a table
And spread you out like some Yayo 
No, bitch , you don't know shit 
You just want all my money, ah
I was hopeless , now I'm focused 
Where the fuck is the party at?
Now hold this , oh shit 
That's it , so sick 
No shit 
Damn, I'm  getting too fuckin' old for this 
But still as explosive with, just load the clip
Two pistols on hip, both are gripped
I hold them at shoulder width
Took a stab in the dark and broke the tip
Of my knife off, but your throat is slit
'Cause I'm cutthroat to the utmost with it
The ultimate
I just let the poker chips fall where they were supposed to fit
Now those days are over, scrapin' change in sofas
Tryna save at Kroger 
So why would I give a fuck about backstabbin' Trader Joe for?
How 'bout that, I'm paid as Oprah
Think I may have broke the scale
'Cause the wait is over
But wait, wait, hold up, 'cause they say I almost
I almost lost it
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah 
You almost got me 
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah 
You almost , you almost , you almost , but I got it 
You almost , you almost , you almost , I got it 
So sit there and act pathetic and sulk
'Cause I'm getting green, Incredible Hulk
'Cause I usually get it in bulk
But I still will stomp your head to a pulp 
You want smoke, I got the tical like Method Man
So get ready to die from second hand
Get a whiff of the doctor's medicine
Like sedatives you'll get popped, Excedrin
'Cause you can get it like over the counter 
Like I just left the damn concession stand 
A mic in my hand's a weapon 
I put that on everything like ranch, I'll never land
I'm too fly, I don't plan to ever Cinderella Man
What I am is better than
Every single one of you
Whether separate or all of you band together
And I put the game on the pill 
Now my Shady babies are all stillborns
Meaning abortions that live 'cause they were still born
I can heal 'em with Neosporin
You 'bout to experience euphoria
 true warrior, got the plug like Trugoy
Give me the cue like I'm ScHoolboy
And I'll treat the beat like a pitbull would do to a chew toy and destroy it, 'cause, boy, I
I almost lost it
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah 
You almost got me 
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah 
You almost , you almost , you almost , but I got it 
You almost , you almost , you almost , I got it
