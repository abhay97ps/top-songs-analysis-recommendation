From Atlanta, Georgia
To the Gulf Stream water
Up to Califor-ni-ay
I'm gonna spend my life a-both a-night and day
And say
Hey, you know it's alright, child, now
Gimme, gimme good lovin' make it alright
To the girl in 'Frisco
To the girls in New York
To the girls in Texarkan'
You gotta understand that baby I'm your man
And say
Hey, you know it's alright, now, now
Hey, you know it's alright, now, child
Hey, you know it's alright, child, now
