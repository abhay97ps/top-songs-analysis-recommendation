I'm lost in your love
Drowning in you
I'm North and I'm South
And I'm way overdue
I'm under your spell
And I'm in way over my head
I'm losing my way
Lost in your love
I'm lost in your love
Eyes open wide
Don't know where I am
But I'm all for the ride
I'm head over heels
I can't tell left from my right
I'm losing my way
Lost in your love
Ooh lost in your love
I see but I don't know I'm seeing
I speak I don't know what I say
I hear I don't know what I'm hearing
I'm lost in a maze
And I can't find the way
I'm lost in your love
Drownin' in you
Ooh lost in your love
Lost in your love
Lost in your love
