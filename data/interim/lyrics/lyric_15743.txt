Gimme the track
Stop
Everybody on the floor
Just pause
Somebody in the middle
Just move
Get on down to the groove
 Brown
The brand new brother in town
Yeah, boy, dope sound 
Smooth
A brother that's so damn cool
Never get played for a fool
Now it's my turn to rule
Bad like Michael Jackson ever had
(Yeah, Doo Doo don't
Sport no Jheri Curl juice
Yo, Doo Doo, tell 'em what you're all about)
Don't drink Pepsi, always Coke
That's right, dope 
Yo, Doo Doo, man, what you got for me now
Summertime
Chilling outside in the dope Jeep
Four or five cuties in the backseat
Homeboys trying to get a peep
Rolling deep
Clean
Dope system kickin'
Ladies in the back
With the popsicle lickin'
Buffed up wax back
Armor All down
Tell him, homie
Who's in town
The dance
Something that will
Put you in a trance
Now it's your turn to
Take a chance
You're rolling, Doo Doo
You're rolling
Let's dance
Enormous, enormous
Enormous, enormous.....
Brown
The brand new brother in town
Smooth
A brother that's so damn cool
Never get played for a fool
Now it's my turn to rule
Don't sweat it
If your body wants to do it
Just let it
(Here we go, here we go
Let's take it to the bridge)
And once you think
You've had enough
Yo, we have Doo Doo Brown
In the house live
Any y'all wanna talk to him
You can reach him at
1-900-976-Doo Doo
Two dollars for the first minute
Twenty five dollars
For each additional minute
You know why
'Cause we rolling like that
1991, We in effect
We coming on the raw scene
With the funky joe beat
You play Doo Doo short
You get busted
And let me tell you something
If you fly builder think you down
And not really down 
You gets none
And, yo, For you homeboys
That think you're all that
And trying to get with this
Act like a tennis shoe
And just do it
 peace
