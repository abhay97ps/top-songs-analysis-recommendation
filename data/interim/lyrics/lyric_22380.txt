Made a wrong turn once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss "No way it's all good"
It didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessin'
Underestimated
Look, I'm still around
Pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
Pretty pretty please, if you ever ever feel like you're nothing
You are perfect to me
You're so mean 
When you talk 
About yourself, you were wrong
Change the voices 
In your head 
Make them like you instead
So complicated, look how big you'll make it
Filled with so much hatred
Such a tired game
It's enough, I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons
See you do the same
Ohh
Pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
Pretty pretty please, if you ever ever feel like you're nothing
You are perfect
The whole world's scared, so I 
The only thing I should be drinking is an 
So cool in line, and we 
But we , and it's a 
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're 
They don't like my jeans, they don't 
Strange ourselves, and we 
 Why do I do that?
Why do I do that?
Yeah, ohh...
Oh pretty, pretty please
Pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
Pretty pretty please, if you ever ever feel like you're nothing
You are perfect to me
Yeah, you're perfect
You're perfect, to me
Pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel like you're nothing
You are perfect to me
