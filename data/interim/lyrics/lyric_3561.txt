Well, my friends that's what I am
That's what I am, her yesterday man
Please tell me something have you met an angel
Someone too lovely to live on earth
Well, yesterdeay I thought I met an angel but
She wasn't worth all she seemed to be worth
And, oh, what a fool I have been
I was sure taken in
Yeah, I'm her yesterday man
Well, my friends that's what I am
I'm her yesterday man
Well, my friends that's what I am
That's what I am, her yesterday man
There's some of the good kind and some of the bad kind
Some of the others are in between
But all that I can say she is the worst kind
Well, I think you know what I mean
And yet in spite all that I say
I'd take her back any day
Now I'm her yesterday man
Well, my friends that's what I am
I'm her yesterday man
Well, my friends that's what I am
That's what I am, her yesterday man
Oh, come a little closer, baby

You gonna leave me, you leave me
I know that, I know that
I know that, I know that
I know, I know...
