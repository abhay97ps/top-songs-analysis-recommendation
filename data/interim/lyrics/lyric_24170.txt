Bathroom stalls for the powder nose 
High heel shoes with the open toes 
She's got a good time wrapped in gold  
For you, for you
All red dress with the devil eyes 
So obsessed with the camera lights 
You love her, but you can't deny 
The truth, the truth
She loves everybody
Can't you tell by the signs?
She loves everybody
She gets off all the time
It's a dark philosophy
And it haunts her constantly
It's a false alarm to me
She's a false alarm
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
Six inch long, 'bout three inch wide 
Dolla', dolla' bill is her only type 
You love her, but you'll never be 
The one, the one
Diamonds and the rings are her fantasy 
She chase hearts with the Hennessy 
You love her, but you'll never be 
Enough, enough
She loves everybody
Can't you tell by the signs?
She loves everybody
She gets off all the time
It's a dark philosophy
And it haunts her constantly
She's a false alarm to me
She's a false alarm
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
She always leaves the man she loves
But the diamonds are forever
She always seems to be alone
But the diamonds make it better
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm
