Two doors down, they're laughing and drinkin'
And having a party two doors down
They're not aware that I'm around
But I here I am crying my heart out, feeling sorry
They're having a party two doors down
I think I'll dry these useless tears and get myself together
I think I'll wander down the hall and have a look around
'Cause I can't stay inside this lonely room and cry forever
I think I'd really rather join 'em two door down, yeah
Two doors down, they're laughing and drinkin'
And having a party two doors down
They're not aware that I'm around
Here I am, no longer crying and feeling sorry
They're having a party two doors down
I can't believe I'm standing here, dry-eyed, all smiles and talking
Making conversation with the new love I have found
I asked him if he'd like to be alone and we start walkin'
Down the hall to my place waiting two doors down, yeah
Two doors down, they're laughing and drinkin'
And having a party two doors down
We're not aware that they're around
But I here I am feeling everything but sorry
We're having our own party two doors down
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Two doors down
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Two doors down
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Two doors down
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Two doors down, oh
Two doors down, they're laughing and drinkin'
And having a party two doors down
We're not aware that they're around
Here we are feelin' everything but sorry
We're having our own party two doors down
Two doors down, they're laughing and drinkin'
And having a party two doors down
We're not aware that they're around
Here we are feelin' everything but sorry
We're having our own party two doors down
