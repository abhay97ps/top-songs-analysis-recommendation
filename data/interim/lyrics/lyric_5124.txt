You're the cause of my condition baby
My life is in your hands
You're the Doctor and I'm the patient baby
Why don't you help me if you can
I'm gonna' leave you now
You're my last go 'round
Cold blood don't put me down
Love reaction can pick me up
Why don't you lend your tender touch
I got to have it now
Stand there, shakin' yo' head ooh baby
Ease on away from my bed
That girl's gonna' die if you can't fight it
A note to yourself, you're the victim now
Pick me up
Pick me up
Pick me up
Ooh pick me up now
What have you got to lose
Only a few words will save one life
Don't walk out that door
I can feel my heart going slow
If you move one step further
You can pull the covers
Life is lost without another
Pick me up
Mmm, Hmm...Help me, don't leave me baby
Come on, wanna' do it again, More
Mmm, hmmm, come on Mr. MD. Help Me
