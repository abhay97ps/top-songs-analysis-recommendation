I don't know why you're mean to me
When I call on the telephone
And I don't know what you mean to me
But I want to turn you on, turn you up, figure you out
I wanna take you on
These words, "You will be mine"
These words, "You will be mine", all the time
The fool might be my middle name
But I'd be foolish not to say
I'm going to make whatever it takes
Bring you up, call you down, sign your name, secret love
Make it rhyme, take you in, and make you mine
These words, "You will be mine"
These words, "You will be mine," all the time, oh
I tripped and fell, did I fall
What I want to feel, I want to feel it now
And now with love come strange currencies
And here is my appeal
I need a chance, a second chance, a third chance, a fourth chance
A word, a signal, a nod, a little breath
Just to fool myself, to catch myself, to make it real, real
These words, "You will be mine"
These words, "You will be mine," all the time, oh
These words, "You will be mine"
These words, they haunt me, hunt me down, catch in my throat, make me pray
Say, love's confined, oh
