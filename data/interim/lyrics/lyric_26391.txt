Oh, yeah
Wake up in my bed, I just wanna have a good day 
Think it in my head, then it happens how it should, ayy
Twelve o'clock, I got a team meeting, then a meditation at like 1:30
Then I ride to the studio listening to some shit I wrote 
Good karma, my aesthetic 
Keep my conscience clear, that's why I'm so magnetic
Manifest it , I finessed it 
Take my pen and write some love letters to Heaven
Just like magic , just like magic 
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it
Just like magic , I'm attractive 
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it 
Looking at my phone, but I'm tryna disconnect it 
Read a fuckin' book, I be tryna stay connected 
Say it's tricky at the top, gotta keep a slim ego for a thick wallet
Losing friends left and right, but I just send 'em love and light 
Good karma, my aesthetic 
Keep my conscience clear, that's why I'm so magnetic
Manifest it , I finessed it 
Take my pen and write some love letters to Heaven
Just like magic, just like magic
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it 
Just like magic, I'm attractive
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it
I don't wanna waste your time on some dumb shit
Password to your phone, you can miss me with that shit
Redesign your brain, we gon' make some new habits
Just like magic , just like magic
Just like magic , just like magic 
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it
Just like magic , I'm attractive 
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it 
Mmm, mmm 
Mmm-oh, yeah
Mmm, yeah, mmm
