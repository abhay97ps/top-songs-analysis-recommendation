I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it
I, I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it
I, I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it
Feels so good being bad 
There's no way I'm turning back 
Now the pain is my pleasure, 'cause nothing could measure
Love is great, love is fine 
Out the box, outta line 
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
Na-na-na-na, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, I like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, I like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, I like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, I like it
Just one night full of sin
Feel the pain on your skin
Tough, I don't scream mercy
It's your turn to hurt me
Yeah
If I'm bad, tie me down
Shut me up, gag and bound me
Cause the pain is my pleasure
Nothing comes better
Yeah
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
Na-na-na-na, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, I like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, I like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, I like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, I like it
S-S-S and M-M-M
S-S-S and M-M-M
Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say ah, ah, ah
I like it, like it
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
Na-na-na-na, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, I like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, I like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, I like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, I like it
S-S-S and M-M-M
S-S-S and M-M-M
S-S-S and M-M-M
S-S-S and M-M-M
