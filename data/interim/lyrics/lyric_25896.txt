Well turn that bottle up and drink it, crank that jukebox up and Hank it
Bartender, pour another round
Here's to our best bad decisions, situation no conditions
Oh, and memories we all need to drown
So, fill your cup and raise it up
Jump in and join the club
And float this whiskey river reservoir
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar
'Cause up in here you're not the only loved and left her
Lost and lonely one who's ever swam against the tide
Thinkin' this is your oasis, it's the safest of the places
That a broken heart can find to hide
So, here's a toast coast to coast
With a big old adios
To wishes wasted on them fallin' stars
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar
Yeah it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
For some barstool believers wear our heart out on our sleevers
Just goin' where the neon glows
Yeah, it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
Yeah, we're just never quite belongers, hanger on-ers way too longers
Just buzzin' where the neon glows
Problems, we all got 'em
Let 'em sink down to the bottom
Doesn't matter who or where you are
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end
The water's fine, y'all, so just come on in
To the deep end of a dive bar
Of this dive bar
Talkin' 'bout a dive bar
