Love has a strange way of finding out
Everything in your heart
Strangest of all is you never know
Just what it is that's tearing you apart
Seasons may pass, summers come and go
Dreams flashing through your mind
Love is something that you dream about
Something that you left behind
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home
Time has a strange way of reaching out
The years turn to yesterday
Reach out a hand, try to grab the past
Stop it all slipping away
Happens to you almost anywhere
A flash before the storm
Just reach out a hand, try to touch her face
Only to find she is gone
Just like I told you again
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home
Never known love burn so bright
Little girl could have been so right
We could have been so happy
I won't be there
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home
Love has a strange way of turning round
When happiness turns to pain
Something that you thought you had has gone
And somehow things will never be the same
That hurt gets so bad as the days go by
A hurt that no drug can cure
There's only one thing that can satisfy
There's only one thing I'm longing for
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home
Better run home girl as fast as you can
Come home girl while you still can
Run home girl as fast as you can
Because someone's gonna be waiting
When you get home
