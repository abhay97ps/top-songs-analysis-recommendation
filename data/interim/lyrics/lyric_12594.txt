I don't ask for paradise
Just face it on my own
It won't mean a thing to me
If I go there alone
They promised us we'd have a chance
That's all we're hoping for
A lucky break is all we're due
We can't wait any more
And if we make the right moves
If we make all the right moves
We can show them all
There's no way that we can lose
And if we make the right moves
If we make all the right moves
We can show them all
There's no way that we can lose
Oh, look beyond these small town streets
And see the world out there
Oh anyone can carve their own
If they only care
There's more for us than givin' in
And only getting by
They say we're gonna sink or swim
But we intend to fly
And if we make the right moves
If we make all the right moves
We can show them all
There's no way that we can lose
If we make the right moves
If we make all the right moves
We can show them all
There's no way that we can lose
Say we're gonna sink or swim
But we intend to fly
And if we make the right moves
If we make all the right moves
We can show them all
There's no way that we can lose
If we make the right moves
If we make all the right moves
We can show them all
There's no way that we can lose
If we make the right moves
If we make all the right moves
We can show them all
There's no way that we can lose
If we make the right moves
If we make all the right moves
We can show them all
There's no way that we can lose
