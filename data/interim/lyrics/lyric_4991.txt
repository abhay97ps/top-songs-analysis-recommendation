If this world were mine
I'd place at your feet all that I own
You've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees
For with your love inside me, that would be all I need
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything
If this world were mine, I'd make you a king
With wealth untold, you could have anything
If this world were mine
I'd give you each day so sunny and blue
If you wanted the moonlight, I'd give you that too
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything
Oh baby, you're my consolation
And there's no hesitation
When you want me, honey, just call me
And honey, you're my inspiration
And I feel so much sensation
When I'm in your arms, when you squeeze me
Whoa oh oh oh
Every sky would be blue
As long as you're loving me
Whoa oh oh oh
With you here in my arms
Life is so wonderful
Whoa oh oh oh
Give me pretty loving, baby
Give me pretty loving, honey
Keep on loving me
Whoa oh oh oh
You know I need you, baby
Really, really need you, honey
Keep on loving me
