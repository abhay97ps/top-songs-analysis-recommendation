There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home, yeah
Seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change
Was it something I said
To make you turn away?
To make you walk out and leave me cold?
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
Right now
I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face 
But the truth remains, you're
Gone
You're gone
Baby, you're gone
Girl, you're gone
Baby girl, you're gone
You're gone
You're
Now I don't wanna make excuses, baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone
No, no
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know?
The time is passing so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
And maybe I could change my every day
But baby, I don't want to
So I'll just hang around
And find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you
And I know in my heart
You can't say that you don't love me too
Please say you do, yeah, yeah
I've been sitting here 
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains, you're
Gone
You're gone
You're gone
You're gone
You're gone
You're gone
Oh-oh-oh
What will I do 
If I can't be with you?
Tell me where will I turn to?
Baby, who will I be?
Now that we are apart
Am I still in your heart?
Baby, why don't you see
That I need you here with me?
Oh oh oh oh, oh!
I've been sitting here 
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains, you're
I've been sitting here 
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane 
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains, you're
Gone
You're gone
You're gone
You're gone
Baby girl, you're gone
You're gone
But the truth remains, you're...
