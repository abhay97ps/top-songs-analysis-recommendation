Like sailing on a sailing ship to nowhere
Love took over my heart like an ocean breeze
As seagulls fly I knew that I was losing
Love was washed away with the drifting tide
Oh it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
It's got you laying up nights
Waiting for the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame
When you've got to take the blame for a love song
Because the best love songs
Are written with a broken heart
Now the tears in my eyes are ever blinding
The future that lies before me I cannot see
Although tomorrow I know the sun is rising
Lighting up the world for everyone but not for me
Oh it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
It's got you laying up nights
Waiting for the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame
When you've got to take the blame for a love song
Because the best love songs
Are written with a broken heart
Oh it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
It's got you laying up nights
Waiting for the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame
When you've got to take the blame for a love song
Because the best love songs
Are written with a broken heart
Oh it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
It's got you laying up nights
Waiting for the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame
When you've got to take the blame for a love song
Because the best love songs
Are written with a broken heart
