I look okay, but I'm not myself
Standing by the phone
Darling, I've been wondering
How I'm gonna let you go
You made me build you a perfect world
To keep you satisfied
But now you're just a broken dream
And when I get back my pride
You'll still be waiting for love
You'll still be waiting for the sun to rise
In the middle of the night
You'll still be waiting for love
I know you'll be waiting when that train passes by
You'll still be waiting for love
Like a dream, there's a lucky feeling
Coming from my soul
Girl, I guess I learned the truth
That you already know, oh
Took me a while to realize
It's a dark and lonely town
And you'll know where you'll find yourself
When the walls come tumbling down
You'll still be waiting for love
You'll still be waiting for the sun to rise
In the middle of the night
You'll still be waiting for love
I know you'll be waiting when that train passes by
You'll still be waiting for love
You'll still be waiting for the sun to shine
In the middle of the night
You'll still be waiting for love
I know you'll be waiting when that train passes by
You'll still be waiting for love
I lost my heart, I lost my mind
But it really doesn't matter
I'm gonna leave my tears behind
And you'll still be waiting
You made me build you a perfect world
And when I get back my pride
You'll still be waiting for love
You'll still be waiting for the sun to rise
In the middle of the night
You'll still be waiting for love
I know you'll be waiting when that train passes by
You'll still be waiting for love
You'll still be waiting for the sun to shine
In the middle of the night
You'll still be waiting for love
I know you'll be waiting when that train passes by
You'll still be waiting for love
Waiting for love
