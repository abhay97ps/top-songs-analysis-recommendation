Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Now if there's a smile on my face
It's only there tryin’ to fool the public
But when it comes down to foolin’ you
Now, honey, that's quite a different subject
But don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Really I'm sad 
Oh sadder than sad 
You're gone, and I'm hurtin' so bad 
Like a clown, I pretend to be glad 
Now there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than the tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby
Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride, I’ve tried
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you
Decided to go 
Oh I need you so 
I'm hurt and I want you to know 
But for others I put on a show 
Ooh oh
There's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than the tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah
Just like Pagliacci did 
I try to keep my sadness hid
Smiling in the public eye 
But in my lonely room I cry the tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby
Now if there's a smile on my face 
Don't let my glad expression 
Give you the wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear 
Make you think that I don't care
When really I'm sad 
Hurtin’ so bad
Cryin’...
