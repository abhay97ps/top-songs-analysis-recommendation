That yellow Lambo' outside for when I trapped in the sun
That green Ferrari sittin' outside when I couldn't make bond
I gave the plug to my nigga, I gave the game to my sons
Yeah
That yellow Lambo' outside for when I trapped in the sun 
That green Ferrari sittin' outside when I couldn't make bond 
I gave the plug to my nigga, I gave the game to my sons 
You need to learn the recipe, how to put a three on a one 
Like the plug to the socket, I'm connected 
I get bored, I might give away a necklace 
That yellow Lambo' outside for when I trapped in the sun 
That green Ferrari sittin' outside when I couldn't make bond
He wanna be a superstar, I bought him a magazine
For his birthday, got him a Glock, hold more than seventeen 
I been on Adderall, I been on gasoline
I had some Haitians with me, they off the pork and beans
I did new registration, I did some new Celine
They line up at the wolf doctor, actin' like some fiends
I microwave the pound, I never cut the lean
I got dope in my blood, it's full of promethazine
You need some molly in your drink to boost your self-esteem 
I'm in Amiri every day, say fuck them Levi jeans 
He wanna be a superstar, I bought him a magazine
I can't be a role model, 'cause I'm a trappin' king
That yellow Lambo' outside for when I trapped in the sun 
That green Ferrari sittin' outside when I couldn't make bond 
I gave the plug to my nigga, I gave the game to my sons 
You need to learn the recipe, how to put a three on a one 
Like the plug to the socket, I'm connected 
I get bored, I might give away a necklace 
That yellow Lambo' outside for when I trapped in the sun 
That green Ferrari sittin' outside when I couldn't make bond
I copped the Porsche and it made me more ambitious 
Got foreign cars in my driveway, I'm a misfit 
Pullin' up on foreign
Down bad, I was starvin' 
Had to buy me a carbine 
Livin' life the largest 
Tryna avoid these charges 
Don't know where your heart is 
Came out the 'partments 
You drownin', flawless 
Seven-figure endorsements 
Colored hair like Rodman 
I ain't come for bargainin' 
I'm doin' too marvelous 
Trapped out on the dead end 
Then the house, get lost in 
Pullin' off like a faucet 
Rolex with the outfit 
Count money with a passion 
Stretch it out like elastic 
Ball without no basket 
Bitch wrapped in plastic
That yellow Lambo' outside for when I trapped in the sun 
That green Ferrari sittin' outside when I couldn't make bond 
I gave the plug to my nigga, I gave the game to my sons 
You need to learn the recipe, how to put a three on a one 
Like the plug to the socket, I'm connected 
I get bored, I might give away a necklace 
That yellow Lambo' outside for when I trapped in the sun 
That green Ferrari sittin' outside when I couldn't make bond
That Lamborghini outside for when I trapped in the sun, yeah
