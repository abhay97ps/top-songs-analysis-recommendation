Cook that shit up, Quay
Trackhawk Jeep goes too fast 
I don't even wear no seatbelt 
Bad lil' bitch got no breasts 
Upgrade, now she got D-cups 
Hop out the Range, I'm glowin' 
Who is Lil Baby? He goin' in 
Man, these old rappers gettin' borin' 
They be takin' shots, I ignored 'em 
Send that pack to the hood while I'm tourin' 
Makin' plays out of town like I'm Jordan 
Need to go get your ho 'cause she whorin' 
If her ball come my way, I'ma score it 
Lamborghini, I don't want no Porsches 
I'm on fire, don't touch me, I'm scorchin' 
Had to fix all my teeth, I went porcelain 
Put the town on my back, I'm a horseman 
One more year, I'ma make it to Forbes' List 
They love me in the Bay like E-40 
I be sittin' exotic on Moreland 
Ain't no strings attached, keepin' it cordless 
She keep callin', but I keep ignorin' it 
Ain't no stoppin', I'm keepin' it, floorin' it 
Man, these niggas can't stop me, I'm goin' in 
Man, these niggas can't stop me, I'm goin' in 
Every time the pack get gone, I get another load 
My main bitch tryna leave me 'lone 'cause I fucked another ho 
I'm like, "Baby, I know I'm wrong, but this just how life goes" 
"And I know these niggas'd be happy if I let you go" 
Got me walkin' on a thin line on my tippy toes 
Man, this shit crazy, different city with some different hoes, here we go
Every time the pack get gone, I get another load 
My main bitch tryna leave me 'lone 'cause I fucked another ho 
I'm like, "Baby, I know I'm wrong, but this just how life goes" 
"And I know these niggas'd be happy if I let you go" 
Got me walkin' on a thin line on my tippy toes 
Man, this shit crazy, different city with some different hoes, here we go
Tryna spend a whole M on some clothes 
Got a bonus, I sold out a show 
Gunna hot like a pot on the stove
Yellow AP on all of my hoes 
I like when that white on her toes 
Picture me ridin' around in that Rolls 
I put some ice on my wrist, it was swole 
I ain't got time to lay up with you hoes 
All of these drugs in my body
I gotta pay somebody keep checkin' my pulse
Walk in the club with no warning take care of that money
They swing on the pole 
Water on me like Dasani 
I shine when it's sunny, this platinum and rose 
Gunna Gunna out the streets
When I go to DC, I'ma fuck with the mo 
Every time the pack get gone, I get another load 
My main bitch tryna leave me 'lone 'cause I fucked another ho 
I'm like, "Baby, I know I'm wrong, but this just how life goes" 
"And I know these niggas'd be happy if I let you go" 
Got me walkin' on a thin line on my tippy toes 
Man this shit crazy, different city with some different hoes, here we go
Every time the pack get gone, I get another load 
My main bitch tryna leave me 'lone 'cause I fucked another ho 
I'm like, "Baby, I know I'm wrong, but this just how life goes" 
"And I know these niggas'd be happy if I let you go" 
Got me walkin' on a thin line on my tippy toes 
Man this shit crazy, different city with some different hoes, here we go
Man this shit crazy, different city with some different hoes 
I can switch my girls up the same way that I change my clothes 
Man it's crazy, all blue backend in the envelope 
And you know I'm never lackin', got a new whip that's up in traffic
Water, water, water on my Patek , it's automatic
I drink water when I'm fastin' , you's a has-been
They would love me in a casket, I can't have it
Boy, I'm far from average , better wait your turn, better get in line
Every time the pack get gone, I get another load 
My main bitch tryna leave me 'lone 'cause I fucked another ho 
I'm like, "Baby, I know I'm wrong, but this just how life goes" 
"And I know these niggas'd be happy if I let you go"
