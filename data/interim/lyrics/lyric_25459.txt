Pooh, you a fool for this one
Ha
Oh Lord, Jetson made another one
Hah
Pack in the mail, it's gone 
She like how I smell, cologne 
I just signed a deal, I'm on
Yeah, yeah
I go where I want, I'm good 
Play if you want, let's do it 
I'm a young CEO, Suge 
Yeah, yeah
The first nigga play, I'ma body a nigga 
I just checked my balance
I'll probably pull up to your hood
And come buy me a nigga 
You know that your ho told you that nigga crazy
Don't think that she lied to you, nigga 
Get caught with your ho when I'm poppin' 'em both
Now they high just like Bobby and Whitney 
Say I'm the goat, act like I don't know
But fuck it, I'm obviously winnin'
Don't make me go hit the bank and take out a hundred
To show you our pockets are different 
I'm out with your bitch and I only want knowledge
She got a lil' mileage, I'm chillin' 
You disrespect me and I'll beat your ass up
All in front of your partners and children 
I'm the type to let a nigga think that I'm broke
Until I pop out with a million 
Take 20K and put that on your head
And make one of your partners come kill you 
Say he fuckin' with me then he gotta grow up
'Cause this nigga gotta be kiddin' 
This shit, it can't fit in my pocket
I got it, like I hit the lottery, nigga 
Opp, I'll slap the shit out a nigga
No talkin', I don't like to argue with niggas 
Ain't gon' be no more laughin'
You see me whip out 'cause I'm gon' be done shot me a nigga 
I don't follow no bitches on IG
But all of your bitches, they follow a nigga 
And that lil' nigga ain't gon' shoot shit with that gun
He just pull it out in his pictures 
Hah

Talkin' my shit, I'ma pop that 
Got like thirty-two thousand in one of my pockets
The other one, that's where the Glock at 
You little niggas wanna be internet gangster
Man, tell all these little niggas stop that 
Been done burnt me a nigga in front of the store
Where your mammy and grandmama shop at 
Hopped out on a whole other wave from these niggas
Let's see one of you little niggas top that
I will turn a nigga into a convertible
Push me a lil' nigga top back 
Her boyfriend be hatin' and callin' her groupie
Just 'cause she like all my music 
She'll send me a text and then delete the message
He tryna find out, it's confusin'
I don't know what these niggas is thinkin' about
Use the brain in your head 'fore you lose it 
I'll pull up after school and I'll teach her some shit
Tell your bro I'm a motherfuckin' tutor
'Member I used to cheat off a pretty bitch test
All the teachers, they thought I was stupid 
Was expectin' the box to pull up on a truck
Man, this nigga pulled up on a scooter
