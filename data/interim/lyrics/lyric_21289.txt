Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so
I've never been awake
I've never seen a daybreak
Leaning on my pillow in the morning
A lazy day in bed
Music in my head
Crazy music playing in the morning light
Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so
I love a sunny day
I dream of far away
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning
I've never been awake
I've never seen a daybreak
Leaning on my pillow in the morning light
Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so
Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so
