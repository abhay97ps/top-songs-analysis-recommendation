Alice, pretty little Alice, pretty little Alice in Wonderland
Alice in wonderland, won't you take me by the hand
And lead me to your wonderland of love
I took one look at you, and that was all I had to do
Alice, you're the girl I'm dreamin of
Tweedle dum, tweedle dee
You have made my life a fantasy
You don't know what you're doing to me
My heart goes pitter patter
'cause I'm mad as a hatter for
Alice, my little girl, there is no other in this whole wide world
Take me by the hand, tell me you understand
Alice, Alice in wonderland
Oh Alice, pretty little Alice, pretty little Alice in wonderland
