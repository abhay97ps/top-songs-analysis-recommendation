Oh, Mama say a prayer for me
Jesse's back in town
It won't be easy
Don't let him near me
Don't let him touch me
Don't let him seize me
Jesse
I won't cut fresh flowers for you
No, Jesse
And I won't make the wine cold for you
No, Jesse
I won't change the sheets for you
I won't put on cologne
I won't sit by the phone for you
Annie, keep reminding me
That he cut out my heart
Like a paper doll
Sally, tell me once again
How he set me up
Just to see me fall
Jesse
I won't cut fresh flowers for you
No, Jesse
I won't make the wine cold for you
No, Jesse
I won't change the sheets for you
I won't put on cologne
I won't sit by the phone for you
No, no, no
Jesse, quick come here
I won't tell a soul 
Jesse, that you've come back to me
My friends will all say, she's gone again
But, how can anyone know
What you are to me?
That I'm in heaven again
Because you've come back to me
Ooooh, Jesse!
Jesse
I'll always cut fresh flowers for you
And Jesse
I'll always make the wine cold for you
Oh Jesse
I can easily change my mind about you
And put on cologne
And sit by the phone for you
Oh, yeah
Jesse
Let's open the wine
And drink to the heart
Which has a will of its own
My friends 
It's tough for them
They're feeling bad
They think I've sunk so low
Jesse
I'll always cut fresh flowers for you
And Jesse
I will make the wine cold for you
Oh Jesse
I will change the sheets for you
And put on cologne
And I will wait by the phone for you
Oh, Jesse!
Oh Jesse
Jesse
I will cut fresh flowers for you
And Jesse, yeah
Make the wine cold for you
Oh, Jesse
And I will change the sheets for you
