This shit wasn't even urgent for me and I could've shown up with nothin' written
What else would I think "Verb'll agree" meant? 
And I only took this for the cash of course...again
I write for matches I don't have any passion for
This for vacation
They even booked me in the one room hotel...this was my last resort
You gotta play your part
This gangsta shit was never for the faint of heart
Renounce that, you try to clip me off, I bounce back
I can't let it slide, besides I'm 'bout that
And karma always come back like a house cat
MAC, extended clip, you know that I mean business
30 in the 10 I've over the speed limit
He's trippin' until I grip the thing
And he into Mr. Thing, Smith the ring, I'm tryin' to blow you to smithereens
I'm in the Lou', kicks lightin' up the block: Billie Jean
Your angels duck while I handle MAC's well , hit Pretty Wings
Silly thing, I let the barrel stick to ya chest, don't fight the 12
Or anybody resisting arrest, he speaks so arrogant
I don't need no wise words from a therapist
Nigga keep the battle shit you woke but not makin' no moves that's sleep paralysis
I creep, sporadically, with chrome to greet you, longest Eagle
Pistol whip you til your skull's showin'
Flip this to the backside, and you'll have your bonus features
I'm known for heaters, you only do a stage
This nigga said he could do the Elvis move holdin' on a gauge
Poor Elvis Presley rollin' in his grave
That ain't even detrimental, I'm loadin' up an eight
Lower with the graze
Bow, even lettin' you live did you a favor, just to bring it up and throw it in your face!
I'll buck the gat, I don't believe nothin' when this sucka rap
You sell a fight-
I said, I don't believe nothin' when this sucka rap
A nigga swung on me when my foot was broke, what's up wit' that?
You can sell a fight, but when it's Showtime, you break a leg
Good luck with-
Jersey
Not only am I gon' beat you, but I'm gon' teach you
So standin' in front of Verb you gain somethin'
You just don't lose and lose
I'm a god with this, Twork
I eat from the garden, Twork
Your rap ability draws power from the foods that you consume
And you consume chicken, turkey, sucka
I don't understand how these lame nigga think
So for me, tryin' to process how squares move around
It's like, it's like tryin' to crack the code on a Rubik's Cube
Let's not lose this mood
Fans, prepare for lyrical evolution
As I dissect through this illusion
Of he's the new hot nigga out now and here he kills
Well he's in the presence of a king nigga, here he kneels
Vegan Verb but I still brought that eerie feel
If I left y'all cups empty from catchin' bodies, well here; refill
This ain't a battle this is dinner time
From another rookie flimsy spine, primitive rhyme, slave for Smack
Who will take the whip back like it's Enterprise
He'll recline, I stand up, I got that OG posture
Smooth nigga, skin glow like I'm from Okinawa
Your flow low key blah-blah, my emoji: mobsters
I'm solo wit' it, I never need a staff I ain't low key  patna
Fade catcher, afterwards we can pop out back like an OG Mogwai
Or get to clappin' 5's like Makidada
This your lyrical hot water? That shit feel like a hot tub
Cock buffer, all yo' rounds sound like brrap pa pa
I run shit, you can't talk no gun shit to no Barack, li'l bruh
Hold on Verb, my nigga simmer down
Psssss
I am gonna cook him that's just that simmer sound
All you lil' cats wanna be king, y'all sound how Simba sound
This is March and I brought December sound
I'm from where if you put your guard up, niggas come knock your window down
The impact sound like cymbal sounds
I'm a product of what I've been around
Wait, I like your lil' special move, that shit is crackin'
My question is, why are you strapped in when you snappin'?
That means you held back lil' nigga doin' your rappin'
This is what you should've said sucka
"I'm not strapped in, I'm solid bruh
Smoke all of ya, pile 'em up
Drums: orchestra
Hammers, carpenters
Calico killers who crack collarbones, the gods wit' us"
You wit' Verb, you cut it close, that's when the guards switch up
I can read between the lines, I see the mark in ya
You target us, we sit back with cigars lit up
Disregard you frauds, we war y'all Parkinsons
No arguin', the blade right across his gut
Then lift his stomach the same motion the garage lift up
The inner you, I wanna talk to ya
You talk loud for all your boys, you a Lavar nigga
And I'm like Gambit, soon as I touch this card the card lit up
This a mirage to us, when you talk bald heads we think of Marge nigga
Simpson, you got the swag of an undercover officer
And I'm a man, a bar mitzvah, a bar spitter
And 'round here bartenders don't serve soft liquor for the autistic
You don't belong here, you long winded but short gifted
That's how you take your move and throw some sauce in it
You said I changed for the URL?
My nigga I was birthed in this way and even worse
Cause back then I was movin' off urge and instinct
And tell Tay Roc, I'm the new GOAT
I say his name but I guess I ain't really deservin' this plate
You? Get back to your ways
Or at least back to your waves
And that's Kaiser, cause I would've hit your perm and then Tay 
When you rap, it's difficult to get involved, I listen hard
To the pieces you leave out and missin' parts
First you tough and then you scared inside ya cell, but contradicts it all
I sit in awe, too many holes in ya round, that's Wiffle ball
I'm masked up, I head to your block and clip it all
You drop, I put one in front of ya area, code is distant calls
Listen dawg, you want me to believe I ain't the nicest yet?
Well I'm in tune with my spirit despite the flesh
You wanna kill me, well I literally want to kill you
Last night at the face-off tellin' me how you ain't like them vets
And twice the threat
I'm thinkin' that shit don't even matter between us
It's a matter between life and death
I was strapped in
I did the "why I oughta" and grabbed the nina
Then the salsa, the sombrero that I brought to Cor' ; that's subpoena
One hit from this MC Hammer like Have You Seen Her?
If I had to arm you in the casket huggin' your body a Macarena
The MAC'll seen ya, yeah this is bad as it seems
I'll leave you Knocking On Heaven's Door: Avril Lavigne
I'm clappin' the thing, I ride wit' it on me
Silencer on it, ain't no blockin' it broady
Twitter fingers, that's until your death trendin'
I'll put you on the front of the 'net, you tried to be goalie
Your mother suffer? BAOW, wanna take the edge off; slice of baloney
Hit Hitman, ShowwOutt, Yung Ill, a lot of ya homies
You can wait ya turn, I ain't gotta kill ya big homie
Cause Chase a bird: Wile E. Coyote
I don't allow frontin', bow somethin'
Pistol whip, loud thumpin'
I put the butt of your heat into your jaw, I'll leave you eatin' through a straw
Cause if I hit you to the machine broke, that's just the way your mouth function 
I done seen a lot of real in my life
And my trials and tribulations that's made me real generous like
So before I smoke you, I'll turn the gun to your dyke mother
And a bullet in the head will be the end to her life
Cause losin' her very own son, BAOW, she'll never have to know what that feelin' is like
This adrenaline hype, I'm done makin' 'em believe
I can really put in twork in these streets, out here makin' niggas bleed
I done spent stacks on straps, Nina, extension, I'm the one really placin' in the weave
These guns ain't cheap, they ain't even free loadin'
And I still give you eight  before I leave
I do what I gotta do
Even recoupin' eight weeks
But when I catch up, I'm comin' in groups, way sleep
Where you at the most, with instruments
If I gotta pull strings, I'm unconcerned where you can lay lease 
I'm wiggin' ain't I?
The aroma from your soul got a nigga anxious
Fuck duckin' BAOW, it's back to Heaven's gate where I send ya angels
Another rusty war revolver
But this was past down from my grandfather for generations, what made it lethal
But you a veteran and it's from a veteran that makes us equal
Cause it's seasoned too  but I made a sequel
Get dolled up, Mossbergs they all dump
I shoot til I wear the shotgun out, I exhaust pumps
Aw fuck the politics, I just wanna stay paid
What you gon' tell me how I got a small fan base?
And how the mass'll  follow you like a runaway slave?
That's what you think of course
Speakin' of slave, you better runaway nigga
BAOW, I peg legs, what you think this hollow in this thing is for?
Soon as you see somethin' Big
Dip'll  be starin' up at the handle, he followin' the drinkin' gourd
I kick the door, I make use of this rifle
I find the bricks myself, cause I'll never get the truth from a liar
You St. Louis niggas think you all Lunatics
Till I give that man what he askin' for-
BAOW! Now your roof is on fire!
Jersey
You ole Jersey nigga be some ole filthy muhfuckas man
Y'all get on stage, no cologne just smellin' like lit Backwoods
Over aggressive sound like UHH, y'all don't even rap good
Looka here lil' buddy, you will never be a star in this game
Get it you heard me?
I'm like a washed up Mike
But it's more excited watchin' Mike go 0 for 20 than watch Ron Harper get 30
Enough of this
Three minute rounds, they ain't book me for a long time
Fuck the preview, let's let that beef brew, in 3D too
So it's Showtime
Holla told me be upfront
With these rookies they small factors
Tax 'em, make 'em pay, they all owe , that's Holla backwards
Watch your jaw or get it wired then, get some stats or be quiet then
Your rhymes soft as Love & Hip Hop
That's why you ain't got no body: Mariah Lynn
Man I be fryin' Lux pen pals
Beloved know, boy from the arch is gold
If we go I'll crush the wind valve on Mr. McDowell
That shit is black and white like a mixed crowd
I bet you'll drop a dime, make a wish now
How Twork somethin'?
Smack throw you some singles and tell you "twerk somethin'"
You niggas with bars? I get out every time, nigga I'll Surf somethin'
I from where it don't count if you squirt somethin' if you don't shirt somethin'
Old school, drum rotate like you tryin' to hurt somethin'
Send a dum-dum to your door: nigga, that's Lurch comin'
You don't earn stripes if you don't earn somethin'
When I rhyme the gangsters put they arms in the sky like I'm tryin' to search somethin'
Yo' bitch wanna come buy my shit, now get some merch from me
They lie to ya, they knew I would body ya
They not findin' ya, lose tonight they wavin' bye to ya
Stay woke; insomnia
For these fans you'll pose on ya toes just like these hoes
This the round where I ripple your robe, sizzle yo' soul
I'm truly violent, you go to yo' mama house when you due for vibin'
For moves of silence, I choose asylum
Bitch nigga I will crack yo' skull open
Take yo' scariest thoughts and make children's movies out 'em
Remove the violence and put jewels inside 'em
He just a loud punch liner, a word stretcher
I commend your superb effort
But you know how many rappers with that same style I got sittin' on Verb's stretchers?
Suppressors on the Eagles, they quiet, the birds peck ya
Nah, but I'm a ruder guy, I lyrically crucify
After me my opponents never see a loss again, cause I remove they eyes
Take the pen they wrote that bullshit wit' and push it through they side
Watch blood and ink cruise they thighs
Look at y'alls savior
Father forgive 'em cause he know not what he do, nigga I use yo' lines
God was last round
Little nigga this the devil cookin'
Twork in the pressure cookin'
No crowd to gas you, let's see if son can still perform like he Devin Booker
I'll take ya mama's god fearin' daughter and developed the sister into a pebble pusher
You came hard, notice my level took up
I'ma be totally honest, there's no comparison wit' us
A Showtime and a Strapped In, is how this match was solely decided
You win if I only allow it
I watched you get booed your whole motherfuckin' career...and I'm supposed to be modest
Beggin' Smack to get them crowds to quiet down
BAOW, now he call tell 'em to give you a moment of silence
Let's take it back when you was famous and shit
How your career came and then went
And now it's RBE, KOTD
And they payin' you top dollar what you claim in defense
But you battlin' for a King Of The Dot necklace?
Over here it's a whole 'nother chain of events
It's not for cameras, this Glock bananas
You seen the proof cause Nina shoot when I command her
Like point and view, and only see it from my point of view, it's propaganda
I promote the violence
I remember when you dropped the waves and got the box fade I was so astonished
Wanted to grab the box blade, ya chin and poke inside it
Your brains on top ya fade, he thinkin' outside the box: he open-minded
Followed by the bird with the long nose: it's Pocahontas
I hold the nine up, that bitch barkin', no prints on it
No more ride up, he's off his high horse he's Prince Cha-
None of them sermons can work, my mom a pastor
She had a small congregation
I watched her have to live off the money that she earned from the church
While I was robbin', givin' her my cash, two different paths
She even had to stand firm where it hurts
You can look at my past and see it's all darker
Paul Walker...my life took a turn for the worse!
First, you gotta show me what that action 'bout
Cause I'll kill you then cremate you and I'll come to your mother crib and pour your ashes out
Empty out the dust like a vacuum pop
Two Glocks to grip, nah, drop them shit
Spine shot from an old MAC, give you a floppy disc
I let it rip, it's Showtime on every shit
I send Chaz somewhere he never went
One box containing Verb, the predicate
The long n-
Nah, it's three minute rounds they ain't book me for a long time
Fuck the preview, let that beef brew, in 3D too
So it's Showti-
I'm at your crib!
He like, "It ain't gon' be that tho."
BAOW! Nigga, YES, IT IS!
Give me a reason, hemochromatosis, we don't keep the iron low like we anemic, we keep it higher
Y'all vets hate us cause y'all be divided
And look at this new wave and see alliance
Bringin' back restorations and realignments
But be advised I'm armed so, if you ain't givin' up props then keep it silent
Or bring back that old Verb, you know the one that was sportin' waves cause he a tyrant
Dome shot, I would've put lead  in the grease : Leonidas
Now you'll see the light, BAOW and that be your life
I held it two feet over the waves...in Jesus Christ
Your shit drenched, if I say "drive-by" that's a verb and cause that you can't see inside 'til the clips hit
That's for a Verb, I spoke words put action behind it
And send ten , see the real where I stay
Mug shot, I'm the real Von Doom: I never took the hoodie off but put steel in your face
You very frail
It's either I end up in a cell or he's  my snitch
Nah, we know you very well
Either way I make you paraplegic
Cause I hear this corn talkin', but I never heard a veggie tell 
I'M STRAPPED IN!
I'LL CLAP YOU IN A COMA!
MADNESS!
I COULD SNAP AT ANY MOMENT!
I pull a pound!
100 clip, he get the fully round!
He don't know who did it...
I'M OVER THE BODY WITH THE HOODIE DOWN!
You do know when you wear that hood we can still see you ugly as fuck, right?
Boy if I looked like you I'd be screamin' "Fuck life."
Nigga you ain't that, before you met Smack probably fucked twice
Boy you look half snappin' turtle, half Bug's Life
Up here rappin' all this Thug Life and what you cut like
See my livin' brought wisdom, those that have limited vision, can't even see that he wears that hood as a defense mechanism
You want this image like you done somethin'
But pardon me Twork I can't be scared of a nigga in the hood cause I'm really from one
What's poppin' Twork?
I'm older than you, I live longer, so I can tell when a person is fakin' and a real someone
I can tell the rappers who come from the field the real gunners
I can tell the ones who erase who they was and rebuild somethin'
I saw some old footage of you Twork
A fan sent Verb the tape, you was rappin' all calm wit' the nervous face
Now all of a sudden you aggressive with the surgeon face
Help me understand, you look like a good kid, where did you learn the hate?
I get it, you impersonate and then perpetrate
All the rappers you like, put they styles in a pot, copy/rehearse and paste
I had it posted before I'ma throw it back up, yeah I regurgitate
We all know you steal niggas raps, you a verse snatcher
But what the fans don't know is y'all Nu Jerzey Twork is a purse snatcher
Now Twork let's play Swear To God
Swear to God you ain't get locked up for snatchin' a woman's purse around Christmas time
Wait, before you get to to lying
Understand you fuckin' wit' a vet and I can have that shit all over the 'net in just the nick of time
Cause you and I know you did that for survival
I can ruin your career in a matter of seconds, nigga keep your pride low
Cause little nigga, durin' this round if I see one eye roll that's on the Bible
I ain't gotta threaten these niggas, y'all know how I go
When you snatch that woman purse, did it give you some power?
When you ran from a nigga you didn't feel like a coward?
When you got caught by the police you wasn't embarrassed like, "I'm Nu Jerzey Twork the battle rapper and I'm bag snatchin'"?
You should take a razor to your wrist and then bleed yourself
All this bite on this stage and you can't feed yourself?
Nigga be yo'self
Motherfucker you ain't sprayin' slugs
You took from a lady cuz, you fuckin' lady bug
Ja Rule rappin' ass nigga, you fuckin' Wanksta
You ain't a gangsta 'til you do some gangsta shit to some gangstas
I ride up, nah I hop out and walk
On all the Jersey natives, blank faced, splat all black on
Swag of The Terminator
Michael Jackson, I'm Bad shoot, two crews sparkin'
My fade game, hit after hit I'll moonwalk him
You sensitive like a bitch that's Raven-Symone
Raven like bitches
Boy it's a long day when I'm on
Nigga I stay with the chrome
I'll hit his bey with the chrome
You new niggas got too many chances to get to cold
I disable the phone
Aye Verb vs Nu Jerzey Twork see what the fuss is about
You say my name and they bring that bread I come put...
