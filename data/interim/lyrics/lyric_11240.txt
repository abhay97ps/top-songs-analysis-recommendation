Ever since he broke your heart
You seem so lost each time you pass my way
How I long to take your hand
And say "Don't cry
I'll kiss your tears away"
He-e-e-e-y there lonely girl, lonely girl
Let me make your broken heart like new
Hey there lonely girl, lonely girl
Don't you know this lonely boy loves you?
(You think that only his lips
Can kiss your lips
And make your heart stand still)
But once you're in my arms you'll see
No one can kiss your lips the way I will
The way I will...
Hey there lonely girl, my only girl
Let me make your broken heart like new
Hey there lonely girl, my only girl
Don't you know this lonely boy loves you?
Hey there lonely girl
You don't have to be lonely
Don't you know this lonely boy loves you-ou-ou?
You-ou-ou-ou-ou
Don't you know this lonely boy loves you-ou-ou?
I make your broken heart like new
And I the everything I heart like new
