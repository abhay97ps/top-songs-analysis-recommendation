Loose lips sink ships
So, come aboard for a pleasure trip
It's high tide, so let's ride
The moon is rising and so am I
I'm gonna get it up
Never gonna let it up
Cruisin' on the seven seas
A pirate of my loving needs
I'll never go down, never go down
So, let's get it up
Let's get it up, get it right up
Let's get it up, right to the top
Let's get it up, right now
Loose wires cause fires
Getting tangled in my desires
So, screw him up and plug him in
Then switch it on and start all over again
I'm gonna get it up
Never gonna let it up, no
Ticking like a time bomb
Ooh yeah, blowing out the fuse box
I'll never go down, never go down
So, let's get it up
Let's get it up, get it up, ow-ow
Let's get it up, right to the top
Let's get it up, right now
Get it up
Come on, Ang
Wail!
So, let's get it up
Let's get it up, get it up, ow-ow
Let's get it up, right to the top
Let's get it up, right now
