Coming at you once again
Yeah, uh huh
It's the one and only, yeah
The Female Mac, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh baby, yeah
That's right, yeah, babe
The store is open boy
Won't you come inside
Try some goodies on aisle 69
Your appetite for love
Is what I like
Oh, won't you let me give you some of this
Chocolate tonight
Feel like sipping on Cristal tonight
Maybe Hennessy up under candlelight 
Run some bubble bath and let's enjoy the night
I'm that tight 
One little kiss on my lips will be
Enough to start it off, you will see, baby
Bring some strawberries and Hennessy
We can make love endlessly 
Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessy
That's the way, that's the way
My love flows 
Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessy
That's the way, that's the way
My love flows
If you could keep it real
Right when my body feels
Good and ready
To satisfy your needs
Just when I'm 'bout to let you
Get inside
I'll be your Mary Jane
Boy you know I'll get you so high
Feel like sipping on Cristal tonight
Maybe Hennessy up under candlelight 
Run some bubble bath and let's enjoy the night
I'm that tight 
One little kiss on my lips will be 
Enough to start it off, you will see, baby 
Bring some strawberries and Hennessy
We can make love endlessly 
Strawberries on top of me 
Candlelight, a little Hennessy 
That's the way, that's the way
My love flows 
Strawberries on top of me 
Candlelight, a little Hennessy 
That's the way, that's the way
My love flows
Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessy
That's the way, that's the way
My love flows 
Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessy 
That's the way , that's the way
My love flows
Gots all the right tools to get you hooked
You gots to have it
Taste this flava, now ya feenin', it's a habit
You wanna, come inside, from the rain
This girl's got more game than a little
Headed straight for the top
That's the way it's going down, boo
Once I get my props
I want a little bit of this
Little bit of that
Warm the baby oil ‘cause the Female Mac is back, wit’…
Strawberries 
Strawberries on top of me
That’s the way 
On top of me
Strawberries
Strawberries on top of me
That’s the way 
Feel like sipping on Cristal tonight
Maybe Hennessy up under candlelight
Run some bubble bath and let's enjoy the night
I'm that tight 
One little kiss on my lips will be 
Enough to start it off, you will see, baby 
Bring some strawberries and Hennessy
We can make love endlessly
Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessy
That's the way, that's the way
My love flows
A real good man
Who ain't afraid to do it right
Serving me sounds nice
Even if it takes all night
I want a real good man
Who ain't afraid to do it right
Serving me sounds nice
Even if it takes all night
Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessy
That's the way, that's the way
My love flows
