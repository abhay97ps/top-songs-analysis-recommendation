My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland
Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah 
Set me free 
Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah 
Set me free 
Could you pull me out of this alive?
Where's my body? I'm stuck in my mind
I'm tired of screaming
At the top of my lungs
I'm in the hole, I'm falling down, down
So down, down
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Sick and tired of waking up
Screaming at the top of my lungs
Think I might've just left myself behind
Maestro, play me your symphony
I will listen to anything
Take me on a trip, DJ, free my mind
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah, oh 
Set me free 
Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah, oh 
Set me free
