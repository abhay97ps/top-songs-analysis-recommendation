That thing you got behind you is amazing
Ooh that body’s like music to my ear
Ooh that body’s like music to my ear
Ooh that body’s like music to my ear
Cause what you want is right here
Ooh she, oh she so international
The way, the way she get it on the floor
I’m tryin, I’m tryin’ to holler at you
I want to get to know you better
Parlez-vous français?
Konichiwa, come and move in my way
That thing you got behind you is amazing
I don’t speak Spanish, Japanese or French
But the way that body’s talkin’ definitely makes sense
It’s her, her body, her body, her body language
It’s her, her body, her body, her body language
The way she moves around
When she grinds to the beat
Breaking it down articulately
It’s her, her body, her body, her body language
It’s her, her body, her body
That make me wanna say
He-eey, he-eey, he-eey
It’s her, her body, her body
Her body language, come on
Shorty, let me whisper in your ear
Tell you, everything you wanna hear
You got my vote Hottest Girl of the Year
Let’s have a ce-lebra-tion, baby
Parlez-vous français?
Konichiwa, come and move in my way
That thing you got behind you is amazing
I don’t speak Spanish, Japanese or French
But the way that body’s talkin’ definitely makes sense
It’s her, her body, her body, her body language
It’s her, her body, her body, her body language
The way she moves around
When she grinds to the beat
Breaking it down articulately
It’s her, her body, her body, her body language
It’s her, her body, her body
That make me wanna say
He-eey, he-eey, he-eey
It’s her, her body, her body
Her body language, come on

That thing you got behind you is amazing
I’m lifting up my voice to say
You’re the hottest girl in the world today
The way you shake
You got me losing my mind
You’re banging like a speakerbox
Turn around; the party stops
Universal lady, let me take you away
I don’t speak Spanish, Japanese or French
But the way that body’s talkin’ definitely makes sense
It’s her, her body, her body, her body language
It’s her, her body, her body, her body language
The way she moves around
When she grinds to the beat
Breaking it down articulately
It’s her, her body, her body, her body language
It’s her, her body, her body
That make me wanna say
He-eey 
He-eey 
He-eey
It’s her, her body, her body
Her body language, come on
Oh that body’s like music to my ear
Oh that body’s like music to my ear
Oh that body’s like music to my ear
'Cause what you want is right here
