I'm not alone
I know you feel it
So much deeper than we can see
Blood runs strong
And all my emotions, have taken their toll on me
A lonely battle another night
I don't wanna fight anymore
Nobody wins in this war
Two hearts are breakin
Is there an end in sight
Don't keep me waitin
Cause I can't fight anymore
Nobody wins in this war
It's you and I and nothing else matters
It's all of the love that you've given me
We will survive if we lay down are weapons
While we've still got time
Will you surrender, or give it up
Cause I don't wanna fight anymore
Nobody wins in this war
Two hearts are breakin
Is there an end in sight
Don't keep me waitin 'cause I can't fight anymore
Nobody wins in this war
These wounds of love need healing
I'm leavin it all in your hands
Oh yes Yes I am, baby
Nobody wins, Nobody wins in this war
Two hearts are breakin
Is there an end in sight
Don't keep me waitin 'cause I can't fight anymore
Nobody wins in this war 
Nobody nobody nobody wins in this
Nobody nobody nobody wins in this
And I can't fight anymore
Nobody nobody nobody wins in this war
