Since you're gone
The nights are gettin' strange
Since you're gone
Well, nothing's makin' any sense
Since you're gone
I stumbled in the shade
Since you're gone
Everything's in perfect tense, well
I can't help it
When you fall apart
I  can't help it
Guess you better start
That is forgettin' about you
Since you're gone
Nights are gettin' strange
Since you're gone
Throwin' it all away
Since you're gone
The nights are gettin' strange
Since you're gone
Thrownin' it all away
I can't help it
Everything's a mess
I can't help it
You're so treacherous
When it comes, to tenderness
I can't help it
Everything's a mess
I can't help it
You're so treacherous
Oh, where's that tenderness?
Since you're gone
I missed the peak sensation
Since you're gone
I took the big vacation
Well, never feel sedate
Well, the moonlight ain't so great
Since you're gone
Well, I've thrown it all away
When the night 
Strange I've thrown it all away
Well, since you're gone
Since you're gone
Since you're gone
I've thrown it all away
