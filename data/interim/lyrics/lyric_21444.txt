It was a home run when the game was tied
A pick up truck when I could drive
One pink line when Katie said I'm late
It was a passing grade, a pretty girl
All the money in the world
What mattered then kept changing every day
But when I bow my head tonight
There'll be no me, myself and I
Just watch my wife and kids please Lord
That's all I ask for any more
Nowadays it's crazy how
A passing storm, a siren sound
Can make me drop it all and pick up the phone
To hear her say that all's okay is all I need to know these days
Can't wait to see their faces when I get home
But when I bow my head tonight
There'll be no me, myself and I
Just watch my wife and kids please Lord
That's all I ask for any more
Let them outlive me by a hundred years
Let their laughter dry up all their tears
Let them love and be loved back like I have been
But when I bow my head tonight
There'll be no me, myself and I
Just watch my wife and kids please Lord
That's all I ask for any more
That's all that matters anymore
