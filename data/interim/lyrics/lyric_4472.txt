 I see a house
A house of stone
 A lonely house
'Cause now you've gone
 Seven rooms, that's all it is
Seven rooms of gloom
 I live with emptiness
Without your tenderness
You took the dream I had for us
Turned my dreams into dust
I watch a phone that never rings
I watch a door that never rings
Bring you back into my life
Turn this darkness into light
I'm all alone in this house
Turn this house to a home
I need your touch to comfort me
Your tender, tender arms that once held me
 Without your love
Your love inside
 This house is just a place
To run and hide
 Seven rooms, that's all it is
Seven rooms of gloom
 Rooms of emptiness
Without your tenderness
Don't make me live from day to day
Watching a clock that ticks away
Another day, another way
Another reason for me to stay
I need you here, here with me
I need you, darling, desperately
I'm all alone, all alone
In this house that's not a home
I miss your love I once had known
I miss your kiss that was my very, very own
 Empty silence
Surrounding me
 Lonely walls
They stare at me
 Seven rooms, that's all it is
Rooms of gloom
 I live with emptiness
Without your tenderness
All the windows are painted black
And wait right here till you come back
I'll keep waiting, waiting
Till your face again I see
(Coming back
When are you coming back?)
