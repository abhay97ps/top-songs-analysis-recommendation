Grownups tell me
The birds and the bees
Do other things than
Live in trees
If you ask me what I think
This is what I'll say
The bees are for the birds
The birds are for the bees
And I don't care anyway
Came the honey from the bee
Birds singing in the tree
Then the wasteful people say
It's got nothing to do with me
Grownups tell me
The birds and the bees
Do other things than
Live in trees
If you ask me what I think
This is what I'll say
The bees are for the birds
The birds are for the bees
And I don't care anyway
Well, birds and bees and ABC's
Live their lives in hives and trees
Birds don't always live in trees
Bees don't look like me
Grownups tell me
The birds and the bees
Do other things than
Live in trees
If you ask me what I think
This is what I'll say
The bees are for the birds
The birds are for the bees
And I don't care anyway
So, birds chirp and bees buzz
No one cares less than I does
I don't care if they can fly
It's got nothing to do with you and I
Grownups tell me
The birds and the bees
Do other things than
Live in trees
If you ask me what I think
This is what I'll say
The bees are for the birds
The birds are for the bees
And I don't care anyway
