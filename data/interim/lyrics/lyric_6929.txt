The language of love
Shoo-be-doo-be-boo
The language of love
Sha-la-la-la-la
When you dig a girl you meet
To sweep her off her feet
Tell her
Ooh-la-la-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la
If it's true love at first sight
And everything is right
Tell her
La-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da
It may sound foreign to her ears
But in her heart she understands and hears
The language of love
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo
The language of love
Sha-la-la-la-la
When you want to steal a kiss
But she tries to resist
Tell her
Scooby-doobie-doo
Scooby-doobie-doo
When you reach to hold her tight
But she jumps out of sight
Tell her
La-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da
It may sound foreign to her ears
But in her heart she'll understand and hear
The language of love
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo
The language of love
Sha-la-la-la-la
The language of love
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo
The language of love
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-scooby-doo
