Bernie writes the words
While Elton makes the music and the melody
Philadelphia Freedom
Always sounds so good to me
Stevie, you're a wonder
When you're singin' that perfect harmony 
It's hard to believe
All the love that blind man made me see, whoa-whoa-oh-oh-oh
Superstar
I want to thank you for what you are, oh whoa
Only six ninety-eight
Lord, you sound so great
And I just can't wait
To hear you singin' 
Come on and sing it, woah-oh-oh
Heart Like a Wheel
Always made me feel any way I want to be
Linda, you're a winner
Oh, girl, you're lookin' thinner than you used to be
Joni Mitchell, you
Always pull me through when I get down and blue
Music is your callin'
Help, I think I'm fallin' in love with you, whoa-whoa-oh-oh-oh
Superstar
I want to thank you for what you are, whoa-whoa
Only six ninety-eight
Lord, you sound so great
And I just can't wait
To hear you singin' 
Come on and sing it, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Sing it 
Come on and sing it, whoa-oh-oh
Sing it 
Come on and sing it, whoa-oh-oh-whoa-oh
Sing another song and make me happy
Come on and sing it 
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Sing another song and make me happy
Come on and sing it 
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Sing another song and make me happy
Come on and sing it 
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Sing another song and make me happy
Come on and sing it 
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
