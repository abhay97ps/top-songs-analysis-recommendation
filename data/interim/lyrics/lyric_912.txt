Mike G, why don't you drop us something' else?
Yeah, this jam goes out to all my gente cruising' in them classic Chevrolets, you know what I'm saying'?
This song was done a long time ago before you know who fucked it up
Yeah, Lighter Shade of Brown
I'm just coasting on a sunny day
Got my homies on the way but still mashing in my Chevrolet
But hey, I'm only making necessary stops
Clowning on the cops as the bass just drops
Out your box while your 6-4 locks
Stupid ass folks trying front off the air shocks
Gliding, feeling the atmospheric breeze
Punks don't touch my mic cause it's T's
Yeah, the jam of the year, is right here
I lift the front so I can drop the rear
Just got back from the B-ball court
Me and Tee are just coasting in the super sport
Say "What's up" to my homies from around the way
Keep cruising that classic Chevrolet
They say, "Let's go chill at Waller"
So I waxed and polished, my '65 Impala
Pick up my friends around one
Now my friends are fighting over whose gonna sit shotgun
Not to brag about my ride but my it's nice inside
This is strictly dedicated to the Brown Pride
And I'm Coasting
Coasting with the top down on a sunny day
I got the homies on the way
We're just coasting with the top down on a sunny day
I got the homies on the way
Coasting, blew another phat track
T-Dre and I are going to take it to the sky and see
Just what it's all about
Cause foos around my way are getting jacked for their clout
Throw a little bit of hype, coming up burning stripes
Peep game when you roll tight
Clowning with the locs in the lowrider
Macking to the hynas on the black trying to hi-side
But yo, I keep snapping, put my time in
And hopefully one day, drop the bomb and start rhyming
Flossing through the trucks like a freight train
Let her fly over one time, make a train and for myself, make a name
D to the slash, yo X about to show improve
Peace to my homies still cruising on the avenue
Hitting off ends on them triple gold Dayton's
Staying true to the game, busting caps, ain't a damn thing changed
But even though, I might not make a stay
I'm still giving love to them homies that love me back
So let the beat just ride
As we take a little trip to the 8-0-5
And I'm coasting
Coasting with the top down on a sunny day
I got the homies on the way
We're just coasting with the top down on a sunny day
I got the homies on the way
Bring it back, one more time for your friends
I'm hitting off ends on my ride, side to side
But be careful when you come to the dips
Take them nice and slow
And try not to scrape off the chrome tips
But anyways, back to the happy days
I'm gonna keep continuing the skill that pays
And relax, listen to the T-Double-E
Cause everything is alright in the S-M-V
8-0-5 coming back again
Deluxe and T-Dre kicking back, just cooling
With the J-C-C at a show
Joke is going to take to the next plateau
Let it ride as we take you to another stage
As soon as we hit the avenue, there's an outrage
People breaking neck as we pass by
Put it in neutral, hit the packs as I wave bye
But there's more thing I got to say before I ride
Lighter Shade, put your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye
While we take you for a spin
California lifestyle, C-O-A-S-T-I-N
Coasting with the top down on a sunny day
I got the homies on the way
We're just coasting with the top down on a sunny day
I got the homies on the way
Well it's 1995 and we hitting
Bumping in the studio, straight to your car system
Let the window down, hear me flow
Automatic on the floor for my SS '64
Hopping like a dog in heat
I got them hoochies on sight as we roll down the street
High signing, low-riding
I got the gin and some digits, now I'm gliding
You know the beat is on so lay back in the cut
While I, Deluxe, follow up with that punch
Let the system thump, drop the top and straight front
Cuause Cali Life Style's got the flavor of the month
Coasting, floating, hit the 3 wheel motion
Coming around the corner, got your back
Now straight boasting
Even though I'm coming kind of soft on this funky track
I'm still laid back and holding nothing back
For the simple fact, this on me and my crew
And for those foos' that were waiting
Lighter Shade, here's the I-O-U
It ain't through, it don't stop just like I told you
C-L-S is rolling out tracks and getting over
Coasting, aw yeah
Straight up coasting for the '95 season, you know what I'm saying?
Special shouts goes out to my homies at Excellence Car Club
Straight coasting down Broadway
I know my boy, Deluxe, is coasting
Yeah and we outta here
T-Dre's just coasting
Deluxe is just coasting
Raylene is just coasting in 1995!
Oooh
