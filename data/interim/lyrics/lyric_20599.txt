Ooh yeah
I love the way you wear those worn-out blue jeans
Walking all around in the big sunshine
Baby, let me believe that you're perfect
At least for a little while
And you don't have to tell me what you're thinking
You can keep all that to yourself
Baby, we got such a good thing going
Don't show me that you're someone else
'Cause I'm acting as if this blue sky's
Never gonna rain down on me
I'm telling myself this true love's
Never gonna leave me lonely
Unless there's something I've missed
I'm acting as if
We don't have to have that conversation
Baby don't you think it's going fine
We don't need to send out invitations
To tell the world that you're mine
'Cause I'm acting as if this blue sky's
Never gonna rain down on me
I'm telling myself this true love's
Never gonna leave me lonely
Unless there's something I've missed
I'm acting as if
As if your sweet kiss is never gonna fade away
And the way you look at me will never change
'Cause I love the way you wear those worn-out blue jeans
Walking all around in the big sunshine
'Cause I'm acting as if this blue sky's
Never gonna rain down on me
And I'm telling myself this true love's
Never gonna leave me lonely
I'm acting as if this blue sky's
Never gonna rain down on me
I'm telling myself this true love's
Never gonna leave me lonely
Unless there's something I've missed
Unless there's something I've missed
I'm acting as if
 oooh yeah
Oh I'm acting as if
