I'll have a blue Christmas without you;
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red
On a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear
If you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain;
And when the blue heartache starts hurting
You'll be doing all right
With your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
You'll be doing all right
With your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
I'll have a blue, blue Christmas...
