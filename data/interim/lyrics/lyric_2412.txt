My girl fell in love with a singing group
From England far away
She lost her mind, she lost her heart
When they began to play
"I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand"
And so my girl wrote a letter to The Beatles
Saying, "You're so fine
You can have my love to keep
Take this heart of mine" 
"Beatles, I'd give you anything
All of my true love"
But they wrote a letter back to her
Sayin' that ain't enough
You gotta send us twenty-five cents
For an autographed picture
One dollar bill for a fan club card
And if you send in right away
You get a lock of hair from our St. Bernard 
I want to hold your hand
So she wrote another letter to The Beatles
Saying "You misunderstood
It's you I love, it's you I want
To have and hold for good" 
"Beatles I'd give you anything
All of my true love"
But they wrote a letter back to her
Sayin' that ain't enough
You gotta send us twenty-five cents
For an autographed picture
One dollar bill for a fan club card
And if you send in right away
You get a lock of hair from our St. Bernard 
I want to hold your hand
So she wrote a last letter to The Beatles
And now my song can end
Others all around her makin' her life another heaven
Now my girl and The Beatles got together
And now she's my girl no more
But she wrote, "Dear Beatles
I love you very much" and furthermore
She sent them twenty-five cents
For an autographed picture
One dollar bill for a fan club card
And 'cause she sent it right away
She got a lock of hair from their St. Bernard
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
