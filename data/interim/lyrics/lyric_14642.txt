Don't mention where you've been
Or where you want to go
Don't tell me 'bout all your sins
'cause I don't want to know
I tried to give you everything
But all I got was nothing in return
Maybe I try too hard
And it don't seem fair
I keep telling myself:
Who needs somebody like you?
I don't need somebody to waste my time
Who needs somebody like you?
Someone like me
No matter how hard I try
You got your life and that's a fact
But I got my dignity
You may be happy with the way things are
But that ain't working for me
I don't ask for perfection
But I've got to know
Did you ever really care?
May be you are just a dream that won't come true
I keep telling myself:
Who needs somebody like you?...
Who needs somebody like you?...
I don't need nobody to tell me lies
Who needs somebody like you?
Someone like me
And now I'm wondering why
I keep comin' back 'til I can't take no more
Who needs somebody like you?
I don't need nobody to waste my time. ...
Who needs somebody like you?
I don't need nobody to tell my lies. ...
