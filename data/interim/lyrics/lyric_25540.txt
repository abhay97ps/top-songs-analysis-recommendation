Uh, huh
You niggas gon' end up in a hearse, hearse
You niggas gon' end up in the dirt, dirt
From the trenches, had to make it work, work
And these fuck niggas just gon' make it worse, worse
Arm , arm
Ho, that's in enemy arms 
Ho, that's in enemy arms 
Tear down an enemy's army 
Tear down an enemy's army 
Ho, that's in enemy's arms 
Ho, that's in enemy's arms 
I wish the enemy harm 
Huh, bitch, I'm a star 
Foreign lil' whip and I'm whippin' this car 
I might just park in the yard 
Catch the opps lackin', I rip 'em apart 
Fuck it, I got no heart
Show no emotions, I live in the dark 
I don't know why but that bitch left me scarred 
I don't know why you just ain't play your part 
Now you focused on wishing me harm 
Fuck it, right to bear arms 
I keep that stick on me, armed 
Under the enemy arms
I cannot fold under enemy arms 
Under the enemy arms 
Under the enemy arms
You niggas gon' end up in a hearse, hearse
You niggas gon' end up in the dirt, dirt
From the trenches had to make it work, work
And these fuck niggas just gon' make it worse, worse
War
I'm in this bitch with the gang
I'm in this bitch with the gang, ayy

Thirty, we gon' let it bang, ayy
Chopper, we gon' let it bang
Blowin' your brain, it's sad
Chopper, we gon' let it bang
Blowin' your brain, it's sad
