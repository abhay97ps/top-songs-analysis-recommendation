All in together now
Now, now cock and reload
-load up in the sound bwoy burial
Y’all, y’all drop and explode
-plode, -plode.  All in together now
Now, now cock and reload

Y’all, y’all drop and explode
-plode, -plode, -plode
Don’t let me erupt.  You will suffer the consequence
Delegate my regiment, run up in your resident
Adrenaline rush, want to hold a steel in my clutch
 bite the dust
I spit, penetrate your temple.  Projec-
-tile drugs propel from any angle.  Are you
Ready to die?  I’m ready to war, I’m ready to kill
I’m ready for anything a motherfucker’s got in store
L.I.F.E. God’s gift to mics, precise with mines, explosive
Come with percepts leaking corrosives that melt through
Poems.  Pro-hazardous material damages tracks
Leaving wounds.  Before it’s sewn, we got it stitched
And I’ll predict with a Professor-X-type wizardry: UBAD
Stronghold expose real, so put on your bifocal
Specs and magnify your vision, see past the average
Size.  Son, we’re brolic, heavy-handed, crushing
Got pours opening, gushing out sweat.  Rushing through the race
Leaving opponents gasping for breath, fighting for air
Original melanin guest up in the set.  Let’s barricade through
The bouncers and doors.  What you mean we ain’t on?  Yo, check the
Black lands

I’m a Zion resident.  I represent what’s Heaven-sent
I’m making plans to overthrow the president
I’ll smoke weed to illuminate my mindstate
Fuck the 9 to 5—increase the crime rate
I puff marijuana anywhere I wanna
Buckingham Palace or on the street corner ‘cause I
Represent the Most High, divine light
I shine bright when I rhyme tight ‘cause happi-
-ness is what it’s all about.  I’ll spit flames ‘til
My teeth start falling out.  Drinking Guinness Stout
Box the Devil in his mouth, read the Gospel
Move like a modern-day apostle, blow smoke
Out my nostril.  It’s hard to be righteous in the
Middle of these evil devices and high prices
The Earth’s been beaten, robbed, and raped.  And, yeah, that’s why
Judgement Day could never be escaped
Yo, yo, yo, I’ll keep
My mind elevated, the wars escalated
Maneuver with the tactics that’s unanticipated
Forget the nickel-plated ‘cause shot can’t gun the level
Of this battle.   from Day One, I left
One sound dead, two sound buried
Three sound pushing up dirt in cemetery for the
Most High, God, mothers, and the strugglers
Brothers in the pen for lamps and street-jugglers
Run down the song, make them 
The maniac of attack trap with raised fists
I don’t waste lyrics on clits, dicks, or

You need to stop
Going through the Motion.  We bring to a fever-pitch-
-type promotion.  Strong motherfucking holding
Treating these hoes like bowling—put these fingers in ‘em
Then I throw ‘em in the gutter.  Yo, I’m live.  If I
Came on the spot with my mother, Bed Stuy
Street webs is monster-sized.  Hands so tight around your neck
They’ll be fossilized—thirteen jaws 
Dig ‘em out, give ‘em Cookie Monster eyes with
An ego.  Olympic swimming poolside.  Mister
Wonderful Pen author equal to sticking your
Head out a copter—you’ll get your wig torn off
So stop playing.  Who you intimidating?
