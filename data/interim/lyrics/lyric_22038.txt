You said when the storm came
That you would be there with your umbrella to block the rain
And you said you'd protect me
From heartache, pain, lies, loneliness, and misery
You said you'll tear down the walls
That were in the way
You promised things would be okay
And I stood there in the freezing cold
And I waited for ya, but you never showed
Where you at? 
Boy you say you would be here for me
Where you at 
Now you said you'll go to church
Stop the slanging, find a real job and go to work
And you say you'd stay out the streets
And spend more time with me
Take away my doubt and fears
And fulfill my dreams
You said you'd be the shoulder for my eyes to cry on
Said you would be the one that I could depend on
And I stood there in the freezing cold
And I waited for ya, but you never showed, boy
Where you at 
Boy you say you would be here for me
Where you at 
And those false promises is much like fake names
You painted a picture for me but there was no frame
You made my future look bright and I believed every word
I went to sleep on the cloud and woke up in the dirt
And now I'm without shelter and the wind is blowing
You said you'd be there for me boy when the tough got going
Said if weapons formed you'd stand in front of me
When ever I felt trapped
Said you'd be the one to set me free
Thought you were my hero
But as it turned out you were no show
Tell me where you at
Oh, you said you'd be there for me
Where you at 
You said you'd be right there for me
And I can't see, see, see, see
You said you'd be there for me
So I'm waiting on ya right here until you appear and
Deliver deliver boy deliver
