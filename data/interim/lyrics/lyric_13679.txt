When I die and they lay me to rest
Gonna go to the place that's best
When they lay me down to die
Goin' on up to the Spirit in the sky
Goin' on up to the Spirit in the sky
That's where I'm gonna go when I die
When I die and they lay me to rest
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best
Prepare yourself, you know it a must
Gotta have a friend named Jesus
So you know that when you die
It's gonna recommend you to the Spirit in the sky
Goin' on up to the Spirit in the sky
That's where you're gonna go when you die
When I die and they lay me to rest
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best
Never been a sinner, I've never sinned
I've got a friend named Jesus
So you know that when I die
It's gonna set me up with the Spirit in the sky
Goin' on up to the Spirit in the sky
That's where you're gonna go when you die
When I die and they lay me to rest
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best
Goin' on up to the Spirit in the sky
That's where you're gonna go when you die
When I die and they lay me to rest
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best
Gonna go to the place that's the best
Gonna go to the place that's the best
Gonna go to the place that's the best
Gonna go to the place that's the best
