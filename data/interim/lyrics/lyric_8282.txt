Would you lay with me in a field of stone
If my needs were strong, would you lay with me
Should my lips grow dry, would you wet them dear
In the midnight hour, if my lips were dry
Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burnin' sand
Wipe the blood away from my dyin' hand
If I give myself too you
Will you bathe with me in the stream of life
When the moon is full, will you bathe with me
Will you still love me, when I'm down and out
In my time of trial will you stand by me
Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burnin' sand
Wipe the blood away from my dyin' hand
If I give myself to you
Would you lay with me in a field of stone
Should my lips grow dry, would you wet them dear
Will you bathe with me in the stream of life
Will you still love me, when I'm down and out
