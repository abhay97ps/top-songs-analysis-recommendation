Everybody sees this you
I'm the one that lost the view
Everybody says we're through
I hope you haven't said it too
So where do we go from here
With all this fear in our eyes?
And where can love take us now?
We've been so far down
We can still touch the sky if we crawl
'Til we can walk again
Then we'll run until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
Back to love, yeah
Back to love, yeah
Why did I change the pace?
Hearts were never meant to race
Always felt the need for space
And now I can't reach your face 
So where are you standing now?
Are you in the crowd of my faults? 
Love, can't you see my hand?
I need one more chance
We can still have it all so we'll crawl 
'Til we can walk again
Then we'll run  until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
Back to love, yeah
Back to love, yeah
Everybody sees this you
Well, I never wanna lose that view
So we'll crawl  'til we can walk again
Then we'll run  until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
So we'll crawl  'til we can walk again 
Then we'll run  until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly  until there is no wind
So let's crawl, let's crawl, let's crawl
Back to love
