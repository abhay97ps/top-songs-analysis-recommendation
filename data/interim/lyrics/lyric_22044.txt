Right right, turn off the lights
We gonna lose our minds tonight
I love when it's all too much
5 AM turn the radio up
Party crasher, panty snatcha'
Call me up if you are gangsta'
Don't be fancy
Just get dancy
Why so serious?
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks
Won't you come on, and come on, and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass!
Slam slam oh hot damn
What part of party don't you understand?
Can't stop coming in hot
I should be locked up right on the spot
Party crasher, panty snatcha'
Call me up if you a gangsta'
Don't be fancy
Just get dancy
Why so serious?
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks
Won't you come on, and come on, and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass!
My glass is empty...
That sucks!
So if you're too school for cool
And you're treated like a fool
You could choose to let it go
We can always, we can always
Party on our own...
So raise your
So raise your glass  if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks
 So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs,  we will never be never be!
Anything but loud
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks
Raise your glass!
Raise your glass!
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
