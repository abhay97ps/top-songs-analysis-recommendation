Oh, hither and thither and yon
Around the world I've gone
Searching for true love
As so many do
Hither and thither and yon
From Cairo to far off Calay
I traveled on and on
Seeking that someone
Who's heart wouldn't stray
Hither and thither and yon
Alas, I wondered
Through many a land
Too blind was I to see
True love was always close at hand
As close as you were to me
My journey is over
It's good to be home
Your face, I gaze upon
And darling, I wonder
Oh, why did I roam
Hither and thither and yon
Hither and thither and yon
Hither and thither and yon
