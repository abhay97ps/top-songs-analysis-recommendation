Mmm, mmm mmm mmm
Oh no no, mhm
We were together just the other day
Taking life for granted, passing time away
I was there for you, you were there for me
We would be together for eternity
I never knew there'll be sorrow
But I knew we'd be together tomorrow
Together forever, we were so wrong
Now I just can't believe that you're gone
And I'm so alone, alone
You never miss a good friend until it's gone
And I'm so alone, I'm so alone, yes I am
I really can't believe that you're gone, gone, gone
Life goes on, and it's not the same
'Cause I can't help sometimes calling out your name
But then I realize that you won't come around, no
Oh, what I wouldn't give to see your smile
Oh, yes, we've had our ups and downs
Oh, what I wouldn't do to have you cussing me out
I know it sounds funny, but what can I say
My life just ain't the same since you went away
And I'm so alone, alone
I miss you
You never miss a good friend 'til they're gone 
And I'm so alone, did you have to go away
I really miss you
Oh, I'm so alone
Oh, yes I am
I'm so alone
So alone
See, I never knew that there would be sorrow
But I knew we'd be together tomorrow
Together forever, we were so wrong
No, I won't believe
I just can't believe
I really don't believe
I'm so alone, , alone
I miss you
You never miss a good friend
I'm so alone
Alone, I miss you
You never miss a good friend
I'm so alone, alone
I miss you
You never miss a good friend
I'm so alone, alone
I miss you
You never miss a good friend
I'm so alone, I'm
I know you're in a better place, yes you are
Can my friends help me sing
Here I am
Can my friends help me sing
Here I am
See, when you need a shoulder to cry on
When you need a good friend to rely on
He's gonna be right there
When you're feeling down and feeling low
All you gotta do is talk to Lil' Joe, oh oh
This is Jason, you know I'm your best friend
And I love you, and I love you, and I love you
See everyone's loved and lost
And nobody wants to pay that cost
But if we all stick here together
We can make everything so much better
I appreciate having a friend like all of you around
