I've got a pocket
Full of holes
Head in the clouds
The king of fools
You've got a ribbon of rainbows
The sun in your eyes
Burning through
Could be I'm happy, I'm sad
Could be I'm losing my head
Over you
Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby 
To want a guy like me 
Yeah, you've gotta be out of your mind
Crazy
So, if I'm dreaming
Don't wake me tonight
If this is all wrong, I don't want it right
'Cause you're the one sure thing when I get lost in the game
Once again
Hey, I'm a lucky guy without a reason and I
Don't understand
Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby 
To want a guy like me
Yeah, you've gotta be out of your mind
Crazy  
Well, there must be some kind of mistake 
To give your heart away
Yeah, you've gotta be out of your mind
Crazy

Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby

To fall in love with me
Yeah you gotta be out of your mind
You're crazy
Crazy
Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby 
To want a guy like me
Yeah, you've gotta be crazy baby
