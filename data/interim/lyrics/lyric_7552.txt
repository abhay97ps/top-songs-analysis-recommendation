My man is a sweet man
My man is a kind man
I know he's a fine man
And he's mine, all mine
Whenever I need him, he's always around 
I don't have to go searching all over town 
He treats me nice and he loves me every day 
I'll tell the world that I'm proud to say
My man is a sweet man 
My man is a kind man 
I know he's a fine man
And he's mine, all mine 
He's home at night, I fix his food 
He's worked all day, he's in a tiring mood 
I cuddle him up
I give him a kiss or two 
I'm willing and able for whatever he wants to do because
My man is a sweet man 
My man is a kind man 
I know he's a fine man
And he's mine, all mine 
His heart is made of gold, his words are heavenly 
I feel like an angel every time he touches me 
To give him up, no, that would never work 
And if you girls fool around, somebody's gonna get hurt because
My man is a sweet man 
My man is a kind man 
I know he's a fine man
And he's mine, all mine 
Yes he is now
My man is a sweet man 
My man is a kind man 
I know he's a fine man
And he's mine, all mine 
Yes he is, girl
My man is a sweet man
