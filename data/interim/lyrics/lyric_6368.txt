Ann, oh, my dear Ann
You hit me in my face again
Ann, oh, my dear Ann
You made me feel a lonely man
You made me feel a lonely man
Ann, oh, my dear Ann
With your ice cold words
I just can't tell you how it hurts
Why can't we live with peace
Or must I beg you on my knees
Why can't we live with peace
Or must I beg you on my knees
Ann, oh, my dear Ann
I wanted you but
You've done it again
You made me your fool
But from the start
I'll play it cool
 2X
Why can't we live with peace
Or must I beg you on my knees
