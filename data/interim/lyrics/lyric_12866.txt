Oh, what do we have here? 
I am exactly where I said I would be last year
L-L-L-Lege Kale
My girl got an ass softer than cashmere
Thought I'd put that out there 
Alright, I'll stop fucking around
A hundred-thousand dollars gets you nowhere, nigga
Dreaded niggas used to fill the block where I was from, Mrs. Shell used to tell me never go there, nigga
Miami, with the palm trees, breeze, and the girlies keep the genis like they sisters with no tears nigga
Fuck it, I won't even go there with ya, all jokes aside, I'll go Colbert with ya'
If it wasn't for my sense of understanding and my humble personality, I'd probably get to mobbing on the set
My man caught twenty and a charge, he was robbin' with a TEC, having problems tryna find and give him checks
Momma, like granny, living on it too, be so proud of me for heading to the west, you know we riding to the death
Stress?  Don't even get me started, I ain't even close to going retarded, still starving
Used to be with some niggas that I thought was for the callin', called it "Charlie in the party", blindsided could've called it
Funny how these niggas jump ship and swim back, Khary couldn't have said it better, I just never would've thought it
Troubles of an artist, fuck it, crying over spilled milk never put a banquet on the table 
Proved that I could do it when they said I wasn't able, only got me charged up, I ain't even need a cable
Good Lord! Don't fuck around and get hurt, nigga! 
Heheh... KD, Based God, cursed niggas 
Wise, wise, wise, wise, wise, till I die, brody, just sign on me
Don't lie on me , sleep is the cousin of- "nah, homie, no reply, homie"
That's code and ethics, please respect it, they cannot change how the flows perfected 
Breath stays the same, still cold and reckless , niggas with no bread on the road to metrics
Men lie, women lie, numbers lie too , the only lies I've been told blindly
So I'm on my way to truth, nigga, you will not find me
When I was young , they told me don't look to the sun 
You'll go blind, or maybe they were scared I'd find out that I could run 
Oxygen inside my lungs  in a three-point stance 
So when they shoot that fucking gun 
When my album drops-  
When I leave that dock-  
Punching in the clock-  
When they're kicking rocks-  
In high school, I wouldn't listen to Lil Wayne
'Cause money over bitches just seemed a little profane
Till I realized, all the girls that I liked were really bitches
So ever since that moment I've been rapping kinda different
Born on the 28th, I'm a Libra, play it safe
And kill all the competition, make sure no one gets to race
Like I said in my other song, boy, who the fuck are you?
Don't keep pillows on my bed so I don't get too comfortable
I don't owe you shit, ain't believe in me
Everybody wants you when you're gold, we got that C3P
Gotta fight for your right like the Beastie Bs, angel in the dust like PCP
Tryna sell out in the MSG, tryna stay away from the MSG
Diabetes in my family, gotta live to see a Grammy
Tried to shit on me but didn't wash your hands, so I ain't taking shit you hand me
That's my modus operandi, I'm a savage, call me Randy
Fill my cup, call me Stanley, due to proper planning-
I mean, I mean I told you you wouldn't find me
I just... I went off the grid
I was just grinding
Yeah
Wasn't looking for the Captain back then? Well, you will not find a nigga
X marks the spot, yeah, I'm grinding, nigga
I ain't met Diddy yet, I am not no bad boy
Never been locked up, but I'm still shining, nigga
Me and Lege Kale like Megazords; combining niggas
This is not a scam or credit card; declining niggas
Whiskey on the rocks, so you gonna have to lime a nigga
I don't really fuck around with Amy-ass-whiny niggas
I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
Used to rap on that computer mic in that basement
Back in the basement
Swear you knew me from before, but I cannot place it
I cannot place it
Wait, wait that was you hating?
How you still hating? Bro, I am amazing
They moving so fast, I got nausea
I mean a nigga just got back from Austria
On my own, did a show front of thousands, crazy
Dropped out of college in Boston, bro
You ego-tripping but you call it bossin' up
Would be famous, but I do not floss enough, what is that costin' ya'?
I ain't get cuffed for the winter
Made a mixtape for the summer, let it simmer, ah!
You will not find me
You will not find me
You will not find me, yeah
