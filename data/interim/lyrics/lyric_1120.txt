Without a warning you broke my heart
You took it darlin' and you tore it apart
You left me sitting in the dark, crying
You said your love for me was dying
I'm begging you, baby, I'm begging you, please
Come on baby, come on please
I'm begging you baby, baby, please
Come on baby, baby, please
Turn on the light, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me
Let it shine, shine, shine, let it shine
I got a little lonely in the middle of the night
I need you darlin' to make things all right
A Little bit higher, just a little bit higher
