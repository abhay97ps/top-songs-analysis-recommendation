Spilling tea on the centrefold, you’re so beautiful
Got the taste of your tongue on mine
Colourised on a Polaroid, you try and act annoyed
You don’t know where your heart lies
I’ll turn the fucking lights off in your room
Leave the T.V on to set the mood
Hide your face in my sheets, pillow sinks in your teeth
You fucking Libra Sign
You’re such a Libra Sign
You fucking Libra Sign
You’re such a Libra Sign
I’m a Sagittarius, I hope that’s alright
And you should come out tonight
We’ll watch the stars shine so bright 
But fuck your star sign, i’ll let you meet the real me
So fuck your astrology, the things they say about me ain’t so fucking true
If you’re a Virgo, I ain’t fucking with you
Chasing stars is a waste of your youth, so think of something better to do
You fucking Libra Sign
You’re such a Libra Sign
You fucking Libra Sign
You’re such a Libra Sign
So just shut your fucking mouth, getting sick of all these lies
Break my heart once or twice, be "My Bloody Valentine"
I don’t know how the words in my mouth come to say
Bet you know who the fuck stole my car yesterday
So let’s meet up cause I think I like you, couple places that we could go to
Or we could a watch a movie in my room, but I know what you wanna do
You fucking Libra Sign
You’re such a Libra Sign
You fucking Libra Sign
You’re such a Libra Sign
I need you on my phone screen
Yeah, I broke my fucking phone screen
Down the back road with a cigarette, like a late night full of regrets
Wear my t-shirt, where my t-shirt?
No, i need that bring it right back
I said my phone screens broken and my heart’s still racing
Yeah, my mind’s still vacant, can’t you tell?
Liquor seeping through my veins, bitch, I feel no ways
Counting days, these hours passing by
And fuck that other guy
Just wanna see your smile but you’d rather see me die
I’m sick of feeling so shit i’m ‘bout to fucking cry
And baby, baby, baby am I gonna be alright?
Just promise me tonight
You fucking Libra Sign
You’re such a Libra Sign
You fucking Libra Sign
You’re such a Libra Sign
I need you on my phone screen
Yeah, I broke my fucking phone screen
