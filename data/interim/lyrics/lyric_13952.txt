You got me in a corner
You got me against the wall
I got nowhere to go
I got nowhere to fall
Take back your insurance
Baby nothing is guaranteed
Take back your acid rain
Let your TV bleed
You're jammin' me, you're jammin' me
Quit jammin' me
Baby, you can keep me painted in a corner
You can walk away, but it's not over
Take back your angry slander
Take back your pension plan
Take back your ups and downs of your life in raisin-land
Take back Vanessa Redgrave
Take back Joe Piscopo
Take back Eddie Murphy
Give 'em all some place to go
You're jammin' me, you're jammin' me
Quit jammin' me
Baby, you can keep me painted in a corner
You can walk away, but it's not over
Take back your Iranian torture
And the Apple in young Steve's eye
Yeah, take back your losing streak
Check your front wheel drive
You're jammin' me, you're jammin' me
Quit jammin' me
Take back Pasadena
Take back El Salvador
Take back that country club
They're trying to build outside my door
You're jammin' me, you're jammin' me
Quit jammin' me
Baby, you can keep me painted in a corner
You can walk away, but it's not over
Quit jammin' me
Oh, you're jammin' me
You're jammin' me
Quit jammin' me
Oh, you're jammin' me
