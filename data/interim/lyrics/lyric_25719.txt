I got 20 on my beat
Everybody know my name ringin' bells
Ringin' bells like the hallway 
I ain't gotta cap in no mothafuckin' rap
I'll whip out and air it out broad day 
I got in with that stick, and I'm with that
Break a nigga in half like a Kit-Kat 
I been tryna be positive, mama 
They ain't fuckin' wit' Jonathan, mama 
Who you know put they mothafuckin' self on the map
And now they don't owe nobody shit? 
I send one of my lil' niggas, come take you off
You get laid on the floor by a jit 
Got pulled over with fifty-five K in my pocket 
The police, they know I'm legit 
The police, they know I got sticks
They be worried about me, they know I'm a clique
These niggas, they know I'm a dawg
I ain't worried about him, I know he a bitch 
The next nigga that come play with me
I'ma send him to go ask 2Pac for a pic, bitch
They say I'm the hottest new nigga
Go check the thermometer, that nigga sick 
Nigga must have a fever or somethin'
Heard he was born up in Cleveland or somethin' 
Let me give you a history lesson
We moved back to Charlotte, 1999 
I ain't sayin that none of that matter
'Cause if somebody touch me, then somebody dyin' 
Why he talkin' so calm when he say that? 
How he make 'em rewind and replay that? 
Who you know get a fade once a week and they tryna get waves?
Fuck a mothafuckin' wave-cap 
Every time that the DJ play "Suge"
Niggas throw up they arms like a mothafuckin' racetrack 
Every time that my baby girl see me
She run and say "Daddy", I love when she say that 
Every time I hit one of my moves
All the bitches go crazy, they like how I do that 
I keep one in the head, if I don't let off first
I'ma dive to the side when I shoot back
Yeah, I'm comin' like Blade in this bitch 
Fuck around, and walked out in a trench coat
They gon' have to put me with the greats 
Wanna fuck with me, she gotta wait 
On the yacht, with me, me and the kids
There's four of us, we on the sea eatin' steak 
I won't go back and forth with a shrimp
You goin out sad 'bout a ho, I'm a pimp 
He keep bumpin' his motherfuckin' gums
We gon put his ass up like a mothafuckin' blimp 
Like to talk on the pillow wit' hoes, that's gon' get him exposed
He a mothafuckin' simp 
You know he got that thang on him, baby
Quit askin' him why that boy walk with a limp 
I don't care bout this mothafuckin' chain 
But I'll still bust your mothafuckin' brain 
Just got head on a mothafuckin' plane 
Ain't no cap in my rap, I'm the truth 
End up fuckin' this ho from the back
I knew her for a day, she on go, she the swoop 
And these niggas ain't livin' like that
Why he talkin' so gangsta? Your bro, he a fluke 
They know Baby gon' blow, he a flute 
They know Baby gon' blow, he the bomb 
They know Baby was just in Miami
Now he in L.A., nigga think he LeBron 
They know Baby go baby on baby 
But five years ago, nigga say he was John 
I touch down at the front of the plane
And the driver come pick up my Louis Vuitton 
While he drive me around, I be blowin' out pressure
I'm chillin' backseat with the iron 
And I'm done with this shit, man
I'm one of the best mothafuckin' rappers, man 
You know 
But I ain't gon' keep, you know, I mean, braggin' 'bout this
I'm done with this one, I'm the best mothafuckin' rapper, man
Quit playin' with Baby, man, do not play with me
I'm just exercising, I'm just exercising my craft, that's it 
And I'm not gonna keep sayin' this shit,  I'm done sayin' this shit
Uh
And I got 20 on my mothafuckin' beat, but this nigga can't engineer for shit
I'm 'bout to make this nigga just start makin' beats and quit engineering
A'ight, cut that shit off
