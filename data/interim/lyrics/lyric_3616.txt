Everyone who is lonely
I've got a place for you
Where the music play-ay-ay-ay-ays
Till way past two
Come along now, let's go down to the scene
Meet me down at the scene
You'll live just like a queen
When you're down at the scene
There's no need to be fancy
No one there will stare
Dress in all the things you usually do
There's no need to care
Come along now, let's go down to the scene
Meet me down at the scene
You'll live just like a queen
When you're down at the scene
Everyone who is lonely
I've got a place for you
Where the music play-ay-ay-ay-ays
Till way past two
Come along now, let's go down to the scene
Meet me down at the scene
You'll live just like a queen
When you're down at the scene
When you're down at the scene
When you're down at the scene
