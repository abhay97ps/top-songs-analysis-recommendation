I was talking, I was talking to a cat the other night
He said, "What everybody is looking for?
What everybody's looking for today?"
They're looking for escapism
Ain't it good to you? 
You know what? I love to get down, Jack 
And when I get down, you understand
I don't have to go into no funny bag
Say, ah, I do this, say what I want, say what I can
You understand, that's the way I feel
You know, I believe I'll get down right about here 
Byrd, if I get down, hey, you know
Byrdy, Byrdy, man, Byrd's gotta
Byrd's gotta, Byrd's gotta, I mean, Byrdy's got a out of sight tune coming up
We gotta record Byrd right here, you know 
So we're trying to get our thing out of the way before Byrd can get into it
Byrd, can we get down before we...?  Is it all right? 
Byrd, do you think it's gonna be a hit? 
Is it, you think it's gonna be a hit?
Well, I know it's a smash, I know it's a smash
'Cause you're in the bag, man, you're saying where it's at
You know, it's gotta be a hit 
You ready, Byrd? 
Get down!
Huh, ain't it good to you? 
Ain't it good to you? 
Ain't it good to you? 
Hahaha, huh
Looka here, what you say, Fred?
You better watch the man
I don't think they heard, what you say, Fred?
You better watch the man
Byrd , come over here, brother, let me tell you somethin'
You think we're talking too loud? 
Huh, I ain't got no dust, huh
I don't have to take it on the lam
Huh? 
Watch him, yeah, all right, you're right, yeah, yeah
Coming from some funny places, what you say, bruh?
Huh, trying to get down 
Well, you know, look here
We can't help it 
Ain't no alcohol, man, I don't dig it
What you say, Jasaan?
Excuse me, cap, while I rap
