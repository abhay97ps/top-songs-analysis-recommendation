Oh, put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin'
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
Ridin' high, when I was king
Played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
Walked away, wonderin' then
But easy come and easy go and it would end
So ah, any time I need ya, let me go
Any time I feed ya, get me low
Any time I see ya, let me know
But I planted that seed, just let me grow
I'm on my knees while I'm 
'Cause I don't want to lose 
I got my arms so spread
And I hope that my heart gets fed
Matter of fact, girl, I'm beggin'
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
I need you  to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again
An empty shell I used to be
Shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man but I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul
What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom, why da basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for da need to replace me?
Ya on a runway track from the good
I want to paint in the pictures any way we could, react
Like the heart in a trash where you should
You done gave it away, ya' had it 'til you took it back
But I keep walkin' on, keep rockin' dawns
Keep walking forward, now the court is yours
Keep browsin' halls, 'cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
Girl, I'm beggin'
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
I'm fightin' hard 
To hold my own 
Just can't make it all alone 
I'm holdin' on
Can't fall back
I'm just a con 'bout to fade to black
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
