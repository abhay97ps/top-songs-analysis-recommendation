You wanna step to me
I know you wanna do me
Come on, fellas, don't fight
That's right
Miss Bobbie, here I'm contemplating your body
Magazine covers, laying all over
Been undercover, drooling like rover
Imagine if I was to be your lover
I'd lick a little lower, take it a little slower
But actions speak louder than words
So I'll hush for now and let myself be heard
You're bound to make the same sound
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
Oh Bobbie, give me one night so I can hold you tight
Wet my apetite, make you feel just right
Roll from side to side, rub around your thighs
Check the merchandise, then try it on for size
Take a shot to find the spot that drives you nuts
I don't intend to stop till you drop
And when you do hit the lights so I can see those baby blues
You've got nothing to lose
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
Right now, he&121
So Bobbie, what's it gonna be?
Why settle for less when you can be with me?
I intend to do my best, forget the rest
So please, say yes, can't you see that I'm obssesed?
No girl can match ya
I dream about you and when I gotcha I ain't touching no one but you
But until that day, the kid will play, so 'ciao' for now
Got nothing more to say till the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
 Come here, let me whisper in your ear
 Ven acércate a mi
 Ven aca más cerca
 Ven que te quiero enseñar algo
 No tengas miedo, ven aca
 He esperado el momento por mucho tiempo
 Ahora si, sigue
 Sigue, sigue
 No pares
 Oh yeah
 Otra vez, otra vez
 Aqui pasamos toda la noche...
