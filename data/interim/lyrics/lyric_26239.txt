Seen my teens flew by in a coach seat
Since we all grown up, you tryna show me
What you tryna do now, huh
You played me once before, now you feel like you want me
Back when I took off, I'm a trophy
Back when I wasn't nothin', you was a trophy
Oh , yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh , yeah, yeah, yeah
Get it through your mind
Asked for all this time
Asked for all my time
I just think you fine, no, no, no
I'd like to tell you off 
'Cause I know you know, hmm
Days gettin' longer, and drugs been gettin' hard to find
You can steal with these eyes
I won't change my mind, no
Just because I'm all grown up 
I already chose up 
I was straight up tryna fuck 
Now I'm leavin', tour's up
But I can't change my affection
And I can't change my attention 
I don't think you know 
I still want my goal 
I still want my goal back 
Come on, baby, throw that 
I'm still checkin' for my throwback
Since my teens go by in a coach seat
And since we all grown up, you tryna show me
What you was tryna do now 
You played me once before, now you feel like you want me
Back when I took off, I'm a trophy
Back when I wasn't nothin', you was a trophy
No , yeah, yeah, yeah
No , yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
You used to want that nigga shootin' baskets in the posts, yeah
Now you want a nigga with three m's so he reposts ya
WiFi on your phone make the long distance seem closer
Used to sit up in your bed thinkin' that I forgot ya
You still got it in your head that I'm super caught up, I'm not
When the Patrón on, I start to forget, yeah, yeah
You let everything on your chest get to your head, yeah, yeah
Had a hard time turnin' twenty-five
Just because I'm all glowed up
I already chose up 
I was straight up tryna fuck
Now I'm leavin', tour's up 
I can't change my affection 
I can't change my attention
I don't think you know 
I still want my goal 
I still want my goal back 
Come on, baby, throw that 
I'm still checkin' for my throwback
Since my teens flew by in a coach seat 
And since we all grown up, you tryna show me 
What you was tryna do now 
You played me once before, now you feel like you want me
Back when I used to take off, now I'm a trophy
Back when I wasn't nothin', you was a trophy
No , yeah, yeah, yeah 
No , yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah
