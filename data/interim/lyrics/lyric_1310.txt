"...song, this is a very sad song, this next
Song we're gonna do
The song is so sad that sometimes I have to
Leave the stage and cry in the backstage a
Little bit while I'm singing this song
The reason this song is so sad because this
Story happened to me just a little while ago
And it was, it was a thing where I met this
This beautiful girl, right? was she a

And I gave her my whole heart, every every bit
And she gave it back to me a month later all

So terrible looking that
I Sold My Heart To The Junkman !
Now I can never fall in love again...."
Well I gave my heart to you, open, so open and trusting

 I sold my heart to the junkman
 I sold my heart to the junkman
I can never fall in love again
Oh and I know you took my heart, you thought that you
Could use it
When you gave it back like a toy
You broken and bruised
 I sold my heart to the junkman
 I sold my heart to the junkman
I can never fall in love again
Now, it was a movie sad scene, I played my part
Ooh I wanted the happy ending, but all I got was
A broken heart
 I sold my heart to the junkman I sold my
Heart to the junkman
I can never fall in love again
Now I swear it was a movie setting, baby I played my part
And all I wanted was a happy ending
But now I'm left with a broken heart
