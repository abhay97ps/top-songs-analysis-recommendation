Kiss me, sailor, before you go out the door
Well, now, bye bye sailor boy
Cause it's Anchors aweigh once more
Well, I'm his girl back home and, on a weekend leave
I'm the very first one that he runs to see
We find a lot of things to do
But pretty soon the weekends though and then it's
Kiss me, sailor, before you go out the door
Baby, bye bye sailor boy
Cause it's Anchors aweigh once more
There's never any place we ever wanna go
Wed rather snuggle up and watch the late, late show
We like to make the hours last
But 48 hours go fast
Kiss me, sailor, before you go out the door
Whoa whoa, bye bye sailor boy
Cause it's Anchors aweigh once more
Well, it's a Friday night, my favrite guy is due
I just can't wait to see him in his Na-a-a-avy blue
As soon as he opens that door
I'll be in his arms once more until it's
Kiss-a me, sailor, before you go out the door
Whoa whoa, bye bye sailor boy
Cause it's Anchors aweigh once more
