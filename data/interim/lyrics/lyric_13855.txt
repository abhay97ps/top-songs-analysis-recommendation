Well, I'm the Big Gipper and I'm here to say
That I'm the biggest rapper in the U.S.A.!
Yeah, my name's Ron with the D.C. Crew
Going on record with a rap for you
Push, push, into George Bush
Tip O, Tip O' Neal
I'm the Big Gipper, don't mess with me
I'm the baddest rapper this side of D.C
With my best girl Nancy as my spouse
Rappin' to you from that big White House
Nancy, Nancy...
Let's break, Nancy!
Jam on it!
They put Fritz up in '84
And though in debate, he seemed to score
I whipped him with a big landslide;
Now he's at Burger Town making fries
Met with Gorbachev in '85
To talk about how everyone could stay alive
And though he seemed to be a guy with class
If he doesn't play ball, we'll nuke his... country!
I'm the Big Gipper, don't mess with me
I'm the baddest rapper this side of D.C
With my best girl Nancy as my spouse
Rappin' to you from that big White House
Let's scratch...
B...B...B...Bonzo... Bonzo...
Bedtime for Bonzo...
Jam on it!
W...W...W...Well...
B...B...B...B...Bonzo
Well, I get up in the morning, and I have some toast
And Nancy and I take a ride up the coast
I'll sign a bill, then take a nap
This is what I call my Presidential Rap!
Well...
W...W...W...Well...
I'm the Big Gipper, don't mess with me
I'm the baddest rapper this side of D.C
With my best girl Nancy as my spouse
Rappin' to you from that big White House
Push, push, into George Bush
Tip Tip Tip Tip...
The current administration's socio-economical and political policies are in direct cohesion with that which has been facilitated
In other words, "Yes"...
Yeah, that's the ticket!
Awesome!
Well, I do and say just what I want
And with Congress, I always win
So, you better let me break
And you better let me rap
Or in '88, I'll run again!
I'm the Big Gipper, don't mess with me
I'm the baddest rapper this side of D.C
With my best girl Nancy as my spouse
Rappin' to you from that big White House
Awesome!
