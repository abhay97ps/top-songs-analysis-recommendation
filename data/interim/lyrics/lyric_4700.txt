I've been playing sunshine games
All  of my lonely life
I've  been playing sunshine games
All of my lonely life
Look around, look around, look around again
Look  around, look around, look around again
Hey  girl won't you come out to play
Come in the waters fine
Hey  girl won't you come out to play
Come in the water's fine
Look around, look around, look around again
Look around, look around, look around again
I've  been playing sunshine games
I've been playing sunshine games
I've been playing sunshine games
I've been playing sunshine games
All of my lonely life
I've been playing sunshine games
All of my lonely life
Look around, look around, look around again
Look around, look around, look around again
Look around, look around, look around again
Look around, look around, look around again
