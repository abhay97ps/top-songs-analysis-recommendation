Suddenly I fell in love
So deep in love
I can't recover
Suddenly you smiled at me
It had to be
There is no other
Can't explain the reason why
I love you, love you, love you, love you
Know that when it came to me
It came so suddenly
In my secret dreams of love
I pictured that first kiss
But my wildest schemes of love
Never fashioned this
Suddenly I took your hand
You held my hand
No words were spoken
Quietly we walked alone
And talked alone
Til dawn had broken
Found the words to tell you why
I love you love you love you love you
Know that when it came to me
It came so suddenly
In my secret dreams of love
I pictured that first kiss
But my wildest schemes of love
Never fashioned this
Suddenly I took your hand
You held my hand
No words were spoken
Quietly we walked alone
And talked alone
Til dawn had broken
Found the words to tell you why
I love you love you love you love you
Know that when it came to me
It came so suddenly
