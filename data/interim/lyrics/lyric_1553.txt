Let me tell you what's on my mind
There ain't no fooling I'm in love this time
Yeah, baby save all your loving for me
I want your kisses every night
His loving eyes and squeezing me real tight
Yeah, baby save all your loving for me
I go to bed, I can't sleep
It's got so bad, I can't count sheep
I toss and turn the whole night through
One of these days I'm gonna get you
I wanna tell ya what I'd like you to do
A love me, like I love you
Yeah, baby save all your loving for me
I go to bed, I can't sleep
It's got so bad, I can't count sheep
I toss and turn the whole night through
But one of these days I'm gonna get you
I wanna tell ya what I'd like ya to do
I want you to love me like I love you
And baby, save all you loving for me
Ya baby, save all your loving' for me
I want you to save, save all your loving for me...
