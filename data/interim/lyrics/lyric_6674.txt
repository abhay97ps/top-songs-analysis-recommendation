I remember
We were flying along
And hit something in the air
Laying here, looking at the ceiling
Someone lays a sheet across my chest
Something warm is flowing down my fingers
Pain is flowing all through my back
I try to move my arm and there's no feeling
And when I look, I see there's nothing there
The face beside me stopped it totally bleeding
The girl I knew has such a distant stare
I remember
We were flying along
And hit something in the air
I remember
We were flying along
And hit something in the air
Then I looked straight at the attendant
His face is pale as it can be
He bends and whispers something softly
He says there's no chance for me
I remember
We were flying along
And hit something in the air
I remember
We were flying along
And hit something in the air
Life is flowing out my body
Pain is flowing out with my blood
The sheets are red and moist where I'm lying
God in Heaven, teach me how to die
I remember
We were flying along
And hit something in the air
I remember
We were flying along
And hit something in the air
