I'm finna stand tall in it, I'm all in it 
You be on my back like a cardigan 
Call her again, I'm in love with your friend 
We be doing dirt, you hide the evidence 
It's evident that you ready to ride 
Hop up in my Jeep and put your pride to the side 
Go against the gang, you must be ready to hide 
Swangin' on the corner, bang my tape 'til it pop 
I thought I was a goner, pledged to your honor
Burn marijuana, these diamonds is on her
Hotter than the sauna, I met her at Salata
Bought lil' baby Prada, she popped it for the dollar
Don't stick around, you should save yourself 
But you can hit my phone if you need some help 
Don't stick around, you should save yourself 
But you can hit my phone if you need some help 
I'm finna stand tall in it, I'm all in it 
You be on my back like a cardigan 
Call her again, I'm in love with your friend 
We be doing dirt, you hide the evidence 
It's evident that you ready to ride 
Hop up in my Jeep and put your pride to the side 
Go against the gang, you must be ready to hide 
Swangin' on the corner, bang my tape 'til it pop 
I thought I was a goner, pledged to your honor
Burn marijuana, these diamonds is on her
Hotter than the sauna, I met her at Salata
Bought lil' baby Prada, she popped it for the dollar
Don't stick around, you should save yourself 
But you can hit my phone if you need some help 
Don't stick around, you should save yourself 
But you can hit my phone if you need some help 
I'm finna stand tall— 
I'm all— 
You be on my back like a cardigan 
We be doing dirt, you hide the evidence 
All—

You be on my back like a cardigan
