You say that you love 
All of the time 
You say that you need me 
You'll always be mine 
I'm feelin' glad all over
Yes, I'm a-glad all over
Baby, I'm glad all over
So glad you're mine
I'll make you happy 
You'll never be blue 
You'll have no sorrow 
'Cause I'll always be true 
And I'm feelin' glad all over
Yes, I'm a-glad all over
Baby, I'm glad all over
So glad you're mine
Other girls may try to take me away 
But you know, it's by your side I will stay
I-I'll stay
Our love will last, now 
'Til the end of time 
Because this love, now 
Is only yours and mine 
And I'm feelin' glad all over
Yes, I'm a-glad all over
Oh, baby, I'm glad all over
So glad you're mine
Other girls may try to take me away 
But you know, it's by your side I will stay
I-I'll stay
Our love will last, now 
'Til the end of time 
Because this love, now 
Is only yours and mine 
And I'm feelin' glad all over
Yes, I'm a-glad all over
Baby, I'm a-glad all over
So glad you're mine
So glad you're mine, now
I said I'm so glad you're mine
So glad you're mine, now
