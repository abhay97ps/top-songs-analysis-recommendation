I've made up my mind
I've got to get out in a hurry
I've stated my case
There's no need to come on with worry
'Cause I'm a real straight shooter
And my boot heels are clean
I'll always try to do better
I don't live in no dream
I live Down To The Line
You know I made it all right 
Stayed up all night 
It's the way to live life 
It's the way to live love 
Down to the line, down to the line
Sooner or later it gets you every time
Down to the line
I found me a way
To stand up this way without cryin'
Now they asked for the key
But they're complainin' instead of just tryin'
But I'm a real straight shooter
And my boot heels are clean
I'll always try to do better
I don't live in no dream
I live down to the line
You know I made it all right 
Stayed up all night 
It's the way to live love 
It's the way to love life 
Down to the line, down to the line
Sooner or later it gets you every time
Down to the line
