I've got a lover way over there on the mountainside
And I know that's where I should be
Don't you know I've got a lover way over there across the river wide
I can hear her calling to me
Oh, she's calling my name
So sweet so plain I can hear her saying
I'm on my way
I'm gonna stay
They tell me that the river's too deep
And it's much too wide
Boy, you can't get over to the other side
But they don't know I got to get there
And hold her in my arms just one more time
Like I did before when she was mine, all mine
'Cause I hear her saying
I'm on my way
I'm gonna stay
I'm gonna get to you
No matter what I have to do
They tell me that the river's too deep
And it's much too wide
Boy, you can't get over to the other side
But they don't know I got to get there
And hold her in my arms just one more time
Like I did before when she was mine, all mine
'Cause I hear her saying
I'm on my way
I'm gonna stay
Baby, when I get there, I ain't going nowhere
Ohh, 'cause a river ain't deep enough
And a mountain ain't steep enough
To keep me from your side
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
