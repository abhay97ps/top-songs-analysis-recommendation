Hello, stranger
It seems so good to see you back again
How long has it been?
It seems like a mighty long time
It seems like a mighty long time
I my, my, my, my, I'm so glad
You stopped by to say "Hello" to me
Remember that's the way it used to be
It seems like a mighty long time
It seems like a mighty long time
Yes I'm so glad you're here again
If you're not gonna stay
Please don't tease me like you did before
Because I still love you so although
It seems like a mighty long time
It seems like a mighty long time
I my, my, my, my
I'm so happy
You're here again
Seems like a mighty long time
Feel so good
To have you back again
How long has it been?
