A month of nights, a year of days
Octobers drifting into Mays
I set my sail as the tide comes in
I just cast my fate to the wind
I shift my course along the breeze
Won't sail upwind on memories
The empty sky is my best friend
And I just cast my fate to the wind
The month of nights, a year of days
Octobers drifting into Mays
I set my sail and the tide comes in
I just cast my fate to the wind
