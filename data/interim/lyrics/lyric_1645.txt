Your cheating heart will make you weep
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come the whole night through
Your cheating heart will tell on you
When tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You're going to walk that floor the way I do
Your cheating heart will tell on you
