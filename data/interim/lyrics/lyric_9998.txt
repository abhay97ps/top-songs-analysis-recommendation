Sitting at the bar
Talking to a friend
Sipping on some wine
Making time
Then our favorite record played
So I turned towards the crowd
And the dancing lady
Made me spill my wine
She was wild, she was free
She moved so temptively
Every guy had one question
On their mind
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Dances, dances
Finished up my drink
And was headed for the door
When I saw that lady
Giving me the eye
So we danced the night away
I hope that she will stay
And maybe I will find out
By and by
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Dances, dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
I hope she does it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
I hope she does it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances...
