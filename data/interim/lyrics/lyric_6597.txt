This is my love song
This is my love song to you
Hold my hand
Baby squeeze it tight as you can
Girl, don't ever let go 
Until I tell you to now
Look in my eyes
Baby, look into my eyes
Can't you see that I idolize
Everything that you do now
Let the beat stay
Just pretend 
Cause I got you and you got me
This is my love song
This is my love song to you
Oh, baby
This is my love song
This is my love song to you
Here's my heart
Treat it gentle treat is kind
Cause girl you'll never find
Another so driven so geniune
Give me your heart
I won't break it never miss you
Oh I can't afford to lose
The love I really need now
Let the music play
Make the world go away
Cause I love you
And you love me
This is my love song
This is my love song to you
Baby hold me in love
Baby, this is my love song
This is my love song to you
Baby hold me in your arms
This is my love song
This is my love song to you
