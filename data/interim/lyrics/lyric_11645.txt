Sleight of hand
Hand of Fate
Chance you take
Life's a snake
And it's all in the draw of the cards
Lightnin' strikes
Breath of life
Red, black or white
Watch 'em fall
And it's all in the draw of the cards
And it's all in the draw of the cards
Drop the cards
Watch the eyes
Down and dirty
Let 'em ride
Boulevard
Small cafe
Cavaliers
Pass the day
The joker laughs
From the street
He weaves his web
Bittersweet… bittersweet… bittersweet… bittersweet… bittersweet
Ace is high
Deuce is low
Take the first
The rest should go
And it's all in the draw of the cards
And it's all in the draw of the cards
Of the cards of the cards of the cards of the cards of the cards
Of the cards of the cards of the cards of the cards of the cards of the cards
Watch the cards… watch the cards… watch the cards…
