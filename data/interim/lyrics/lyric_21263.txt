Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh 
Whoa, oh
When I saw you over there, I didn't mean to stare
But my mind was everywhere, I wanna know you
Gonna guess that you're the kind to say what's on your mind
But you listen when I have something to show you
There's a mark above your eye, you got it in July
Fightin' for your sister's reputation
You remember people's names and valentines are lame
So I bring you flowers just for no occasion, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, I wanna know you
Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself, "Yeah, I thought so"
You smile, never shout
You stand out in a crowd
You make the best of every situation
Correct me if I'm wrong
You're fragile and you're strong
A beautiful and perfect combination 
Whoa, whoa, oh 
Whoa, oh, I wanna know you
Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself 
I like how you are with me
In our future history
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself, "Yeah, I thought so"
I thought so, ooh, whoa
Yeah, yeah
Yeah 
Yeah 
I wanna know you
Yeah 
Yeah 
I wanna go there where you go 
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road 
I'll sit back and say to myself 
I like how you are with me 
In our future history 
And maybe someday down the road 
I'll sit back and say to myself 
"Yeah, I thought so"
