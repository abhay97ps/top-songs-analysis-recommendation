What's so different? 
Baby 
What's so different? 
Yeah 
If you cheated on him
How I know you ain't gon' do it to me?
I need to tell you something
Check this out
You say you love me
But at one time you loved him
So what's so different?
Tell me if you were in my shoes
What would you do or think of me?
Would you trust me?
But you feeding me all this rap about
How it's different
But it's not mentioned what you're doin' is wicked
Now I'm having second thoughts about you and me
Cuz this not how I want it or it should be
You say you want my trust and
Told me you were leavin'
How am I to know that you won't do it to me?
You're tellin' me it's different
But what the hell is different?
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me
You're creepin' on him for me
But you say "just trust me"
How am I to know that you won't do it to me?
You're tellin' me it's different
But what the hell is different?
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me
Like the saying goes, you reap what you sow
And what goes around comes back around
To you five times harder
And I'm pretty sure that he's thinkin'
That you're totally his
But you're here in my rimmed-up drop top wit me
All hugged up and all over me
Kissin' all of me
Is that to get me where you want me to be?
Don't want this to happen to me
So I'll drop you off, go back to your man
Cuz really, this ain't me
Baby, uh uh uh, uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh 
Uh, Woo! Woo!
Don't tell him baby
You won't do this shit to me
Baby tell me one thing
How could yo do it?
What did he do to you?
Does he know he blew it?
Or is it just that
You wanna get even
Baby, if that's not it
Please tell me the reason
I just don't wanna
Get caught up in drama
If you don't want him
Just tell him, don't cheat on him
If you don't tell him
Me and you can't be
Cuz tell me how I'll know
You won't do that shit to me?
You would do it to me
