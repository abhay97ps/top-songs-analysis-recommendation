Lonely girl in silk and satin
Love has never known you
Lonely girl all dressed in sadness
Love will never own you
For you're afraid to stop, look, and surrender
You're afraid of love, torrid or tender
Once, I dreamed we'd share moments of splendor
Wish that I could have shown you
Lonely girl in silk and satin
Wish that I had known you
Lonely girl
Lonely girl
Wish I had known you
Wish I had known you
Lonely girl
