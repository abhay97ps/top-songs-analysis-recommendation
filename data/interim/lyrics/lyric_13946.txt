As the sun goes down on the Arizona plain
And the wind whistles by like a runaway train
Hey hey hey it's a beautiful thing
Well it's me and you and a flatbed truck
My heart kicking over like a whitetail buck
Hey hey hey in the middle of spring
You can cut me deep
You can cut me down
You can cut me loose
Don't you know it's okay
You can kick and scream
You can slap my face
You can set my wheels on a high speed chase
Hey no matter what you do
Wild horses could not drag me away from you
Wild horses could not drag me away from you
As the sky falls down from the midnight blue
Spittin' like bullets on a hot tin roof
Hey hey hey it's a beautiful sound
Well it's me and you in a flatbed truck
In a foot of mud just my luck
Hey hey hey a hundred miles out of town
You can call me a fool
You can call me blind
You can call it quits
Can't hear a word you say
'cause if I had you once
I'm gonna have you twice
I'm gonna follow my heart instead of good advice
Hey no matter what you do
Wild horses could not drag me away from you
Wild horses could not drag me away from you
