This cypher is brought to you by Genius, SSRec and RAID SHADOW LEGENDSSSSSSS
Told me to write on a cypher
I told them "fuck you"
And I pissed in my diaper
If you don't get laughed at, lucky you
But I'm making you fools a joke!
But there ain't even a croak
From the audience I hear nothin' spoke
You idiots, I'm funny, time to go smoke
But the old scroll foretold of old yellow and gold
And my finger skin is dried up, color of shiny mold
Scolded by my parents, stress makes me fold
Let's simply be honest, I am ya' LORD!
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Christmas on the way
All the kids gonna gеt presents, they prolly likе "Yay!"
I don't really care about the people that hate 
Emergency tsunami, yeah, I gotta navigate 
Y'all got the 4, well, I'm gettin' the 5 
Y'all get paid on a Monday, for me, it's every day 
Biden won the role, get that rubbish outta here 
Yeah, my crew been ballin' before the NBA 
Yuri on ice? Nah fam, Yuri Smith 
PGF, they innocent, I plead the fifth 
Haters used to love me, why you gotta switch? 
Actually, that don't phase me, 'cause I'm chillin with your-
Oop, can't say that 
Yeah, all yo mixtapes wack 
If you mess with the gang, yeah, time for payback 
Time for lots of combat 
Pullin' up with them straps 
Got so much bands 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, schlatt 
Ayo I'm AJRogers, verse number three, that's me!
As the year comes to a close I hope you have a wonderful Christmas
I know this year's been vicious but hear listen
Everything's gonna be alright 
So hopefully you see your loved ones and all of the lights
Down under in Victoria, we had dozens of cases a day
But now we're down to zero because of the heroes who stayed away
No matter how you go and celebrate the festive season
I just hope it gives you a reason to see within
That nothing comes for granted so keep your chin up 
Your fam, they could be gone any day
So try to cherish every moment with them before they fade away
Everyone's been through hardships this year there's no denying that
But we can get through the hard times it ain't all doom and gloom 
Uhhh... I went to the mat, saw a cat, it was fat
Damn! Killed it! Where's my record deal at?! 
I'm like Santa, sneaking in your house with a fat sack
He open the present, what's in it? A Glock that's gon' blow his cap back
If he mess with me he gon' get sleigh-ed
223 light up the room like a tree, feel the blaze
And my diamonds bright too
Leave him bleeding same color as Santa Claus' suit
Call me Krampus, I'm the Christmas monster
I'ma leave him waking up at a 2pac concert 
Silver bells out here they be ringing
Christmas choir, my chopper is singing
I'm smoking trees by a Christmas tree
5'1" thick girls, like some elves, they be missing me
It's Christmas time
And I'm on my final line
It's kinda like finals time
I'm studying, but more like "student dying"
Just became an editor like 14 days ago
But I spend my time writing papers, and I still got more to go
None of what I'm supposed to learn I cannot remember
It feels like it's been a decade but it's only November
COVID got me fucked up, I wanna return it to sender
Package up that bat, then burn it to embers
I'ma spend Thanksgiving at home
And Christmas all alone
And where I live, I'll be lucky to see some snow
If Santa gifts a vaccine, he better wear a face mask
If COVID tryna ruin us, it's coming up all aces
On the beat I'm a beast, like a dragon, I'm flyer
Sixth verse, it's a curse, all I do is spit fire
Still want the smoke? Add success to your wishlist
Your ego is fuller than a chimney on Christmas
Speaking of Christmas, it's that time of year
Family, friends, gifts, and holiday spirit are here
Christmas time, all I want is a machete
My stomach to fill up as I watch Hype William’s Belly
Stressing hard, Ohgeesy, this shit get Heavy
I impose we keep up with our mentals it’s a levy
My friend says he copped some green, calls it the the Grinch
He opened up the bag, all I could do is wince
Rolling up the weed, man it got a stench
Boutta start the hotbox, got my water for thirst to be quenched
Its the holiday season, you know I be freezin'
You switch on gang, we call that treason
My momma said stay inside but I didn't understand the reason 
All white cortez's, you know they be creasin
You know we be leaken 
My neck be lookin' like a blizzard
R.I.P LeRissa, I really do miss 'er
For those ***** that killed her better watch your back before I put you in my freezer 
They call it a holiday season, but this year I ain't feeling it dude
Can't even go outside man, now I am missing my old good hood
We were the good kids, now my friends be smokin' wood in the backwoods
And getting addicted to forex schemes, fuck it, it's ruining the mood
Remember the days when you and your homies used to share the food
And remember that one guy who never liked the frozen seafood
Now it's just calls for money, help and some never-ending feud
Wish you could go back in time and enjoy your sweet childhood.
Hey, listen up
Stop mixin' up
Opinons with oppression
'Cause it seems like we might be digressin'
Towards equality no matter how anyone decide to identify
And no, I'm not JK
Those who stand with that stupid bitch, fuck what they say
Would you look at me
Surrounded by people who are first degree and some who'll never get their first degree
It's just a matter of with which lifestyle you agree
Those who work hard to live life happy and free
Those who waste time and will end up in the world's debris
Or hose who brings their craft to a level of mastery
And those whose life stories will stay a mystery
Lucky me I know with which lifestyle I agree
Looked at as a role model
Because I got a medal
But all I do is force the pedal
Until I bend the metal
And I break the treadle
But I don't stop to repair
Nor to see if you care
So in envy, you can stare
At Success, you'll never share
It's not just a shimmer it's flare
So shut the fuck up life ain't fair
My name's Pixie Lee
And I guess verse twelve belongs to me
I may suck at rap
But I don't care about that
I've worked with enough rappers
To know rap is like being a mapper
I love Christmas 
Woah, wait
When's the release date?
Oh no, am I too early?
But those Christmas lights are so pearly
Let's stop singing Deck The Halls
And let me paint your walls
Second cypher I've done
And trust me, I'll do them all 
They said Christmas, Christmas time is here
That it's time for joy and time for cheer
I always thought it was time for beer
Sadly again, I was beaten by my frien
I don't rap, but they do
Children singing "I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus"
Can we just take a little pause?
Do you know how wrong it is?
Your thirty year old mother
Making out with a one hundred and thirty year old man
Fuck, I'm getting out of hand
Good luck, verse thirteen
Happy holidays from your favorite tween
I said, "**** a whip, I'ma ride in the sleigh" 
And I'm gettin' real holy, white linen for babe
Blood red like a nosebleed, you know I'ma slay
On read like don't know you, please stay out my way
Or just like the code when they tryna play
I keep it one hundred, look me in my face
They know I'm a problem, I always exceed
Whatever they need, I got it, won't give it
'Cause I'm not a Lord, and I'm unforgivin'
I hear the lies, they think that I'm with it
Burn you like the coal that you see on Christmas
닥쳐~ 시끄러운 오리
쓸모없는 소리
썰매 종소리, 들어 봐
꼬마 야, 엄마에게 울지마
Pixie said I'm unlucky
I got blessings, just trust me
Okay, Derex the 9, so I'm not here to pull it out
I'm tired of this beefing, I've realized all this I'm full without
No banging on your door, sorta like I came through the south
Playing to 21, but oh, this savage's on, look like I blew you out
I'm not sure if I wanna chase the cyan and gold
But I'm still not falling for the bait that my man was thrown
Just to- abort the call
Make 'em say it's like a cannon phone
Wait for them to find ya
When they grab the megaphone, asking "What happen though?"
If I'm being brutally honest, I will not let ya
Don't mess up
Front on my team, get this beam, no Quadeca
I'm next up, but I never choked, 'cause y'all needa confess stuff
I'm not responding to your subs, it's 'bout time that you step up
Start spitting this heat, looks like rappers the coal
Kidding, but it's a real treat how I found that they stole
Not quitting yet, still they stand up jumping out the goal
Tending to poke in, take this L, you don't want no smoke
I'll pop you like popcorn, I'm poppin', I'm hot 
Don't even do Christmas, I'm just smokin' the logs 
Set ablaze my cerebrum, that's what I celebrate 
I'm a catch, still you can't catch me, that's no debate 
Don't ever sleep, so I just roast the roosters 
On cruise control when I rhyme, coast with scooters 
You so dumb you can't even look sharp in 8K 
Charge 1K for every line, so you owe me 8K 
Christmas Eve, looks like rain, dear
Climate change, no snow, no cheer
Doing this to earth, yule be sorry
The next snow will come when I'm hoary
Christmas should be about the birth of something great
Yet we all sit here, getting drunk, gaining weight
People out there freezin', exposed to their fate
So think twice before you eat out and celebrate
Yo, white mike on the mic
Christmas ain't a day but a way of life
Leaving y'all rappers out in the cold 
While i'm sitting spittin' bars by my fireplace
Sittin' round table with the fam
Spreadin' that strawberry jam
I'ma wrap this up like a bow
Put you under my tree 'cause you just got 
I'm Crackar
You wack, uh
So, um..
私は今PS5を持っています... PS5フリースタイルも行うべきですか？
Да, время пришло, это Рождество
Пошёл запашок ёлки — как же хорошо
На улице свежо, падает снежок
Год почти завершён, вместе все поржём
Над прошедшим годом — баг системы, полетел первичным кодом
Сумасшествие детей, ведь все закрыли школы
Даже неизвестно сколько это будет ещё длиться
"Наденьте маску, это полиция"
Я не слепой, блядь, I see y'all gaming
Comme un nude d'Em Rata, annotera qui pourra
Mets ton Glorious à la poubelle comme cadeau d'Noël
C'est le S, le W, le O-N-O
When the baguette comes in, you know it's getting dutty
I'll kill this verse, hang it tight and call it noose-fi
Bringing the pain in, wit' my vro Voorhees I be Freddy
Put IQ in my purse, stack 'em like Alkalynity
A voice in my head, is shouting me names
Got less in real life than my internet friends
Ain't nothing but humor to put me to an end
They wanna put me in jail I Smash them in Fendi
Think twice if you're told you're not a good Ed
They're the same with "overrat" beforehand
I'm not innit for the money nor the fame nor the red
Burn Glorious to the ground like it is already dead
I translate an album a night wit' no cappuccino
Polemics and doubt, guess they'll call me TrappaChino
Don't deserve nothing, I'm at 18 months of yellow
But put respect on my name, I'm your French boy Swono
Damn, scumbag, it's comeback
I can't see where you at
This way of doing things isn't a variant
Verse is diverse, my voice is a curse
Write in cursive, ask for mercy
Everyone's flow is recursive
Yo, Kurt
Instead of shooting shit rather
Drink yogurt
I would join rather
Your cult
Of dairy product lovers
You know, Kurt
It's good
Ok
Brrrrrrrrrrr
Dooot dooot dooot dooot dooot dooot
Dooot dooot dooot dooot
Bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo bo
BOOM
Ayo
Steppin up to JP?
Man you must be trippin, dawg
Ain't trippin off the henny man
Its sake that im sippin, dawg
Im rappin all day
There ain't no time for intermissions, dawg
Makin good music, man
Thats my inner mission, dawg
They know im comin out for blood like im suwoop 
And my girl bad as hell so I call her Tsuyu
Asui, you got some beef wit me but I dont know you
Like saitama might just end your life if I fold you
I sleep wit the mac so
Guess i got the heated mattress 
Hit you wit the fire ball jutsu, i turn you into ashes 
Speakin of my matress
Thats where i took Erza last night
Prodigy shots make you levitate mine make you take flight 
They always say they be bangin but they really cappin
Man, my dope spoons darker than Micheal Blackson
Niggas mad cuz my bitch stay kawaii 
And my bars always stay fresh subarashii
Yeah, I guess this the start of my rapping career
All people gonna be like, "What the fuck's happening here?"
I know you hear me, I take it serious, man
On a Genius cypher with the wonderful Genius fam
Somebody tell Kanye, maybe he'll sign me
Maybe I'll meet Cudi one day, man, finally
That's Kids See Ghosts like they Ebenezer Scrooge
And this my Christmas carol for you, I'm out, poof!
Скоро новый год — под ногами лёд
На шее нету ice и я как будто borke
Все люди ловят кринж, ведь дед мороз — Пахом
Ёлочка блестит, пока я забыл про сон
I turn dust to roses like Velvetears, you can take it or leave
This is war, bad omens, you woke up the beast
My bitch bad like Phem, and I'm the grim reaper
I don't fuck with snakes, or cops, I don't fuck with you either
Y'all can call me Atlas 'cause I ride my own wave
Just listening to lofi, fuck it, I won't change
Bitches hit me up and get ghosted like Lando
Funny how after all this I still don't know where to go
Do I make you sick? Do you think I'm useless?
Or am I just another person who's sick of making excuses?
I can sense an evil presence so I call it Sophie Meiers
I hide out in the closet away from pricks and liars
Don't get mad at all this chaos 'cause I didn't start the fire
It's like I'm smoking on a blunt 'cause I just keep getting higher
I woke up for christmas to find this crappy shit
It appears to be a doki doki game i played it for a while
One girl snapped her neck, another hanged herself, one was a yandere , the other deleted all of them so thank you for that! 
The second present was, the best game of all time its called undertale
But it forced me to do genocide 
I got some plushies that broke apart easy
I played some fnaf but its not the same cuz my ex deleted the game ayy!
I went up stairs to listen to some good shit juice world, i wish i could meet him but too bad hes dead
Playing among us, literally one imposter among us, went to medbay this guy and i fot for a motherfucking day he said
Dude why you following me for god damn sake
Cuz you might be the killer dude just go do your task you fucking green ass hole
Then he saaaaaaid: don't stab me with that rusty damn knife
Never said i had one you green bitch
Bet you just wanna stab me in the guts i don't trust you, your pretty sus green bitch...
/green was the imposter/
Well... HES GONE
The next day just played these new games for no goddamn reason preat sure doki doki is treason
Have a good god damn christmas all you lil bitches!!!
2021, 2021, 2-0-2-1
Let me in, let me in, let me to the 2021
My weed be spiced up, my cake be sliced up
Go to the sunrise, check the new son rice
Only one in this xmas, Obi-wan my true father
I want to eat some grilled meat, i want to take new year present
Is this holdiay is good? Oh, of course yes!
Swag-swag-swag, dope-dope-drug
Foolfish day, but awesome noel rap, a
Celebrate it unforgettably, my dear friend, ya
Nevermind, ha, nevermind
Quando ho aperto gli occhi non ho sentito risate
Ma ho visto mille luci come di notte a Linate
Ho perso quell'aereo nel quale c'eri anche tu
Amore fidati di me, ora e per sempre sei il mio Artù
Ho perso mille treni
Ho perso mille voli
Ho perso mille sogni
Ed ora piango tra i lenzuoli
La notte sono sola perché tu sei andato via
Sono scomparsi tutti e questa casa
No, non la sento più mia
Mia ma' mi disse è tutto a posto
Mio pa' mi disse è tutto a posto
Ma io non vedo più sorrisi
Solo occhi tristi come a fine agosto
Mi sembra di impazzire
Questo mondo mi sta stretto
Ma troverò uno spazio mio
E lo farò perché l'ho detto
Qualcuno ora sta bussando
Ma non apro e non mi avvicino
Perché a scriverlo son io e non gli altri il mio destino
Davanti alle fiamme rosse dentro al mio camino
Chiudo gli occhi e mi faccio cullare dal vento come un bambino
Quando li riaprirò sarà ormai già marzo
Chiudo citando un santo Salmo: "Buone feste del cazzo"
Rapping fast, taken aback, oh god it's the King of the raps, the Master's back, king with a sword, a shield on my back
I'm in the black cat with a black mask, with my lyrical longevity, heavily, steadily, prepare for me, bear for me, carefully, scared of me, better me, pray for me, hate on me, carelessly
They pulling guns on the guy with the missile
Im bringing out the mac, while you bringing a pistol
They gotta write out their raps, i just mumble and whistle
They gotta try to find their wife, i just laugh while i kiss her
They gotta hate on the kid, taught em, now they calling me mister
They should be proud that the rap god fucked their sister
They should be proud that the rap god wanted to hit her
Just joking, i'll give your girl back, know u probably miss her
Just joshing i'm really like that, I put hits on the hitters
These kids ain't really like that, you just typing on twitter
I see the fake shit from afar, it ain't hard to dismiss
I could really rap for hours, but im writing my hit list
I could really turn from sweet to sour, and your female would lick this
Im giving you sons rap gifts, calling it rap christmas
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy
Gang, gang, gang
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ridin' with my chopper, ayy, ayy
I'ma beat him like his father, ayy, ayy
Ay, I love Christmas because it's really fun and cool
Get to see your family, but don't go in the pool
Opening some gifts that you've wanted all year
Drink some Christmas drinks and feel the holiday cheer
All the stores are closed, everybody's in the house
Old Kris Kringle is going to break into your house
He's gonna steal all your snacks and give you stuff you wanted
I can't think of a way to end this verse :/
Today

Merry Christmas everyone
