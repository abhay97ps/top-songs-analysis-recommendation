I'm true to the game, I'm doin my thang
If you made it this far
You're immune to the pain, immune to the rain
Immune to the losses living off top ramen, shoppin at Ross's
Now I'm doin big dog shit eatin like bosses
Now I go and tear the mall up I do this often
And I take of my momma this shit is awesome
And until I'm in my coffin imma keep ballin
My only fear is fallin
Long as I'm here I'm all in the money keep callin', no stallin'
I got to get it I come from poverty
Long as I'm breathin this shit gon be part of me
I'm tryna own some property real life monopoly
Hustle to hustle way I'm in the game like soccеr cleats
Ain't nobody stoppin me fuck a lot cause I got thе key
Crack it wide open for my people bitch we got to eat
My baby boy I got to feed a better way there's got to be
Million in my bank account before I die I gotta see
Trynna fulfill my prophecy they laughed now the copy me
Only God on top of me
Fuck Y'all
Step in my shoes you gon' understand my vision
Conditions of my livin we wasn't supposed to be winnin'
Told us shut up and listen 'cause they seen that we're different
Right then and there we made a decision and built a business
Everything independent Four Fifty-Four on my pendant
We did it right it's what they don't like They feel resentment
If it ain't directed it ain't respected I quickly debt it
By any means I'm gon' get it
My nigga look at where we come from
Got it out the mud with my loved ones
Run it up we gon' need it all you don't want none
Gotta bring it right back to the neighborhood I sprung from
Represent correct with every breath until my lungs done
Started out with nothing now we run our own company
Hundred dollar shows now we need a couple G's
Four round trip flights with a couple keys
We gon' pull up give the people what they wanna see
Quality sell itself take it or leave it
But I ain't budgin' bitch you buggin'
They don't make 'em this decent
If you owe me you can pay it in pieces
Just hope it reaches gotta reason
Just need some time to illustrate my thesis
Fuck the preachin' I just want the lights and the action
Don't compare me to these niggas I got twice the passion
Long nights in traffic not a second in vain
Take the good with the bad and I respect them the same
Lace the wood up with hash all I smoke is supreme
If it ain't Ninety-One or better then don't roll up a thing uh
Dope paragraphs doper than a pair of halves
Check your grip this shit so heavy most won't dare to grasp
The other half to scared to gas and just don't bear a chance
Pair of bands in every pair of pants
Go and get it or regret it can't go back and re-edit
Built an understandin' No more lookin' back 'cause we get it
I'm true to the game, I'm doin my thang
If you made it this far
You're immune to the pain, immune to the rain
Immune to the losses living off top ramen, shoppin' at ross's
Now I'm doin big dog shit eatin' like bosses
Now I go and tear the mall up I do this often
And I take of my momma this shit is awesome
And until I'm in my coffin imma keep ballin'
