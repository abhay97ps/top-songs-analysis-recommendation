If a strip a strip, you know you gotta say, "Take it off!"
Getting x-rated, now you gotta say, "Take it off!"
Shabba inna di place so just holler out, "Take it off!"
Sensuous emotion, they're gettin' my attention 
Staring up easy to find the right position 
Don't rush, don't hurry now 
Take your time girl, get it right 
And no need to accelerate 
Cuz we can kill the feeling
Keep it slow... 
And sexy 
Instant aphrodisiac for the lover man
Keep it slow...
And sexy 
Tell them say!
Man and woman no have the same luck
God create the woman dem fi get plenty - 
Food, clothes, and lots of luxury
Woman bring the fruit and society
Food, clothes, and plenty luxury
Can't make love on dem hungry belly
Give it up! give it up! the everlasting cup
From afar, man a say, "you fat 'til you buff"
Girls, them like it when I hold them tight 
Makin' love all through the night 
Take the time and do it right
Cuz we can kill the feeling
Keep it slow and sexy 
Instant aphrodisiac for the lover man 
Keep it slow and sexy 
Too much movement might hurt the back 
For the lover man, Shabba...
Sex is sex, sex is a realty
Teach it in university and college
Let it be safe, Let it be protected
If it be protected, the longer you live
Shabba and Johnny Gill, musically active
If it's music, our backitive
