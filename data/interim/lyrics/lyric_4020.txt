When the world was on my shoulders
And all hope for tomorrow was gone
You took my hand and, baby
You made me see
There's a future for me
I can make it with you, baby
I can make it with you
I can make it with you
By my side
And when all life had lost it's meaning
When my dreams had been shattered by time
You touched my hand and, baby
You made me see
There's a future for me, yeah
I can make it with you, baby
I can make it with you, yes, yes, I can, Lord
I can make it with you
By, by my side
I remember
When I was down
I've been lost
But I, I've been found, yeah
I can make it with you, babe, babe
And I can make it with you, oh, yes I can
I can make it with you
By, by my side
Ah, babe, baby
I can make it with you, baby
I can make it with you, yes, yes, yes I can
I can make it with you
By my side
Ah, watch me now
I can make it with you, baby
I can make it with you, yes, yes I can
I can make it with you
By my side
Oh, yeah
