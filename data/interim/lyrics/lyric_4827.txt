I've been crying for you
'Cause I'm lonely, so blue
Smiles have all turned to tears
But tears won't wash away my fears
That you're never ever gonna return 
To ease the fire that within me burns 
Keeps me crying baby for you 
Keeps me sighin' baby for you 
So why don't you hurry?
Come on girl, see about me 
See about you yeah, that's me 
I've given up my friends just for you
My friends have gone and you too
No more peace shall I find
Until you come back and be mine
No matter what you do or say 
I'm gonna love you anyway 
Keep on crying baby for you 
I'm gonna keep on sighin' baby for you 
So come on, hurry
Hey girl, and see about me 
See about you girl, that's me
