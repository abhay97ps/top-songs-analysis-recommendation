Pearl
One summer night with you
Will make up for the past
And the nights I never knew
Love, warm love
Just light the match
That lights my fire
Pearl, I'm burnin' with desire
With Pearl, with my girl
You comb my hair
With your fingertips
Kiss me with your pretty little lips
Oh Pearl
You're my girl
Pearl
Your smile brings on a glow
And deep inside my heart
I begin to know
Love, warm love
You strike the match
That lights my fire
Pearl, I'm burnin' with desire
Oh Pearl, you're my girl
You comb my hair
With your fingertips
Kiss me with your pretty little lips
Oh Pearl
You're my girl
Mmmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmmm
You strike the match
That lights my fire
Pearl, I'm burnin' with desire
Oh Pearl, you're my girl
You comb my hair
With your fingertips
Kiss me with your pretty little lips
Oh Pearl
You're my girl
You strike the match
That lights my fire
Pearl, I'm burnin' with desire
Oh Pearl, you're my girl
You comb my hair
With your fingertips
Kiss me with your pretty little lips
Oh Pearl
You're my girl
