Intro :
Ok....you said what you said
And you did what you did....for what
Just to blow up in your face
You got everybody thinking I'm the bad guy
It was you all along 
F.o.h
I be sleeping and she start beefing 
I be chilling and she start geeking 
I be smoking and she start chiefing 
She keep playing games
Chorus
 She keep playing games with my heart
She keep playing games with my heart
She keep playing games with my heart
And she keep playing games
Verse one
I shoulda let it ride
I shoulda let it go
I shoulda listened to my soul when it told me so
But I listened to that glow
And the way it made me feel
Vibing off every sound
Thinking every word was real
Normally im wolverine
My heart protected by steel
I bounce back off set backs
Take no time to heal
But this little bitch
She got me feeling the ills
Ready to kill
Ready to hang myself from the ceil
Yo she killing me
She killing me
I don't know why
Im just fading to black
Bleeding
Looking at the sky
Only truth that I got is that this world is a lie
And I wasted energy
Im a fool cause I tried
Im a fool for your lies
I don't want to be cold to you
I want to be close to you
It's like I sold my soul to you
I hate it cause I can't leave
I hate it cause I can't breathe
In this pretty hell
She said she love me but I can't tell
Chorus
Cause she keep playing games with my heart
She keep playing games with my heart 
She keep playing games with my heart
And she keep playing games
I say If she keep playing games with my heart
Imma go insane and let that thing spark
Bang to the brain
Bang bang to the heart
Cause she keep playing games
Verse two
It's so serious I don't think i can
Ever put this in some words for you to understand
It's like song you can't get outta your head
But instead
It's all the words that was said
Amped up to the red
With the echo on
My eardrums playing war songs
Why the ones that's always right
Be the most wrong
Do it look like I wanna fight
Bitch im too calm
And you're still that little girl pulling false alarms
Starting dram
Crying wolf to police
Saying im a deadbeat
Saying im a thief
Saying im a liar
Saying that im ugly
Saying everything in the book but you love me
It funny how the ones you not speaking to
You speak about the most
And the one sleeping with you
Beefing with you most
The ones eating with you
Cheating you the most
But you push me away
And you keep these people close
And you show these people love
And you treat me like im ghost
Like im really not there
Like you really don't care
Yeah I gave this shit some thought
Now im fully prepared
To cut this bitch short
Across the neck
Ear to ear
Chorus
Cause she keep playing games with my heart
She keep playing games with my heart 
She keep playing games with my heart
And she keep playing games
I say If she keep playing games with my heart
Imma go insane and let that thing spark
Bang to the brain
Bang bang to the heart
Cause she keep playing games
I say she keep playing games
I say she keep playing games 
I say she keep playing games
I say she keep playing games 
I say she keep playing games with my heart
And I shoulda seen that shit from the start
Back when I was focused on that cash
Before I got distracted by that ass
At first all I wanted was her ass
And then all I wanted was some cash
I knew deep down inside it wouldn't last
I knew deep down inside
I shoulda let it ride
I shoulda let it go
I shoulda listened to my soul when it told me so
But I listened to that glow
But I listened to that glow
But I listened to that glow
But I listened to that glow 
Outro
Bravo
Bravo
Bravo
Bravo 
What a performance
Somebody please give this bitch an oscar
And tell her to sit her dumb ass down
Thank you
Thank you
Bottom line is
People hate when you treat them the way they treated you
