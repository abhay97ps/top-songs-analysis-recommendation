You were hangin' your feet off
The tailgate of Billy Don's Ford
I grew up in this little bitty town
Never seen you before
You were swayin' in the moonlight
While the radio played
And I've
I've had that song in my head all day, yeah
It was a sweet Southern soulful thing
That got me down deep
You caught me starin' at you
But you smiled back at me
Started slingin' that air guitar
Man, you sure can play
And I've had that song in my head all day
I don't know who sings it
I keep searchin' the radio
I just wanna hear it
So I can watch that video
I got in my head of a blue-eyed boy
Dancin' in the bed of a two-tone Ford
Oh Lord, is it love?
I just can't say
I said, 'How 'bout an autograph for 'ya
Your biggest fan?'
You wrote your name and your number
In the palm of my hand
My heart and that big bass speaker
Were thumpin' away, and I
I've had that song in my head all day
