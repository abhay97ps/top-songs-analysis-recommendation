Pull back the cover
Shades, good God
It's a raid
Cut off the lights
And call the law
Cut off the lights
And call the law
Standing over there
The devil's son-in-law
Call the law
Call the law
The devil's son-in-law
Bring on the juice
Bring on the juice
Bring on the juice
Bring on the juice
Make me sweat, huh
Still good
It's still good
Still good
It's still good
