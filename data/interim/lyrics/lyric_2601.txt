You're my world you're ev'ry breath i take
You're my world you're ev'ry move i make
Other eyes see the stars up in the skies
But for me they shine within you're eyes
As the trees reach for the sun above
So my arms reach out to you for love
With your hand resting in mine
I feel a power so divine
You're my world you are my night and day
You're my world you're ev'ry pray'r i pray
If our love ceases to be
Then it's the end of my world for me
With your hand resting in mine
I feel a power so divine
You're my world you are my night and day
You're my world you're ev'ry pray'r i pray
If our love ceases to be
Then it's the end of my world, end of my world
End of my world for me
