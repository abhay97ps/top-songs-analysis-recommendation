We go where we like
We got over time
We get paid to rattle our chains
We go in the back
Paint our money black
Spend it on the enemy
Sleeping in the church
Riding in the dirt
Put a banner over my grave
Make a body work
Make a beggar hurt
Sell me something big and untamed 
Now our time, a real good time
Now our time, a real good time
Now our time 
A real good time 
Baby, you're mine
We know how to pray
Party every day
Make our desolation look plain
Riding in a rut
Till the powers cut
We don't even have a good name
Sleeping in the church
Riding in the dirt
Put a banner over my grave
Make a body work
Make a beggar hurt
Sell me something big and untamed 
Now our time, a real good time, ooh
Now our time, a real good time
Now our time , a real good time
Baby, you're mine
Doo doo doo doo, baby
Ah, ah, do do do
Now are time, a real good time oh
Now our time 
Real good time 
Now our time
Now our time, a real good time
Feel good, real good, it's the same old saying
Real good, feel good, don't got no more brains
Feel good, real good, it's the same old saying, yeah, yeah
Feel good, real good, I don't got no more brains
Baby, you're mine
