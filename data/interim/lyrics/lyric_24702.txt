When we
When we
Mmm
When we
Go
I like it when you lose it
I like it when you go there
I like the way you use it
I like that you don’t play fair
Recipe for a disaster
When I’m just try’na take my time
Stroke is gettin deep and faster
Screamin' like I’m outta line
Who came to make sweet love? Not me
Who came to kiss and hug? Not me
Who came to beat it up? Rocky
And don't use those hands to put up that gate and stop me
When we fuck
When we fuck
When we fuck
When we fuck
I could be aggressive 
I can be a savage 
I just need your blessin 
Say that I can have it, yeah
When we fuck
When we fuck
You love it when I lose it
You love it when I go there
You love the way I use it
You love that I don’t play fair
You end up callin me master 
Say this universe is mine
When we’re done it’s a disaster
End up like this every time
Who came to make sweet love? Not me
Who came to kiss and hug? Not me
Who came to beat it up? Rocky
And don't use those hands to put up that gate and stop me
When we fuck
When we fuck
When we fuck
When we fuck
I could be aggressive 
I can be a savage 
I just need your blessin 
Say that I can have it, yeah
When we fuck
When we fuck
Face down, ass up
Back, back, back it up
Lemme get both of them legs
And put em both behind your head
This shit is gettin deep, deep up in there
Feel your legs gettin weak up in here
Get a face full of that gushy, I’m close baby don’t push me, this is how it always should be when...
When we fuck
When we fuck
When we fuck
When we fuck
I could be aggressive 
I can be a savage 
I just need your blessin 
Say that I can have it, yeah
When we fuck
When we fuck
