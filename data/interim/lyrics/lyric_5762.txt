Once I believed that when love came to me
It would come with rockets, bells and poetry
But with me and you
It just started quietly and grew
And believe it or not
Now, there's somethin' groovy and good 'bout whatever we got
And it's gettin' better
Growin' stronger
Warm and wilder
Gettin' better every day, better every day
I don't feel all turned on and starry-eyed
I just feel a sweet contentment deep inside
Holdin' you at night
Just seems kind of natural and right
And it's not hard to see
That it isn't half of what it's gonna to turn out to be
'Cause it's gettin' better
Growin' stronger
Warm and wilder
Gettin' better every day, better every day
Ba-da-da-da, da, da, da-da, da, da
Da-da-da, da-da
And I don't mind waitin'
I don't mind waitin'
'Cause no matter how long it takes the two of us know
That it's gettin' better
Growin' stronger
Warm and wilder
Gettin' better every day, better every day
Better every day
It's gettin' better every day
Gettin' better every day
It's gettin' better every day
Gettin' better every day
It's gettin' better every day
Gettin' better every day
It's gettin' better every day
