Come here, baby
Closer, baby
Don't be touching me
Don't be holding me
Don't you understand
You're too much for me
There's a fire in me
You're a sinner man
With your devil lies
And your evil eyes
Oh, you know you can
Take the best of me
And the rest of me
Damn you, sinner man
You get this started and
There's never any way to stop
I don't know how to cool it down
Yes, you make it hot
I said: "No"
I said: "No"
I said: "No, no, no"
But it never does me any good
When you look at me
You start a fire
Touch me and my flames
Get higher
Don't be touching me
Don't be holding me
Don't you understand
You're too much for me
There's a fire in me
You're a sinner man
With your devil lies and your evil eyes
Oh, you know you can
Take the best of me
And the rest of me
Damn you, sinner man
Damn you, sinner man
Woo, sinner man
Over and over
You promise me your love will last
I have learned, I just get burned believing that
I said: "No"
I said: "No"
I said: "No, no, no"
But it never does me any good
There's something deep, deep inside me
I feel the devil
Sneaking up behind me
Don't be touching me
Don't be holding me
Don't you understand
You're too much for me
There's a fire in me
Damn you, sinner man
Oh, with your devil lies
And your evil eyes
Oh, you know you can
Take the best of me
And the rest of me
Damn you, sinner man
Damn you, sinner man
Don't be touching me 
Damn you, sinner man 
Don't be holding me 
Don't be touching me 
Damn you, sinner man 
Oh, leave me alone
Ohhh
I can't quit ya
Leave me alone
Leave me alone 
Oh, you sinner
Come on, take this fire out of me 
But you're still a sinner man 
Now leave me alone, leave me alone 
Damn you, sinner man
Damn you, sinner man
