I told her, "Fuck that nigga"
Woop-woop, uh
I don't know your name, but you heard my name 
I know why you came, tryna get that name
But you heard my name
Girl, I know you wanna be my main chick
My main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
I told her, "Fuck that nigga" 
We sittin' in the back of the club 
Table got a rope in the front, I don't know ya
Uh, you lookin' real familiar, I could just be a lil' drunk
I don't know your name, it's a Goddamn shame 
I don't know how to explain it for ya
But, girl, I'm just sayin' if you got a man back home, I don't know him 
What? Just keep it on the hush
Pocket full of trees, don't beat around the bush 
Walk on green, I could even hear the putt 
K.O. shawty when I hit her with a punchline 
Get a couple shots when it's crunch time 
Duckin' from my ex like a one time 
Throw a sign when you really tryna go
Got the car parked right at the door 
I don't know your name, but you heard my name 
I know why you came, tryna get that name
But you heard my name
Girl, I know you wanna be my main chick
My main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
I told her, "Fuck that nigga" 
Nah, and you don't know my name 
Just in case you the feds, I don't know ya 
Uh, I might'a poured you a drink 
But don't let it go to your head
I know why you came, tryna be my main chick 
Passenger side when I lane switch
Top back, two seats only 
Ain't no room for your friends, I don't know them 
We just seizin' the moment
Up all night, throw a deuce to the mornin' 
Fly motherfucker, everythin' is imported 
Don't try to act too important, I know your game
You got a gang of niggas
All over you, but you all over here , on me 
Girl, I ain't tryna dog ya
Bad bitch only thing I'll call you 
I don't know your name, but you heard my name 
I know why you came, tryna get that name
But you heard my name
Girl, I know you wanna be my main chick
My main chick 
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
I told her, "Fuck that nigga"
Baby, why you playin'? You heard my name 
 I know why you came
She gon' gimme that brain so we can do our thang
Let's do that thang 
What you think about me takin' you down here? 
I can be your man when he's not around, yeah 
I don't know your name, but you heard my name 
I know why you came, tryna get that name
But you heard my name
Girl, I know you wanna be my main chick
My main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
I told her, "Fuck that nigga"
