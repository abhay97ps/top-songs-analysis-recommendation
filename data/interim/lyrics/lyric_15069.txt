I've got the power 
Hey, yeah-eah
Like the crack of the whip, I Snap! attack
Front to back, in this thing called rap
Dig it like a shovel, rhyme devil on a heavenly level
Bang the bass, turn up the treble
Radical mind, day and night all the time
7:14, wise, divine
Maniac brainiac, winnin' the game
I'm the lyrical Jesse James
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, yeah-eah
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, getting kinda heavy
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda heavy
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda heavy
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda heavy
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda heavy
I've got the power 
I've got the power 
I've got the power 
I've got the power 
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic
Quality I possess, some say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh
Of the microphone that I am holding
Copy written lyrics so they can't be stolen
If they are, Snap! Don't need the police
To try to save them, your voice will cease
So please, stay off my back
Or I will attack, and you don't want that
