Do me a favor, pick me up, take me out later
Don't worry about no paper

My life can get crazy, I deal with shit on the daily
But baby, I'm thinking maybe
We could agree to work it out like this
I need you  to give me your time 
I need you  to not wanna be mine
Are you down to be a distraction, baby?
But don't distract me, let me ask you, baby
Do you, do you,do you do you wanna be

So I need you with me to keep me right and keep me up all night
We can get faded
This life can make you so jaded
So we can stay shaded just to us and try to get it right, oh
