I look kinda tired, baby, I'm kinda wornm
But there's something burning deep in my veins
I ain't no star, baby, I ain't no prize
But I see another lonely night in your eyes
You may not remember my name
But I think you'll remember tonight if you want to
You may not remember my name
But I think you'll remember tonight
I ain't special, baby, I'm just a man
Who don't look quite as good as I used to
I been around, baby, I understand
You can see by my face all the wars that I been through
You may not remember my name
But I think you'll remember tonight if you want to
You may not remember my name
But I think you'll remember tonight
Don't have much, baby, here's all I got
And even that ain't gonna last forever
I ain't trying to be something I'm not
I just wanna spend the night together
You may not remember my name
But I think you'll remember tonight if you want to
You may not remember my name
But I think you'll remember tonight
You may not remember my name
But I think you'll remember tonight if you want to
You may not remember my name
But I think you'll remember tonight
