Dreams are just dreams
When it's dark inside your head
And all it takes is a little help from you
You know it's true
That dreams are for real
When you see what I see
And you feel it too
We took the longest road
Just to make it harder
Let's do it all again
It only makes us stronger
Dreams
I guess we're just made of dreams
Nothing else matters
As long as we believe
I'm looking at you
And I see my life
Passing before my eyes
And when the journey's over
And all my dreams come true
I dream of you
What do you see
When you look inside your heart?
I live for can walk a thousand miles
And change your life
When dreams lead the way
The impossible is suddenly in sight
Every step you take just brings it all together
You gotta keep the faith
When all seems lost forever
You're the one
That keeps my hope alive
My vision clear
I'll spend my life with you
Conquer fear
We'll make it through
Nothing else matters
As long as we believe
I'm looking at you
And I see my life
Passing before my eyes
And when the journey's over
And all my dreams come true
I dream of you
I dream of you
