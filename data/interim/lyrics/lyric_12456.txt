Who do you
Girl, who do you belong to?
My point of view is
Girl, I think you're hot
If we talked
What words could I describe?
There's no dictionary book
To explain how you look
Girl, I think you're so 
Cold blooded
What more can I say? 
Cold blooded
The way you walk 
The way you talk, baby 
Mama, you're too cold for me 
Freaky baby
Who are you? 
Girl, what's your name and number?
Is it true
That you think I'm hot? 
If we try
To get to know each other
You might find
You couldn't trade me for another
'Cause I think you're so 
Cold blooded
In my dictionary 
Cold blooded
What more can I say, baby? 
Cold blooded
Holy smokes and gee whiz 
Cold blooded 
Baby, don't you know that you're too much? 
And you're too hot 
Don't you know you're like a candle?
I'm the only man that handles you 
Baby 
You're so hot, you burn me out
Just burn me up, uh
Baby, baby, baby, baby, don't be so cold blooded
Ooh, la-la-la-la, la-la

Cold blooded
What else can I say, baby?
