Well I keep holdin' on to yesterday
I keep holdin' on enough to say
That I'm wrong
I keep thinkin' that I'm lonely
But it's only missing you inside
Days that we were once together
Seems they'll never come alive
So I keep holdin' on to yesterday
I keep holdin' on enough to say
That it's wrong
Lord I don't know when I'll see you
I can't reach you anymore
If I'd only known I'd need you
Then I'd keep you like before
I keep holdin' on to yesterday
I keep holdin' on enough to say
That I'm wrong, wrong, wrong
To keep holdin' on
My yesterdays have all gone by
