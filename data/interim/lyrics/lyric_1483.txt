You can have this dance with me
You can hold my hand and
Whisper in my ear sweet words that I love to hear
Don't be shy 
Just take-a your ti-ime 
I'd like to get to know you 
I'd like to make you mine 
I've been wai-aiting, standing here so patiently
Fo-oh-oh-or you to come over and have this dance with me
And my number is Beechwood 4-5789
You can call me up and have a date any old time
Don't be shy 
Just take-a your ti-ime 
I'd like to get to know you 
I'd like to make you mine 
And my number is Beechwood 4-5789
You can call me up and have a date any old time
