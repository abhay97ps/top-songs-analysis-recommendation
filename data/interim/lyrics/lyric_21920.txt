Now I've had the time of my life
No, I've never felt like this before
Yes, I swear, it's the truth
And I owe it all to you
'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I owe it all to you
I've been waiting for so long
Now I've finally found someone to stand by me
We saw the writing on the wall
As we felt this magical fantasy
Now with passion in our eyes
There's no way we could disguise it secretly
So we take each other's hand
Cause we seem to understand the urgency
Just remember
You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something
This could be love
Because
I've had the time of my life
Never felt this way before
Yes, I swear, it's the truth
Owe it all to you
Hey, baby
Hey, baby
With my body and soul
I want you more than you'll ever know
So we'll
No
Yes, I know what's on your mind
When you say
Stay with me
Just remember
So I'll tell you something
This could be love
Because
I've had the time of my life
Never felt this way before
Yes, I swear, it's the truth
Owe it all to you
Cause I've 
 the time of my life 
 searched through every open door 
Til I found the truth 
 owe it all to you
Now I've
Had the time of my life
No, I never felt this way before
Yes, I swear, it's the truth
And I owe it all to you
I've
The time of my life
Never felt this way before
Yes, I swear
It's the truth
Cause I've had the time of my life
Til I found
The truth
And I owe it all to 
Oh woah-oh-oh-woah
Now I've
Had
The time of my life
