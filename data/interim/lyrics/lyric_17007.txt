I feel your touch
I can hear you voice
Can't you release me?
Your love has got a hold on me
You came into my life
I thought you were the one for me
Can't fight this feeling anymore
Release me
You got a hold on me
Can you release me?
You got a hold on me
Now I'm looking back
Realizing it could never be
But somehow you still got a hold on me
How could this be?
I'm fantasizing constantly
The way you touched me
The way you kissed me
The way you moved me
Release me
You got a hold on me
Can you release me?
You got a hold on me
Aqui estoy
Para decirte que por favor
Dejame en paz, no quiero amor
Sueltame
Siempre pienso en ti, como es
Que mis recuerdos siempre son de ti
Del amor que te di
Release me
You got a hold on me
Can you release me?
You got a hold on me
Release me
You got a hold on me
Can you release me?
You got a hold on me
