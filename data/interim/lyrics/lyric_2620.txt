Love is all we need
So won't you take me
In your arms and love me
Love me
Love is all we need
So, darling, press me
To your heart and love me
Love me
Tell me we'll always
Have each other
Cause that's all I
Ever want to know
Tell me there'll never be another
Cause I will always want you so
Love is all we need to make
Our every dream come true
So, love me, love me
All we ever, ever need is love
Tell me we'll always
Have each other
Cause that's all I
Ever want to know
Tell me you'll always be my lover
Cause I will always want you so
Love is all we need to make
So, darling, hold me close to you
And love me, love me
All we ever, ever need is love
