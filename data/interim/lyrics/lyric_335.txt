When I hold my baby tight
With all my might
I tell her I'm gonna never
Let her out of my sight
She says ta ta
Just like a baby
You know she fears no harm
When she's in my arms
With me telling her
All about her charms
She says ta ta ta
Just like a baby
Come here, let me bend your ear
Tell you of this love of mine
The way she soothes me
The way she grooves me
She's the only one
That ever moves me
She says it's good to have
A love to call your own
Instead of being in a crowd
Feeling all alone
And I say ta ta
Just like a baby
Come here, let me bend your ear
Tell you of this love of mine
The way she soothes me
The way she grooves me
She's the only one
That ever moves me
She says it's good to have
A love to call your own
Instead of being in a crowd
Feeling all alone
And I say ta ta
Just like a baby
