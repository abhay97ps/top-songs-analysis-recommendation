Last exit to Brooklyn, last chance to turn around
Last exit to Brooklyn, gonna keep these wheels of mine coverin' ground
Last night I caught that girl lyin', tryin' to deceive me
And now all of these tears she's cryin' I'm not buyin' you better believe me
She swore that she was mine alone, our love would never die
I'm leavin' now for parts unknown

The last exit to Brooklyn, gonna keep these wheels of mine coverin' ground
On the last exit to Brooklyn, the last chance to turn around
The last exit to Brooklyn, the last chance to turn around
The last
