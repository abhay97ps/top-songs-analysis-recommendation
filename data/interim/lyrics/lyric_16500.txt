You Better Wait
She was only a child
Someone to hold on
Only a child
Someone to believe in
Only a child, someone to love
She was "17", beauty queen
I met her in a magazine
Heart of fire, Love's desire
Reachin' out, higher higher
Runaway, one more day
A broken hearted child at play
I pray for you, baby blue
In the name of love I reach for you
In the darkness comes the evil of the night
Think about it
Stop your self before you fall
Stop before you lose it all
Somewhere there's love
Oh, somewhere, somewhere
Precious girl, little pearl
Temptation is lonely world
Eyes deceive, they believe
In everything they wanna see, yeah
And the neon lights reflect your life
Only you know where you hide baby
Stop your self before you fall
Stop before you lose it all
Cause somewhere there's love
Stop yourself before you start
Don't look back, don't lose heart
Don't look, don't look
Don't look back baby
Don't
Don't look, don't look
Don't look back baby
