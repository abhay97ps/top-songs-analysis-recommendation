Well walk the road of life together, day by day
And I will love you every step of the way
The road may wind beneath a sky of blue or gray
But I will love you every step of the way
So only love me, and love me only
And we will never walk with loneliness
For just as sure as every April turns to May
So will I love you every step of the way
So only love me, and love me only
... And we will never walk with loneliness
For just as sure as every April turns to May
So will I love you every step of the way
I'll love you only, every step of the way
