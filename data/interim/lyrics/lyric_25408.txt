 I took a couple of my dawgs on a lick
Do or die, gotta survive, pay the rent 
I was so broke that I could cry, I was sick 
Born in the wild, so many trials, I ain't quit
All the people I robbed, I brought 'em down, I repent 
Dirtied the money, I let it drown, watch it cleanse 
Sellin' these pounds, a hundred times I jumped the fence 
Breakin' it down, I made a pound turn to ten 
Them hunnids ain't found, they in the ground, don't get spent
They in the ground
Way back in the time, black and brown, you get lynched
Black and brown
We was talkin' him down, he make a frown if he flinch
Gun him down
See the pain in my eyes, I hold it down 'cause I'm rich
Hold it down
Livin' in the street, concrete, get rough 
Niggas tryna creep, we eat, gun bust 
Think about my history, back of the bus 
Fought for the rights, but we still killed us 
Tryin' not to be political, it was ridiculed 
'Member I was in the middle school, with a fit or two 
Mama had the boy by herself, it was critical 
Started with the weed, then codeine, then a pill or two 
Hit one lick, then I hit two 
Kickin' down the door, then I ran through 
Sticks in the van, this ain't bamboo 
I got rich bought some land for my kids too 
Take the risks for my fam, for some damn food 
Take my bitch out to France, out to Canc√∫n 
My wrist like a dam, you can splash, pool 
Money root of all evil, but the cash rule
 I took a couple of my dawgs on a lick
Do or die, gotta survive, pay the rent 
I was so broke that I could cry, I was sick 
Born in the wild, so many trials, I ain't quit
All the people I robbed, I brought 'em down, I repent 
Dirtied the money, I let it drown, watch it cleanse 
Sellin' these pounds, a hundred times I jumped the fence 
Breakin' it down, I made a pound turn to ten 
Them hunnids ain't found, they in the ground, don't get spent
They in the ground
Way back in the time, black and brown, you get lynched
Black and brown
We was talkin' him down, he make a frown if he flinch
Gun him down
See the pain in my eyes, I hold it down 'cause I'm rich 
Hold it down
Know some savages, they tryna clean up and they won't let 'em 
Streets done made my heart so cold, need a whole sweater 
I was kickin' in the back of doors but I know better 
You expose what you know, then you go get it 
Sow what you reap  , sleepin' on my feet
Trust fund for my daughter, son, daddy plant a seed
No bond when you do a crime, slavery repeat 
Slick minded, they think we runnin' a treasury 
Lost my homie, it keep on hauntin' me in my sleep
Lost my grandmama, whole family incomplete
Stabbed in my back a million times, this shit deep
I was hittin' licks doin' crime for my seed
Broke now I got 25 cars, it's a fleet
Take notes, make a bando turn Ferrari, I can teach
Struggled with the pain, but I still turned out a beast
I got out the chains, now the world belong to me 
 I took a couple of my dawgs on a lick
Do or die, gotta survive, pay the rent 
I was so broke that I could cry, I was sick 
Born in the wild, so many trials, I ain't quit
All the people I robbed, I brought 'em down, I repent 
Dirtied the money, I let it drown, watch it cleanse 
Sellin' these pounds, a hundred times I jumped the fence 
Breakin' it down, I made a pound turn to ten 
Them hunnids ain't found, they in the ground, don't get spent
They in the ground
Way back in the time, black and brown, you get lynched
Black and brown
We was talkin' him down, he make a frown if he flinch
Gun him down
See the pain in my eyes, I hold it down 'cause I'm rich
Hold it down
