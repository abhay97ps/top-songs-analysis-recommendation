We've seen some hard times, hard time
Holding it together ain't always easy
An angry man, hungry woman, driving each other crazy
It's so low down, show down, there's nothing else safe to say
Baby's on the town, baby's looking round, talking about walking away
Don't let go, got to give it one more chance
We've got to hold on, loving me may not make much sense
But I'm gone on you, baby, baby, I'm gone, and I want you back again
I may be wrong for you, baby, maybe I'm wrong but I love you just the same yeah
Now, we've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
Hard times, hard times, holding it together ain't always easy
Angry man, hungry woman, driving each other crazy
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
Through all those hard times, hard times
Holding it together ain't always easy
Hard times, hard times, holding it together ain't always easy
Face some hard times, hard times
Got to hold on, got to hold on
Face some hard times, holding it together ain't always easy
Hard times
