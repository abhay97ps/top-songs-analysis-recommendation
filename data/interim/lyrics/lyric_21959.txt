I'm gonna wear you down
I'm gonna make you see
I'm gonna get to you
You're gonna give in to me
I'm gonna start a fire
You're gonna feel the heat
I'm gonna burn for you
You're gonna melt for me
Come on, come on
Into my arms
Come on, come on
Give in to me
You're gonna take my hand
Whisper the sweetest words
And if you're ever sad
I'll make you laugh
I'll chase the hurt
My heart is set on you
I don't want no one else
And if you don't want me
I guess i'll be all by myself
Come on, come on
Into my arms
Come on, come on
Give in to me
I'll use my eyes to draw you in
Until i'm under your skin
I'll use my lips, i'll use my arms
Come on, come on, come on
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
