Yo
I'm a fuckin' beast, a disgustin' freak rapin' nuns and priests
Cause I've been violent since the day that I discovered peace
Never nothin' sweat, I murder snares and leave the drums deceased
My pen can rupture sheets, stab a song, and acupuncture beats
You're more then desperate, I forced the weapon in your direction
The forks embedded in your intestines your scorched and breathless
Now you're stored and kept in my basement cellar that's corpse infested
Born relentless experimentin' with different torture methods
I was rhymin' and makin' features while you were chasin' divas
I'm a rapper and great achiever, you can't relate to either
A sacred preacher, I'll take a cleaver and slice your facial features
Claimin' that you sick when you pussies couldn't even break a fever
I don't give a fuck about new cars and big chains
You can go to hell with your smooth talk and bitch claims
You should've known by now that my true bars inflict pain
I bring terror to beats when I drool sparks and spit flames
My words are wise, I rap hard, my flow is turnin' tides
You'll burn alive I sip liquor and like my Bourbon dry
I spit a verse of mine on the stage with the curtains wide
So quit sayin' that you gon' murder guys, you wouldn't hurt a fly
I keep the rhythm the way I kill it should be forbidden
The demon's risen, I'm lawless and don't believe religion
You'll be a victim when I stab creatin' deep incisions
So get familiar with fish because you gon' be sleepin' with um
This is Hip Hop, fitted hats and baggy jeans
This is hardcore, sippin' jack and passin' weed
This is head nod music, where the purple at?
Faggots better put their purses back this is Murder Rap
I'm the main attraction, your brains are bashed in until it stains the napkin
I'm bringin' what the game is lackin' this is dangerous rappin'
Your shameless passion's pathetic I can't refrain from laughin'
If I hear a track I'm takin' action, I'm a trained assassin
I'm in the booth with machetes, razors, and Tommy guns
I only rap over heavy base and atomic drums
A verse of mine could leave the optics in your sockets numb
We're all born with original sin so why should I stop at one
My lyrical ways causin' miserable fates
My criminal traits intimidate political snakes
So now I'm puffin' on the kush until my visuals fade
And takin' rap to put it back in its original state
I got a beat obsession which motivates me to write and seek progression
I spit key conceptions to release you from your deep depression
It's cause of rap that I don't need a weapon to release aggression
I bleed in heaven, I box with God, and I dream inception
I keep it comin' cause I know you fans in need of substance
Your speakers bumpin' from my vocals and obscene production
Bang the repercussions till you suffer from a beat concussion
You know sleep faggot? Yeah well you about to meet his cousin
This is Hip Hop, fitted hats and baggy jeans
This is hardcore, sippin' jack and passin' weed
This is head nod music, where the purple at?
Faggots better put their purses back this is Murder Rap
