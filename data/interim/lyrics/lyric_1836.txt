Oh, whoa,  no
Oh, whoa, yeah
Look at Killer Joe go 
Dancing with Marie 
He don't act like he knows 
She belongs to me
Look at how they Wobble 
He's the best in town 
I think I'm in trouble 
She forgets that I'm around
Yeah!
Oh, I'm so jealous
Hey, help me, fellas
Go on and tell her she should only dance with me-ee-ee
Uh!
Look at Killer Joe go 
Holding her so tight 
Putting on the big show 
With Marie tonight
Someone better tell him 
She is mine alone 
Just because he dance good 
That don't mean he take her home
Yeah!
Oh, I'm so jealous, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, help me fellas
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go on and tell her
She should only dance with me
Uh!
Look at Killer Joe go 
Stealing my Marie 
Someone better tell her 
She belongs to me

 Come back to me

 Good day, Marie
