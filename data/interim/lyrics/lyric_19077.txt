She can see herself in the shiny grill and the wire wheels
Of a red Chevelle, with four on the floor and the top down
Chrome
Zippin' by on an Electra Glide with dual tailpipes doin' 105
In the broad daylight, on a two-lane headin' out to town
Forget pink and purple paisleys
Little mellow-yellow daisies
Ain't no pot of gold, in her rainbow
Her favorite color is chrome

She got her leg up high on the bumper of my big black Mack truck
With a smoke stack pointed towards the sky, and mud flaps, you know the kind

I said hey little girl you sure look nice, do you wanna ride
I won't bite, she climbs inside, says hell no, I wanna drive
Forget pink and purple paisleys
Little mellow-yellow daisies
Ain't no pot of gold, in her rainbow
Her favorite color is chrome
It's chrome alright shiny, nice polished
Chrome, chrome
Forget pink and purple paisleys
Little mellow-yellow daisies
Ain't no pot of gold, in her rainbow
Her favorite color is chrome
Her favorite color is chrome
That girl is all about chrome
She sure loves chrome
