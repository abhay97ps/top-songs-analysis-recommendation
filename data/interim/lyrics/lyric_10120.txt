Take me to your place in space
I'm sick and tired of the rat race
On rocket ship, no time to wait
I just want to gravitate
It's out of sight
It's out of sight
It's gone
It's gone
It's out of sight
It's out of sight
It's gone
It's gone
I'll take you out to see the place
Where the man and the moon has a smilin' face 
You don't have to wear no fancy lace
Just a funky feel and a lot of taste
It's out of sight
It's out of sight
It's gone
It's gone
It's out of sight
It's out of sight
It's gone
It's gone
People movin' to and fro
To a sonic band, and a laser show
Superman, Batman, blowin' all night
Playin' one on one with a meteorite
It's out of sight
It's out of sight
It's gone
It's gone
It's out of sight
It's out of sight
It's gone
It's gone, gone, gone
Ninth dimension, seventh plane
Out here raising solar Cain
The star patrol said keep it down 
As long as we're cool, we can stay in town
And as long as we're cool, we can stay around
It's out of sight
It's out of sight
It's gone
It's gone
