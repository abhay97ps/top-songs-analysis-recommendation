I've just come down
From the Isle of Skye
I'm not very big and I'm awful shy
And the lassies shout when I go by
Donald, where's your troosers
Let the wind blow high
Let the wind blow low
Through the streets
In my kilt, I'll go
All the lassies say hello
Donald, where's your troosers
A lassie took me to a ball
And it was slippery in the hall
And I was feared that I would fall
For I had nae on my troosers
Now I went down to London Town
And I had some fun in the underground
The ladies turned their heads around
Saying, Donald, where are your trousers
To wear the kilt is my delight
It is not wrong I know it's right
The Highlanders would get a fright
If they saw me in the trousers
The lassies want me every one
Well, let them catch me if they can
You canna take the breaks
If a Highland man
And I don't wear the troosers
Donald, where's your troosers
Donald, where's your troo
Oh, well, that's the way
We sing the song in Scotland
But of course the song might
Have more international appeal
Sung something like this
One, two, three, four
Well, I've just come down
From the Isle of Skye
I'm not very big and I'm awful shy
The lassies shout when I go by
Hey, Donald, where's your troosers
Let the wind blow high
Let the wind blow low
Through the streets
In my kilt, I'll go
All the lassies shout, go, go
Donald, where's your troosers
Oh, man, I'm all rock and roll
And I'm a-moving and
A-grooving to save my soul
Grab your kilt and go, go, go
Hey, Donald, where's your troosers
Let the wind blow high
Let the wind blow low
Through the streets
In my kilt, I'll go
Oh, yeah, go, go, go
Hey, Donald, where's your troosers
Hey Donald, where's your troosers
Yeah, hey, Donald
Hey, just a minute
What are you doing there
Well just you stop rocking it
And moving it, man
The song should be sung
Just exactly like this
I've just come down
From the Isle of Skye
I'm not very big and I'm awful shy
And the lassies shout when I go by
Donald, where's your troosers
Donald, where's your troosers
