I can smell a bitch nigga a mile away
Type of nigga so bitch, he should put "bitch-made" on his license plate 
From that real shit you bitch niggas play hide and seek 
Me and bitch niggas, we don't conversate
Bitch niggas love saying real niggas tryna hate 
But nah, nigga, I’m a real nigga, I had to bag up weight
You got fear in your heart so you cooperate 
I can't stand how bitch niggas operate
You's a bitch , your mama know you a bitch 
Your girl even know you a bitch 
I don’t know how she suck your dick, pause
You got caught with some shit 
With your best friend and your clique 
Y'all got caught hittin' a lick 
Everybody went down 'cause you snitched 
Whoever raised you ain't do a good job at that 
Whoever raised you need to get slapped
Karma is a bitch and she gon' get you, nigga, just like that
'Cause once a bitch, nigga, always a bitch, facts
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, ho nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, ho nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, ho nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, ho nigga, bitch nigga 
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, ho nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, ho nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, ho nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, ho nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch niggas always contemplate
Always contemplate what on they tryna say
Bitch nigga leave the house, think he fly today
Bitch nigga don't even know what’s ’bout to come his way, bop
Bitch nigga, you should bleed for seven days
No testosterone, you scared to catch a fade
I got in a fight and you ain't fight
You ran off, so next time I see you, I’ll knock you out on sight
 Ayy, I don't want no rap beef
'Cause I'm really gon’ slide, check my rap sheet 
Ayy, so think twice before attacking me
I'ma pull a gun out, I ain't gon' run, I ain't no athlete
 You count the next man's pockets
You fall, pillow talking to that bitch, she a ho, you know she our's
I hate a bitch nigga, I hate a bitch nigga, I swear to God
I don't know what's worse, bitch niggas or alcohol
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, ho nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, ho nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, ho nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, ho nigga, bitch nigga 
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, ho nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, ho nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, ho nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, ho nigga, bitch nigga
