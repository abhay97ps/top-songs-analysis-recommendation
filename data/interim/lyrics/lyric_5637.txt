Is she looking at me
Is a feeling really happening
It's so easy to see
Something's on her mind
Is she really as free
As the girl that
She pretends to be
Does she know that I see
Something's on her mind
Will she find
A way to talk to me
Does she really
Want my company
Is she thinking like me
Does she wonder
If I'm wondering
Is she trying to see
Something's on my mind
I may be a fool
To let her go
But I can't begin
To tell her so
Does she wish he was me
Does she really
Want to be with him
Wonder if he can see
Something's on her mind
Something's on her mind
Something's on her mind
Something's on her mind...
