It's Britney, bitch
I see you
And I just wanna dance with you
{Giggles}
Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
Your public display of affection 
Feels like no one else in the room 
We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking 
We keep on rocking 
Cameras are flashing
While we're dirty dancing
They keep watching 
Keep watching
Feels like the crowd are saying
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
The center of attention 
Even when we're up against the wall
You got me in a crazy position 
If you're on a mission 
You got my permission 
We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking 
We keep on rocking 
Rocking 
Cameras are flashing
While we're dirty dancing
They keep watching 
Keep watching
Feels like the crowd are saying
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
I just can't control myself
Oh!
They want more?
Well, I'll give them more
Ow!
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Oo-oo-ooh!
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Give me more, yeah
Gimme 
Gimme, gimme 
Oh-oh-oh
Gimme more, gimme more
Gimme more, gimme more, babe
(Danja, Danja, Danja, Danja
Danja, Danja, Danja, Danja)
I just want more
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Bet you didn't see this one coming
The Incredible Lago 
The legendary Miss Britney Spears, haha
And the unstoppable Danja
Ah, you gonna have to remove me
‘Cause I ain’t going nowhere
