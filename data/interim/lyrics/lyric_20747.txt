We headed out to California
Everybody tried to warn us
Said we wouldn't make it any further
Than that worn out Chevy would
We broke down a time or two
Thought "maybe we didn't think it through"
We were all we had to turn to
When it wasn't lookin' good
We're lookin' back laughin'
'Cause they called us crazy
We were young, we were wild, we were restless
Had to go, had to fly - had to get away
Took a chance on that feelin' - baby
We were lovin' blind - borderline reckless
We were livin' for the minute we were spinnin' in
Maybe we were a lot of things
But we weren't crazy
Just a couple kids a couple years ago
Now we gotta couple kids of our own
We turn out right - proved them wrong
Look at us goin' strong
Lookin' back laughin'
'Cause they called us crazy
We were young, we were wild, we were restless
Had to go, had to fly - had to get away
Took a chance on that feelin' - baby
We were lovin' blind - borderline reckless
We were livin' for the minute we were spinnin' in
Maybe we were a lot of things
But we weren't crazy
Coulda set it down
When things got tough
Coulda walked away from this love
But that'd been crazy
We were young, we were wild, we were restless
Had to go, had to fly, had to get away
Took a chance on that feeling
We were lovin' blind, borderline reckless
We were livin' for the minute we were spinning in
Maybe we were a lot of things
Oh maybe we were a lot of things
But we werent crazy
We weren't crazy
We weren't crazy
