I'm coming, I'm coming, baby
I'm coming, comin'-come, help me
Make your baby understand
Don't try love, why don't
You take your man
Love can be a two-sided thing
You never get more than you can bring, hey
I'm coming, I'm coming, baby
Ooh, help me
I'm coming, I'm coming, baby
I'm gonna love you
Don't wanna break your heart
Back up and get ready
And give yourself a brand new start
I said I'm coming, I'm coming, baby
I'm coming, help me, baby
I can't get no, if you don't stone
Wig out, wig out, oh, hey
I can't knock it
Cause I need to rock it
This day or night
Yesterday was a long day
I missed you the wrong way
I'm coming, hey, coming, baby
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come
Coming, I'm coming, baby
Hey
Oh, help me, oooh
Oh, baby, I'm coming, hey, yeah
I'm coming, yeah
I can't knock it
I need to rock it
This day or night, baby
This day, this day, this day
I need to rock it, baby
This day, I'm coming
I'm coming, baby, oooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm coming, coming
Hey, I'm coming, coming, baby
Oh, I'm coming
