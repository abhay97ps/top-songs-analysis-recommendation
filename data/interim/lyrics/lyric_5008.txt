There is a tiny heartbeat
Hasn't seen the light of day
Her mama's only fourteen
Does she keep it or throw it away?
She says, her life's too crowded
This kind of trouble she don't need
So she hands the doctor money
After all it's not a human being
It's just bad news for a modern man
Bad news for the human race
When you turn your back on Him
Then evil takes His place
Bad news for modern man
Bad news for the human race
When you turn your back on Him
Then nothing but evil takes His place
Her daddy, he's a preacher
Who's wrapped up in his world
Her daddy knows his Bible
But he don't know his little girl
She feels our condemnation
She knows our spiritual pride
The church should care for the wounded
Not leave them on the street to die
That's just bad news for modern man
Bad news for the human race
When you turn your back on Him
Then evil takes His place
Bad news for modern man
Bad news for the human race
When you turn your back on Him
Then evil takes His place
Want the bad, bad news?
Will we live till 1990
Or will the bomb kill us all by then?
People go to war for the love of money
Human life is so cheap to them
Frankie say, Repent, get to it
We need a healing in our land
Light of the world, well, baby, you're in it
When will you take a stand?
Bad news for a modern man
Bad news for the human race
When you turn your back on Him
Then evil takes His place
Bad news for modern man
Bad news for the human race
When you turn your back on Him
Then nothing but evil takes His place
Bad, bad news
Bad, bad news, 
For the human race
You let evil take its place
You got bad news, you got bad news
Everybody lose, everybody lose
If there's nothing but bad, bad news
