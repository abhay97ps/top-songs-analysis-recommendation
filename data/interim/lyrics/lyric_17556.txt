If there ever was a perfect night
This just might be the one
For telling you the way I feel
And just how real we've become
If I'm anxious and a little uptight
It's because I wanna ask you this right
If I never stop loving you
Will you never start wanting me to?
Say you won't and that's what I'll do
For forever with a heart so true
If you'll start and end every day
Forever never wanting me to go away
All I'm ever gonna always do
Is never stop loving you
Please forgive me I'm a little bit nervous
I really rehearsed what to say
It's funny, in front of the mirror
My words sounded clearer today
In my heart I've got it straight in my head
I mean everything I think I just said
If I never stop loving you
Will you never start wanting me to?
Say you won't and that's what I'll do
For forever with a heart so true
If you'll start and end every day
Forever never wanting me to go away
All I'm ever gonna always do
Is never stop loving you
Even though it isn't what I had planned
I really think you understand
If I never stop
If I never stop loving you
Will you never start wanting me to?
Say you won't and that's what I'll do
For forever with a heart so true
If you'll start and end every day
Forever never wanting me to go away
All I'm ever gonna always do
Is never stop loving you
All I'm ever gonna always do
Is never stop loving you
