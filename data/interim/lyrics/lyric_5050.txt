A man can't do
No more than a woman'll let him
She won't make mistakes
If she knows she'll regret them
A woman'll stick by ya
Through thick and thin
And a  woman like this
I know I got to win
I know 
Honey, I know 
I know 
I got a sure thing 
Listen to this
Me and my baby been together
Through all kind of weather
I don't care what happens
We're always together
When I see her talking
To some fellow out on the street
When the conversation is over
She comin' straight home to me
Yeah 
Oh yeah 
I know 
I got a sure thing 
Listen to this too
I go to work in the morning
With a satisfied mind
Don't have to worry
About that woman I left behind
When I come home in the evening
My aching back she'll rub
Dinner's on the table
And my woman's in the tub
Oh 
Ha ha ha, I know 
I know 
I know 
Mmmm 
I got a sure thing 
Oh 
I know 
She's everything 
She's my woman in my dreams
