If kid Joe could he'd shit on the world
He has the tits of a girl
The most dirtiest kids in the world
Their like vomit you hurled
His wife is trife like an ogre that packs knives
She looks like a demon at the altar of sacrifice
A pagan from Gibraltar rockin a halter
Shes eatin Molotovs like theyre going out of style all of it
Kid Joe reps Dyker Heights he'll soon be rockin tights
Dressed up like a jester for the whole night 
Italian midget with a belly, Kathy got jelly
Polimeni's Khomeini in a Pelle Pelle
Stenches like Mordecai, sanitation odors
The hygeine of G not clean
Kid Joe don't know what clean means
Four times Four Nine times Nine
Let's talk turkey
Mathematics never entered his mind
He can't combine thoughts, but he goes to court
Devouring Kathy's putrid quarts 
His son is filthy, Joe's father hates him
Mercy game, he Curtsys
Rockin jester suits in a nursery
Polimeni Joe Dyker Height it up
Attica
Fifty smacks to his face when we're mad at her
He ain't a part of my family, but shim is
Fuck her, him, all a them
You murdered my business
Joe's tits grow by each inch
He got smacked
Now his face is red like a pinch
Like Mitch the Midget gettin lynched
Smackin hims a cinch, he won't do shit
He probably won't realize he got hit
Or at least if he does he knows it was done by his brothers
Kid Joe is known for rockin five hundred pound lovers
Fat monsters named Missile Mitchell Michelle
Gazelle Giraffe Sharell
Kathy ain't workin
She hasn't worked since thirteen
Since she jerked herself
Fuckin with Joe the worst thing
Having kids with him
He fucks pigs with double chins
With wigs that suck dicks
In the Bronx for five cents
Shout out to Joey Gotti
My man he takes shits
He rocks tits and takes flicks
Dykers The Matrix
Polimeni's an anus, five years in the box
He'll do five years with Kathy's crotch
Kid Joe is Satan he's Satan
Kid Joe is Satan Yo he's Satan
Dirty Satan, fuck the world
The world the world domination
Kid Joe is Satan
Hey Ronnie, I need to take a shit
Kid Joe is Satan
Polimeni
Kid Joe is Satan, Kid Joe is Satan
Dyker Heights
Kid Joe is Satan, Kid Joe is Satan , Kid Joe is Satan, Kid Joe is Satan 
Kid Joe is Satan,Kid Joe is Satan
My names Kid Joe, and I'm outta my mind
People think I'm insane, they didn't know I could rhyme
If I need to take a shit, I'll take a shit on the floor
