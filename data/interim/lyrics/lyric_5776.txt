The world that you live in is grooving
All the things on the street just a-moving
And every time that?
And you know that you got nowhere to run
Well, I wanna know
Do you got that funny feeling
Well, do you got that funny feeling
You walk? feeling funny
And you feel that you don't need no money
And you find that you're rocking and reeling
And you?
Well, I wanna know
Do you got that funny feeling
Do you got that funny feeling
Are you feeling groovy, baby
Are you feeling good
I can't get no sleep at night
