Know what I'm sayin', know what I'm sayin'?
Know what I'm sayin'?
Heard they talkin' shit 'bout I
Who, what, when and why? 
I'm alive, just took one to revive 
Keep that vibe when we show up and collide 
Me and the guys move just like the F-O-I 
In the Hills, but still keep them ghetto ties 
Was talkin' Frenchy's, but she thinkin' Ocean Prime 
Know she keep an open mouth and open mind 
I don't open up her door, she open mine 
I need less stress and I need more thighs, yes 
We on the jet quest, mobbin' with the tribe, yes 
In the headrest, one of 25, yes 
Ain't seen the best yet, open up your eyes, yeah 
One, two, three, four, five, that's the countdown 'til I slide 
Pork and rinds, how I grew up on my side 
Ain't no fence just a hundred acres wide 
When shit get tense, we twist up and we get fried
I picked my favorite dancer out then pay her rent 
At Christmas time it's no Saint Nick, we got the Grinch 
I smack that ass she threw it back in self defense 
We took the crib, flood the backyard like it's the beach 
We did some things out on the ways that we can't speak
All I know it was "Mo Bamba" on repeat 
I don't think these things I took is helpin' me 
I could bar up some more
Had to gather the foes
Had to count up the Os 
Had to summon the hoes 
Dodgin' federal 
I rolled through the light 
Rollin' the dice 
Rock all my ice 
Poppin' that coochie 
This down and groovy 
To get down, get groovy 
That bitch brown and choosey 
Shawty , in a supersonic 
Brand new LaFerrari , my bitch ride iconic
One, two, three, four, five
That's the countdown 'til I slide 
Pork and rinds, how I grew up on my side 
Ain't no fence just a hundred acres wide 
When shit get tense, we twist up and we get fried 
Was born in the movie 
Never make excuses 
It was time to move it 
It was God and the Uzi 
We were trained to use it 
They were trained to use it 
Shoot you like Cupid 
Hit your medulla, yeah
Shoot at, shoot at intruders 
Then shoot your producer 
Then she fuck the gang, get banged
And fuck on the group, she a groupie 
Love her when she choosin', hmm 
Big bankroll it's soothin', hmm 
Pull up with sticks in a Sprinter bus
I make 'em cuddle up, this not a movie
One, two, three, four, five
That's the countdown 'til I slide 
Pork and rinds, how I grew up on my side 
Ain't no fence just a hundred acres wide 
When shit get tense, we twist up and we get fried
