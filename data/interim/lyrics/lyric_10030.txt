Like a river flowing gently to the sea
It seemed so right when you came to me
And though we've tried babe
There's still something wrong
And tomorrow when you wake
Darling I'll be gone
There was a melody but the song came to an end
Though you're no longer my lover
You're still my friend
We both saw rainbows
When sunlight filled the sky
But clouds of gray got in the way
And I must say goodbye
Cause it ain't love
It ain't love
It ain't the feeling I've been dreaming of
It ain't love
And it's enough to make you lay your head and cry
When you tried so hard to make it right
And it's enough to make you close your weary eyes
When you realize your dream's gone out of sight
When I fell in love so tender and warm
Thoughtful words and poems and a feeling was born
But there's an emptiness somewhere deep inside
Why do we hurt each other thoughtlessly when the feeling has died
When it ain't love
It ain't love
It ain't the feeling I've been dreaming of
It ain't love
It ain't love
It ain't the feeling I've been dreaming of
It ain't love
