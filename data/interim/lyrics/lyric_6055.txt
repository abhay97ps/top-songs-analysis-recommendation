He is a lineman for the county
And he drives the mainroad
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singing in the wire
I can hear you thru the whine
And the Wichita Lineman
Is still on the line
I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman
Is still on the line
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman
Is still on the line
