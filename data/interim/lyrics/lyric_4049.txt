Left you at eight
Came back at nine
We still got love
It sure is fine
I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
C'mon now and open up your door
An hour can be
Such a long, long time
When your lips ain't
Stuck on mine
I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
C'mon now and open up your door
I said-a I
I said-a I
I said-a I
I said-a I
I said-a I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I wanna love you some more
I'm all on fire
My love ain't died
Got a big desire
And I ain't lyin'
I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
I said-a I
I wanna love you some more
C'mon now and open up your door
I said-a I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
