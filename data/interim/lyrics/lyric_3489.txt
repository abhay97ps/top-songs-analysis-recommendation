Look through any window, yeah
What do you see?
Smilin' faces all around
Rushin' through the busy town
 Movin' on their way
Walkin' down the highways and the byways
 Movin' on their way
People with their shy ways and their sly ways
Oh, you can see the little children all around
Oh, you can see the little ladies in their gowns when you
Look through any window, yeah
Any time of day
See the drivers on the roads
Pullin' down their heavy loads
 Movin' on their way
Drivin' down highways and the byways
 Movin' on their way
Drivers with their shy ways and their sly ways
Oh, you can see the little children all around
Oh, you can see the little ladies in their gowns when you
Look through any window, yeah
What do you see?
Smilin' faces all around
Rushin' through the busy town
Movin' on their way
Movin' on their way
Movin' on their way
