One light, two lights
Put a light
In your window
Don't let him see 
Pack your things quietly
Let him think you're asleep
Then signal one light
To let me know you need me
Two lights
And I'll come running to your side
Cause I'll be hiding in the bushes across the street
And all you have to do
Is signal to me 
Put a light
In your window
Don't let him know 
We'll slip away darling, darling
To some secluded place we'll go 
Signal one light
To let me know you need me
Two lights
And I'll come running to your side
Cause I'll be hiding in the bushes across the street
Come rain or shine
I'll be here til you're mine
Oh
One light
Two light
We fell in love by chance
Our hearts never planned this romance
Your mom and dad 
And your mom she's been 
Your dad won't let you go
So signal one light
Baby, baby when you're ready to go
Two lights
And I'll come running with a ladder swinging
Cause I'll be hiding in the bushes across the street
Some come on girl signal to me
 baby, baby I got my track shoes on
