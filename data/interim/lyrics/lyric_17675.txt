Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh
Oh-whoa
She was a friend of mine 
She left with my man 
She lied , cheated , took all I had 
She was a friend of mine 
She used what she knew 
She lied , cheated , and left me confused
I feel so lost
Don't know why this has happened to me, ooh
My closest friend
I never would have thought it could be
You were someone
Someone I really thought I could trust
But my man, you laid, and I'm betrayed
She was a friend of mine 
She left with my man 
She lied , cheated , took all I had 
She was a friend of mine 
She used what she knew 
She lied , cheated , and left me confused
Thicker than blood
Wherever there was me, there was you, ooh
My all was your all
But that wasn't enough for you
You had to see
And try to walk a mile in my shoes
In my head, in my bed
Betrayed by my best friend
She was a friend of mine 
She left with my man 
She lied , cheated , took all I had 
She was a friend of mine 
She used what she knew 
She lied , cheated , and left me confused 
You were my friend 
I gave you all I had 
Everything, everything that you'd want 
Oh-oh-ooh-whoa-oh-oh-whoa 
You were my friend 
Oh, my sister 
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah 
She was a friend of mine 
She left with my man 
She lied , cheated , took all I had 
She was a friend of mine 
She used what she knew 
She lied , cheated , and left me confused 
She was a friend of mine 
She left with my man 
She lied , cheated , took all I had 
She was a friend of mine 
She used what she knew 
She lied , cheated , and left me confused 
She was a friend of mine 
She left with my man 
She lied , cheated , took all I had 
She was a friend of mine 
Oh-oh, you're a liar
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh
