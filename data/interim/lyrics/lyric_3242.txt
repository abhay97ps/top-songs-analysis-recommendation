 get on your pony & ride; all right!
 get on your pony & ride; ah you're ridin' high!
Now stay in the saddle
 way west where the grass is green
 California, you know what I mean
 New York City & Detroit too
 on to New Orleans, the home of the blues
 now get ready
Now shoot!  Shoot!  Shoot! 
 to St. Louis where the girls are pretty
 Atlanta, GA, what a swingin' city
 Got to make it, that's for sho'
 Move on furthermo'
 now get ready
Now shoot!  Shoot!  Shoot! 
 All right now, stay beside me, stay beside me
 All right! 
...& fade
