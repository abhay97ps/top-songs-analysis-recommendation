Don't judge by what you see
There's a softer part of me
Girl, my life has been so cold
There were times I needed you so
Do you remember me
I was the one
I was the one who loved you long ago
Do you remember me
From the days when our hearts were young
Do you remember me
Look deep into my eyes
There's a glow you'll recognize
Girl, I can't change all the wrong that I've done
Time can't erase the love that we knew
Girl, do you remember me
I was the one
I was the one who loved you long ago
Do you remember me
From the days when our hearts were young
Do you remember me
I'm not a stranger, girl
More than just a memory
Do you remember me
I was the one who was wrong, no doubt about it
I was the one who broke all our dreams in two
I was the one who could never forget about you
Do you remember me
Do you remember me
Do you remember me
Do you remember me
Girl, do you remember me
I was the one
I was the one who loved you long ago
Do you remember me
From the days when our hearts were young
Girl, do you remember me
I'm not a stranger, girl
More than just a memory
Do you remember me
From the days when our hearts were young
Girl, do you remember me
I do remember you
Say you remember me
I'm not a memory
Do you remember me
From the days when our hearts were young
Do you remember me
I was the one
I was the one who loved you long ago
Girl, do you remember me
