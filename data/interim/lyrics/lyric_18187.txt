This woman that takes on the world
And picks up you shirts, keeps it together somehow
This same woman, that melts with your touch
Wants you to feel what I'm feelin right now
Chorus
'Cause this woman needs
A safe place to land
The strength in your hands
To know you know
What this woman needs
Is somewhere to cry
So lay by my side
And I'll tell you, I'll tell you
This woman needs to be reassured
That my heart's your home and love is what wills you to stay
I need you to see me in every light
And hear that you still think I'm beautiful anyway
What this woman needs
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, what this woman needs
Is somewhere to cry
So lay by my side
And I'll tell you, I'll tell you
What this woman needs
Yeah, what this woman needs
Yeah, yeah, yeah -
What this woman needs
