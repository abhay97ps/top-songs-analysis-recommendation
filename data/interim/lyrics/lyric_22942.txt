Ladies, it's your song, so as soon as this come on
You should get out on the floor, go and get your sexy on
If you know that you're better than the new girl that he on
Go 'head and tell him now, "You gon' miss me when I'm gone"
Ayo, CiCi
Let me show you how to do a singing bitch greasy
You was by Lenox, yeah, the one on Peachtree
I was with Dimitri, seen you on your Love & Hip Hop, Mendecees
"F-f-f-f-fuck these petty niggas" is a bitch motto
If I say it on wax, every bitch follow
If I'm sipping in the club, Myx Moscato
I got a big fat ass, big dicks follow
Hit them with the back shots, hit them with the ass shots
Take them to the bank then I hit them with the cash drops
I do it big, I hit them with the caps lock
I'm gonna ball, I hit them with the mascot
No, I never been there, but I like to Bangkok
Big fat titties when they hanging out my tank top
Huh, you gon' play me?
On Instagram, niggas tryna to shade me
But your bitch at home tryna play me
I'm Nicki M Weezy F, baby
Man, fuck you and your lady
Gun butt you, 'cause you shady
Now which bitch want it? 'Cause that bitch get it
I gave him to you, bitch, don't fucking forget it
I just went through a break up 
But it's okay, I got my cake up 
Do my hair, put on some makeup 
Trying to see where tonight gonna take us 
I post some pics up looking sexy 
Now this nigga wanna text me 
How much you wanna bet me? 
He gon' regret the day he left me 
We celebratin' our breakin' up, oh whoa
Bartender, go 'head and pour me a little more
Tonight we gon' have us a good time
Let's have a toast to our goodbyes, oh whoa
Ladies, it's your song, so as soon as this come on
You should get out on the floor, gon' and get your sexy on
If you know that you better then the new girl that he on
Go 'head and tell him now
"You gon' miss me when I'm gone" 
I'm out
 I'm out
I'm out
Now tell me, do my ladies run this? 
Not even Hammer can touch this 
We standin' up on all the couches 
Tomorrow you gon' hear about this 
This is what you hearin' through your speakers 
That's why we dancin' til our feet hurt 
See I found out he was my problem 
Tonight I came out here to solve him 
We celebratin' our breakin' up, oh whoa
Bartender, go 'head and pour me a little more
Tonight we gon' have us a good time
Let's have a toast to our goodbyes, oh whoa
Ladies, it's your song, so as soon as this come on
You should get out on the floor, gon' and get your sexy on
If you know that you better then the new girl that he on
Go 'head and tell him now
"You gon' miss me when I'm gone" 
I'm out
 I'm out
I'm out
The way I put it on you got you goin' trippy, trippy 
You wanna come for it, wishin' you could get it, get it 
No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o
No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o
I got you hot, make you stop when you see me, see me
You got your hand out, talking 'bout, "Gimme, gimme"
No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o
No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o
Ladies, it's your song, so as soon as this come on
Say "fuck these petty niggas" if these niggas did you wrong
If he got a new bitch, then tell that bitch "meet you outside"
And pop her like a molly 'til them bitches recognize 
Grinning 
I'm winning - the end and the beginning
I send them on an errand then I son them like my children
You couldn't get a fan if it was hanging from the ceiling
