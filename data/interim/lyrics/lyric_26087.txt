I told them niggas put me on, had to run it up on my own
They was actin' like they ain't hear a nigga
Now even when I'm right, a nigga wrong 
Now these niggas wan' see me gone
It's probably 'cause I'm a real nigga
Nah, I ain't trippin' on no bitch ass nigga
Be done had a nigga in a six-pack get a shit-bag, nigga 
The judge wanna see me sit back
But it's probably 'cause his daughter wanna fuck with her lil' thick ass
My rich ass don't kiss ass
I'm the definition of what these niggas can't find
Pistol packin', half the times dreamin' 'bout slangin' some iron
Ayy, how you feelin'? I'm chasin' money, tryna catch up on time
I ain't never change, I'm still the same, I'll put that Glock to your mind
Bitch, we die to live
Give a fuck 'bout no Grammy, long as my son grow to be real
That heavy metal I'm rockin' out, bitch, I'm known to that keep that steel
Since I was nine to this time, really done gave the jail too many years
But I'm a young rich ass nigga
Check how I floss, forever ball
Paid for a Rolls, my son got Lambos and all
I'm sorry, mama, I've been hurtin', I ain't takin' time out to call
Not even prayin', jump out the bed, I swear it's hard to stand tall
I told them niggas put me on, had to run it up on my own
They was actin' like they ain't hear a nigga
Now even when I'm right, a nigga wrong
Now these niggas wan' see me gone
It's probably 'cause I'm a real nigga
Today in life, it ain't nothin' like old days
I say money made everything change
Ayy, from my mans to my kids to myself
I say he forever capitalize off pain
Main nigga, big Rollie, big pistol
Top shotta, don dada, fuckin' gravedigger
We let them shots off at you and whoever came with you
While I'm takin' off, equip my brothers, that's a gang missile
Stripes
Nigga, I'm official, fuckin' a whistle, nigga
Life
They gon' have to give me, 'fore I let a nigga take mine, I'ma kill a hundred niggas
They say I'm remindin' niggas of Pac
Keep playin' around on that camera phone, they gon' find a nigga he shot
Dead, they call that FaceTime, nigga
Stay out the way, but I'll shake your whole gang 'fore you shake mine, nigga
Solo, pushin' the buggy in the store with the tool
And I'm pullin' up Lamborghini, pickin' up my daughter from school
We grew up fast paced, no big homies to show us the rules
I be havin' bad days when I don't want to take no photos, I'm rude
Like move
Ten times outta ten, if you ever see me, I be clutchin'
I'ma let it slang and pray to God, show me forgiveness when he judge me
I'ma try to aim that bitch between a nigga ears, he ever touch me
Can't trust a ho, even if these bitches really think they love me
Long as you know, never let a pussy nigga give me nothin'
Nowadays, a nigga really gettin' money, I remember back when
I told them niggas put me on, had to run it up on my own
They was actin' like they ain't hear a nigga
Now even when I'm right, a nigga wrong
Now these niggas wan' see me gone
It's probably 'cause I'm a real nigga
I told them niggas put me on, had to run it up on my own
They was actin' like they ain't hear a nigga
Now even when I'm right, a nigga wrong
Now these niggas wan' see me gone
It's probably 'cause I'm a real nigga
