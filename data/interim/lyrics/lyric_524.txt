Hey, mama, you better talk to Sue
She's doing the hoochi coochi coo
They're swirling in the kitchen
I know she'll get a licking
For doing the hoochi coochi coo
Hey, mama, you better come real quick
Tell papa to bring a hickory stick
She's shaking like she's breaking
And I know she'll soon be aching
From doing the hoochi coochi coo
She's spinning like a top
Shimmying with that steady rock
Dipping up and down
Then she go, round
Round and round
Hey, mama, what you you gonna do
Hey, mama, just look at little Sue
They're swishing in the kitchen
I know she'll get a licking
For doing the hoochi coochi coo
Spinning like a top
Shimmying with that steady rock
Dipping up and down
Then she go, round
Round and round
Hey, mama, what you you gonna do
Hey, mama, look at little Sue
They're swishing in the kitchen
I know she'll get a licking
For doing the hoochi coochi coo
