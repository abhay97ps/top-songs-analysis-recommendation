Thinking about you tonight
In a 3-D hotel room in Rome
Chainsmoking American cigarettes
And keeping my ear to the phone
Through the blinds to the street
My mind wanders
To the nights when I had you alone
Reality becomes science fiction
And my heart's in the war zone
If you won't free me
Riding in this rodeo
Juliet love tonight
With her vicious Romeo
For your love
I'd give you anything
The stars and the moon
And the sky above
Existing for you alone
And the moments we steal from each other
A millionaire I become
As you cry out my name
I'm your lover
I was travelling light
As I checked into
This heartbreak chateau
And there's no place for me in the sun
That doesn't cast a shadow
Whoa
Tower free me
From riding in this rodeo
Juliet's loves tonight
With a vicious Romeo
For your love
I'd give you anything 
The stars and the moon
And the sky above 
You say I'm your world
Well you are my universe 
You say that you want me
To get love's curse
I was traveling light
When I checked into this heartbreak chateau
And there's no place for me in the sun
That doesn't cast a shadow
For your love
I'd give you anything 
The moon and the stars
And the sky above 
You say I'm your world
I say are my universe 
You say that you want me
All you get's loveç®‚ curse
Give you anything 
I give you anything 
Shirt off my back 
A million bucks 
Cause I want you 
Tonight 
I want you 
Tonight 
I want you 
Tonight
I want you tonight
