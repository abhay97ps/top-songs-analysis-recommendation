You know you had me
With your sensuous charm
Yet you looked so alarmed
As I walked on by
In awesome wonder
You had to know why I did not respond to carry on
Love me in a special way
What more can I say?
Love me now
Love me in a special way
What more can I say?
Love me now
Love me now
'Cause I'm special
Not the average kind
Who'd accept any line
That sounds good
So reach into your chain of thoughts
Try to find something new
Because what worked so well for you before
For me it just won't do
Love me in a special way
What more can I say?
Love me now
Love me in a special way
What more can I say?
Love me now
Love me now
So reach into your chain of thoughts
Try to find something new
What worked so well with you before
For me it just won't do
Love me in a special way
What more can I say?
Love me now
Love me in a special way
What more can I say?
Just love me now
Love me in a special way
And tell me what more can I say
Just love me now
And tell me what more can I say
Just love me now
Love me in a...
And tell me what more can I say
Just love me now
