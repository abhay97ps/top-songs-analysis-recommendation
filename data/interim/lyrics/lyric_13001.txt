Oooooh! Ooh I'm searching for a better place
Oooooh! Ooh I'm tired of living in the sand
Oooooh! Ooh I'm searching for a better land

I don't wanna live in this place
Oooooh! Ooh I'm always trying to escape
Oooooh! Ooh I never know which road to take
Heaven, must be there-ere
Well, it's just got to be there-ere
I've never, never seen Eden
I don't wanna live in this place
Heaven, must be there-ere
Well, it's just got to be there-ere
I've never, never seen Eden
I don't wanna live in this place
Live in this place
Live in this place, this place
Oooooh! Ooh I want to find a better place

Well, it's just got to be there-ere
I've never, never seen Eden

Well, it's just got to be there-ere 
I've never, never seen Eden
I don't wanna live in this place
Heaven, must be there-ere
Well, it's just got to be there-ere 
I've never, never seen Eden
I don't wanna live in this place (fade
