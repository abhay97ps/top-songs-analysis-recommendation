Mujer, te quiero mucho
Nunca te dejo
You wanna know why?
'Cause Johnny is here to stay
Love, a special word that's shared by two
An understanding that I love you
Dream of all dreams and you are my fantasy
I feel that things won't always be right
We must remain strong and go on
Always remember, my love, that I adore you
Siempre te amo
You have got that love, I'm needing more
Even though we faced closed doors
I have but one wish and that is to love you
So don't you run away, run away, my love
And don't you take away, take away my heart
There's only much that I can say and do to you
To make you love me
Girl, an understanding of you and I
A love so precious, so treasured and true
Our love will stand the test of time to show
I'll always care, baby, just for you
I'll never let you down, you know
Sweetheart, you make me strong, for I'll be there for you
Nunca te dejo
You have got that love, I'm needing more
Even though we faced closed doors
I have but one wish and that is to love you
So don't you run away, run away, my love
And don't you take away, take away my heart
There's only much that I can say and do to you
To make you love me
You have got that love, I'm needing more
Even though we faced closed doors
I have but one wish and that is to love you
So don't you run away, run away, my love
And don't you take away, take away my heart
There's only much that I can say and do to you
To make you love me
