You can break away
Or you can stay
You choose your life
You're free to fly
Go on and fly
Go on and fly
She had it in her own time
To get away and try to find
Somewhere to go, to run
She saw the world through open eyes
And never let a soul inside
Don't come too close
So close
Baby thinks she's smart
But what about her heart?
Like a wild bird of prey
Like a thief in the night
You can take what you want
And you don't think twice
'Cause the world's in your hands
You got all you want
And you won't change a thing
You're the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one
Her soul was strong
Her heart was tough
And when she felt she had enough
She tore herself away
Love in the dark is all you see
Get what you want
Not what you need
You look the other way
Never letting on to what it's all become
Like a wild bird of prey
Like a thief in the night
You can take what you want
And you don't think twice
'Cause the world's in your hands
And you've got all you want
And you won't change a thing
You're the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one
Life is a dream
The lucky one
The lucky one
The lucky one
Oh, life is a dream
The lucky one
Life is a dream
The lucky one
The lucky one
Baby thinks she's smart
But what about her heart?
Like a wild bird of prey
Like a thief in the night
You can take what you want
And you don't think twice
'Cause the world's in your hands
And you've got all you want
And you won't change a thing
You're the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one
