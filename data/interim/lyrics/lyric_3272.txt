Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh
Loving you so
I was too blind to see you letting me go
Now that you've set me free
Chorus:
It's gonna take a miracle 
Yes it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
Cause I'm crazy for you
Ooh...
Didn't you know?
It wouldn't be so easy letting you go
I could have told you that
Now I know I can't get through to you
I'm gonna try to show you how much
You're turning me around, destroying me
I'll never be the same anymore
You must realize
You took your love and left me quite by surprise
You can be sure that know
