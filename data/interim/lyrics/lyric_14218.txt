Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes
Watchin' the ships roll in
Then I watch 'em roll away again
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide, roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time
Left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco Bay
I had nothin' to live for
Looks like nothin's gonna come my way
I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Gonna watch the tide roll away, ah
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time, yeah
Looks like nothin's gonna change, no
Everything, everything remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yeah
Looks like nothin's every gonna change, no
Lord, everything remains the same, yeah
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same
I'm sittin' here restin' my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
Two thousand miles, I roam
Just to make this dock my home
Lord, I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Gonna watch the tide...
Lord, gonna watch the tide roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Gonna waste... waste... oh Lord
Just... I'm gonna sit, gonna sit
