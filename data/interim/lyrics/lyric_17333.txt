Must be love
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love
Must be love
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love
Somethings got me upside down
And I never been like this before
Somethings got me goin' 'in and out
And I never moved like this before
Somethings glowin' 'round my eyes
And I never looked like this before 
Somethings brought this girl to life
And I never felt like this before
And Im sure that was something that happened to me
Must be love
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love
Must be love 
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love 
Somethings caught me by surprise 
And I never opened up before 
Somethings got me mystified 
And I never lost my cool before 
Somethings racing my heart beat
And I never lost like this before 
Somethings got a hold of me
And I never  touched like this before
And I know that was never is happening to me
Must be love 
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love
Must be love 
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love
Ah...whoa...whoa...ah...ooh... ah...eee...
Must be love 
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love
Must be love 
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love
Must be love 
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love
Must be love 
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love
Must be love 
It must be love, talkin' 'bout love
