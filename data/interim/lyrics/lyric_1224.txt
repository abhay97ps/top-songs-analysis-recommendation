Backwood burnin' money earnin’ motherfucker, I am
Nas, I am, Pac, I am, B.I.G., I am
Rap City on the basement, big Tig, I am
California king, I put that on my kids, I am
Tell Kendrick I passed the torch and I meant it, every sentence
Spoke to the crowd 'til the crown got passed down, I'm bitchin’
On the stage with Snoop and the Pound, that was so vintage
Long way from the crowd, I'm poppin'  benches
Like a hurdler, any lyricist murderer
Unless 3 Stacks or Blueprint, Jigga is on the verse with 'em
Your top 10 no match for my top 5
All you niggas is lucky, Will Smith after Pac died
Thug Life, west side, let one of you pop fly
I hold the Glock sideways like Ashanti's cocked eye
I look in my opp's eyes tellin' me not God
Make his body do the block boy and leave him lopside
I am dope at the border in the narco cop eye
I am chicken in the grill of a Cutlass like Popeye's
I am Jay, Dames, and Biggs while watchin’ the Roc rise
Nigga, you could shake the jar, just don’t let the pot slide
I am both of the clips in Drake's beat
Take advantage, fuck all of these bitches while Drake sleep
I’ma start with Keke and K.B., go up in 'em, 8 feet
Make her clit tick like an 8-peat
Never cross me, nigga, I am Jesus son
Shoot my shot at your bitch, I don't need no gun
I just roll a basketball emoji in her DM
Cum in her mouth, she was this close to bein' my BM
My BM’s crazy, my DM's brazy
I see them chicks in the Maybach whenever he in Vegas
MGM shakin', hollow-tip like he in Takers
I fuck around and put 3 in Satan
Hell on Earth since birth, I been flexin' for the turf
Black ghost through the hood like a pastor of a church
30Ms his net-worth, fuck 12, let 'em search
Nigga, I'm a Bad Boy in a Death Row shirt
I am all the littles Lil' Uzi, Lil' Baby
Lil' Wayne, Lil' Pete, Lil' Skies, Lil' Tay
Lil' Pump, Lil' Cease Lil' Boosie, Lil' B
I might pop a Lil' Xan and listen to a Lil' Reese
Give them papers a Lil' Twist, smoke my Lil' Thicky
Eat it to Lil' Kim, give her a Lil' Dicky
Lil' J and Lil' Fears, money off that Lil' Yachty
Lil' Debbie go a Lil' Cray when she off a Lil' Molly
Throw on a Lil' Biggie, she shy like Lil' Durk
She my Lil' Mama in a Lil' Snoop shirt, yeah
She all on my dick, she said it's lit, yeah
I'm on my shit, yeah, convertible top on the 6, yeah
Come out the same time as Chingy, nigga, I'm still here
Roll them maple leaves, Degrassi inside this wheelchair
Smokin' on this real, yeah, Draco, let it kill air
Weave on the track and make 'em think that it's my real hair
Off-white, teal Airs, kick start a fly
Paris fashion week, get murdered, yellow tape and chalk inside
, kill the pussy, make him think his daughter died
Left my dick inside her long as I waited for Carter 5
I am the Lakers' starter 5
I am Eazy-E immortalized
I'm the bullets in Trump temple for tellin' all them lies
No matter what you believe in this movie, the martyr dies
Tell my enemies I'm comin' and they better fall aside
Tellin' bitches if they ain't shooters, they better call a ride
Put a chopper on the seat and let it sing like L.M.I
Get it poppin' with this heat like it's a McDonald fry
Talk to Prodigy the night before he died
Said he happy to be alive, where you at? We should ride
Woke up to the news that my nigga died
So I borrowed the tear ducts from Havoc eyes and I cried
So I'm mobbin' deep for the rest of my life
Can't call my peace out the world without my knife
I don't fuck with Grammys ever since they fuckin' dissed me
Took my lil' horn and gave that motherfucker to Missy
Guess I'm too much, Thug Life, notorious, they don't get me
Fuck it, I'm in this Bentley
I'm too much real nigga for real nigga and Trump
I'd rather salute the flag than Hilfiger
Only thing in life I haven't done is smoke with Obama
And get head in Barbados from any bitch that know Rihanna
Ayy, any bitch that know Rihanna, bring it
Yeah, suck on it, sing it
My red bandana Dolce Gabbana
You ain't sayin' shit unless it's 9 Os and 3 commas
I'ma say it again Dolce Gabbana
You ain't sayin' shit unless it's-fuck it
Look, look, Game gon' freestyle
Meanwhile, my nigga off and he havin' 3 childs

Been punkin', fuckin' niggas up, never needed guns
Every time I hit the club, I go solo

Old Snoop sittin' in court, ponytail all fucked up

I don't owe that nigga money and he fuck with me, nigga
Everybody know The Game crazy, brazy, YG
Look, I said that I'm brazy, nigga
The flow never lazy, uh, never lazy, boy
Fuckin' with these lazy toys
I pull a Draco out the back of the motherfuckin' the back of the back of the Cadillac

Nigga, fuck y'all
Look, we gon' keep comin'
Game time, look
Uh, you know I'm not your average nigga
I get you murdered from a pool in Calabasas, nigga
I catch a fade and whoop ass like Cassius, nigga
I come with chronic on the table where the hash is, nigga
I roll my blunts on a bitch back, nigga
I'm on them Fireball shots, nigga, fuck a 6-pack
You can get your chain but you can't get your bitch back
Blue Maserati got me askin', "where the Crips at?"
At the Jewel like I'm Birdy, where Flip at?
Slice a nigga up, yeah,  can't fix that
I used to believe in Kane, that nigga
I used to believe that Nino was really out here killin'
Now I know why Tray ain't pull that trigger
I wake up everyday with O-Dog inside my fuckin' mirror
That's me, nigga
I be on Nike I.D. bored as fuck puttin' red strings in all the K.D.s, nigga
I'ma take my Porsche down to Comp Town Road
And I'ma shoot 'til I can't no more
I'ma take my Porsche down to Comp Town Road
And I'ma blast 'til I can't no more
I got some Palmer Bloccs on Rosecrans outside the Bentley
Tell them niggas got the Draco on it, God sent me
I ain't come to die, nigga, I'm still alive, nigga
I kill the bitch then get at the startin' 5, nigga
D-R-A C-O-M-P-TO-N, nigga, I ain't never had friends
3rd grade went to elementary, I was in the sandbox
Shootin' marbles, fuckin' up my homies like Sandlot
Dog in the backyard, 2 pit bulls
1 named Makaveli, other named Clip Full
Niggas can't fuck with me, nigga, they don't see the shots
'Til I die, 88 years old, Cedar Block
I'ma take my Porsche down to Comp Town Road
And I'ma ride 'til I can't no more
I'ma take my Porsche down to Old Town Road
And I'ma ride 'til I can't no more
Had some T-flats on the right side, eses with the killin', nigga
But I'm fuckin' black, I'm a Comp-
Can't talk about it 'cause my nigga still in jail for it
Tryna get appeals for it, nigga got a deal for it
Dre signed a nigga, I was fresh outta Compton
He ain't been back in 10 years 'til I brought him
Pat him on the block, Cedar Block, in the black hat
Compton-can't talk about it
Nigga, if I stop, then you know it's real shit, nigga
Had a bitch name Jada, I ain't Will Smith
I'm more like Pac, fuck with Jada before him, nigga
I ain't braggin', I ain't blue, I ain't play Aladdin, nigga
I'm that nigga, I been-can't talk about it
I'm that nigga, I said-shh, can't talk about it
Every shootout I been in, I done walked up out it
Why would I be here? Let's get one thing clear

And
