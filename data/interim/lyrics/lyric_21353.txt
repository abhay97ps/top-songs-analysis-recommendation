Maybe this time, I'll be lucky
Maybe this time, he'll stay
Maybe this time
For the first time
Love won't hurry away
He will hold me fast
I'll be home at last
Not a loser, anymore
Like the last time
And the time before
Everybody loves a winner
So nobody loved me
Lady Peaceful
Lady Happy
That's what I long to be
All the odds are
They're in my favor
Something's bound to begin
It's got to happen
Happen sometime
Maybe this time I'll win
Cause everybody
They love a winner
So nobody loved me
Lady peaceful
Lady happy
That's what I long to be
All the odds are
They're in my favor
Something's bound to give in
It's got to happen
Happen sometime
Maybe this time
Maybe this time
I'll win!
