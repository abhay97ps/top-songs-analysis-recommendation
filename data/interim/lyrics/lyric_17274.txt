Yo suckas fall back
Respect the format
Y'all ain't welcome here
I never liked them stupid door mats
Got strats upon strats to take the earth prime
Lyrics without gimmicks to wake minds up like snorting coke lines
I rhyme crimes divine, personalities intertwine
Swing guillotines smoke amphetamines drink turpentine
The world's mine no rebuttals retorts better check the reports
You face the dark side of the force
Me and panic on nega-mode Negatron
Vandalize Cybertron
Star scream Decepticon
Give me 5 epsilon
Off the grid movie Tron
Pile piles on your pylon
No more voltage for Voltron
Yea yea, either you with it or with it
You ain't with it you get it
When you get it you deaded
Your whole crew catch the edit
Henchmen spraying the leaded
Gas your block with unleaded
And watch Queen Latifah set it off
Don't want to get physical like turn your head and cough
There'll be side effects like you using the drug Zoloft
I zone out but in zones I touch down
A confounded criminal my pros is I know cons
That do jobs for minimal and split wigs with no salons
Freeze
Ice beams wild schemes dreams of treason
Get green weather machine change the seasons
Don't need a reason just want to see the world burn
You're allies get it first so next its gonn' be your turn
I'm earnest your whole squad they earned this
Incinerating bodies putting ashes into urns quick
The furnace
Have them pushing up daisies and turnips
Y'all worthless
Ain't nobody alive here to murder me
Ya'll wasting time tryin' to box against eternity
Hold it down my method call it gravity
Hit tracks with alkaline that's assault and battery
Niggas
They never learn, They never do
Respect is earned
And thats the truth
Fall back
You don't want the drama
Just stay at home
Kick it with ya baby mama
What you wanna 
What you wanna 
What you wanna 
What you wanna do?
Hit em with the Wu - Xi
Finger hold, finger hold
All those young garden gnomes
Playing, think we old?
Do what you’re told
Ci-fu
This is the part where I talk my shit
About how we walk that shit
Add some bark with it
Got fire tracks that spark visions
Higher than the atmos or the stratus
0.C., we on some Mars missions
And ya'll rap cats is all kittens
And your women's pussy we doggy style
On Morse code we tap it up
So let's wrap it up go head shorty back it up
If the niggas actin up they faces we smackin up
Cracking up while we jacking these fools at melee
Workin' hard to get moms packed up on a vacay
Another niggas wack staying relevant like Ray J
Trying to up they pay grade ain't joking with y’all jay kay
We could give a damn what he, she, or they say
We been outcrowd since the heyday
So make way
And mayday
Kamikaze competition
Call me kami
Got ya wishing
That we finally
Got diminished
Next dimension
For ya'll minions
Crew of degenerates but we been a threat
Killing the game and winning the fame
And reassemble rap
Til we get to the ranks of Shabba Ranks
This think tank ain't tanking
And history is formulating
They say when pigs fly
Well, I see soaring bacon flow been on swine flu
Do I need to remind you my girls sweet as some hai chu
God blessed me with vibes dude
The red barons in flight school
An empires our eyes view
Your hearings impaired and your visions a lie too
Radio ain't prepared they hide too
So how do I devise to take over each side through
Pretending I’m high intending to slide through
Or inventing a guide these niggas can live to
Beat maker is side one and the emcee is side two
Both can kick you from the head to caboose
Breakin' ya down two times
Square to the root, call us the truth and vamoose
I got my Kung-Fu with my pinky up 
Skadoosh... Bitch
