You know I love you
I'll always love you
Even though the tears are fallin'
From my eyes
I still remember baby when
Our love was so strong
So go on
Go ahead and kiss him
Go on and kiss him goodbye
Goodbye, whoa goodbye
He doesn't love you the way that I love you
Cause if he did he wouldn't go and break your heart
He's only flirtin' baby but my love is so strong
So go on, go ahead and kiss him
Go on and kiss him goodbye
Na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye
Na na na na, na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye
He's never near you to comfort and cheer you
Even though the tears are fallin', fallin' from your eyes
He might be thrillin' baby but my love is ready and willin'
So go on, go ahead and kiss him
Go ahead and kiss him, oo
Go ahead and kiss him, oo
Go on and kiss him goodbye
Goodbye, whoa goodbye
Bye bye bye, goodbye, whoa goodbye bye bye
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye
