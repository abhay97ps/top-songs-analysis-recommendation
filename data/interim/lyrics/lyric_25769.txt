Hahahaha, Nick, you're stupid
I wish that you would love me 
I wish that you would love me more
Nobody else but me 
Like, shawty, what you asking for? 
And lil' bitch, I'm right here, ayy
Like, shawty, what you looking for? Yay, yay
I ain't goin', uh, I ain't goin' away
Like, shawty, right there, right there, ayy 
Nobody can compare, can compare
I know it ain't fair , ain't fair 
All mine , all 
You're all mine , all of mine 
Callin' and brawlin' all the time 
Fallin' in love when it all ain't right 
Crawlin' in my arms when you cry 
I don't wanna love, I don't wanna fuck with you
Shawty, keep my love, shawty, keep my love with you 
I know that I'm stuck, I know that I'm stuck with you 
Yeah, and I know that's the issue, oh
I wish that you would love me 
I wish that you would love me more
Nobody else but me
