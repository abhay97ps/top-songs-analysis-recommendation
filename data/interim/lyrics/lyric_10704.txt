You're driving home in a downpour
Can't wait for you to walk through the door
The rain is beating on my brain
As the look on my face stays the same
Don't ever wanna lose ya 
And when I hear a speedy siren
My heart gets so still just like dying
Do anything to get you home safe
Where could you be it's getting so late
Repeat chorus
