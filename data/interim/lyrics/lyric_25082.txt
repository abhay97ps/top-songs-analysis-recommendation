I don't wanna wake up
I want you spread out on the sheets
Said pussy so good
Uh, pussy so sweet, oh
I don't wanna wake up
I want it flowin' through my streams
Gettin' me hot
Under my feet
I don't wanna wake up
Please don't wake me up, I feel it creepin' 
Controllin' how you movin', lucid dreamin' 
Always on the side of different seasons, yeah, yeah
Took the beltway down to your hood 
Say you was in the crowd, I never looked
Lookin' back how things came back around, guess I was hooked
Burn the bread and then we burn the town, we both was cooked, yeah
Nah, nah, please don't wake me up, feel like I'm dreamin'
Any given Sunday, you can get it, Willie Beamen
I can make your Mondays even better like the weekend 
That's my Coco, I'm her Ice-T 
Bend her over for some pipin' 
Bust a cloud, shoot the lightnin' 
Pop it now, no, we can't sleep 
I don't wanna wake up 
Want you spread out on the sheets 
Say, pussy so good 
Oh, pussy so sweet 
When I wake up 
Want a drop top on the beach 
Gettin' me hot, yeah 
Under my feet
When I wake up
You decide if I live or die
When you're close, I'm alive, I can feel the sky
I just want your body close to me, oh
And if I O.D., I'll be alone with no heartbeat
I hope they kill us with a ghost in the Lambo'
And the doors goin' up, suicide
I don't wanna wake up 
I want you spread out on the sheets 
'Cause that pussy so good , yeah
Girl, that pussy so sweet 
I don't wanna wake up 
I want it flowin' through my streams 
Ha, gettin' me hot 
Oh, under my feet 
I don't wanna wake up
