When you told me that you loved me
And I thought I could tell that you did
My heart told me all was well
From the deepest part of me
There came a melody
Complete with harmony
As my heart played for me
A symphony
I remember all the times
You told me that you were mine
And I remember what it did to me
From the deepest part of me
There came a melody
Complete with harmony
As my heart played for me
A symphony
But when I found your goodbye note
When I read the things you wrote
When I knew that you had gone from me
From the deepest part of me
Came tons of tragedy
No trace of harmony
No symphony
For there was no heart left in me
