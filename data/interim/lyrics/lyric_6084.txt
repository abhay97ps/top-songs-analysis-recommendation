Verse 1:
I can't sleep
It's this mind that keeps me haunted
With every mistake I've made, and I keep adding on it
I'm a control freak, and I need everything to be perfect
I'm that guy that trusts no one, my every move has a purpose
I didn't choose to be this way, trust me, nothing would be worth it
I'm paranoid, delusional, I rethink every movement
The only shelter that I run to are the holy halls of music
I do this to stay sane, not for your amusement
Chorus: 
Here's a confession in a church all of my own
It'll be better, we just have to wait for dawn
Verse 2:
I have this crippling anxiety, the thing is downright evil
It's a demon that's whispering I'm not good enough for people
It has a very good weapon, see, it operates on fear
It makes you fear things that are not really here
If you take a new direction, see, it springs into action
Overthinking every single, little human interaction
That's why I'm always by myself, alone without an ending
How can I be with someone when I'm barely standing?
Chorus: 
Here's a confession in a church all of my own
It'll be better, we just have to wait for dawn
Verse 3: 
I walk around with my fists balled like fighters do
How my life is going, I don't have the slightest clue
But I hope that what shines upon me finally has a brighter hue
Red, white or blue, doesn't matter, as long as the light is true
But when the pencil and the paper come together to create the illusion
I'm a better person when I'm inside the booth
Cause emotions overwhelming, negatively effect my well-being
But it helps me, and the music just provides the proof
When you get used to the abusive way
Of people telling you how you should stay a tool for them to use away
You start to hear 'em when they're not there and you may hallucinate
Grab 'em by the throat and choke 'em, then wake up to them asking about what you're gonna do today
Funny how that works
People don't listen before the period in my sentence, so I write them all backwards
So I'm the crazy one whose head is in the blessed land
I learned my lesson, I won't be sent to stand with my confessions, man
Chorus: 
Here's a confession in a church all of my own
It'll be better, we just have to wait for dawn
