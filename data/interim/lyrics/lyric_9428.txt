You go where you want do what you please
Never let on, not even once, that you've ever been lonely
It's nice to see you alone
Are you looking for something maybe you ain't gettin' at home
Your hair is in place dressing to kill
Your old man has said that when he dies he will leave you his money
And the pool where you swim
Are you looking for something maybe you ain't gettin' from him
Steppin' out, steppin' out, to get a little action on the side
Steppin' out, steppin' out, the day time queen takes a midnight ride
And it's plain as plain could be, you're a woman who wants to be free
So if you're steppin' out tonight honey, come on and step out with me
The party's a bore, it's bound to get worse
Let's slip out somewhere and engage in our own celebration
Let me pour you some wine
Are you thinking maybe baby your needs are the same as mine
Let's go for a walk, go for a ride
Or maybe just stand here and think what we can do to eachother
No we don't have to dance
If you're thinking of stepping out, honey this is your chance
Steppin' out, steppin' out, to get a little action on the side
Steppin' out, steppin' out, the day time queen takes a midnight ride
And it's plain as plain could be, you're a woman who wants to be free
So if you're steppin' out tonight honey, come on and step out with me
Steppin' out, steppin' out, to get a little action on the side
Steppin' out, steppin' out, the day time queen takes a midnight ride
And it's plain as plain could be, you're a woman who wants to be free
So if you're steppin' out tonight honey, come on and step out with me
