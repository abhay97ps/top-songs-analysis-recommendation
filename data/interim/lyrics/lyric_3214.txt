What up shorty, Yeah I'm just sittin here
I'm rememberin the first time that we met each other
You know I ain't even want your phone number I wanted you to have mine
You know cause I wanted you to call me, You know
Um it's like you know even if you seen somethin at the super market
That you usually buy, And they ran out of it
Yeah, I wanted you to call me, Haha
Together we were so strong
Let me start by asking you girl what you think can really go wrong
Cause what's deep is from the beginning of the glasses of Moet
And the of the Agatha Christi glasses
Beautiful lines travel across like Jason Kidd passes
And Escalades with rims spinnin, In front of your night school classes
All those dudes was talkin dirt, You told me never stop puttin in work
Come on girl, I'm tryin to get to know you
Hot sex like Miami and Shearlings, Tennis bracelets with whirl winds of diamonds
You that all night hustle love, And ain't nothin about you
Like New Jack City, Listen Momma, We gone run the city
The way you move and shake your body, Right-Right
Baby girl it's you, Right-Right, Baby girl it's you
Don't stop, Before you say you love me girl
And don't stop, It's only you I'm love'n girl
Can't believe that I'm in love with you
This is crazy what am I to do
She got my back, She help me build my stacks
That's why for her I'm going all out
She got the bail money in the bank
And ain't nobody gonna take her place, That's why I stay in her face
She make me feel like I'm top of the world
For my birthday Jordan eight's and John Paul Gardiner combs
Custom design fitteds with rhinestones
Payin European fees cause she know a nigga love the jones
Copped me some twenty-sixes for the whip
And when I did my time up North she didn't abandon ship, She stuck to the script
That's why I treat her like the Mona Lisa and give her body sexual fever
Girl when I'm with you, I'm high like Amsterdam reefer
You niggas slipped on feel on a dick, You just built a friendship, Right-Right
Yeah, You know, I mean, Damn, You so pretty, I swear to my Mother
I never thought I would ever get with somebody that look like you
Aw man, You just don't know what you do to me, Word
