If she knew what she wants
If she knew what she needs
If she knew what she wants
If she knew what she wants
He'd be giving it to her
Giving it to her
But she wants everything
Or there's nothing she wants
He's crazy for this girl
If she knew what she wants
He'd be giving it to her
Giving it to her
I'd say her values are corrupted
But she's open to change
Then one day she's satisfied
And the next I'll find her crying
And it's nothing she can explain
If she knew what she wants
If she knew what she needs
If she knew what she wants
If she knew what she wants
He'd be giving it to her
Giving it to her 
Some have a style
That they work hard to refine
So they walk a crooked line
But she won't understand
Why anyone would have to try
To walk a line when they could fly
No sense thinking I could rehabilitate her
When she's fine, fine, fine
She's got so many ideas traveling around in her head
She doesn't need nothing from mine
If she knew what she wants
If she knew what she needs
If she knew what she wants
If she knew what she wants
He'd be giving it to her
Giving it to her
But she wants everything
Or there's nothing she wants
He's crazy for this girl
If she knew what she wants
He'd be giving it to her
Giving it to her
Ooooooh, giving it to her
Giving it to her now
