He don't
Hang around
With the gang no more
He don't do the wild things that he did before
He used to act bad
Used to, but he quit it
It makes me so sad
'Cause I know that he did it for me
And I can see
His heart is out in the street
He don't
Comb his hair
Like he did before
He don't wear those dirty old black boots no more
But he's not the same
There's something 'bout his kissing
That tells me he's changed
I know that something's missing inside
Something died
His heart is out in the streets
He grew up on the sidewalk
Streetlights shining above
He grew up with no one to love
He grew up on the sidewalk
He grew up running free
He grew up and then he met me
He don't
Hang around
With the gang no more
Gee, he doesn't smile like he did before
I wish I didn't care
I wish I'd never met him
They're waiting out there
I know I gotta set him free
He's gotta be
His heart is out in the streets
He don't hang around with the gang no more
He don't hang around with the gang no more
He don't hang around with the gang no more
