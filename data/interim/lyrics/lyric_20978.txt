Chorus: Trey Songz
You can be my cutty, cutty, buddy, fo' sho 
Girl, don't act like you don't already know 
We can get it on the bed or the floor 
I wanna take you to
H-Town
Repeat Chorus
Girl, if you need this here
Call me, don't have no fear
I wanna 
Late night's a lovey-dovey
Some wanted to love, to love me
She's somethin' like a friend
Call her my cutty buddy
Even though she got a man 
She already know the plan 
She already know the deal
So what the business here
Even though she 
She already 
She already know the deal
Know the deal, know the deal
Even though I'm chubby, chubby 
Your chick, she love me, she love me 
She might be with you now
But she still thinkin' of me
Y'all out there making love 
Our cutty make 'em love me
In the back of the 'Llac, buddy
Just like 
That 
Repeat Chorus Twice
 How you do your lips like that
Move your hips like that
Work your ass like that 
Why you make noise like that
Move slow like that
Fuck fast like that 
Baby, I ain't gon' lie to you 
We so sexually compatible 
How I thrill myself, like I kill myself
When I feel myself inside of you 
You can be my cutty buddy, nibble on my Nutty Buddy
While we do some freaky things with the lights on
Touchin' on you while I'm listenin' to T-Pain 
Huggin' on you while I'm listenin' to Mike Jones 
Do it soon as we got in the sack
Or I could hit it in the 'Llac
Off a fifth of the yak
Like 
Like 
That 
 It's the middle of the night
Y'all got into a fight
Now you mad with your feelings hurt
Girl, let me Buy U A Drank
Please tell me what you thank
Right before I get up in them skirts
 Skeet, skeet
 I pull up in a 'Llac truck
 Beep, beep
 My mean shawty back up
 Beep me
 If your man act up, he poor time, girl, I'll be the backup
Hook: Mike Jones
Cause I'm your cutty buddy
Cut-cut-cut-cutty buddy
Soon as he fall asleep
She on her way to love me
Repeat Hook
Pre-Chorus: Mike Jones 
Cause she know that I 
And she know that my 
We can do it on the bed or the floor 
Cause you know that I keep it hood
And she know that I 
And she know that my 
We can do it on the bed or the floor, let me know
Repeat Chorus Twice
See, I can't be her man {Man}
And she can't be my girl {Girl}
But we do it like it's the end of the world
You dig
We have relations like I'm kin to the girl
I make her holla like when momma brought her into the world
Look, I don't let him buy you dinner tonight {Yeah}
Then at the end of the night {Yeah}
You be my dinner tonight {Dinner tonight}
Ha
You see, he dark, he always dim in his light
And that girl, wanna shine, I bring her into the light
Voila
I become her Allah
And I swear that thang feel like la, la, la {La-la-la, la}
And since he feed her lies 
I be her dessert on the side {Oh, oh}
Yeah
Repeat Chorus Twice
