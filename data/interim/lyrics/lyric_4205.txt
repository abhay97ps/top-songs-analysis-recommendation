Won't somebody tell me please?
How do you catch a girl?
Take a little piece of cheese and put it on a trap
If you don't catch a mouse then you're bound to catch a rat
Take a tiny shiny hook and a little piece of bait
And you're bound to catch a fish if you're calm enough to wait
But how do you catch a girl?
How do you catch a girl?
Won't somebody tell me please?
How do you catch a girl?
Daniel Boone took a rifle and a coonskin cap
And he found an icy river and he set a little trap
And he took a bit of jerky and he took a little nap
And he knew he'd catch a beaver or a fat muskrat
But how do you catch a girl?
How do you catch a girl?
Won't somebody tell me please?
How do you catch a girl?
I'd like to know how to catch a girl
I've caught frogs, I've caught snakes, earthworms
And they may be nice
But girls, oh
Well, I asked the local lover and he told me what to do
He said learn the rocking dances both old and new
But it's hard to do those dances with two left feet
So I've got to find a method that'll work for me
Oh, how do you catch a girl?
How do you catch a girl?
Won't somebody tell me please?
How do you catch a girl?
I wish I knew
How do you catch a girl?
How do you catch a girl?
How do you catch a girl?
How do you catch a girl?
