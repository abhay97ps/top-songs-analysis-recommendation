Where you at?
At my house
Let me see that ass
What you say?
I said "let me see that ass"
That ass?
Oh, you on some naked shit
Hahaha
I'm on my way
Stop lyin'
I'm on my way, bye
I'm ashamed of all the things that I was doin' for you
Should've known that all these girls the same and they ain't loyal
She a freak, took her to Nobu, on a beach 
Just to eat Louboutins all on her feet 
Where you get the money for them shoes, girl?
You hit me on my DM like a fangirl 
Did you want me or did you want these bands, girl? 
Now I know you just another Instagram girl 
She almost made me think that all she want is me 
I hit the club and she the first one that I see
Said that she there 'cause she know promoters in the club 
Come to find out that my homeboy hit her up 
All this ice, I need a freezer, mhm
Whip it up, egg beater, mhm
Whippin' up two-seaters
Said she love me, don't believe her, mhm
Can't be mediocre, mhm
Twenty on her choker, mhm
Fuck her, I don't know her, yeah
Give me face, like poker
Whoa, can't believe I wanted you
Whoa, I can't believe I wanted you, yeah
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you
No, no, no, no, I don't need you 
No, no, no, no, I don't need you 
Man, I swear these girls are see-through 
Stevie Wonder, I can't see you 
She so hurt, I'm so irked, she get on my nerve 
My head hurt, matter fact, kick her to the curb 
Found out that she with him, like this verse, get murked 
My chopper, ego dispersed, yeah, probably die before it hurt, ayy
Cartier lens, I'm on lurk, uh, twenty-thousand for a fur, ooh 
What would she do for a purse?  She said she'll give me a Perc' 
My new bitch better, so I cannot sweat her, don't talk to that girl, that's a curve 
Speakin' of sweater, my neck is so frozen it lookin' just like an iceberg
All this ice I need a freezer, mhm
Whip it up, egg beater, mhm
Whippin' up two-seaters
Said she love me, don't believe her, mhm
Can't be mediocre, mhm
Twenty on her choker, mhm
Fuck her, I don't know her, yeah
Give me face, like poker
Whoa, can't believe I wanted you
Whoa, I can't believe I wanted you, yeah
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you
Uzi, they used to make fun of you 
Yeah, all my hundreds blue
Whoa, little bitch, I'm done with you 
Hit it from the back while Uzi stand in front of you 
23, but I had her when I was 22 
I can't wife that girl, she fucked like twenty dudes 
You can't get a kiss, can't get caught tonguin' you 
I got lots of girls, no, there ain't just one of you  
Off-White on my Prestos, all these girls I'm runnin' through 
I can't text her back, these Franklins what I'm thumbin' through 
Fuck a finger in that bitch, I use a thumb or two 
Made her number one and you ain't even number two
All this ice I need a freezer, mhm
Whip it up, egg beater, mhm
Whippin' up two-seaters 
Said she love me, don't believe her, mhm
Can't be mediocre, mhm
Twenty on her choker, mhm
Fuck her, I don't know her, yeah
Give me face, like poker
Whoa, can't believe I wanted you
Whoa, I can't believe I wanted you, yeah
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you
