A little bit of soap
Will wash away your lipstick on my face
But a little bit of soap will never
Never never ever erase
The pain in my heart
And my eyes
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears
Mmm, a little bit of soap
Will wash away your powder from my chin
But a little bit of soap will never
Never never ever begin
To take away the hurt
That I feel
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears
Mmm, have you heard when love begins to die
Isn't one to cry, night and day
But like a bird, you left your robin's nest
And just like all the rest, you flew away
Mmm, a little bit of soap
Will take away your perfume eventually
But a little bit of soap will never
Wash away the memory
Of your name
In the night
That I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears
I'll never lose the memory of your name
In the night
That I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears
Mmm, a little bit of soap will never wash away my tears
Mmm, it's gonna never, never, never wash away my tears
