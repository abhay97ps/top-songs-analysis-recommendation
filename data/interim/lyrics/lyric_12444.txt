Clean shirt, new shoes
And I don't know where I am goin' to
Silk suit, black tie 
I don't need a reason why
They come runnin'
Just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy
About a sharp dressed man
Gold watch, diamond ring
I ain't missin' not a single thing
Cufflinks, stick pin
When I step out
I'm gonna do you in
They come runnin'
Just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy
About a sharp dressed man
Top coat, top hat
And not to worry cause my wallet's fat
Black shades, white gloves
Lookin' sharp, lookin' for love
They come runnin'
Just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl's crazy
About a sharp dressed man
That's right, real fine
