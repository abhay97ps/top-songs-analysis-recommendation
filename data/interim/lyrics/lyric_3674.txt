I want someone
To hold me, hold me 
I've got to have that
I want someone
To caress 
Someone to confess
That she loves me
I know, I know, I know
I know there must be someone
Someone that must feel the same
And we'll lay our blames
To this love of mine
I want someone
To love 
That's what I need 
I've got to have it
I want someone 
To care for, for, 
I know, I know
I know there must be someone somewhere
Someone that's got to feel the same
And we'll lay our blames
To this love of mine
I've got to have her
You know I need a girl like that
Baby baby, baby baby
My love 
Baby baby, baby baby 
My love 
...
