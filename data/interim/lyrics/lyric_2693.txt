Seems like the other day
My baby went away
He went away 'cross the sea
It's been two years or so
Since I saw my baby go
And then this letter came for me
It said that we were through
He found somebody new
Oh, let me think, let me think, what can I do?
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no no no no no
 walkin' in the sand
 walkin' hand in hand
 the night was so exciting
 smile was so inviting
 then he touched my cheek
 with his fingertips
Softly, softly we'd meet with our lips
Whatever happened to
The boy that I once knew?
The boy who said he'd be true
Oh, what will happen to
The life I gave to you?
What will I do with it now?
 walkin' in the sand
 walkin' hand in hand
 the night was so exciting
 smile was so inviting
 then he touched my cheek
 with his fingertips
 softly
Walkin' in the sand
Walkin' hand in in hand
