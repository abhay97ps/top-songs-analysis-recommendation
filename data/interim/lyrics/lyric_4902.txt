Sunday mornin' 
Sun shinin' on your eyes, sleepy face
Smilin' into mine, Sunday mornin' 
Lots of time with nothin' to do
Lots of time to spend with you 
On Sunday mornin', Sunday mornin'
It's so quiet in the street
You can hear the sound of feet walkin' by
I'll put the coffee on to brew
We can have a cup or two
And do what other people do
On Sunday mornin'
Sunday mornin', Sunday mornin'
Sunday, Sunday, I love Sunday
Sunday mornin'
Come hold me in your arms 
Everything's all right
Lots of time, lots of time, lots of time with nothin' to do
Lots of time to spend with you 
On Sunday mornin' 
Sunday mornin'
It's so quiet in the street
We can hear the sound of feet walkin' by
I'll put coffee on to brew
We can have a cup or two
And do what other people do
On Sunday mornin', mornin', yeah
Sunday mornin', Sunday mornin'
Sunday, Sunday, I love Sunday
Sunday mornin'
C'mon and hold me in your arms 
Everything's all right 
Everything's all right 
Everything's all right 
Everything's all right 
Everything's all right
On Sunday mornin', Sunday mornin', Sunday, Sunday
Sunday mornin', Sunday mornin', mornin'
On Sunday morning, lot's of time with nothin' to do
 Lot's of time to spend with you
Mornin', Sunday mornin'
Lot's of time with nothin' to do
 Lot's of time to spend with you
Mornin', Sunday mornin'
Lot's of time with nothin' to do
 Lot's of time to spend with you
Mornin', Sunday mornin'
Lot's of time with nothin' to do
 Lot's of time to spend with you
Mornin', Sunday mornin'
Lot's of time with nothin' to do
 Lot's of time to spend with you
