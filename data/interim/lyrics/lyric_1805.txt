Why must I love you so much?
Sandy, I long for your touch
A better luck the next time Sandy
I gotta tell ya that we're through
A find a guy who's always handy
A listen girl I'm leavin' you
A dum dadida dum dum dadida dida
Dum dadida dum dum da dida dida
A dum dadida dum dum dadida dida
Dum dadida dum dum dadida dida
I love a girl around the corner
Just found out that she's no good
I left her, didn't even want her
But I'd crawl back if I could
Why must I love you so much?
Sandy, I long for your touch
I never thought you'd put me down
I can't believe that you're untrue
And now the news is out around town
Yeah, what else can I do?
Whoa ooooo dumdidala dumdidala
La dal la dal la dal la dal
Oh, these words of pain
I can't explain
Oh, and all those tears I cry for you
A better luck the next time Sandy
I've gotta tell you that we're through
A find a guy who's always handy
Listen girl, I'm leavin' you
Why must I love you so much?
Sandy, I long for your touch
I never thought you would put me down
Can't believe that you're untrue
And now the news is out around town
Sandy babe, what can I do?
Dida dida dum dum da dida dida
Dum da dida dum dum da dida dida
Dida dida dum dum da dida dida
Dida did dum dum da dida dida
