Mr. 305
I want everybody 
To get ready 
'Cause we about to shut down 
Ohh-ohh
Can't tell me nothing now
Baby, I know how to fly
Ohh-ohh
Can't nothing hold me down, I'm gonna touch the sky
Can't nothing, no, hold me down
Sube sube, hasta la nube
Pa delante-lante
No mires pa tras
I hit the jackpot cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-ching
Real chicos do real things on the road to get diamond rings
Moved up from the streets, graduated hustla
On his way to an entrepreneur, undefeated, double shooter
Now baby, save me, from the game before it plays me
My life's a movie, call me Martin Scorsese
I couldn't care less if you love me or hate me
Life's a bitch, now fuck you, pay me 
Sube sube, hasta la nube
Pa delante-lante
No mires pa tras
Dale
Ohh-ohh
Can't tell me nothing now
Baby, I know how to fly
Ohh-ohh
Can't nothing hold me down
I'm gonna touch the sky skyy
Woo
Lose my money, honey
Now pay me what you owe me
My mens a hurricane, you should see the way she glow it
I don't make it rain
I speak that global warming
This same no biggie ain't ready to dance
Now baby, save me, from the game before it plays me
My life's a movie, call me Martin Scorsese
I couldn't care less if you love me or hate me
Life's a bitch, now fuck you, pay me 
Sube sube, hasta la nube
Pa delante-lante
No mires pa tras
Dale
Ohh-ohh
Can't nothing hold me down
I'm gonna touch the sky, sky
Ohh-ohh
Can't tell me nothing now
Baby, I know how to fly, fly
Ohh-ohh
Can't nothing hold me down
I'm gonna touch the sky, sky
Can't nothing, nothing
Hold me down
Can't nothing nothing
Hold me down
Can't nothing nothing
Hold me down
Now watch me, now watch me
Now watch me shut this thang down
It's my life, I'm a do what I do
And if you don't like, it's cool, fuck you
