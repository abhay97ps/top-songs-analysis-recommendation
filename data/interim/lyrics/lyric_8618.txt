Never thought about tomorrow
Seemed like a long time to come
How could I be so blind, baby
Not to see you were the one
I let ya slip on from me, honey
I let you walk on by
I refused the love you had for me
I refused to love and let it die
I must of got lost, I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Somewhere down the line
I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Give away the days you were mine
Don't know why I let you leave me
Honey, I don’t know
They say it's hard to see love comin'
But babe, you always see it go
I must of got lost, I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Somewhere down the line
I must of got lost, I must of got lost
To give away the days you were mine
Love can be a sweet thing
I just don’t understand
I made a game outta lovin' you
And now I hold the losin' hand
So, I must of got lost, I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Somewhere down the line
I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Give away the days you were mine
I just can't understand it
I just can't understand it
I just don't understand it
And I must of got lost, I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Somewhere down the line
I must of got lost, I must of got lost
To give away them days you were mine
I must of got lost, I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Somewhere down the line
I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Give away the days you were mine
Oh yah!
Well
I must of got lost, I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Somewhere down the line
Yeah!
Oh
I must of got lost, I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Somewhere down the line
I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Give away the days you were mine
I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Somewhere, somewhere down the line
I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Give away the days you were mine
