Here we stand
Somewhere in between
This moment and the end
Will we bend?
Or will we open up
And take this whole thing in?
Everybody else is smiling
And their smiles don't fade
And you don't even wonder why
You just don't think that way
Maybe you and me got lost somewhere
We can't move or we can't stay here
Well, maybe we've just had enough
Well, maybe we ain't meant for this love
You and me tried everything
But still that mockingbird won't sing
Well man this life seems hard enough
Well maybe we ain't meant for this love
Take my hand
And I will lead you
Through the broken promise land
Yes I can, ah yes I can
I can be there when you need it
I'll give it all till you can't feel it anymore
I don't wanna love you now
If you'll just leave someday
I don't wanna turn around
If you'll just walk away
Maybe you and me got lost somewhere
We can't move or we can't stay here
Well, maybe we've just had enough
Well, maybe we ain't meant for this love
You and me tried everything
But still that mockingbird won't sing
Well, man, this life seems hard enough
Well, maybe we ain't meant for this love
Maybe you and me got lost somewhere
We can't move or we can't stay here
Well, maybe we've just had enough
Well, maybe we ain't meant for this love
You and me tried everything
But still that mockingbird won't sing
Well, man, this life seems hard enough
Well, maybe we ain't meant for this love
Maybe we ain't meant for this love
Maybe we ain't meant for this love
