I will serenade you
All along the way
I will serenade you
Anyway you say
Take you to the country
I'll take you to the shore
Show you to my garden
I know you'll make it grow
If you let me serenade you
You know that's what you come for
So that I will serenade you
I wake you in the morning
On your sunrise time
Your fire in the evening
When it blows outside
If you let me serenade you 
You know that's what you come for
So that I will serenade you 
And when the walls
Begin to fall
Can't hold back the joy that love will conquer all
Every moment
Every day
If you want to hold me
I will I will I will I will stay 
Let me serenade you 
I will  
If you want to hold me, yeah
One more one more now
Everybody keep on , I will sing it 
I will say I love you baby 
 woooooo 
I will serenade you
All along the, whoa! 
C'mon, let me sing it
Wooo oooh oooh
I will serenade you baby 
I will serenade you
