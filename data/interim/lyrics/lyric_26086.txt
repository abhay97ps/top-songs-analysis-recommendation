Let me make one thing clear
You can buy me a beer, but you ain't taking me home
No pick up lines, I came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room
I couldn't help but notice you seem a little down on your love too
Yeah, my heart might be breaking
But, this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'
We should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone 
We should be drinking alone, together 
I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up
Tonightâ€™s the night that never was
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only
But just 'cause we're lonely, don't mean that we should
We should be drinking alone
'Cause drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone
Drinking alone, drinking alone 
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone 
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone
I'll pretend that I care
Baby, pull up a chair
We'll stay here 'til they make us go home
We should be drinking alone 
Oh, we should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone  together
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone 
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone 
We should be drinking alone
Ooh, ooh, ooh
