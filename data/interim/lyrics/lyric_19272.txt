Hey yo Slim, you ready?

Don't hold back, here's my love
Baby you're the one for me 
How can we get down tonight
No more game lets spend some time
Baby won't you give it to me
Just give it to me baby
You don't know what you do to me
The way you touch baby
I love it when you're on top of it, so spread it

Hot and wet
Girl you make me wanna sweat
When you touch me like that
Girl you know I wanna give it to you
Second verse, come on
Baby now it's getting late
Don't start now, I can wait
To show you belong to me 
Know how I like it, take your time, close your eyes
Let me show you what real love should be
Girl you don't know,  baby
 - w/ ad libs
You ready?
Yeah, hey ya'll I don't think their ready

Now baby you done work, if you work it
Tweak it, twerk it 
I feel like your every imperfection is perfect 
Luda, yeah what you heard is true
I make you do things, you ain't even know you can do 
Got 'em weak in the knees cause my back is strong
And you wonder why your girls wanna tag along 
Cause them birds is jealous, my words embellished
Plus they heard that I kiss every curve and crevice 
I'm too hot to handle, I rock your mantle
When I play 112 and light 16 candles 
Deep sea fishin in your favorite position 
Everytime you moan I pay close attention 
Flip 'em like a pancake , show me somethin 
Or we can break in your vibratin tongue ring 
Let's mountain climb 'til we reach the peak 
The technique will make you sweat, but don't sweat the technique 
 - w/ ad libs
Let's go, c'mon
Yeah, c'mon

Girl just keep it hot and wet 
Girl I'm gonna make a sweat
Keep it real close to me
Let it drip all over me 
You know just what I like 
Touch it, love it, freak it all night
I'm gettin it off me 
But baby you gotta keep it
You ready? Let's go
C'mon, yeah
