Oh darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Oh darling, if you leave me
I'll, I'll never make it alone
So believe me when I beg you
Don't you ever leave me alone, leave me alone
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know, I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know, I nearly broke down and died
Oh darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
So believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know, you know I nearly broke down and died
Oh darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down
So believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
