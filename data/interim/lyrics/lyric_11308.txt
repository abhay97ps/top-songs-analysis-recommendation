Ridin' in a long gray limousine
Sitting in a pair of hundred dollar jeans
Trying to talk sense to a rock'n'roll queen
Damn, best kinda living anybody ever seen
Oh, Angeline
Looking at the bright lights, searching for the silver screen
I never seen a woman who could look so good
And be so doggone mean. Yeah
Oh, midnight strutting in New York City
Midnight woman, she is looking so pretty
Her little heart beat in rhythm with the world
She used to be her mama's little girl
Hey, hey Angeline
Whoa, just a game that she loves to play
Leaving broken hearts all along the way
She's got friends that she ain't never used
She's winning now but she's bound to lose
Oh, Angeline
Looking at the bright lights, searching for the silver screen
I never seen a woman who could look so good
And be so doggone mean. Yeah
Oh, midnight strutting in New York City
Midnight woman, she is looking so pretty
Her little heart beat in rhythm with the world
She used to be her mama's little girl
Hey, hey Angeline
