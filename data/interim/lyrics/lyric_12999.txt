It seems like only yesterday
I didn't have a clue
I stood alon not knowin where to turn
Now suddenly I look around
And everything looks new
I don't know why, but I think I'm startin' to learn
They call it understanding
A willingness to grow
I'm finally understanding
There's so much I can know
Until the day you came along
I used to just get lost
I only heard the things I wanted to hear
It always seemed like no one cared
But then you took the time
And now I look and everything seems clear
You've got me understanding
You've really helped me see
I'm finally understanding
It's meant so much to me
You've got me understanding
You're really on my side
You've got me understanding
