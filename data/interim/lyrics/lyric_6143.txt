Sometimes, I wonder if he loves me like he used to
So many things bring doubt to my mind
It's only natural for a woman to sit and worry
And search for all the faults, she can find
Last night I waited up, it seemed forever
And I'm not even sure when he came in
To make things worse he never tried to wake me
And offered no excuse for where he'd been
But I'll see him through
For better, for worse, Lord knows it's true
'Cause I love him, I'll see him through
He gave me love when I needed it bad
He was the only thing on earth that I had
And that's the reason that I'll see him through
I'll see him through
He gave me love when I needed it bad
He was the only thing on earth that I had
And that's the reason that, I'll see him through
And that's the reason that, I'll see him through
