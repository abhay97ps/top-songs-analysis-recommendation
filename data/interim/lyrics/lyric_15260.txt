Ain't no doubt about it, you're a masterpiece
You're amazing
Adrift at sea'til I saw your face
It's amazing
Anybodys guess - now it's guaranteed
Sent to seventh heaven in my hour of need
Baby baby baby you're amazing
Taken by surprise
Don't waste time tryin'to explain it
Can't believe my eyes
You changed my nights from black to blue
It's amazing
Ever since I fell in love with you
You're amazing
So far out of sight that it's like a dream
Beyond all imagining
But I believe
Baby baby baby you're amazing
Take me by surprise
Don't waste time, baby tryin'to explain it
Right before my eyes
Baby baby baby we ain't faking
We're in paradise
Baby doll, I'm not exaggering
I thought that I could see, but I was blind
I realized now I'm just wasting time
Baby baby baby you're amazing
Taken by surprise
Don't waste time, baby tryin'to explain it
Can't believe my eyes
I used to be weak but you made me strong
So amazing
It's gotta be right 'cos it sure ain't wrong
It's amazing
Baby you're the difference between day and night
I was in the dark 'til I saw the light
Dynamite!
Baby baby baby you're amazing
Took me by surprise
Don't waste time, baby tryin' to explain it
Right before my eyes
Baby baby baby we ain't faking
This is paradise
Baby doll, I'm not exaggering
Girl you're dynamite
Baby baby baby
Baby you're amazing
Took me by surprise
Baby you know how to drive me crazy
Make me realize
Why waste time baby tryin' to explain it
This is paradise
Baby baby baby you're amazing
