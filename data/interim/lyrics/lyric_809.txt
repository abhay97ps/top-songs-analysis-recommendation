The story began in Renosa
A village in old Mexico
A girl and a Mexican soldier
Were sweethearts, a long time ago
They made big plans for a wedding
The town of Renosa would go
And there would see Jimmy Martinez
Married to Sarah Sero
Oh-oh-oh
One day there came a message
It said that Jimmy must go
As Jimmy was leavin' Renosa
To fight at the Alamo
He never returned to Renosa
The story's been told and retold
How Jimmy the Mexican soldier
Died at the Alamo
Oh-oh-oh
Jimmy's last letter to Sarah
Began with a message like this
Oh dear one, how sweet is the memory
The memory of our parting kiss
I send my heart in this letter
I pray to the one up above
Oh Sarah, don't ever forget me
Stay just as pure as the dove
Oh-oh-oh
I'm like the dove in your window
It's chosen just one mate for life
And you are the one I have chosen
The one that I want for my wife
He never returned to Renosa
The story's been told and retold
How Jimmy the Mexican soldier
Died at the Alamo
Oh-oh-oh
Sarah refused to believe them
She prayed for Jimmy's return
And there ever night in her window
A small little candle would burn
Years turned her dark hair to silver
She prayed for Jimmy so long
Then one night the village was saddened
The light in her window was gone
Oh-oh-oh
