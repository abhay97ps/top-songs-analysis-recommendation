Jole Blon, Delta flower
You're my darling
You're my sunshine
I love you, I adore you
And I promise to be true
In the evening, in the shadows
I'll be waiting by the river
When I hear your sweet voice
I rejoice, I save my kisses for you
Sha la la, sha la la
Jole Blon, Cajun angel
Let me tell you that I love you
In the spring, you
Swore we'd be married
But I'm waiting still for you
When your hair turns to silver
I'll still call you Delta flower
Pretty Blon, I'll still love you
And I will wait for you
Sha la la, sha la la
We'll go away from this city
We'll go back, girl, back to our home
Some day I promise I'll take you
Cause so far away we've roamed
And the bells, they will ring
From the mountain through the valleys
On the banks of the river
There you will be my bride
Sha la la, sha la la
