High school U.S.A
High school U.S.A
High school U.S.A
High school U.S.A., come Friday noon
Bout a half past three
I drop my books and my misery 
Stroll up and down
Through the soda shop
Drop a coin in the old jukebox 
Well, now looking all around
What did I see every school kid
There could ever be
They come from Pittsburgh
Chicago and Boston too
New Orleans, San Diego
And old St. Lou
Cleveland, Portland, and L. A
Fort Worth, Charlotte
And Frisco Bay
Detroit, Newark and Memphis too
Well, they wanna do the high school bop with you
Well, come Saturday morning
They were still going strong
They've been rocking and
A-rolling all night long
No time to study on their ABC's
Mmm they're getting their lessons
On the birds and the bees
Yeah all across the floor
They're doing the hop
Everybody's doing that
High school bop
They come from Dallas
Cincinatti and good old Philly
Houston, Raleigh, and Kansas City
Miami, Baltimore and Washington
Norfolk, Atlanta and Charleston

High school bop with you

They all wanna do the
High school bop with you
Mmm
