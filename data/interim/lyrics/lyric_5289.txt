I know you've been hurt
Girl you must think I'm a jerk
Girl I didn't mean it
I walked up over you
Took your love for granted
Played you for a fool
I learned my lesson
I didn't mean to make you cry
Don't you know that I love you
You can see it in my eyes
Girl I'm so guilty
There is no excuse for what came over me
Girl will you forgive me
In your heart I know there's still a place for me
You're going to walk
All over my heart
Baby take your shoes off before you start
I don't wanna be hurt
I can't stand the pain
Baby take your shoes off girl I've changed
Do it easy
It's such a shame
All the crazy things I do
Could have been so easy
Giving my love to you
Your love is sweet
So sweet that it made me blind
I couldn't see you were made for me
I must have been out of my mind
Girl please take it easy
Cause I know before I was the man for you
Girl will you forgive me
For your mind is telling your heart what to do
Girl I'm sorry
Baby I didn't mean it
Wait a minute can we talk
Now take off take off uh take
I know you've been hurt
Girl you must think I'm a jerk
The things that I did to you
The way I was lying to you
There's really no excuse for the things that I did
I was silly and lost my head
I must have been a fool to hurt a girl like you
I don't know why
Maybe  too fly
Being fool is a terrible thing when you hurt somebody you love
If you're gonna do it
Baby do it
Do it easy
Baby don't
Baby don't
Baby just 
I took you for granted girl I apologize
Let's pick up the pieces so dry your eyes
 over and over again
 be your lover and your friend
I couldn't sleep at all last night
I don't know
Maybe it's my conscience call
 being fool is a terrible thing when you hurt somebody you love
So if you're gonna do it
Baby do it
Do it easy
Baby don't
Baby don't
Baby just
