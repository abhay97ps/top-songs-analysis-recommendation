Come on, y'all, let's go downtown
Come on, y'all, let's groove
Hey, hey, hey
From Monday to Thursday, I'm dead on my feet
Most of the time, too tired to eat
When I try to read the paper, I fall fast asleep
As soon as Friday rolls around
I lay all the weekly burdens down
I put on my glad rags and paint the town
I'm livin' for the weekend
Right now I'm livin' for the weekend
Said I'm livin' for the weekend
'Cause that's when I party down
 Party hardy.   Party down
 Party hardy.   Party down.  
Soon as Monday rolls around again
I got to put all that partyin' to an end
Got to swap that same old grind
With those 5-a-day weekends
Sometimes I get frustrated through the day
I take off early and I just get paid
At that time, I don't really care
Because I done took all that I can bear
I'm livin' for the weekend.  
Oh, oh, right now, livin' for the weekend.  
Heh, right now, I'm livin' for the weekend
Heh, 'cause that's when I party down.  
 Party hardy.   Party down
 Party hardy.   Party down
 Party hardy.   Party down
 Party hardy.   Party on down
 Monday, dead in my socks
 Tuesday, too tired to rock
 Wednesday, tired, wanna sleep
 Thursday, oh so weak
 Friday,  party down
 Friday,  party down
 Party hardy, ay, yi, party down
 Party hardy, ah, party down
 Saturday,  Saturday
 Saturday night
On Saturday night this time, I'm gonna party, party, party, party
Huh, uh, uh,  party down
 Party hardy, ow, party down
 Party hardy, ah, party down
 Party hardy, ow, party down
 Party hardy.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Such a good time I had.  
What a real good time that I had last night, y'all
 See you again at the same place
 Next weekend
Again at the same time.  
 We'll call your friends and your neighbors
 We'll do it just like we this weekend
 'Cause when I...
Sunday's here, y'all.  
 Sunday's here, y'all
 And it won't be long
 It won't be long before we get on back to the J-O-B, y'all
I got a job.  
I'm talkin' about the,  the J-O-B
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, I...
 I'm livin'  for the weekend
It's a shame that we got to  get ready for the weekend
 Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
I'm waitin' that we can all do it again.  
Heh, heh!  I had a real good time.  
 I just can't help myself
