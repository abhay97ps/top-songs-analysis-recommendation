T'was the night before Christmas when all through the castle
My monsters were having a Yuletide hassle
The tree was all trimmed in ghoulish things
Like werewolf fangs and vampire wings
But they were up to no good
Didn't act like good monsters should
They found themselves a new play
They planned to rob Santa's sleigh
They were making a list and checking it twice
Frankenstein wanted a shiny new trike
A new chain for Janos, a brace for Igor's back
A speed shaver for Wolfman, a new cape for Drac
They were up to no good
Didn't act like good monsters should
They found themselves a new play
They planned to rob Santa's sleigh
The Mummy was to signal from the castle roof
At the very first sound of a reindeer hoof
As Santa slid down the chimney wall
The zombies were to make off with sleigh and all
From beyond the moat, there arose such a clatter
I jumped to the window to see what was the matter
Like a bolt of lightning, it happened so quick
And there in our midst stood old Saint Nick
He began to dig down deep in his sack
And came up with the traction for Igor's back
Drac got his cape, Frankie's trike made him behave
Even Wolfman was happy, now he can shave
And all ended well
And Santa was really swell
No need to rob Santa's sack
Maybe next year, he'll come back
So the children everywhere were spared the grief
Of losing their presents to a monster sleigh thief
Now the monsters love Santa and say they'll behave
And never again rob sleighs or graves
Igor, what do you think of Santa now?
"Santa good"
What was that he said as he drove out of sight?
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
"Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night"
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-wolf open sleigh
Well, dashing through the snow
Where is that reindeer with the red nose?
On Donner, on Blitzen, on Dancer and Vixen
