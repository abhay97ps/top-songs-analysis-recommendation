Does he love me?
I wanna know
How can I tell if he loves me so?
 Oh, no, you'll be deceived
 Oh, no, he'll make believe
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss 
 Oh, no, it's just his charms
 Oh, no, that's just his arms
If you want to know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss 
Oho, it's in his kiss 
Oh-oho, hug him, squeeze him tight
Find out what you wanna know
If it's love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss
Oh, no, that's not the way
You're not list'nin' to all I say
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss 
Oho, it's in his kiss 
Oh-oho, hug him, squeeze him tight
Find out what you wanna know
If it's love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss
Oh, no, that's not the way
And you're not listening to all that I say
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss 
Oho, it's in his kiss 
Oh, yeah , kiss 
Ooh, it's in his kiss 
It's in his kiss 
Oooh, it's in his kiss 
Ooohooo, oho, in his  kiss 
Ohohoho, it's in his kiss 
That's where it is 
Oh, it's in his kiss
