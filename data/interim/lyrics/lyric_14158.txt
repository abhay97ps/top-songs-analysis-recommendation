You're a polished diamond
Now you're feeling kinda rough
Yes I know how long you've been searching
For the perfect touch
You better hear what I say
I can tell your eyes are just about to give you away
Cause there's the girl that you were after
Feel your heart beating faster now
There's the girl you were after
Can you say that you don't want her anymore
Just take my word now
Cause you know it's true
She ain't good enough
For the likes of you
You better hear what I say
I can tell your eyes are just about
To give you away
Cause there's the girl that you were after
Feel your heart beating faster now
There's the girl that you were after
And all the time you can't get past her
There's the girl that you were after
Broken glass, complete disaster
There's the girl that you were after
Can you say that you don't want her anymore
I believed you once
When you explained
That it wasn't so tough
To forget her name
Cause there's the girl that you were after
Feel your heart beating faster now
There's the girl that you were after
And all the time you can't get past her
There's the girl that you were after
Broken glass, complete disaster
There's the girl that you were after
Can you say that you don't want her anymore
There's the girl
There's the girl......
You don't wanna
You don't wanna
You don't wanna
You don't wanna
There's the girl
There's the girl......
