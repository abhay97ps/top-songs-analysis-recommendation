If I ever do you wrong
If I ever leave you all alone
If I ever tell you a lie
And if I ever make you cry
Baby, I hope a fire
Light on my pie
I hope a bee sting me over my eye
You know I love my pie
And I love my eye, baby
So you know I'll never do you wrong
If I ever make you blue
If I ever say I don't love you
If I ever make you sad
And if I say something that'll make you mad
Baby, I hope I slip
And break my hip
I hope a fever blister come on my lip
You know I love my hip
And I love my lip, baby
So you know I'll never do you wrong
If I ever break your heart
If I ever tear your dreams apart
If I ever say we're through
And if I ever walk away from you
Baby, I hope a?
Come on my elbow
I hope a rock fall on my big toe
You know I love my toe
And my elbow, baby
So you know I'll never do you wrong
