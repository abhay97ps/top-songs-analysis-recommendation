MC
I came to have a party
Open off that Bacardi
Feeling so hot tamale
Boy, I know you watchin' me
So what's it gonna to be? 
Purple taking me higher
I'm lifted and I like it
Boy, you got me inspired
Baby, come and get it
If you're really feelin' me
'Cause it's my night 
No stress, no fights
I'm leavin’ it all behind
No tears, no time to cry
Just making the most of life
Everybody is livin' it up 
All the fellas keep lookin' at us
'Cause me and my girls on the floor like what 
While the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut
It's like that y'all 
That y'all 
It's like that a a that
A like that y'all 
It's like that y'al 
That y'all 
It's like that a a that

Oh-oh 
You like this and you know it
Caution, it's so explosive 
Them chickens is ash and I'm lotion
Baby, come and get it
Let me give you what you need 
It's a special occasion
Mimi's emancipation 
A cause for celebration
I ain't gonna let nobody's drama bother me
'Cause it's my night 
No stress, no fights
I'm leavin’ it all behind
No tears, no time to cry 
Just making the most of life
Everybody is livin' it up 
All the fellas keep lookin' at us
'Cause me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut
It's like that y'all
