For the last year
I've been searching
I needed something to believe
I'm a gambler
With my fortune
Trying to keep you up my sleeve
When I'm away
I fill my heart with
Dreams
I lose myself
Keep my silver dreams of you
Are you lonely
Are you crying
Are your tears for me
When I come home
And I touch you
What will our eyes see?
For the next year
I'll be traveling
Roads that take you far from me
Time can take love
Time can fade love
I hope that you'll remember me
When I'm away
I fill my heart with
Dreams
I lose myself
Keep my silver dreams of you
I lose myself dreaming silver dreams
I lose myself dreaming silver dreams
Silver dreams
Silver dreams
Ahh...
