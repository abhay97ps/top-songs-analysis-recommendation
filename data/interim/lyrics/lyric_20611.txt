Your empty walls, your empty walls
Pretentious attention, dismissive apprehension
Don't waste your time on coffins today
When we decline from the confines of our mind
Don't waste your time on coffins today
Don't you see their bodies burning
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication?
Don't you see their bodies burning
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication?
I want you to be left behind those empty walls
Taunt you to see from behind those empty walls
Those empty walls
When we decline from the confines of our mind
Don't waste your time on coffins today
Don't you see their bodies burning
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication?
Don't you see their bodies burning
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication?
I want you to be left behind those empty walls
Taunt you to see from behind those empty walls
Want you to be left behind those empty walls
I taunt you to see from behind those empty walls
From behind those empty walls
From behind those empty walls
The walls
From behind those empty walls
I loved you 
Yesterday 
Before 
You killed my family 
Don't you see their bodies burning
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication?
Don't you see their bodies burning 
Desolate and full of yearning 
Dying of anticipation 
Choking from intoxication? 
I want you to be left behind those empty walls
Taunt you to see from behind those empty walls
Want you to be left behind those empty walls
Taunt you to see from behind those empty walls
From behind those empty walls
From behind those fucking walls
From behind those goddamn walls
Those walls, those walls
