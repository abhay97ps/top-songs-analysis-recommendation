*Aww!*
*Aww! Aww!*
CMB! We in the building
Yeah
Swagged out, 100
Always strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs, and since I'm paid
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Yessir!
Check me out, look
26 inches, bitch, I'm sitting crooked
Old school Chevy faster than a silver bullet
Strawberry paint; seats, vanilla puddin'
Two bitches, go'n'n' and eat each other's pussy
Top chopped, sent the car to the barbershop
My driveway look something like a parkin' lot, haha
I'm so unorthodox
I got your bitch riding my dick wit no shocks
Haha!
Ha!
I'm the hottest shit jumping out the coffee pot
Man, I'm just tryna gеt my spot like a polka dot
Lil' kush make my eyes and my shoulders drop
Lil' syrup, and I can make a soda pop
Keep talking, and I can make my soldiers pop
Real niggas with me, riding 'til the motor stop
I got these hoes straight living out a soap-op
I got it covered like a coke top, okay?
Always strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs, and since I'm paid
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm—
Always strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs, and since I'm paid
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back
Yeah, shawty, the last M-O-B
Fly in the Bugatti with the tool on the seat 
Put the K in the car while we riding blades 
Put the chopper on the pussy in the driveway 
Bet the house on the young'un' when we got paid 
Triple-colors on the bikes and the new Merced' 
Bustin' keys on they ass while we got paid 
From I-10's ridin' hot to an open bay 
Uptown made man out the hallway 
Crab in the bucket, 50 shots, bitch, make a way 
I thought they knew, shawty!
Like Father, Like Son...
Ball till you fall, stunting wit them paper plates 
Throwin' hundreds on them hoes while we eat steaks 
We in the club popping bottles, like, every day 
We grind for the shine, nigga, getting big money 
Got a fleet tossing chicken, nigga, get cake 
I'm on the island with this power like Scarface 
I'm in the Impala, drop-top, chunky 
Iceman, Birdman, rocking red monkeys 
Already, nigga, neighborhood superstar 
And we gon' ball til we fall, bitch
Always strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs, and since I'm paid
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm—
Always strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs, and since I'm paid
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back
