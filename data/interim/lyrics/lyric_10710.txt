In the heart of the night
In the cool southern rain
There's a full moon in sight
Shining down on the Pontchartrain
And the river she rises
Just like she used to do
She's so full of surprises
She reminds me of you
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
Oh, whoa, down in New Orleans
There's a night bird singing
Right on through till the dawn
And the streets are still ringing
With people carrying on
It's been so long waiting
Just to be here again
Anticipating
All the time I could spend
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
And I trust in your love never falling down
I trust in your love
Just like I do in this town
Whoa, never falling down
Whoa, never falling down
In the heart of the night
In the cool fallin' rain
There's a full moon in sight
Shining down on the Pontchartrain
And the river she rises
Just like she used to do
She's so full of surprises
Oh, momma, she reminds me of you
Right here, in the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
Down in New Orleans
And I'm so glad to be back in New Orleans
Please don't wake me, don't shake me
If it's only, if it's only just a dream
It's the only place I can face that feels so right
Below that Dixie moon and loving you
In the heart of the night
