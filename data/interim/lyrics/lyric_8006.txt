This song is dedicated to some people
With whom I had the pleasure of living
Over half the years I've lived
'Til now, when we come to our fork in the road
And though our feet may travel
A different path from now on
I want them to know how I feel about them
And that I wish them well
Sweet harmony
Go on and and blow on
Stay in perfect tune
With your own familiar song
Make the world aware
That you're still goin' strong
Go on, spread your joy around the world
Spread your joy around the world
Sweet harmony, yeah, yeah
Go on and blow on
I believe in miracles
If you can dream it it can be done
And though a task was made for two
It can be done well by one
Go on, spread your joy around the world
Spread your joy around the world, ew
Sweet harmony
Spread your joy around the world, ew
Sweet harmony
Go on, spread your joy around the world
Sweet harmony, ew
Sweet harmony, go on and go
You were the prelude for the song
The village minstrels play
Though most of them have come and gone
You're still around today
Go on, spread your joy around the world
Harmony, huh, spread your joy around the world
Keep on, sweet harmony, ew
To every heart and soul
You know the joy you bring
When you do your thing
Sweet harmony, yeah
Don't stop now, no
Sweet harmony, I believe
Spread your joy around the world
Sweet harmony
