When I noticed her the first time
I was outside running barefoot in the rain
She lived in the house next door
Her nose was pressed against the window pane
When I looked at her she smiled
And showed a place where two teeth used to be
And I heard her ask her mom if she
Could come outside and play with me
Soon the day's of sand and shovels
Gave way to the mysteries of life
Then I noticed she was changing and I
Looked at her through different eyes
We became as one and knew a love
Without beginning or an end
And everyday I lived with her
Was like a new day dawning once again
And I've loved her since every doll was Shirley Temple
Soda pop was still a nickel
Jam was on her fingertips
Milk was circled on her lips
After many years our live grew
Silent and at night I heard her cry
And when she left me in the fall I knew
That it would be our last goodbye
I was man enough to give her
Everything she needed for a while
And searching for a perfect love
I found that I could not give her a child
Now she lives a quiet life
And is the mother of a little girl
Every time I pass her house
My thoughts go back into another world
Because I see her little girl
Her nose is pressed against the window pane
She thinks I'm a lonely man
Who wants to come inside out of the rain
And I've loved her since every doll was shirley Temple
Soda pop was still a nickel
Jam was on her fingertips
Milk was circled on her lips
