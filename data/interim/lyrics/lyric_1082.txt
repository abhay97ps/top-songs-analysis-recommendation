A gypsy rover come over the hill
Down through the valley shady
He whistled, and sang 'til the greenwood rang
And he won the heart of a lady
Ah-dee-doo-ah-dee-doo-dah-day
Ah-dee-doo-ah-dee-day-dee
He whistled, and he sang 'til the greenwood rang
And he won the heart of a lady
She left her father's castle gate
Left her own fine lover
Left her servants and her estates
To follow the gypsy rover
Ah-dee-doo-ah-dee-doo-dah-day
Ah-dee-doo-ah-dee-day-dee
He whistled, and he sang 'til the greenwood rang
And he won thе heart of a lady
"He is no gypsy, my Father", shе said
"But lord of these lands all over
And I will stay 'til my dyin' day
With my whistlin' gypsy rover"
Ah-dee-doo-ah-dee-doo-dah-day
Ah-dee-doo-ah-dee-day-dee
He whistled, and he sang 'til the greenwood rang
And he won the heart of a lady
