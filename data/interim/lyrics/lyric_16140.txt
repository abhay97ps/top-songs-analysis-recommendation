You never have to worry about my love
As long as you're taking care of business with my heart
See, I'm the kind of girl to dedicate my world
You got to give me all you got
I need it all, baby, every drop
You got to show me and mean the words you say
It's not a game for me, baby
It's just not that way, yeah
I'm only one woman, baby
Treat me like a lady.  
You got to take the time to show me 
That I'm your one and only.  
I'm only one woman, baby
And I need a one-woman man.
