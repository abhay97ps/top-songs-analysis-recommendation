I once was a fresh young kid
Nothing could drag me down
I lived and I loved what I did
No one could turn me ‘round
I laughed and I joked with my friends
They don’t suspect a thing
Alone in the light of the moon
A change comes over me
How can I stand this lunacy
Feeding my dark desires?
Look at the nighttime sky, you fool
It’s a fool moon fire
Day after day, it’s no use
At night there’s something changed
I just gotta play it loose
Be cool, but it’s getting strange
I know it won’t be long
Before the world can see
Alone in the light of moon
My mad lycanthropy
How can I stand this lunacy
Feeding my dark desires?
Look at the nighttime sky, you fool
It’s a fool moon fire
Now my friend, you know
It’s so, so hard to say
Sometimes darkness beats
Defeats the light of day
How can I stand this lunacy
Feeding my dark desires?
Look at the nighttime sky, you fool
It’s a fool moon fire
How can I stand this lunacy
Feeding my dark desires?
Look at the nighttime sky, you fool
It’s a fool moon fire
Fool moon fire
Fool moon fire
Fool moon fire
Fool moon fire
Fool moon fire
Fool moon fire
Fool moon fire
Fool moon fire
Fool moon fire
Fool moon fire
Fool moon fire
Fool moon fire…
