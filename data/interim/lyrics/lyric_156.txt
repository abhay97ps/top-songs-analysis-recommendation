Well, hi, Simon
Theodore
Alvin, I see you got here early
And you're rehearsing the band
That's very good
You know I would
What's that great big expensive
Orchestra waiting for over there?
Oh, boy, I'm sure glad they don't belong to
Alvin, Alvin, say something, Alvin
You mean you hired all those musicians
You know how much a
Fifty piece orchestra costs
Wait a minute, you don't need
A fifty piece orchestra to play for
Oh, how we love to go for a ride
And see the country far and wide
Look at the snow and the frost
Will you wait?
We roll the windows up and down
And toot the horn in every town
Who cares what the orchestra costs
I'll tell you who
We're happy while we're rolling along
We're singing every goofy song
Boy, what a joy, what fun
Children waving you a big hello
Why, you've got friends
You didn't even know
How we love to go for a ride
And see the country far and wide
It's great when you're on the go
Let's go
Alvin, put that baton down and listen to me
You just cannot go around
Listen, fifty musicians costs over
Let me see, two thousand times fifty
Do you realize?
Alvin, stop leading that expensive orchestra
And come over here
Children waving you a big hello
And he's still worrying about the dough
How we love to go for a ride
And see the country far and wide
It's great when you're on the go
Alvin, will you cut it out?
What do you think we're
Gonna pay this orchestra with chestnuts ?
Now listen to
Slow down, buddy
I absolutely cannot understand
A single word you're saying
You can't understand a word I'm saying
You can't understand a word I'm saying
Simon, Theodore, will you cut out that
Wah, wah, wah and listen to me
Orchestra, will you please go home?
Alvin, stop leading that orchestra
Alvin, Alvin
