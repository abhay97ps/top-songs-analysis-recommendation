Ba do, ba do, ba do, ba do
In my hometown lived a quite girl
Together we always seemed to be
We we're just good friends
Then something deep within, my heart
Kept a telling me
Be closer together
For you might love one another
You be closer together
For you might love one another
You must take heed to your heart
And never let it get too far apart
She's the girl that you love
She's the girl that you love
Closer together
Closer together
For the first time I, looked into her eyes
Wasn't long before I realised
Sincere and true
They said I love you
And at last her heart was saying too
Be closer together
For you might love one another
You be closer together
For you might love one another
You got to take heed to your heart
And never let her get too far apart
She's the girl that you love
She's the girl that you love
Closer together
Closer together
C'mon lets, be closer together
C'mon lets, be closer together
C'mon lets, be closer together
C'mon lets, be closer together
