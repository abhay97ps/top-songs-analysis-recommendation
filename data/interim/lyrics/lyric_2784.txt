If you want this love of mine
Treat me gentle, treat me kind
Don't be mean, and don't be bad
And you'll get the truest love that you ever had
If you want my lips to kiss
Cuddle close and don't resist
Lovin' you is all I crave
And if you let me, pretty baby, I'll be your slave
If you want this love of mine
Baby, come on and get it
If you should fall in love with me
I'll bet you never regret it
Not a thing I wouldn't do
I'd do anything just for you
Just let me know that you're really mine
Because I wanna love you 'til the end of time
Not a thing I wouldn't do
I'd do anything just for you
Just let me know that you're really mine
Because I wanna love you 'til the end of time
I just wanna make love to you, baby
So you better come on
And get it
