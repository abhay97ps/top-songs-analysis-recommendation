Made to last, I raise the flag full staff, why do you ask?
I just look back, wave, and laugh
We got spaceships made from glass, we look up as they pass
We get a good look at Wonder Woman's ass
While we sit there, she scrape the froth off my beer
While you’re at it, why don't you take your wig off dear?
Yeah - this is some James Brown "Living in America" shit
And probably as good as it's ever gon’ get
At the campsite, under a lamp light, Hamites and whites
Survivalists types obsessed with plant life
The Israelites say they plan to stand and fight
To do that, first you gotta recognize what's right
Happy wife, happy life, she a happy mutant, maybe you're right
She's the professor Xavier type
She doesn't strike you as the type that likes the lyrics I write
We spend cold icicle nights, communicate Skype
After work go home, lay pipe, then play fight
Explain life, talk about what our day was like
I got a blow torch for bubbles and candlestick market trouble
Whatever man, I was born to hustle
Read the charts, enjoy the warm breeze and fart
Been there, done that, I don't need to talk
Cause I'm a swasta sipping vodka, eating tandoori steak 'n lobster
Harrison Ford used to be a carpenter
Three’s Company: Suzanne Somers, Mr. Furley, remember?
Put the shower curtain up was clever
Love is love, knuckles and nubs, billy club thugs with a grudge
Against men with man buns and guns
Poker run emerald coast, I’m stoked - that's an inside joke
Propose a toast on wide approach
Black shoes, white gloves, bowties, slick quotes and cigar smoke
Now customs wanna’ check my cargo
They gotta' Hip-Hop embargo
I visit Mar-a-Lago, to see if martial law is normal
Eagle point marina, party on the slip
Polly want a cracker, shorty wanna' strip
Rip, this is some James Brown "Living in a America" shit
The Cherubims win, the Seraphims quit
High speed trains constructed by low speed cranes
Asteroid strike, it's all in vain
