Yes, I'm the girl
From Wolverton Mountain
I wish someone would
Make me their wife
I can't help being lonesome
On Wolverton Mountain
When your daddy's handy
With a gun and a knife
They said my lips
Were sweeter than honey
But how do they know
When no one's made the dare
I hate the bears and the birds
On Wolverton Mountain
They tell my daddy
And it just ain't fair
Many a lad has tried
To climb this mountain
But they never seem
To reach the top
My daddy, Clifton Clowers
Is always there to meet them
His gun and a knife
Bring them to a stop
Yes, I'm the girl
From Wolverton Mountain
And if something don't change
I'll be an old maid all my life
But I keep hoping somebody
Will climb this mountain
And take me to the valley
To be his wife
There'll be somebody
Who really loves me and
He'll climb up on the mountain
He won't be killed by Clifton Clowers...
