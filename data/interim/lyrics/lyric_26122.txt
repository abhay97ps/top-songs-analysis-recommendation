I was so high out my mind, I thought I wasn't gon' see tomorrow
Yeah
Stayin' ten toes down with my head up 
Teezy on the beat 
Mafia the dream, we just gon' chase it
I was talkin' to, um, I was talkin' to Slime when I said, um
I think I asked him do he think, do he think I could do seven
Then he said "Bro, you fuckin', is you fuckin' crazy?" That nigga said, "Hell yeah"
Then he said some other shit behind that
Reportin' straight out of the slums 
From rags to riches, I got me some bitches and I changed up how I come 
In a drought when your pockets got mumps 
These niggas believin' in nothin'
Ran up my sack, you know I ain't dumb
Wherever I'm goin', I pull up with somethin' 
38, Atlanta, Lil Haiti 
Where I'm from, it's hard to make it 
I'll never let 'em take it 
Grammys, I was nominated 
Told that bitch that I'm leavin', so face it 
Get a new ho and have me a baby 
Out the jungle, I conquered and made it 
It still don't feel like I'm famous 
Feel like they don't feel me now, yeah 
Fill it up, stuntin', they see me now, yeah 
I'm steps away, I can't stop now 
No, I won't let you waste my time 
Surrounded by some millionaires 
And I know I'ma be one when I walk off
Feel like I can be a trillionaire 
Yeah I'ma be the one that they talk 'bout
Yeah
I'ma be the one they talk about
I'ma be the one they envy, yeah
Hate it when you made it out the struggle
Love to see a nigga in the trenches 
Went to sleep, had a few nightmares, nigga just left off a mission
I'm the one paid my dues, dropped out of school, now I'm winnin'
I had a girl with some red hair, made a nigga feel like Chapo 
Just got off the phone with vato, know a young nigga gon' kill somethin'
I wanna get me a mil' ticket, my young nigga wanna get his murders up
Gotta go get me a million, spend half of it on convertibles
Jumpin' off the porch, no daddy, had to go and get mine out the gutter
Came up poor and ashy, now a nigga take care of my mother 
Wish I had a cure on sickle cell, hate to see my sister suffer 
You can never put a price on how much I love her
Surrounded by some millionaires 
And I know I'ma be one when I walk off
Feel like I can be a trillionaire 
Yeah I'ma be the one that they talk 'bout
Feel like they don't feel me now 
Flexed up, stuntin', they see me now, yeah 
I'm steps away, I can't stop now 
No, I won't let you waste my time 
Represent out the gutter, yeah, yeah
Fell in love with my Cartier, yeah
Go to war 'bout my brother, yeah, yeah
I'll kill 'bout my brother, yeah, yeah
Used to sleep on the floor, yeah, yeah
Used to kick in the door, yeah, yeah
I finesse with the bros, yeah, yeah
