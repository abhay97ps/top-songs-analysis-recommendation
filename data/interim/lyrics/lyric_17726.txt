Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way
Messing me up, my whole head
Teasing me, just like Tisha did Martin
Now look at what you're starting
Schoolboy's crush and it ain't on the hush
The whole world sees it but you can't 
My peoples they complain, sit and rave and rant 
Your name is out my mouth like an ancient chant 
Got me like a dog as I pause and pant
*heavy breathing*
Speaking of which
Got a leash and I wish just to rock you miss 
Make a militant move, peep my strategy 
End of the day you're not mad at me 
Not dealing with nobody, now that's what you told me 
I said, "Hey yo, it's cool, we can just be friendly" 
'Cause yo, picture me messing it up
Her mind not corrupt, with the ill C-cups
Shit, I'm on my J.O. 
Bullshitting, hoping that the day goes slow 
Got me like a friend, what confuses me though
Is kisses when we breeze, tell me what's the deal, yo?
Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way 
Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things 
Should I just sit out or come harder? 
Help me find my way
Now why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Making things for me towards you harder
Killing me, just when I think we're there
You douse the whole vibe and the flows in the air
Telling me 'bout next man
But next man ain't the nigga with the plan
Who got your heart in mind?
It's about time that you just unwind 
And let it just happen, make it front-free 
Just sweat me like Moneypenny 
Digging you, getting inside of your stee 
It's the Quest cat keeping you company 
Forever, or however you want it
Word, word
Now wait a minute, ma, before you jet into the curb 
Start to make affections, which is goo,d not the herb
But it, it ain't me, and I, I ain't blurred 
I'ma still just chill with you
Maybe things could change if you change your view 
If not, then, I guess it is cool 
Just to keep to yourself and abide by the rules, right
Like that y'all
Check it out now...
Check it out now...
Like that now...
Check it out now...
Wha wha now...
Check it out now...
Yeah yeah now...
Check it out now...
Check it out now...
It's like that now...
Check it out now...
Yeah yeah now...
Check it out now... 
What you say, what? what?
Now you caught my heart for the evening 
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way
