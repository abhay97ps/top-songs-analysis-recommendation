When your world is full of strange arrangements
And gravity won't pull you through
You know you're missing out on something
Well that something depends on you
It takes a lot to love you
You know it's true
There's one thing
Yes, one thing that turns this gray sky to blue
The look of love
The look of love
The look of love
When your girl has left you out on the pavement
When your dreams fall apart at the seams
Your reason for living, your reason for leaving
Don't ask me what it means
I don't know the answer to that question
If I knew I would tell you
Look for your information
Yes, there's one thing, one thing that still hold true
The look of love
The look of love
The look of love
The look of love
The look of love
The look of love
If you judge a book by the cover
Then you judge the look by the lover
I hope you'll soon recover
Me, I go from one extreme to another
And though my friends just might ask me
They say, "Martin, maybe one day you'll find true love"
I say, "Maybe there must be a solution
To the one thing, the one thing we can't find"
Sisters and brothers
Should help each other
Ooh, ooh Heavens above
Hip hip hooray
Yippee ai yippee aiay
Be lucky in love
Look of love
