Look, my bitches all bad, my niggas all real
I ride on his dick in some big tall heels
Big fat checks, big large bills
Front, I'll flip like ten cartwheels
Cold ass bitch, I give broads chills
Ten different looks and my looks all kill
I kiss him in the mouth, I feel all grills
He eat in the car, that's meals on wheels 
I was born to flex 
Diamonds on my neck
I like boardin' jets, I like mornin' sex 
But nothing in this world that I like more than checks 
All I really wanna see is the 
I don't really need the D, I need the 
All a bad bitch need is the 
I got bands in the coupe 
Bustin' out the roof
I got bands in the coupe 
Touch me, I'll shoot 
Shake a lil ass 
Get a little bag and take it to the store 
Get a little cash 
Shake it real fast and get a little more 
I got bands in the coupe 
Bustin' out the roof
I got bands in the coupe 
Bustin' out the roof 
I gotta fly, I need a jet, shit
I need room for my legs
I got a baby, I need some money, yeah
I need cheese for my egg
All y'all bitches in trouble
Bring brass knuckles to the scuffle
I heard that Cardi went pop
Yeah, I did go pop 
That's me bustin' they bubble
I'm Dasani with the drip
Baby mommy with the clip
Walk out Follie's with a bitch
Bring a thottie to the whip
If she fine or she thick, goddamn
Walkin' past the mirror, ooh
Damn, I'm fine 
Let a bitch try me, boom 
Hammer time, uh
I was born to flex 
Diamonds on my neck
I like boardin' jets, I like mornin' sex 
But nothing in this world that I like more than checks 
All I really wanna see is the 
I don't really need the D, I need the 
All a bad bitch need is the 
I got bands in the coupe 
Bustin' out the roof
I got bands in the coupe 
Touch me, I'll shoot 
Shake a lil ass 
Get a little bag and take it to the store 
Get a little cash 
Shake it real fast and get a little more 
I got bands in the coupe 
Bustin' out the roof
I got bands in the coupe 
Touch me, I'll shoot 
Bitch, I will pop on your pops 
Bitch, I will pop on whoever 
You know who pop the most shit? 
The people whose shit not together 
You'da bet Cardi a freak 
All my pajamas is leather 
Bitch, I will black on your ass 
Wakanda forever
Sweet like a honey bun, spit like a Tommy gun
Rollie a one of one, come get your mommy some
Cardi at the tip-top, bitch
Kiss the ring and kick rocks, sis 
Jump it down, back it up 
Make that nigga put down 2K
I like my niggas dark like D'USSÉ
He gonna eat this ass like soufflé
I was born to flex, diamonds on my neck
I like boardin' jets, I like mornin' sex
But nothing in this world that I like more than Kulture
All I really wanna see is the 
I don't really need the D, I need the 
All a bad bitch need is the
K.K.C
