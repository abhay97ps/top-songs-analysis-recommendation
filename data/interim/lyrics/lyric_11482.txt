I'm going down to the river
Just to bide my time away
Don't you look for me tomorrow
Cause I won't be back this way
Oh girl I hate to leave you
But I just can't seem to stay
When I see the sunrise in your eyes
Darling I'll be on the way
The miles go by so slowly
It seems that time stands still
I long for the day that I can settle down
But I guess I never will
Oh the cities they pass by me
Like the ships that sail the sea
Lord I here that highway calling
Darling I hope you'll wait for me
Oh it's cold here in the city
I live my life from day to day
Guess I'll always be a rambler
But it's so hard to find my way
Lord I need someone to help me
I just can't go on this way
I need your smiling face beside me
So darling I'm coming home today
