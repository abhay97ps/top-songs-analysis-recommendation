Anyone
Anyone
Anyone
Anyone
You can blame me
Try to shame me
And still I’ll care for you
You can run around
Even put me down
Still I’ll be there for you
The world
May think I’m foolish
They can’t see you
Like I can
Oh but anyone
Who knows what love is
Will understand
Anyone
 Oh yeah babe
Anyone
Anyone
 I feel so sorry
 For the ones
Who pity me
 ‘Cause they just don’t know
 Oh, they don’t know what happiness and love can be
I know
I know to ever let you go
Oh is more
Than I could ever stand
Oh but a-anyone, anyone
Who knows what love is
Will understand
Oh,  they'll understand
 If they try love they'll  understand
 Oh, try  to understand
 Everyone needs love  so understand...
