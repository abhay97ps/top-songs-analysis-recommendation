Why don't you stop!  and think it over ?
Before  you say it's over
Because 
It'll never be over for me
Think of all the happy times we knew
All the memories I shared with you . . 
Don't walk out the door and say goodbye
Isn't what we had worth one more try?
I just don't know, what I would do
Darling, without you
What a cold an' lonely place this world would be . . 
If you leave me now, you'll hurt me so
Just for ol' times sake before you go . .
