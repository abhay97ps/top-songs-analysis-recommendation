You're an anchor, I'm uptight
You're what gets me through the night
You keep me steady and on course
'Til I found you I was lost
But you're the earth and I'm a sky
And sometimes if I go to high
Well, then you pull a string that pulls me back
If not for you I might lose track
And I might fly away, oh, I might fly away
And go my own way to places that we've never been together
I might fly away take to the sky some day but not for now, not today
Nobody here is flyin' away, away
You have reasons, I have dreams
So we're perfect, so it seems
You talk fortunes, I tell the truth
Kept me from my crazy youth
When you're near me I feel whole
I don't have to rock and roll
I don't worry, I don't think
But baby hold me close and I won't break
And I might fly away, oh, I might fly away
And go my own way to places that we've never been together
I might fly away take to the sky some day but not for now, not today
Nobody here is flyin', flyin' away, oh, I might fly away
I might fly away but not for now, not today
Nobody here is flyin' away, oh, I might fly away
I might fly away, take to the sky some day but not for now, not today
Nobody here is flyin' away
