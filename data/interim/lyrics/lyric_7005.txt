I can hear his heart beat for a thousand miles
And the heavens open every time he smiles
And when I come to him, that's where I belong
Yes, I run unto him like a river's song
He gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
He gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
He's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to him when the sun goes down
Takes away my trouble, takes away my grief
Takes away my heartache, I go right to sleep
He gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
He gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
Yes, I need him in the daytime
Yes, I need him in the night
Yes, I want to throw my arms around him
Kiss him, hug him, kiss him, hug him tight
And when I'm returning from so far away
He gives me some sweet lovin', brightens up my day
Yes, it makes me righteous, yes, it makes me whole
Yes, it makes me mellow down to my soul
He gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
He gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
He gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
He gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
He gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
