Yeah, what happens when it's too good to throw away?
You either let it go bad or go away
Take my time , take my time, I'ma take my time
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na 
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na 
I'm single again 
Told her we'll be better off friends 
Baby, I should just focus on me 
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again 
Told 'em that we better off friends 
Blaming you is just so easy 
But maybe the problem's me
I'm single again 
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be 
Maybe I should spend this time on me 
Maybe I should spend this cash on me 
Instead of blaming all my old girls when I leave 
Instead of calling up these fake hoes that I don't need 
Old relationships turn to new déjà vus
Got me feeling like, "I don't fuck with you"
Oh nah, nah, that's the old me
You fucking with the new me 
Honestly, all the disrespect had damn near ruined me 
All the trust gone, seems like all you say is, "Prove it to me" 
And you know I suck at lying, don't, don't do it to me 
Maybe 'cause my mom had never worked it out with my dad 
Maybe 'cause he had insecurities and she had 'em back 
Maybe 'cause single parent love was all I ever had
Who knows? 
I'm single again 
Told her we'll be better off friends 
Maybe I should just focus on me 
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again 
Told 'em that we better off friends 
Blaming you is just so easy 
But maybe the problem's me 
I'm single again 
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be 
Maybe I should spend this time on me 
Maybe I should spend this cash on me
Take my time, take my time, I'ma take my time
Take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
Even if I'm late, I'ma take my time
What have you done for yourself?
What have you done for your mental health? 
I even tried the drugs and they didn't help
Short term fix, that breaks everything else 
And my bros keep throwing me these random girls in stallions
I need the best advice, went across the street to Khaled 
He said the major key is to be strong on your own
Lose your other half, you're never off balance 
Lookin' for the love in somebody else
That I probably should've gave to myself
Cycles I need to break in myself
If I'm alone, I'm second to no one else, so 
I'm single again 
Told her we'll be better off friends 
Maybe I should just focus on me 
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again
Told 'em that we better off friends 
Blaming you is just so easy 
But maybe the problem's me 
I'm single again
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be 
Maybe I should spend this time on me 
Maybe I should spend this cash on me 
Take my time, take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
Take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
Even if I'm late, I'ma take my time
Yeah
Stay on this grind
