Baby, you’ve got a sexy body
I think I ought to tell you so
You look so deep and so delicious
I kiss you from your head to toe
If there’s a chance I could romance you
I’d make you scream in sheer delight
I’d give you so much love and pleasure
You’d want to make love every night
You know I could
(Ooh, ooh, ooh
Wrap my arms around you)
You know I would
(Ooh, ooh, ooh
Squeeze and hold your body tight)
I’ll tell the world
(Ooh, ooh, ooh
I’m so glad I found you)
Don’t you know, baby
(Ooh, ooh, ooh
Now tonight’s the night for love)
I’m gonna give my all to you
I’m gonna have a ball with you
I’m gonna give my all to you
I’m gonna give it to you
Give it to you
Give it you
Give it to you, baby
Baby, there’s no one who can move me
Or do the freaky things you do
You set a fire through my body
Whenever I make love to you
Come next time that we get together
I’ll probably say these words again
But as for now, boy
When you want me
Just open up and come on in
You know I could
(Ooh, ooh, ooh
Wrap my arms around you)
You know I would
(Ooh, ooh, ooh
Squeeze and hold your body tight)
I’ll tell the world
(Ooh, ooh, ooh
I’m so glad I found you)
Don’t you know, baby
(Ooh, ooh, ooh
Now tonight’s the night for love)
I’m gonna give my all to you
I’m gonna have a ball with you
I’m gonna give my all to you
I’m gonna give it to you
Give it to you
Give it you
Give it to you, baby
I’m gonna give my all to you
I’m gonna have a ball with you
I’m gonna give my all to you
I’m gonna give it to you
Give it to you
Give it you
Give it to you, baby
I want to slowly take my time with you
I want to rap
And I want to dine with you
I want to drink the finest wine with you
And then go wild and crazy
I want our eyes to meet
I want lips to touch
I don’t think that’s asking of too much
If you want me like I want you
Then let’s go wild and crazy
I’m gonna give it to you
Give it to you
Give it you
Give it to you, baby
I wanna give my all to you
I wanna have a ball with you
I’m gonna give my all to you
I’m gonna give it to you
Give it to you
Give it you
Give it to you, baby
I wanna give my all to you
I wanna have a ball with you
I wanna give my all to you
I wanna give it to you
Gve it to you
Give it you
Give it to you, baby
I wanna give my all to you
I wanna have a ball with you
I wanna give my all to you
I wanna give it to you
Give it to you
Give it you
Give it to you, baby
