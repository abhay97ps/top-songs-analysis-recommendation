I come from a place where light cease to exist
Some call it dark city
Difficult to discern the difference between night and day
With a perfect mix of denial despair and deviance intricately combined to alleviate the pain
Yet the suffering still remains
Where cats ride the old train rocking gold chains immaculate but
Purposely tucked in shirts because
You don't want to fall prey to hungry eyes attached to
The patient niggas that remain faceted on your jewels
Waiting for the perfect opportunity to tax that shit
The whole way where you might get blown away
By metallic stones that spray out of handheld devices
In the palms of cats who won’t hesitate to cock back and structure you lifeless
So in the hands of a navy blue uniform who also possesses the licence to
 the oesophagus with the vigour plus preciseness of impulsive 
But seemingly lack the same flawless ability when it comes to guns 
And mics slipped conveniently
This year  rates are at an all-time high
As students migrates to the school of hard knocks
Curricula consists of strategically designed gang warfare battlefronts
Police evasion tactics
And ergonomically roll blunts that produce the type of smoke that’s  lungs to achieve that all time high
Ghetto mathematicians fluent in the studies of scales and kilos
No politics no politicians, in fact
The only axis of evil we know can be summed up in four 
Three  two Chinese food, one liquor spot
The terrorized urban blocks where helpless patients herd in flocks
Welcome to the New York rock exchange
The presidential heads can be changed into pretty miniature pebbles
That possess the power of the head rush
The brain cartilage with the force 
Physical forms in a hopeless, worthless zombified carcass
Less sophisticated drug is reduced to sniffing glue, , aerosol fumes
And C02 bb gun cartridges most of us hostages to the darkness where
Shots rip through garments and sever flesh and bones with the precision of sharpened dart tips
In the hands of an archerist marksmen
I quickly depart when I witness the evil thoughts that lurks in the hearts of men
Manifests itself in the heartless deeds where harlots feed off a 
Whispering to herself I’ll never do this again, their tricks will end
As soon as I raise enough ends to feed my seeds
Easier said than done, how easily she spread the buns for the 
Officially recycled back to the nigga she just sucked off to buy some crack
A ruthless cycle that weakens the strong like cancer  disciples
Praise the lord and ask questions but curse the gods when their prayers go unanswered
Where priests are sent from up above, the Shepard the sheep saves souls lead us to greatness
But in this dark city where it's difficult to see 10 feet ahead of you let alone eternal  the shepherds go astray
And turn Sunday school rapists
When the cats away the mice will rape kids
Where religious  argue for ages and ages through pages of text but its hopeless
Unfocused on the fact that the meek which will inherit the earth is reserved for rats and roaches
And mushrooms that thrive under trees without leaves barley alive
They taunt the roses that barely survive once adored, now ignored, forgotten, obsolete and dismissed
I come from a place where light cease to exist
Some call it dark city
Difficult to delineate the difference between night and day
Where all that's beautiful fades away
Everything alters and one by one we drift away like the waters
Where sirens sing songs of sadness for martyrs who died in the 
I heard the news  we all had choices and that was the life he chose so I felt the remorse for
That dead dealer who instead was dealt a bad hand and poker face couldn’t save him this time
He didn’t understand it when they call your bluff and your chips are gone
 with sweet gunpowder kisses
That caresses the flesh that breaks hearts harder than the departure of high school lovers
Screams under the moonlight when the NYPD moonlight 
Must be fluent in the usage of guns, clubs and plumbing tools
Watch them as they awfully administer back shots to the backside of  with plungers
Then you wonder why I fail to sympathize when I heard Jiggs got shot
Feel no remorse for dead dealers and likewise
I feel the remorse for dead cops in this jungle
Where urban dwellers ride the trains with their heads in hands disgruntled
Trying to ascertain when did life get so hard
Knowing the meaning of life has been reduced to dead end jobs
Overpriced rent and an underdeveloped community and a 17 dollar 7-day unlimited ride metro card
And at the end of days you realise that there’s nothing except endless days
Where all that's beautiful fades away
Where everything alters and one by one we drift away like the waters in the Hudson river
I walk these streets unfazed at the sounds of mothers who deliver screams of suffering for fallen sons and daughters
Where all that’s beautiful drifts away
I walk these streets unfazed at the sounds of woman who hola
You'd be amazed at the shit they're willing to part with for a dollar
Everything altars and one by one we disappear
I walk these streets unfazed, apathetic to the tears
And the sounds of brothers who top off beers and smoke blunts in dedication to others who ain't here
When all that's beautiful fades away
I walk these streets unfazed at the visions of robberies and botched 5 finger discounts
 delineate the quickest way to dismount off a chain link fence not to avoid thieves but to evade to the events
In this dark city
