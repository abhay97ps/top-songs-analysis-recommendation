Was a time I felt I was the only bad luck charm
Thought I lived an honest life
Not doing nobody no harm
Well I got me that son
I always dreamed about
When he was born man did a jump and shout
Well one old day
He fell down sick
With something that had no name
Everybody shook their heads and called it a crying shame, well
I did what I never did before
Fell down on my knees and prayed
And he pulled through and only God knows how
And I got a debt unpaid
That's when I learned that dammit isn't God's last name
No Dammit isn't God's last name
I know many men who have no faith in the power of heaven above
But there's a force who lives our lives on not but straight out loving
And if you need help take a tip from me
You can get that help and the price is free
You have troubles everyone does
Don't blame something you don't know
Go find a place to be alone and spill your tale of woe
Don't be scared if you ain't never prayed and you blasphemed all of your life
God has infinite mercy on your soul
Could lose your yesterdays
You're going to learn that Dammit isn't god's last name
No Dammit isn't god's last name
No Dammit isn't god's last name
No dammit isn't god's last name
No dammit isn't God's last name
No dammit isn't God's last name
No dammit isn't God's last name
