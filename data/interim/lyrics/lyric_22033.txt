Uh
You don't have to be beautiful to turn me on
I just need your body, baby, from dusk till dawn
You don't need experience to turn me out
You just leave it all up to me
I'm gonna show you what it's all about
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss
Ah, ah-ow
You got to not talk dirty, baby
You can't be to flirty, mama
I know how to undress me
Yeah
I want to be your fantasy
Maybe you could be mine 
You just leave it all up to me
And we could have a good time
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I think I wanna dance
Huh
Wooh, gotta, gotta, gotta
Little girl Wendy's parade
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Women not girls rule my world
I said they rule my world
Act your age, mama 
Not your shoe size 
Maybe we can do the twirl
You don't have to watch Dynasty to have an attitude
You just leave it all up to me
My love will be your food
Yeah
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss
