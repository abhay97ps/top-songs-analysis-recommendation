Sometimes I walk a little faster in the school hallway
Just to get next to you
Some days I spend a little extra time in the morning
Just to impress you
Guess you don't notice
Guess you don't need this
Sad, you're not seeing what you're missing
On the outside shying away
On the inside dying to say
I'm unusual, not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai Chi practicing, snowboard champion
I could fix the flat on your car
I might even be a rockstar
I might even be a rockstar
Sometimes I wish when the phone rings
That it would be you saying, "Let's hang out"
Then you confess that there's something special
Between us, why don't we find out?
But you don't even know me
Guess you don't need me
Why you're not seeing what you're missing?
On the outside shying away
On the inside dying to say 
I'm unusual, not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai Chi practicing, snowboard champion
I could fix the flat on your car
I might even be a rockstar
If you only knew the real me
I might even be a rockstar
I'm telling you that we are meant to be
That wouldn't it be nice if you could see
That I really am a rockstar
Yeah-yeah! 
Yeah, I really am a rockstar
Hey, hey, hey
Ha, a rockstar
I'm unusual, not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai Chi practicing, snowboard champion
I could fix the flat on your car
Rocking it wherever we are
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I really am a rockstar
'Cause I really am a rockstar
I am a rockstar
Whoa
Yeah
Goodnight, everybody!
