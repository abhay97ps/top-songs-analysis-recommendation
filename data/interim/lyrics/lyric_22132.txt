I know I'm still young
But, I know how I feel
I might not have too much experience
But, I know when love is real
By the way my heart starts pounding
When I look into your eyes
I might look a little silly
Standing with my arms stretched open wide
I love you this big
Eyes have never seen this big
No-one's ever dreamed this big
And I'll spend the rest of my life
Explaining what words cannot describe but, I'll try
I love you this big
I'll love you to the moon and back
I'll love you all the time
Deeper than the ocean
And higher than the pines
Because girl, you do something to me
Deep down in my heart
I know I look a little crazy
Standing with my arms stretched all apart
So much bigger than I ever dreamed my heart ever would
I love you this big
And I'd write your name in stars across the sky
If I could, I would
