Haha, and I was thinkin' of
Ow!
Baby, you don't have to try to read my mind
'Cause you know I wanna get it in 
And tell me why would we just think about it?
If you want it, then I got it 
We can be body to body, body to body 
I don't mean to rush you, girl
But we should be body to body
Body to body, body to body 
Uh, picture your body soakin', bath water
No panties on, come up out them leg warmers 
Wrap up your hair , leave on your heels 
Kissin' you while I whisper, "Shawty, how it feels?"
Let ya mind wonder, oh, you're thinkin' dirty

I dream about it, let's take advantage
My body on your body, hope that you can manage
Gotta moan it, damn it, feels good
Pullin' on her hair to let her know I'm still hood 
Damn right , so unreal

Was that Chanel 5? Very sexy fragrance
Are those your real eyes? Can tell you're partially Asian
But I know your body got me focused, I'm just so sedated
And I guarantee I'll do you better than your past and latest 
Body to body , wet as Dasani 
Bet if I hit your spot that I'll make you tsunami 
Change up the sheets , no time to sleep
Asked her what she's think, then she replied that I'm a beast 
Yeah, she replied that I'm a beast 
Got it locked between the sheets and even in the streets
Baby, you don't have to try to read my mind
'Cause you know I wanna get it in, yeah

Body to body, body to body
We're making love on the floor
You're kissing my tattoos
