I'll just sway...
This's the way it goes down
Def Squad
Nine-pound
Check this here
The E gets wicked, no need for the biscuit
The green-eyed funkdafied brother coming wicked
I sets the party off just like Tanqueray
The Funk Lord, nobody else could swing this way
I put the loc to the motion, drop the funk coast to coast and
I Buck like Shot, cuz I know I Got Cha Opin
Check the soup, I Dogg the mic like Snoop
I get swift like H-Town, when I Knock Da Boots 
I'm dynamite with this mic
I Show like Doug E. and I rock the mic lovely
The afrodesiac, bringin the do-wah-diddy
To your city, on the Zapp side with the vibe
I'm Stone Cold like Bobby and Ralph T
I come with the Game of Death, without Bruce Lee
The irregular speakin, for those MC's who be tweakin
Catch me at the Beacon just freakin
Brothers can't see me
Cuz my style's the bom-digi-bom-uh-dang-a-dang-digi
Brothers can't see me
Cuz my style's the bom-digi-bom-uh-dang-a-dang-digi
(I'll be waiting
For your love, anticipating)
Brothers can't see me
It goes one for the trouble, two for the show, ayo
I'm gettin airplay like The Most Beautiful
I'm the Mack, I made Goldie turn chrome
When I induce my styles upon the microphone 
I goes down for y'all in broad daylight
Weeded, rockin the mic like ta-dow and psych
Today is a Green Day, so it's blazin
To specify it, I get big-up from Jamaicans
Hey, the E-R-I-C-K gets down for the public
More doper than Janet Jackson's stomach
Ask anybody, who's the dopest producer?
I think of cruise, I'm never too much like I'm Luther
My style is the craziest
No crew is fadin us
You got beef with my squad you better dare that
The shit I kick make rappers say, "I should've said that"
Brothers can't see me
Cuz my style's the bom-digi-bom-uh-dang-a-dang-digi

And more flyer than Robin Givens
Cosmic Slop, from the darkside
Basically, I Can't Wait, songs from the Redman tape

And y'all constantly keep listening

Flying through the air with wings E Double doing my thing
