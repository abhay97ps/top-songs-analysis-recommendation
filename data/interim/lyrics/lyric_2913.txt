(You'll aways be the one I love
You'll always be the one I love)
Every hour every day every year
You'll always be the one I love
Through each smile through each sigh through each tear
My heart will feel the same old glow
Even though the stars may fade from above
Well I promise there will be no other arms for me
You'll always be the one I love
(You'll aways be the one I love
You'll always be the one I love)
My heart will feel the same old glow
Even though the stars may fade from above
I promise there will be no other arms for me
You'll always be the one I love
You'll always be the one I love
