Lover of mine gone to a faraway land
Serving your country on some faraway sand
If you should get no name
Remember that your heart belongs to me
I'm sending you a picture
To carry with you all the time
So when you're feeling lonely
It's something to remind you
I'm thinking of you constantly
Remember that your hearts belongs to me, yeah
If a pretty girl should pass you by
I won't mind if you give her the eye
Or even if you give her a smile sometimes
But keep your heart because your heart is mine
Your heart is mine, your heart is mine
Lover of mine, if I could tell you how I yearn
For the day to come when you will return from far across the sea
So remember that your heart belongs to me, yeah
Remember your heart belongs to me
Far across the sea, but your heart it belongs, it belongs to only me
Lover of mine
