Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over, girl
I hear you knock, knock, knock, baby, come on up
I hope you got, got, got something in your cup
'Cause I'm three shots deep, and I ain't tryna sleep
Get your Redbull on 'cause I'm ready
You've been playin' hard to get with me all night
And we both know exactly what you want, right?
Don't tell me what you won't do, tell me what you gon' do
What you gon' do?
Once I throw on this bow chicka wow wow, what you gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave but I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky-down, down, girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'ma make it sound like
I'ma make it sound like
You tryna make me wait, wait, wait 'til the second date
But I can't, can't, can't even contemplate
Waiting one more minute, let me jump in it
I brought you flowers and a teddy
You've been playin' hard to get with me all night
And we both know exactly what you want, right?
Don't tell me what you won't do, tell me what you gon' do
What you gon' do?
Once I throw on this bow chicka wow wow, what you gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave but I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky-down, down, girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'ma make it sound like
I'ma make it sound like
Yeah, I can make it sound like
I got a leather couch, and a black mic
And we all alone, what it sound like?
The night was dead, we found life
I know I talk shit, but it sound right
You say you can't, but that's unfair
Gotta give something, something gotta give
I bet you love it, I win the bet
Now we laying up, hah, cigarettes
Now I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alright, girl, you know you like that
Oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa
Oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh
Say I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alright, girl, you know you like that
Oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa
Oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh
Once I throw on this bow chicka wow wow, what you gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave but I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky-down, down, girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'ma make it sound like
Yeah, I'ma, yeah, I'ma make it
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over, girl
