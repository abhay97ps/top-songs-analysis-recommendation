Oh, oh

Somebody called for the queen?
Oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh, oh
Thugger 
Mmm, ayy
I never killed anybody 
But I got somethin' to do with that body 
I got the streets on my back 
Carry it like I'm movin' a body 
I told them to shoot a hundred rounds 
Like he tryna movie the body 
It was like 11 in the mornin'
Skippin' school, that's a truancy body
I made me some racks in the mornin'
I had me a pack by the mornin'
I had me some racks by the mornin'
I had a six-pack by the mornin'
I got on a mink, no pneumonia
The racks keep me up, don't need Folgers
I had a pack in my shoulder
You gotta picture me rollin'
You gotta picture me rollin'
Pacific ice, I'm an ocean 
Ready for war like I'm Russia 
Latest Chanel for the luggage 
My diamonds they tusslin' 
My neck and my belly on 'Tussin 
They callin' for me and they rushin' 
You wanna be like me and I love it 
Hundred racks on my draws 
Big racks, better calm down 
If you're gon' ride, come around 
Whole squad smokin' out the pound 
Squad goals on these hoes 
Maison Margiela my toes 
Farrakhan glasses for the chosen 
You can go and get mad 
Jumpin' in the Bent' with the too-dark tint
And who's you? 
My shawty pullin' up with a real bad bitch
I wanna fuck you too 
Drippin' my swag, Dubai tags, I'm new
I got a Smith & in the bag now
I get all type of cash, I'm a general, tru 
I never killed anybody 
But I got somethin' to do with that body 
I got the streets on my back 
Carry it like I'm movin' a body 
I told them to shoot a hundred rounds 
Like he tryna movie the body 
It was like 11 in the mornin'
Skippin' school, that's a truancy body
I made me some racks in the mornin'
I had me a pack by the mornin'
I had me some racks by the mornin'
I had a six-pack by the mornin'
I got on a mink, no pneumonia
The racks keep me up, don't need Folgers
I had a pack in my shoulder
You gotta picture me rollin'
You gotta picture me rollin', packin' a semi  colon
Ready for war like Korea, headlining shows out in Poland
You should be cleanin' my mansion, my place is disgustin'
Why don't you act like a Hoffman, and go get to dustin'?
Yeah, latex on my drawers, bitch, go clean my crown
Can't hear my haters from way up here, they don't make a sound
Body goals on these hoes, white paint on my toes
When I send that new bae alert, niggas gon' be mad
Jumpin' in the Bent', then I switched to the Ghost like, "Who's you?"
Remember this face 'cause I'm that bitch you gon' lose to
Drippin' in the ice, fuck you lookin' at? Screw you
It's squad goals when all your bitches pretty like New New
I never killed anybody 
But I got somethin' to do with that body 
I got the streets on my back 
Carry it like I'm movin' a body 
I told them to shoot a hundred rounds 
Like he tryna movie the body 
It was like 11 in the mornin'
Skippin' school, that's a truancy body
I made me some racks in the mornin'
I had me a pack by the mornin'
I had me some racks by the mornin'
I had a six-pack by the mornin'
I got on a mink, no pneumonia
The racks keep me up, don't need Folgers
I had a pack in my shoulder
You gotta picture me rollin'
Jumpin' in the Bent' with the too-dark tint
And who's you? 
My shawty pullin' up with a real bad bitch
I wanna fuck you too 
Drippin' my swag, ooh, pop tag, I'm 
I got a Smith & in the bag now
I get all type of cash, I'm a general, tru
