Ooh Baby please turn yourself around
Ahh baby so I can love you
Ohh baby
I'll make you feel so good
Ohh sugar, just like you want me to
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh honey, I hope you never freeze
I love you, I love you so much
Ohh baby baby, don't ever go away
Ohh stay with me baby, I'll love you night and day
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh now, I just love you that's all
I've got my mind made up baby
There are no doubts 
That you're my foxy lady, foxy lady
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
My lady my baby sure does love to ball
All I know that if we should ever
Ever, ever ever ever part
That one day will surely break my heart
Got to get ready, got to get ready
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
