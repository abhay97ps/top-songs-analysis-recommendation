Oooh, oooh...
Oooh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooooooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
I realized that now our love is past
Tried so hard to make it last
Feelings are far gone, they just seem to fade away
But yet I can hear him say we did try
Tried our best to make it through those times
Let's stop, don't go any further, 'cause I need some time
Darlin', I know you never meant to make me cry.  
I never understood your reasons why
And darlin', I know you never meant to make me cry.  
Those lonely nights without you, I guess it's goodbye
Oooh
I never thought that I could hear you say
How I should go my own way
Tell me can't you see the changes that you put me through
I wonder if you really knew how I tried, 
Tried my best to make it through these times
But you said stop, don't go any further, 'cause I need more time
Oh baby
And darlin', I know you never meant to make me cry.  
I never understood your reasons why
Oh, oh, oh, darlin', I know you never meant to make me cry
Those lonely nights without you, I guess it's goodbye
Goodbye
Ohhh...oh.  
You never meant to make me cry
I never understood your reasons why
Oh, oh, oh, darlin', I...
You never meant to make me cry
Tell me why, tell me why.  Why?
Oh, oh
 Whoo, hoo, yeah
You never meant to make me cry
Don't say goodbye
