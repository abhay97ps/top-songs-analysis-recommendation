Made a promise to my mama that I'll bless her
With some grandkids, she can spoil 'em
Until then, I'm getting dollars, I'm just doing what I gotta
Can a man live? And it's all day, homie

Came a long way from all-state, yeah, now we All-American
 Shit, we All-American, yeah

I could sell snow to a ski slope
I could sell evil to the devil, nonbelievers to a temple
Shit, I could sell water to a speedboat
And these eyes is iconic
I went pro, made profit, now I keep some dead faces in my pocket
Gettin' faded, I been stoned all week 
But what's a God without a little OD? Just a G
Twisting my weed, easing my mind

It won't hold me down no more
Made a promise to my mama that I'll bless her
With some grandkids, she can spoil 'em
Until then, I'm getting dollars, I'm just doing what I gotta
Can a man live? And it's all day, homie

Came a long way from all-state, yeah, now we All-American

Back then they used to call me little
But now I'm ridin' somethin' clean in a coat made of armadillo
They haven't got the memo, I'm sayin' I'm the shit, though
Tryna make it complicated when this shit is simple 
Tell me what you wanna be, what your dreams is 
A hundred G's in my jeans, I'm a genius 
Sin everyday, someone save me please
And get schooled, homie, change degrees 
I'm the plug, what you need though?  I'm goin' beast mode
I keep a freak, even when she underwater she can deep throat 
I made a mill' before I paid a bill 
'Cause fools worried about a wave, I'm a Navy SEAL 
Come with me, I can make your life change for real 
Always had a dream of stuntin', it ain't nothing unless you runnin' shit 
Just a young ma'fucker with a plan 
Thought I was the man
Yeah, back when I first made a hundred grand
