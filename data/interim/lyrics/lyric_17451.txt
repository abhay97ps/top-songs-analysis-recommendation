Oww!
Life was goin' great
Love was gonna have to wait
Was in no hurry
Had no worries
Staying single was the plan
Didn't need a steady man
I had it covered
'Til I discovered
That love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
And I gol' darn gone and done it
Gone and done it 
Guess I fell in love 
Must've been the way he walked 
Or the sweet, sweet talk 
I guess I, gol' darn gone  and done it
I was quite content
Just a-paying my own rent
It was my place
I needed my space
I was free to shop around
In no rush to settle down
I had it covered
'Til I discovered
That love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
I gol' darn gone and done it
Gone and done it 
Guess I fell in love 
Must've been the way he walked 
Or the sweet, sweet talk 
I guess I, gol' darn gone  and done it
Ah, ow
Ooh!
Hmmm, mmmm
Well, love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
And I gol' darn gone and done it
Gone and done it 
Guess I fell in love 
Must've been the way he walked 
Ooh, oooh, or his sweet, sweet talk 
It's in the way he calls my name 
And I know I'll never be the same 
Don't cha know that...
Love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
I gol' darn gone  and done it
Woo
Thought I had it covered, uh-huh
Life was going great
Well, I gol' darn gone and done it
