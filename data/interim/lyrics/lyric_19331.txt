Roll, cheah, cheah

You can catch me in the club with a gangsta girl
When I ride, I'm gonna ride with a gangsta girl
When I smoke, I'm gonna smoke with a gangsta girl
When I freak, I'm gonna freak me a gangsta ...
I'm lookin for them gangsta girls
Not them fake ass +Wanksta+ girls
Just them ghetto fabulous girls, gotta keep 'em in my world
Mama makin gangsta moves, rollin with this gangsta dudes
Sittin on, spinnin 24's, openin my Bentley doors
Drunk at the party, hands up in the air but still she sexy when she shake her body
That type of chick that says "hey girl, let's go to the after party"
After that we go to my room for the after, after party
Y'all know what happens next
Hypnotiq and a rated X, got her singin the greatest sex
Now on dubs, rollin up, into the club, raisin 'em up
Now we in the back, blazin 'em up , dice in hand, shakin 'em up
I need a chick like that to come and share my gangsta world 
And if you in the club with hands up, you be gangsta girl
Oh yeah
I see ya
Oh yeah
Yeah
Ok, mami your so gangsta cause she fuck with nothin but gangsta 
Type a nigga that a stank a gangsta
Drink Hypnotiq and she roll big body
And she got a body, that is gangsta hottie
And she fuck with nothin but gangstas that is old O.G.'s 
24's on that brand new jeep
At a gangsta party, she'll be drinkin Bacardi
And she pops her body, don't you hurt nobody
Got my killers in here, they'll squirt somebody
But that Benz so fast, it'll jerk your body
And we smokin that Cali dro, totin that calico
Bird man and Kelly mami, let your body roll
No one will never know, what happen behind the door
I like it fast or slow, a freaky bitch fo sho
Street life is all I know, hustlin and stackin dough
I file to keep it gangsta, until my casket closed
Once upon a time in this place called hood
Where the gangsta girls shake it and they all smell good
Lived this legendary pimp  by the name of Fresh
Fix hair, fix nails, fix toes, fix breast
But one chick super sick, make every nigga grab his dick
Heart pound up and down, when she goin round and round
Do the +Snake+, stop and shake, ass like an earthquake
I can't wait to meet her uh, undress her, beat her up
Now we leavin from the club, and she let me cop a rub
Can't believe she choose me, +Feelin On Her Booty+
I'm about to cut like knives, strokin mami with some ice
Takin me to paradise, I nut once, she nut twice
Sex in cities, rubbin titties, that's how I get it
One more 'gain, with her friend, playa that's how I hit it
Now we grippin, grabbin, pullin, stabbin 
It's Hypnotiq how I got it, but I'ma glad that you came
Slim Teresa, and Lakeisha 
Tanya, Wanda, and Laneisha 
My fifty Kims all in Tims 
A hundred shorties, all at parties 
Full of drama, baby mama 
When they freakin on the weekend 
But they knowin where they goin 
Fly wheels, pay they bills
