There are 8 million stories in the big city
This is mine
Baby... ohh baby
Once I had a man as sweet as he cloud be
Once I had a man he was so right for me he called me
 ohh, baby
He said baby try to see 
Baby understand 
Baby your for me; won't you take my hand
But I pushed him away 
Wouldn't let him near
Pushed him far away 
Now I'm wishing I could hear him call me  all the time Ooo baby
Lonely through the days, lonely through the nights
Lonely, lonely hours without that guy I held so tight
Lord I pray that you listen to my plea
Help him to forgive so he'll comе back to me and call me...
 all the timе
Baby, baby, baby, baby come home to me
Come on, come on, come on baby
