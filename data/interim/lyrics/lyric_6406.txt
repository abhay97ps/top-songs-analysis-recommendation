No arms can ever hold you
Like these arms of mine
No arms can ever hold you
Like these arms of mine 
No heart can ever love you
Like this heart of mine 
My dreams can all come true
If you care for me
Ah, this feelin' that I feel
Was just meant to be
No lips can ever kiss you
Like these lips of mine 
No one can ever offer
What I offer you
My heart, my arms are yours
Till the end of time
No arms can ever hold you
Like these arms of mine
My heart, my arms are yours
Till the end of time
No arms can ever hold you
Like these arms of mine
