Can you help me out, can you lend me a hand?
It's safe to say that I'm stuck again
Trapped between this life and the light
I just can't figure out, how to make it right
A thousand times before
I've wondered if there's something more, something more
I feel it's going to rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine
With every tomorrow comes another life
I feel it's going to rain, for days and days
I tried to figure out, I can't understand
What it means to be whole again
Trapped between the truth and the consequence
Nothing's real, nothing's making sense
A thousand times before
I've wondered if there's something more, something more
I feel it's going to rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine
I feel it's going to rain like this, rain like this, rain like this
Fall down, wash away my yesterdays
Fall down, so let the rain fall down on me
I feel it's going to rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine
I feel it's going to rain like this, rain like this
So let the rain fall
I feel it's going to rain like this rain like this
So let the rain fall down
I feel it's going to rain like this
I feel it's going to rain
