Up in the morning, out on the job
I work like the devil for my pay
I know that a lucky old sun has nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day
I fuss with my woman. and I toil with my kids
I sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray
I know that lucky old sun has nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day
Dear Lord above, don't you see I'm pining?
I got tears all in my eyes
Why don't You send down that cloud
With the silver lining
Lift me up to paradise
Show me that river, why don't You take me across
And wash all my troubles away
I know that lucky old sun now, he's got nothing to do
But just roll around heaven all day
Dear Lord above, don't you see I'm pining?
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with the silver lining
Lift me up to paradise
Show me that river and take me across
And wash all my troubles away
And I know the lucky old sun now, he's got nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day, yes sir
He's got nothing but roll around heaven all day
I say he just roll around heaven all day
Now you say it 
Yes, Lord
