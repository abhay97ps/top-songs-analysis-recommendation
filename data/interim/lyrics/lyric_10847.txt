No kiddin'
I'm ready to fight
I've been lookin' for my baby all night
If I get her in my sight
Boom boom! RIGHT HERE! Out go the lights!
No kiddin'
I'm ready to go
When I find her boy don't you know
If I get her in my sight
Boom boom! WHAT IS IT? Out go the lights!
I thought I treat my baby fair
I just found out she don't want me here
If I get her in my sight
Boom boom! COME ON! Out go the lights!
- solo -
I never felt this mad before
When I just found out she don't want me no more
If I get her in my sight
Boom boom! COME ON! Out go the lights!
No kiddin'
I'm ready to fight
I've been lookin' for my baby all night
If I get her in my sight
Boom boom! ONE MORE! Out go the lights!
Take it home!!
