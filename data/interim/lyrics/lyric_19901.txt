Mmm
Come on
I don't wanna go another day
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
Seems like everybody's breaking up
And throwing their love away
But I know I got a good thing right here
That's why I say, hey
Nobody gonna love me better 
I'ma stick wit' you forever 
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'ma stick wit' you 
You know how to 'preciate me
I'ma stick wit' you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'ma stick wit' you
I don't wanna go another day
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
See the way we ride in our private lives
Ain't nobody gettin' in between
I want you to know that you're the only one for me 
And I say
Nobody gonna love me better 
I'ma stick wit' you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'ma stick wit' you 
You know how to 'preciate me
I'ma stick wit' you, my baby 
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'ma stick wit' you
And now
Ain't nothin' else I could need 
And now
I'm singing 'cause you're so, so into me
I got you
We'll be makin' love endlessly
I'm with you 
Baby, you're with me 
So don't you worry about
People hangin' around
They ain't bringin' us down
I know you and you know me
And that's all that counts 
So don't you worry about
People hangin' around
They ain't bringin' us down 
I know you and you know me
And that's, that's why I say, hey
Nobody gonna love me better
I'ma stick wit' you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'ma stick wit' you 
You know how to 'preciate me
I'ma stick wit' you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'ma stick wit' you
Nobody gonna love me better
I'ma stick wit' you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'ma stick wit' you
You know how to 'preciate me
I'ma stick wit' you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'ma stick wit' you
