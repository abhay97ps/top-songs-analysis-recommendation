You threw me out the night before last and now you want me back in your
Arms again
You think I'm a fool, you treat me like dirt, you pull the string and
Hope I will be your friend
But I know what's on your mind, and I'd rather be out in the street
Without a dime
And I'd rather Beg, Borrow and Steal, I'd rather Beg Borrow and Steal
I'd rather Beg, Borrow and Steal, than go back to you, go back to you
Than go back to you, go back to you, than go back to you, go back to
You.....
How long 'dja think I'd hang around pretending not to see the tricks you
Pulled on me
There's only so much a man can take before his life turns into a
Tragedy. So I'm gettin' out now while I can, cause I don't want to crawl
I want to walk out like a man....
And I'd rather Beg, Borrow and Steal, I'd rather Beg Borrow and Steal
I'd rather Beg, Borrow and Steal, than go back to you, go back to you
Than go back to you, go back to you, than go back to you, go back to
You.....
I'd rather Beg, Borrow and Steal, I'd rather Beg, Borrow and Steal
