Undecided
Don't know where to go
Don't know what I'm gonna do, oh
Uninvited
I'm knocking at your door
Have I the right to call on you, oh
You don't want me anymore
So let me explain 'cause I don't wanna lose you
You don't want me anymore
I tried so hard, so hard to please you
I remember, baby, on the day you left
You said you'd never understand, no
But I keep thinking if you'd tried real hard
You could give me just one more chance 'cause
You don't want me anymore
Won't you let me explain 'cause I don't wanna lose you
You don't want me anymore
No
I know you're thinking
I'm just no good 
But I won't give up to keep your love
You don't want me anymore
You don't want me anymore
You don't want me anymore
You don't want me anymore
You don't want me anymore
You don't want me anymore
You don't want me anymore
You don't want me anymore
You don't want me anymore
You don't want me anymore
You don't want me anymore
