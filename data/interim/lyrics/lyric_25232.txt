Ooh
No, no, no
No, no
In peace , may you rest 
Never ever shoot below the neck 
You a rookie , I'm a vet 
That's why I got a Glock, you got a TEC 
Not checkers , this chess 
I flooded out my Patek with baguettes
I curve Tiffany , for Jess 
Need to get myself together, I'm a mess 
In Bikini Bottom, I’m with Sandy 
Moesha keep on drinkin' all the brandy 
Keisha eat the molly like it's candy 
Bodyslam a nigga like I'm Randy 
Yeah, I'm a hot hitter 
I'm a guap getter 
Leave a thot bitter 
Get your block hit up
Oh, you think you in a group? Get that shit split up 
Tryna suck me layin' down, I make that bitch sit up 
Yeah, hot box, dirty stick, case closed 
We grill beef, nigga, charcoal 
Sellin' pussy, her vajay-jay got a barcode 
These broke ass niggas need Jobco 
Used to use EBT to get seafood 
Now I Uber Eats when I want Kiku 
She wanna hang out and let the gang G you 
Metro worth a lot of M’s, nigga, me too 
Hangin’ off my earlobes is a rock 
Hangin' off my waistline is a Glock 
The body in that casket was a opp 
I don’t throw no bottles, I throw shots 
All this drip on me, I need a mop 
Balenciaga boxers and the socks 
I got 10 freaky girls on a yacht 
Finna drown in 'em, dawg, finna drown in 'em 
Last altercation, got a hundred rounds in him 
All my spots got a lot of bloodhounds in 'em 
Ain’t no furniture, it's just a lot of pounds in 'em 
Percs, soft, hard, and I got the brown in 'em 
Word to bombaclaat, shotta, we don't ramp in 'em 
Edgewood, Glenwood, Bouldercrest and the Hamp with 'em 
Got a lot of sticks, you can get stamped with 'em 
Tryna mediate the beef, you get found with 'em 
All these chains, rest in peace to Harriet Tubman 
Niggas broke 'cause they doin' too much clubbin' 
Cashed out on all my cars 'cause I'm stubborn 
Zone 6 against the world, that's how I'm comin' 
I came out the womb, I was thuggin' 
Ain't no fistfights, niggas uppin' 
Rappers say they want smoke, but they bluffin' 
When you see 'em face-to-face, it ain't nothin' 
Hangin' off my earlobes is a rock 
Hangin' off my waistline is a Glock 
The body in that casket was a opp 
I don't throw no bottles, I throw shots 
All this drip on me, I need a mop 
Balenciaga boxers and the socks 
I got 10 freaky girls on a yacht 
I got 10 freaky girls on a yacht
You know, I was racin' down the highway earlier today, ridin' down 20
I happened to see a nigga I robbed back in the day
You know what? He was happy to see me
