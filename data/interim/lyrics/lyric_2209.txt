I have a boyfriend
Met him a week ago
He's my forever
Last night he told me so
He's the boy that I adore
Never felt like this before
And I know I'll never let him go
I have a boyfriend
We'll never say goodbye
We made a promise
He'll never make me cry
Every time we kiss goodnight
Feels so good to hold him tight
And I thank the stars up in the sky
 oh-oh, yeah
Yes, we will 
Whoa-oh-oh-oh 
Every time we kiss goodnight
Feels so good to hold him tight
Oh-oh, I'm so glad I have a boyfriend
I have a boyfriend
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I have a boyfriend, yeah, I do
