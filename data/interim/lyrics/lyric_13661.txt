I gave my love, I gave my life, I gave my body and mind
We were inseparable
I guess I gave you all of my time
And now you plead insanity and you don't even know the score
Why can't you learn to play the game?
Baby, don't you know that you need me more? 
You need another lover like you need a hole in your head 
You know there ain't no other
That can do the duty in your bed, yeah
We were brothers and sisters
United all for love
Now all of the sudden 
You try to fight it 
You say you've had enough 
Even though we had big fun 
You want another someone 
Your happily ever after be 
Sure as there's a sun, 
I'm going to be the one and if 
You don't understand face to face 
Baby I'll tell you down on my knee, yeah
You need another lover like you need a hole in your head 
You know there ain't no other
That can do the duty in your bed, yeah
You need another lover
You know there ain't no other
You need another lover like you need a hole in your head
You need another lover like you need a hole, hole, hole, hole, ah
You need another lover
You know there ain't no other
There's going to be a riot, if you don't clap your hands
If you don't make that funky stand, everybody
You know there ain't no other
