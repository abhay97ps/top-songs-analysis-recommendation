If I don't go now, I never will
Lord, I'd be dead if looks could kill
Those slings and arrows thrown my way
Maybe you just made your passion play
With those dirty looks
Love those dirty looks
Get back down to the naked truth
With those dirty looks
Don't you know that it's not nice to stare?
Well, you better watch out, you better beware
Do you really mean what you say with those eyes?
Well, don't look now, but there's trouble inside
Give me those dirty looks
I love those dirty looks
Get right down to the naked truth
With those dirty looks
Well, I don't feel sorry, got no regrets
But that's one look I won't forget
You made me tremble, you made me shake
Oh, you made me do a double take
With those dirty looks
Love those dirty looks
You get right down to the naked truth
With those dirty, dirty looks
Give me those dirty looks
I love those dirty looks
Get right down to the naked truth
With those dirty looks
