It seems the days we spend together all too quickly fade away
And even now my lonely mind is filled with thoughts of yesterday
The say grow up
Put your mind on what you have to do
But I know I can never make it, baby, without you
I can feel a good vibration
When I put my mind on you alone
I get a real sensation
Feel like I'm naturally stoned
Naturally stoned
And now they say it’s time for me to face their troubled world alone
But I know I can never do it while I'm standing on my own
There's just one thing that they do not seem to understand
Why can’t they get it through their heads
I need a helping hand
I can feel a good vibration
When I put my mind on you alone
I get a real sensation
Feel like I'm naturally stoned
Naturally stoned
I can get a good vibration
When I put my mind on you alone
I get a real sensation
Feel like I'm naturally stoned
Naturally stoned
Naturally stoned
