Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy would save our sons and daughters?
Did you know
That your baby boy has come to make you new?
And this child that you delivered
Will soon deliver you?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy would calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know
That your baby boy has walked where angels trod
When you kiss your little baby
You've kissed the face of God?
Oh, Mary, did you know
Mary, did you know
Ooh
Oh, the blind will see
The deaf will hear
And the dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the lamb
Ooh, Mary, did you know
That your baby boy is Lord of all creation?
Mary did you know
That your baby boy would one day rule the nations?
Did you know
That your baby boy is Heaven's perfect lamb
And the sleeping child you're holding
He is the great
The great I Am?
Mary, did you know?
Mary, did you know?
