My love I ran around on you
Yes I broke your heart in two
And I want the world to know I'm sorry 
So if by chance you want to know
If I really love you so
All you have do to is come and ask me
And never mind what they say
Never mind what they do
I'll tell you tra la la la la la
Know that I love you
Tra la la la la la
Know that I love you
Now I hunger for your touch
I never knew you meant so much
I know that I have hurt you and I'm sorry 
So darling take me back again
And our love will never end
Don't listen to the whole world talk about me
Please never mind what they say
Never mind what they do
I'll tell you tra la la la la la
Know that I love you
Tra la la la la la
Know that I love you
