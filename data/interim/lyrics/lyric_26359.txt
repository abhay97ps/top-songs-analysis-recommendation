Hold on, I'ma give it to you
I was just thinkin'
We started talkin' like two years ago, three years ago
Four years ago, somethin' like that, ah 
It's two days 'til our anniversary, somethin' like that, oh 
Uh-huh
Yeah, you know I tried to stop
Yeah, you know I tried
I tried to give you a little less of my time
Startin' to feel like I'm never in my right mind
In my right mind 
Is it the right time, babe? 
See you in the nighttime, babe, it's nighttime
Wish you had feelings like mine, baby
Feels like I'm still just a homie 
Actin' like you don't want me, yeah 
No, shawty just don't do it for me 
You do it for me 
Yeah, say you're done doin' it for me, then say bye 
Say  bye 
Say-say now, girl, say bye 
Say now, say goodbye 
Say goodbye
You know I tried, I really tried
Now you're right back on my mind
I feel the time just  passin' by
Thought this was always forever, so I'm askin'
Why would you lie to me, babe?
No, that ain't right to me, baby
You know I was here to stay
Ain't really got much left to say
Please, say you're done doin' it for me, then say bye
Say  bye 
Say-say now, girl, say bye 
Say now, say goodbye 
Say goodbye 
Overloaded
On all the memories and all the moments, yeah
When I look back to them, it's hard to focus
Oh, I like to imagine the time being frozen 
Oh, don't tell no lies, you wasn't mine, but hit my line up
Why? 'Cause you was tired of somebody 
I won't say his name, I'm simply tryna forget everything
Since you don't remember anything
