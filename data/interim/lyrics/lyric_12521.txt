I rolled out this morning
The kids had the morning news show on
Bryant Gumbel was talking 'bout the fighting in Lebanon
Some Senator was squawking 'bout the bad economy
It's gonna get worse you see
We need a change in policy
There's a local paper rolled up in a rubber band
One more sad stories
One more than I can stand
Just once how I'd like to see the headline say
Not much to print today
Can't find nothing bad to say because
Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town
Nobody OD'd
Nobody burned a single building down
Nobody fired a shot in anger
Nobody had to die in vain
We sure could use a little good news today
I'll come home this evening
I'll bet that the news will be the same
Somebody takes a hostage
Somebody steals a plane
How I wanna hear the anchorman talk about a county fair
And how we cleaned up the air
How everybody learned to care
Whoa, tell me
Nobody was assassinated in the whole Third World today
And in the streets of Ireland
All the children had to do was play
And everybody loves everybody in the good old USA
We sure could use a little good news today
Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town
Nobody OD'd
Nobody burned a single building down
Nobody fired a shot in anger
Nobody had to die in vain
We sure could use a little good news today
