Baby, you the man, 'cause you put it on me
And every morning, I roll over, feel you touching on me
I got another man but he ain't like you
And I can't be your baby mama though I'd like to
C-C-C-C-C-C-Call me real late at night
When my man's asleep and take a red eye
To the Westside, up and down my spine
And let you feel what you've been missing
I'm so bona fide
 Ooh, when you need me
 You don't have to worry
 We can do, we can do 
Call me, call me
 Ooh, when you need me
 You don't have to worry
 We can do, oh 
Baby, take my hand when you're feeling lonely
It don't matter where we're at
Let me put it on you
I got another man but he ain't like you
And I can't be your baby mother though I'd like to
C-C-C-C-C-C-Call me at the break of dawn
I'll be sure to meet you with no panties on
We can slip and slide
We can take a ride
Got some love and reminiscin'
I'm so bona fide
 Oh, when you need me
 You don't have to worry
 We can do 
Call me , oh, when you need me
 You don't have to worry
 We can do 
 Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it 
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it 
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Bounce, bounce

You can call me
Call me
You can call me 
Oh, call me , oh, when you need me
 You don't have to worry
 We can do something 
Oh, call me , oh, when you need me
 You don't have to worry
 Oh
