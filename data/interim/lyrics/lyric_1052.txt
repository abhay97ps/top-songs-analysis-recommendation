Oh, goodbye, cruel world
I'm off to join the circus
Gonna be a broken-hearted clown 
Paint my face with a good-for-nothin' smile
'Cause a mean, fickle woman
Turned my whole world upside-down
Farewell to love 
I'm off to join the circus
Gotta find a way to hide my tears 
Then I'll have them rollin' in the aisle 
And I'll forget that woman
If it takes a hundred years
Oh, step right up 
And take a look at a fool 
He has got a heart 
As stubborn as a mule 
Come on, everybody, he's good for a laugh
And no one could tell his heart is broken in half
Well, the joke's on me 
I'm off to join the circus
Oh, Mr. Barnum, save a place for me 
Shoot me out of a cannon, I don't care 
Let the people point at me and stare 
I'll tell the world that woman 
Wherever she may be 
That mean, fickle woman made a cryin' clown out of me
Shoot me out of a cannon, I don't care 
Let the people point at me and stare 
I'll tell the world that woman 
Wherever she may be 
That mean, fickle woman made a cryin' clown out of me
Goodbye, cruel world
Goodbye, cruel world
Goodbye, cruel world
Goodbye, cruel world
