You make a rose afraid to grow
You make a wind forget to blow
You make the sun up in the sky forget to shine
And you are driving me out of my mind, now
You make a bell forget to ring
You make a bird forget to sing
You make a weeping willow tree forget to cry
And you bring clouds that cover up the sky now
You're a voodoo woman, that's plain to see
You're a voodoo woman, so stay away from me
You make a dog forget to growl
You make the wind forget to howl
And voodoo woman you break every heart you see
So voodoo woman stay away from me now
You're a voodoo woman, that's plain to see
You're a voodoo woman, so stay away from me
You make a dog forget to growl
You make the wind forget to howl
And voodoo woman you break every heart you see
So voodoo woman stay away from me
