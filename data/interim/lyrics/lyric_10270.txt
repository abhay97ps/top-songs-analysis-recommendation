I've wondered all my life
How I could ever let you go
There's not a lot of change in my life
But one thing that I know
If ever I see you again
Maybe this time it'll work out alright
Maybe this time we won't say goodbye but only goodnight
With a love that won't end
If ever I see you again
Warm sleepy morning waking up next to you
Feeling you close by my side
Nothing on earth has ever felt better
Then the feelings I've felt deep inside
Sometimes it seems that I never lost you
And that you're not really gone
'Cause I had this dream
This wonderful dream
It just goes on and on
If ever I see you again
Maybe this time it'll work out alright
Maybe this time we won't say goodbye but only goodnight
With a love that won't end
If ever I see you again
