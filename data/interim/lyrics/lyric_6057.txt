Don't you do it
Girl, don't don't you do it
Please don't you do it
Don't, don't you do it
Girl ,don't you do it
Oh, don't break my heart
Baby, baby, don't break my heart
Oh, ou don't have to tell me you've gone to found someone new
'Cause I can feel his presence, girl, whenever I'm kissing you
How can you ask me to try, try and understand
Well, just put yourself in my place
Go on, see if you can
I'm begging you no, oh don't you let him  
I'm begging you no, don't you let him 
Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me
So what if he whispers how much he loves you in your ear
But pay no mind 'cause I love you much more my dear
My love can move  mountains
That's how strong it is for you
If you ever walk away in to his arms
Which will surely break my heart in two
I'm begging you no, oh don't you let him  Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me
I'm begging you no, don't you let him 
Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me
Don't break my heart 
Woo, don't break my heart 
If you leave me for him you would truly be unfair
Just ask yourself, whenever you needed me, wasn't I always there
Now, I'm begging you, begging you, down on bended knees
Women, women torn apart please stay here with me
I'm begging you no, oh don't you let him  Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me
Hey don't you do it, please don't you do it
Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me
Don't leave me stranded, I couldn't stand it, please
Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me
Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me
