Summer's gone and no songbirds are singing
Because you're gone, gone from my arms
Gone from my lips, but you're still in my heart
What to do?
Oh, I'm left here just crying
Over you
Oh, I'm so blue
What can I do now that you're gone?
The days, they prolong now that you're gone
My nights, they leave me blue 
I don't know why there are tears in my eyes
Can it be that I'm still in love with you?
Summer's gone and no songbirds are singing
Because you're gone, gone from my arms 
Gone from my lips  but still in my heart
Summer's gone and no songbirds are singing
Because you're gone, gone from my arms
Gone from my lips but still in my heart
