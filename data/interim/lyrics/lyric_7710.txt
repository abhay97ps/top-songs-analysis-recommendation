If we were older
We wouldn't have to be worried tonight
Baby oh, I wanna be with you, so bad
Oh, darlin'
Oh yeah
Well tonight's the night
We always knew it would feel so right
So come on baby, I just wanna be with you
Someday's a long time
And we've been waiting so long to be here
Hold me tight
Our love could live forever after tonight
If you believe that what we're doing is right
Close your eyes and be still
