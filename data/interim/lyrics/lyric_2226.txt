Pain in my heart
She's treating me cold
Where can my baby be?
Lord, no one knows
Pain in my heart just won't let me sleep
Where can my baby be?
Lord, where can she be?
Another day has began to get tough
Said I want you to come back, come back
Come back, baby, 'til I had enough, oh
A little pain in my heart just won't let me be
Wake up at restless nights
Lord, and I can't even sleep
Mhm, yeah
Stop this little pain in my heart
Another day has began to get rough
Said I want you to love me, love me
Love me, baby, 'til I get enough, oh
Pain in my heart
A little pain in my heart
Stop this little pain in my heart
Stop this little pain in my heart
Someone stop this pain
Someone stop this pain, oh
