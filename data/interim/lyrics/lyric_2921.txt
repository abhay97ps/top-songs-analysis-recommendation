No arms can ever hold you like these arms of mine
No heart can ever love you like this heart of mine
My dreams could all come true if you'll care for me
This love that I feel for you was just meant to be
No lips can ever kiss you like these lips of mine
No heart can ever love you like this heart of mine
My heart, my love are yours 'til the end of time
No arms will ever hold you like these arms of mine
No arms will ever hold you like these arms of mine
