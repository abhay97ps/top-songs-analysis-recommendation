He's a Canadian Crip y'all, hate him or love him
I figured with that reputation you wouldn't make it through customs
I never knew there was a Grape Street in Ottawa
Shouldn't you be gang banging or something? Aiming and dumping
A lot of battlers say that you're fronting but I get it bro
This geeky image you display is nothing but a front
To keep your gangsta self away from the public
I overheard a few ladies discussing how they here to see they Canadian husband
Right?
Shit, I thought they was speaking about Pat Stay...but they wasn't
They said your skinny muscleless frame is irresistible
Though most women say it's disgusting
These chicks, can't wait til you touch them
They're praying you fuck them
How do you do it bro? Is it good conversation?
Quick advances when you get the chances? Wait...you into dancing?
Screw it, let's not play stupid, he isn't handsome
He's awkward as hell plus his wardrobe works to his disadvantage
Cause, everything you own says Virgin, you Richard Branson
Just glancing, I can tell you a virgin, it's in the way that you stand
When Bonnie went for your privates I bet you came in your pants
For three rounds, you told us how her pussy stunk on some skunk shit
How she's a slut bitch, that jumped ship to suck dick
But it's funny the minute she had your cunt gripped you loved it
She tried to dick check and grabbed you by the pussy on some Trump shit
Now last year I seen some chump shit
He had his eye on  but another battler bagged her
Let her feel a peen  all night long
Boy you were so distraught, that next day that young boy put an end to ya , did this guy wrong
Either he didn't care for his career or he into  losing cause he ain't even tie Juan 
Let bygones be bygones
Or you gon' be dropping tears/tiers for being too dramatic
Even if Math said he was mean, all it would mean is dude is average
I set a light  on top to Dish out pain when I'm shooting ratchets
Yeah, ten'll  Clear things up
Get the picture? That's what I use for static
But it ain't all about suits and caskets, generally I'd slide across your hood to prove these Dukes are Hazard
You 'bout to lose a classic, and get your mic jacked 
It's like moonwalking cause your feet  got you moving backwards
Yeah I had a da feet/defeat bar!
I had to see what it was hitting for, I got the winning score
You think not? You misinformed, you gotta listen more
Niggas is getting Dumb & Dumber if they can't see how I'm whipping dawg
This undercover cop, lying/lion on his shield like Gryffindor
Now is you spitting or dancing?
My question is, what you be doing with your hands?
Are you seizing while you're scheming?
Are you moving in a trance?
Are you trying to do The Robot?
A flying judo chop?
Maybe you practicing both
Maybe you sleepwalking while dreaming you're air traffic control
But you are not a Crip
You're a door to door energy salesman in Ottawa
Stop acting like you're from the hoodest spots
But you being a Crip, maybe that's something I shouldn't mock
Clearly he is good with Watts
So if Charron tells y'all that he lit my whole block up...believe him
I mean he's not fronting
I just wouldn't expect to see cops coming from Glocks dumping
It's cause he had a good week, shit my whole street bump from him
How could I 
My bad, you should start your round, "Hi Dad. I'm a fly lad."
So many checks on me I'm a walking Nike ad
Tell your crew, if I put hands on a square it's not an iPad
Whoever feel a way about shit that Chilla say
Throw your dukes up when you slide past
And I be waiting, trying to hit a gang of chins like I'm waring with the Triads
I'm in my bag
So get in yours and hold it down like me
Cause you ain't never stood in front of three rounds like these
Boss Town!
Y'all heard him bring up *Dumb & Dumber* right?
I'm going against a known veteran
It's like when that dude ate a burger with the dudes from *Dumb & Dumber*
Cause you gon' die when I give you a taste of your own medicine
Who y'all gon' ride with?
If there's Coke I'll pop cans for cream so da-don't you try this
Got a lil' ahead of yourself, thinking he's the fliest
I've seen better delivery from women with the Zika Virus
He'll be like, "My first opponent was Cee Major
I'm looking at you but I don't see major
I graduated marine biology, I'm a sea major"
Well here's another homophone that seem major
At the airport, he called me a "retard" yesterday
But I have the best drive way, it was re-tarred yesterday
That's every bar you spit, they think it's the hardest shit
All you do is repeat the same thing like girlfriends in an argument
You don't buy her a 100 bullets, you inspire a 100 Bulletz
So if I Snicker he'll pull Butterfinger and wigs will be split
I'll put a bounty on your head if you don't quit that scheme shit
Stop using Google to make a list of things hit
I ain't usually the one to bar  out, but I'll settle the Score since he missed a big  hint
Bars
Now I'm giving him schemes
Little did he know I had a couple Twix up my sleeve
Cause if you do associative wordplay I'll shoot you sixty times
While you list your rhymes I'll bring a clip this wide
And reload after every bar like Bamalam when he's spitting grime
 just died, coffin; sit inside
Hands across his chest; British pride
Having the best pen is what you symbolize
You're not the king, those are Simba lies
Your girl wet, when it's head first like a Slip N Slide
Nothing but gangs on that couch like it's Simpson's time
You're from Boston, but they're asleep while you're spitting
Rhymes
Your city bombs marathons, you should make the crowd explode when you finish lines
Yo yo when you finish lines....
Y'all think that I'm choking? I ain't trying to think of rhymes
The reason I froze up in this time is cause they haven't seen a Chilla  body since Walt Disney died
Writing's your only strength, you'll need charisma to cook me
For claiming your pen-a-trait  I'm going in on this pussy
Your schemes? Make me wanna start stabbing stuff
Serial/cereal killer, leave your roof cut like Capt'n Crunch
You're not believable, that's why you ain't on Smack too much
You're such a bitch you'll probably get hit by a Raptor punch
Doing two on twos? You rap too much
With Danja Zone, you just had a Big L with Kane, that's Platinum Plus
You know Danger Zone, Big L, Big Daddy Kane, Platinum Plus
Bonnie's best material; that was nuts
You claim you have a 100 K's and make your cannon bust
I put up a 100K to call a Cannon's bluff
I hate people who write their rounds like you
They say I pray on the URL, that's downright true
So I may have battled dudes who sound like you
But I made a name for myself off of killing clowns like you
Smack Killer
You call yourself The Smack Killer, but K-Shine was smacking on you
Arsonal smashed your Crip flag then started swagging on you
Clips ain't even care to write a round, he was slacking on you
DNA had a day's notice son was blacking on you
Suge damn near ripped your pockets off when he was tapping on you
Magic's rounds were half as long as yours and he was blacking on you
Cortez broke you the fuck down, he was cracking on you
John John....okay, you beat John John
But alas, now I gotta show bro a L
Somebody should've told Charron this won't go so well
This fo'fo' could blow send his whole mo' to Hell
Put CC in a box, that's Coco Chanel
Got a boat load of shells from the piece be flying
Catch him running, air with the mask like I'm deep sea diving
My guy's pull  and let it sing, I bet you he be crying
Cause you could even fire a BB and see C whining
Keep hyping, see they don't put Chilla Jones versus CC, see me?
I'm a PG and I be G, believe me this is easy, do him breezy, greasy, get the win now
Who could beat me, defeat me?
Now, who could y'all CC, stock gonna drop on the spot
GZ stomp on your block in a drop
Beat me blocking your shot as you Top
ZZ you just wanna be P to the M
Kick a windshield you feeling breezy spit 'em still
Get him a pound you feeling greasy son I'm still
Get him a pill and D.E. , I be gripping for real!
See this is why my pen king
And  cause I even get punch drunk without drinking in pubs
I'm good with angles, rebuttals I think of is nuts
Plus I'm dirty with grime rounds like a ring in the tub
He's a scrub
Listen, I thought y'all would be stoked, to see me on the card if I was catching wreck with Ars'
But he was bright enough to duck
Which leads to you getting pressed and stabbed with something extra sharp
I left the blood bath once he got his liver pulled  out, but I left his heart
Then drew the steel from ringing his bell fast 
But to let it bang or not I had second thoughts
Til I caught him dipping, started wigging
Hit his windshield, leaving glass go everywhere
All I left is shards, hit him and his chick
Saw shots exit her dome and tear her man chest apart 
He's just a mark
So how dare he talk like his hands are scary
But instead I took the shot and now I got a can to bury 
Y'all bland and heavy
Cause battle rap ain't a career...it's a transition to a new life
Look at Con', Hitman and Clips, I'm trying to help you not to lose sight
I had a promo code, *Charron sucks*, 30% off
My website traffic and views spiked
Don't you understand?
Do I have to show Corey a graph  to help him move right?
It's all about steps Charron or be a stepping stone
Bredren I could rock you, mid round and drop you
That's actually no question, but think I'm promo
Shit...Don't Flop and us would probably go viral
Another million views added to Jones' legend
And I'll be blowing up off of battery charge like a Galaxy Note 7
Don't test me
You might've battled dudes who sound like me...
...but you never stood in front of three rounds like these
Boss Town!
When Chilla raps, he claims he needs police at events
I'm like "Wow, he must bore people to death"
You know WoW, World Of Warcraft, kill boars, I can scheme with the best
He did a scheme about the UK, y'all like that? There's a reason I guess
Ain't Boston in New England? So I knew England would be what leads  to his death
See I wanted Soul or a Brit like Tony
Eur' didn't even say your name which was something I predicted homie
He just sent me three Z's and a smiling shit emoji
Cause you're too boring, like I don't know what to do boring
Like, open up the fridge to see if there's new food boring
Don't take offense, when sheep can't sleep they count your schemes jumping over a fence
That's the perfect example
When Bill Cosby runs out of pills he just puts on your battle
You lost dawg, they should post a post to kill him coast to coast from here to Nova Scotia
You won't Everlast, you get Slaine in Boston La Coka Nostra
Bull doze ya til ya fade away
Last time we seen Jones with a snake he was Agent K
You Smack rappers only shooting at laser tag
I'll leave these faggots all over the streets like a gay parade
Last year Westwood, this year Guinness, we ain't the same
EA Sports, every year I change the game
You do one thing and it ain't that great
When I pull out the pen  I hit every angle like a frag grenade
You need performance in a crazy way
Entertainment is something Chill laxing like a lazy day
Even I could whoop your ass, you rap too nerdy
I don't care how you feel  Jones on his back like a Man-U jersey
Bring up the slack, there's no way that you hurt me
Your career's just a pure L  I don't think your hands too dirty
Cause commotion, we both came across the ocean for you to get crucified, that's cross promotion
It's going down like  moves
Nah, it's going down like Don't Flop's views
See the bodies I've stacked, I don't think someone could climb it
I'll put nine below, after this win Chill  it'll fuck with the climate
When I kill your favorite rapper everybody is quiet
I guess we when you live by the sword they keep your W's silent
King Pen, you don't strike me as the king type
You get your schemes from Google, you ain't "King Pen" you're "King Type"
Against JC you did car parts, now I'll flip the scheme for you
Mind you wrote all of this while using Wikipedia
Shine was someone I oughta body  cause trannies are his main attraction
Spoiler alert, he loses  if he couldn't copy and paste his tactics
Your girl I'll muffle her  once her hub caps she'll change your status
After this win she'll  say "Retire  you shouldn't get recognition  with the same mechanics
He's like, "I'm King Pen, my utensil's the worst weapon."
Your writing's just a Googling nerd session
Make sense you scheme 'bout car parts, your career is just one big search engine
That's all that Chilla do, right now I'm killing you
Shove him in the freezer, look at me when I'm chilling you
All you do is scheme, you're in need of a new sound
Bonnie did the dick check, so I'm used to my opponents reaching for two rounds
Ball game
You said Pat Stay threatened to stab you if you brought Hollohan on stage
My question is, how you snitch on him right then and there?
I mean, if that was me I wouldn't care if he had the knife with him there
I mean we talking about the chain
Plus you passed up on an extra thousand cause you was frightened and scared
Couldn't be me y'all, cause for a rack no foe be a  threat in spite of  my fears
You was frightened for years, so how the fuck did you back down?
Let Arsonal push you around like, "Put that blue flag down!"
Let Suge push you around like you a douche bag clown
To let 'Ganik push you around like, "You can't use that round."
You a clown, see I got the crown
So you can go ahead and try to call me wack
But I'm the King Pen, Charron, it's time to show him why they call me that
See I can rap, so I suggest you warn him, this a lesson for him
This pathetic, boring, nerd/ foreman
Boy I'm back in my bag, shit I knew when I was prepping for him
I'd outrap him so bad y'all gon' have to sell  for him
Now who thinks Charron got a weapon on him?
He got at NWX with a fake arm, nigga had a prosthetic on him
I got two straps, and I'll use both arms get ambidextrous on him
Make your friends hide cause everything I pops red like Erik Foreman
Check the Lord when I catch ya whoring
Use Professor X's telekinetic force to dissect the organs
Poindexter meets Dexter Morgan
This is Drexler, next to Jordan's best performance
You gon use the block to create lines and make points like Tetris scoring
So diss Writer's Bloque all want, try to play our crew
Til you get smacked with the K and have deja vu
Matter of fact, you had a line in that last round, that was...alright
Something about "silent W and sword"
See here's where you learn the rebuttals I bring harder
Cause you talking about swords and I'm the King Pen
When we in England and you up against a King Arthur
But anyway, you told Shine, "hands up don't shoot"
But you say, " guns up shoot back"
Gangsta
So you really be popping the hammer?
Acting brolic on the block trying to rock a bandanna
When Shine smacked you, really all I thought of was Panda
Cause one hit had you looking like broad in Atlanta
So see how I design a  setup? Maybe you caught it on camera
Like an episode of Frasier I got him watching the Grammar
But, that's the difference between us
You don't have a lot of replay value
And I don't mean to be insincere but that's exactly why I was sent here
So I hope I'm making sense here and since air from the vents ain't helping us with your sents here
Liam gon' have to spray Febrese and light some incense here
He sold his sold to the devil, committed sins here, who think it'll work
Well, so many "nahs"  I think are sincere
But we in England, right?
It's only right I keep a pound there's no cents here
Every bullet I send sear and get any Eurgh sends here
That wack shit you had in store tonight?
I haven't seen any years like...since Sears
And you didn't know that this ass whipping was coming?
Maybe Eurgh should've sent seers
Now a "seer" is like a future teller or a psychic, but I guess you were more affordable
But, booking you in this medium was a gip, see  my aura cools  that's the difference between us
And that's why you losing now, against Mr. Jump To Top Tier From The Proving Ground
Boss Town!
Yo, you hear his slogan when he said, "they call me the King Pen", I thought that was wack
Well they call me The Flip God, so let me show you why they call me that
Cause real talk, I know this guy is a faggot
You had a line about that 70's Show, that's how they trying to take it
I'll run into this guy's house, this guy's getting fragrant
I ain't Erik Foreman that's only right I make him hide in the basement
You know how I know you're the worst?
You did a whole round on how Tony's a nurse
Genius, I can't think of a verse that was greater
I can't wait til you battle Big T and call him a personal trainer
That was the worst third round that happened that weekend
And Rob Wilson versus Innuendo happened that weekend
A fake angle ain't what we're trying to hear
Smack hasn't booked this guy in a year
Too bad Tony wasn't a nurse, that way he could've revived your career
Y'all  I can't condone
Now you have to answer to this machine, you couldn't handle Tones
I ain't trying to battle Jones, I'm trying to practice Jones
I can afford to show him the ropes I'll Indiana Jones
You know a Ford, Harrison Ford? You like how I flip it Jones?
There's a gap between us, it'll take more than a Diary for you to bridge it  Jones
Say I'm special ed', I brought a stupid crew
I don't fight dawg, but my brother's Scrappy like Scooby Doo
Plus your girl's a slag, I'll send the news to you
I can fit my hand on that bird like the butler from Scary Movie 2
Who are you? I don't know why they brought you here
Eurgh offered me Math, I said "I don't want people that are bottom tier."
Cause Math is the type of rapper that's coming for a check
Being old and washed up don't mean that you're someone that's a vet
You're out punching rappers cause you're hungry at events?
Well I'm outpunching rappers cause i'm hungry for respect
"Boston" backwards "stegasaurus" that's something I regret
But for King Pen I'll make sure every one of mine connect
Now I'm fixing my mistakes, so to summarize it best
I had to take a look at my old writtens to change the future like The Butterfly Effect
So I could do writtens or kick a free for a second
I could Shine off the top without a Slim Jesus impression
Bring up the slack, I don't need the attention
I got a plan for your chin Chilla  like a PETA convention
Whether it's Smack rappers or backpackers, I leave an impression
I can adapt to any body like Mystique from the X-Men
You ain't gangster, that is something we are addressing
You're not a G, P.S. you need some direction
You don't spark the Ruger, you sound as dark as Cruger
You make Martha Stewart look like Martin Luther
You're not intimidating, and you brought up Donald Trump?
You barely leave your house
You sound like such a pussy that Donald Trump grabs you by the mouth
So I'll hit 'em first, then it's "give me your biggest shot"
Gender neutral, I'll let you decide if you're a bitch or not
Your girl's a thot, that ho's insane
Zombie kill shot, I just go for brains
Brought her to an ally, I don't even know her name
Fill her up with three fingers then toss her at the King Pen/pin like a bowling game
That was too gutter
And you're the bar favorite?
They all underestimate me til they start taking
Clips, Suge, Ars', the way I did 'em was heart breaking
I kill more people that slept on me than SARS blankets
Plus, your girl, she sucks a lot of dick
She's been all over the map
She went to the Fresh Coast, I heard she blew Caustic and Frak
She went to Toronto and she hopped on my sack
She's given more head to stars than the top of your hat
See you should actually take off the hat, I know you may hate it
But he won't take off his hat cause his hairline goes farther back than Craig David
See, we're in this venue, we were supposed to be in the other venue be I'm in rage
We're suppose to be in Stylus, but his style is not meant for the big stage
See, you may have battled dudes that sound like me
But you've never stood in front of freestyles like these
Who the boss now?
