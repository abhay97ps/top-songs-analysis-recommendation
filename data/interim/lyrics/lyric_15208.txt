I'm on the way up
Look out
Ow!
Babe
Oh, babe
People tell me
I can't have everything
But still I wanna have it all
They say I cannot succeed in life
That I'll get so far
And then I'll fall
I don't need no negative outlook
I don't need nobody putting me down
Don't they know that talk is useless?
Nothing's gonna keep my feet on the ground
Because I'm on the way up
I've got it all together
Nothing's gonna hold me back
Yeah, I'm on the way up
I'm only getting better
Now tell me what you think about that
Look out
If and when you make it
All kinds of people come around
Some of them in your corner
Some of them put you down
But one thing they all agree on
Is that you are gonna change
When all along
They're the only ones
Who never ever remain the same
Now tell me which one of us changed?
Only fools dont take chances
If you wanna be on top
You gotta work every single moment
Cause another's after your spot
All the suckers scream and shout
They don't know what it's all about
This is my world
And I'm sorry
This table is reserved
Oh
Oh, yeah
People think I can't have everything
But I'm gonna get it all
I'm on the way up
Nothing's gonna make me fall
No, no, no
Now what you think about that?
Tell me what you think about that?
Uh-huh
Thought so
