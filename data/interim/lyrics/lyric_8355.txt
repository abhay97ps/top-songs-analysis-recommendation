You came when I was happy
In your sunshine
I grew to love you more
Each passing day
Before too long
I built my world around you
And I prayed you'd love enough of me
To stay
If you love me let me know
If you don't then let me go
 I can't take another minute
Of a day without you in it
If you love me let it be
If you don't then set me free
Take the chains away
That keep me loving you
The arms that open wide
To hold me closer
The hands that run their fingers
Through my hair
The smile that says "hello
It's good to see you"
Anytime I turn around
To find you there
It's this and so much more
That make me love you
What else can I do
To make you see
You know you have whatever's mine
To give you
But a love affair for one
Can never be
If you love me let me know
If you don't then let me go
I can't take another minute
Of a day without you in it
If you love me let it be
If you don't then set me free
Take the chains away
That keep me loving you
Ah, take the chains away
That keep me loving you
