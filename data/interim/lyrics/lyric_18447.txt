Posters of love surrounding me, lost in a world of fantasy
Every night she comes to me and gives me all the love I need
Now this hot girl, she's not your average girl
She's a morpharotic dream from a magazine
And she's so fine designed to blow your mind
She's a dominatrix supermodel beauty queen
I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child
Just a little touch of Madonna's wild style
With Janet Jackson's smile, rolled in a body like Jennifer
You got the star of my liquid dreams
Angelina Jolie's lips to kiss in the dark
Underneath Cindy C's beauty mark
When it comes to the test well Tyra's the best
And Salma Hayek brings the rest
Now this hot girl, she's not your average girl
She's a morpharotic dream from a magazine
And she's so fine designed to blow your mind
She's a dominatrix supermodel beauty queen
I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child
Just a little touch of Madonna's wild style
With Janet Jackson's smile, rolled in a body like Jennifer
You got the star of my liquid dreams
Looks ain't everything she's got the sweetest personality
Like Halle B
My mama thinks I'm lazy, my friends all think I'm crazy
But in my mind, I leave the world, oh
Liquid Dreams, my Liquid Dreams
Waterfalls and streams, these liquid dreams
I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child
Just a little touch of Madonna's wild style
With Janet Jackson's smile, rolled in a body like Jennifer
You got the star of my liquid dreams
My liquid dreams
My liquid dreams
My liquid dreams
