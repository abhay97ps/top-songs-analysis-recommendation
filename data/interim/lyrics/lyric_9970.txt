La-lala-la-la, la-lala-la
La-lala-la-la, la-lala-la
La-lala-la-la, la-lala-la
La-lala-la-la, la-lala-la
For you, there might a brighter star
But through my eyes the light of you, is all I see
For you, there might be another song
But all my heart can hear is your melody
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one, who would break my heart in two
For you, love might bring a toast of wine
But which each sparkle know the best for you I pray
For you, love might be for you to find
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one, who would break my heart in two
For you, there might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you, it's all I see
For you, there might be another song
But in my heart your melody will stay with me
