Spring's in the air
There's magic everywhere
When you're young and in love
The moon at night
Seems to shine twice as bright
When you're young and in love
Each night seems just like the Fourth Of July
When stars spangle in the sky
Dreams can come true
If you believe they do
When you're young and in love
Trust and you'll find
There's no mountain you can't climb
When you're young and in love
Though many teardrops are bound to fall
True love an conquer all
When you're, when you're young and in love
Young and in love
Though many teardrops are bound to fall
True love an conquer all
When you're, when you're young and in love
Young and in love
Young and in love
Young and in love
Young and in love
