I don't know why
I love you like I do
I don't know why
I just do
I don't know why
You thrill me like you do
I don't know why
You just do
You never seem to want my romancing
The only time you hold me is when we're dancing
I don't know why
I love you like I do
I don't know why
I just do
La da da da...
You never seem to want my romancing
The only time you hold me is when we're dancing
I don't know why
I love you like I do
I don't know why
I just do
I don't know why
I just do
