Know it sounds funny, but I just can't stand the pain
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me, girl, you know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole, and I borrowed, yeah
Ooh, that's why I'm easy 
I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah 
That's why I'm easy 
I'm easy like Sunday morning
I wanna be high, so high
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
I wanna be free, just me, oh baby
Ugh
Oh, ooh, that's why I'm easy 
I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah 
That's why I'm easy, yeah 
I'm easy like Sunday morning
