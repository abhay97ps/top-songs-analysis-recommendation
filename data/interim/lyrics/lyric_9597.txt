Every night I sit here by my window
Staring at the lonely avenue
Watching lovers holding hands and laughing
And thinking 'bout the things we used to do
Chorus:
Like a walk in the park
 like a kiss in the dark
 like a sailboat ride
What about the night we cried
Things like a lovers vow, things that we don't do now
Thinking 'bout the things we used to do
Memories are all I have to cling to
And heartaches are the friends I'm talking to
When I'm not thinking of
Just how much I love you
Well, I'm thinking bout the
Things we used to do
Chorus:
Like a walk in the park
 like a kiss in the dark
 like a sailboat ride
What about the night we cried
Things like a lovers vow, things that we don't do now
Thinking bout the things we used to do
Still can hear the jukebox softly playing
And the face I see it still belongs to you
Now there's not a single sound
There's nobody else around
Well, it's just me thinking 'bout
The things we used to do
Chorus:
Like a walk in the park
 like a kiss in the dark
 like a sailboat ride
What about the night we cried
Things like a lovers vow, things that we don't do now
Thinking bout the things we used to do
And heartaches are the friends I'm talking to
Got me thinking 'bout the things we used to do
Staring at the lonely avenue
