Oh, the boardwalk's deserted
There's nobody down by the shore
And the Ferris wheel ride
Isn't turning around anymore
The heat wave and the crowds are just old news
But I've still got some sand in my shoes
Brings memories of the salty air
Oh, the blanket that we used to share
How we fell in love down by the sea
Comes back to me 
With the sand in my shoes
Oh, when the water was cold
You would tremble and hold me so tight
And we'd sit on the beach
Just to wait for the stars to come out at night
The heat wave and crowds are just old news
But I've still got some sand in my shoes
Oh, brings memories of the salty air
Oh, the blanket that we used to share
How we fell in love down by the sea
Comes back to me 
With the sand in my shoes
 Whoa
 Whoa-la-la-la-la-oh
 Whoa-oh
