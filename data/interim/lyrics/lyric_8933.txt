I never seen such a beautiful day
Looked like everything is coming my way
Feel like a bird just leaving a cage
Looks like my luck is
Getting ready to change
Sure feels good feeling good again
Sure feels good feeling good
Feels good again
The sun just came out
From behind a cloud
Now I feel like shouting out loud
Hallelujah, let the sun shine in
 I'm feeling alright again
Sure feels good feeling good again
Sure feels good feeling good
Feels good again
I wore out nine pairs of shoes
Walking this old floor
Never sang nothing but the blues
Now I'm singing me a brand new song
Standing in a new pair of shoes
Sure feels good feeling good again
Sure feels good feeling good
Feels good again
Good ain't the word for it
Good, it's good, good, good
