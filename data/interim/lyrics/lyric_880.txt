Rainbow, Rainbow
Rainbow, wishin on a rainbow
Wishin for her lovin, that I never seem to find
Rainbow
Dreaming of her kisses
Soft and tender kisses
That will never be mine
Her soft lips, the touch of her hands in mine
Her fingertips put me in paradise
Rainbow
Wishing on a rainbow
Hoping that she'll love me
Just the way that I love her
Her soft hair, the look in her misty eyes
Her face so fair, puts me in paradise
Rainbow, wishin' on a rainbow
Hoping that she'll love me
Just the way that I love her
Rainbow, rainbow
