The other night I was
Walking down the street
I was getting kinda hungry
I decided to get me something to eat
Now I passed up all the chain
Franchise joints on Hamburger Row
And stopped at a little greasy spoon place
I always eat at called Eat, Sit and Gulp
Get you one of the greasy hamburgers
All peppered up, lay you up in the
Hospital for ten days
So I ordered me up a
Couple of those grease bombs
Waitress brought 'em over
Lifted up the bun, checked 'em out
Damn, no ketchup
So I nudged the guy sitting next to me
At the counter, I said, "Hey, partner
How about passing the ketchup over?"
Suddenly, this little bitty green hand
Holding a ketchup bottle came into view
And I freaked cause the guy sitting
Next to me... was a Martian!!
Now in twenty-eight years of eating hamburgers
I ain't never run into no Martian
Not at 2:30 in the morning and certainly
Not at a fine scarfing establishment like Eat
Well, he was sitting over there with a
Bunch of colored sticks on his plate
And I looked over at him and I said
"What you eating there, boy, crayons?"
He said, "Why no!
They're Martian cigarettes!
Here, try one!"
Well, 'bout half hour later
He looked over at me and smiled
Them ol' Martians ain't got
But two teeth in their head
And he said, "How do you feel?"
And I said, "Weeeeeeell, I feel so good
Yeah, I do, gonna boogie
Wow! Til the break of day!"
Meanwhile, back at Eat's
I was stiiiiiiiiiiiiiiill thinking, I said
"How come out of all the places
You could have landed
You ended up here?"
He said, "Well, according
To my lunar space map
This town here is supposed to be
The boogie capital of the U.S.A!"
So I asked him, I said
"Now, where else you been, boy?"
And he told me
He said, "I've rocked 'em over
And I've rocked 'em down
Rocked 'em in the country
I've rocked 'em in town
Rock 'n' roll, Memphis on up to Maine
Woke up a lady and she asked my name!
Told her the name was on ten of my shirts
Told her, rocking chair Martian
Don't have to work!"
Yeah, I feel so good
Yeah, yeah, gonna boogie
Martian boogie
