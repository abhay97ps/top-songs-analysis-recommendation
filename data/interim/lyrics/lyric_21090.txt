Have you ever had someone who loved you?
Never leave your side

Yes, you do
I'm givin' all my life and all my love
If you promise that you'll be here forever
I'll give you all of me, I'll give you everything
If you promise you'll never leave me
What my friends say don't matter
You've been right here from the start
And I'll get on my knees, I'll give you all of me
You'll never leave my side
Because

You complete me 
You hold my heart in your hands 
And it's okay 
'Cause I trust that 
You'll be the best man that you can
Baby, you love me, yeah
Oh, yes you do, yeah
And no matter what they ever say about you
I'm gonna stay by your side
Promise me no matter what they say about me
That you're gonna be here until the end of time
'Cause you held me down when nobody was around
And gave me all the love I need
So give me more, don't you ever leave
