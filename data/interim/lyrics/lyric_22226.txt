You're so delicious
You're so soft
Sweet on the tip of my tongue
You taste like sunlight
And strawberry bubble gum
You bite my lip
You spike my blood
You make my heart beat faster
Own me, you own
You rattle my bones
You turn me over and over
Till I can't control myself
Make me a liar
One big disaster
You make my heart beat faster
It's the way you swell, slow
Pushing right out your seams
It's the way you smile, baby
When you've got me on my knees
You're all night noise
You're siren's howl
You make my heart beat faster
Own me, you own
You rattle my bones
You turn me over and over
Till I can't control myself
Make me a liar
One big disaster
'Cause you make my heart beat faster
'Cause I jump back, I crash, I crawl
I beg, I steal, I follow you
Yeah, you own me
And you make my heart beat faster
Faster, faster
I can't get enough
Because it's gone
Like, I guess this world is over to me
You own me, you own
And rattle my bones
You turn me over and over
Till I can't control myself
Make me a liar, yeah
One big disaster
'Cause you make my heart beat faster
You own me, you own
And rattle my bones
You turn me over and over
Till I can't control myself
Make me a liar
'Cause you make my heart beat faster
You make my heart beat faster, yeah
