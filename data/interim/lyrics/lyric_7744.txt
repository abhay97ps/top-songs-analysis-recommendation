Your love is so precious and rarely found
I realize that there are few with your love around
Oh, I see many guys
Taking advantage of you, love
They misuse your kindness
As a weakness too
No longer can I stand back
And watch your life fill with pain
I've seen it too many times
Tryin' to smile and keep the tears restrained, baby
I can't stand to see you cry
I love you too much, that's why
'Cause your love is so precious and rarely found
I realize that there are few with your love around
Ohhhh...
Oh, I'll share the blame
For the hurt you have been through
I hate myself for silent lips
That held words that could've been your cure
So now I'd like to step right in
Please, invest your love in me
And my reward for your faith
Will the be joy in your eyes, I see
'Cause baby
I can't stand to see you cry
I love you too much, that's why
'Cause your love is so precious and rarely found
I realize that there are few with your love around
Ohhhh...
Ohhhh, now, now, now, now, now, now, now
I'm gonna be bold
A love for life that's true, baby
'Cause that's how serious
I am in wanting you
So place your love and trust
In these hands of mine
And I'm gonna  our hearts as one
And together happiness we'll find
'Cause baby
I can't stand to see you cry
I love you too much, that's why
'Cause your love is so precious and rarely found
I realize that there are few with your love around
I can't stand to see you cry
I love you too much, that's why
'Cause your love is so precious and rarely found
I realize that there are few with your love around
I can't...
I can't...
I can't stand to see you cry
I love you too much, that's why
Your love is so precious and rarely found
