Swingin' this dance now to hit the scene
It's got the latest groove and it's really clean
Haven't you heard about the bird?
Don't you know that the bird's the word?
Come on, jump here and get on your knees
And get to flappin' your wings in the west or the east
Haven't you heard about the bird?
Don't you know that the bird's the word?
Bird, bird, bird, bird, bird
Well, they're dancin' this bird in the east and the west
Make this dance and you'll look the best
Haven't you heard about the bird?
Don't you know that the bird's the word?
