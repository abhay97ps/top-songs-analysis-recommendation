It's no secret, it's no secret
It's no secret, it's no secret
When I first met you
How you changed my life that day
But when each tomorrow
You just seem to drift away
Then I discovered
That you were cheating
You were cheating on me
But I was the last to know
Our love was a lie and it's no secret 
It's no secret how you hurt me inside
And it's no secret because you told everybody
Didn't I really love you?
You know I gave you all my heart
When I put my arms around you
I never thought we'd ever part
Then I discovered
I guess you couldn't love me
Like you said you love me, oh, no
Why was I the last to know?
Our love was a lie and it's no secret 
It's no secret how you hurt me inside
And it's no secret because you told everybody
All of my life I was looking for someone just like you
You shattered my dreams, tore me apart
What can I do?
But I was the last to know
Our love was a lie and it's no secret 
It's no secret how you hurt me inside
And it's no secret because you told everybody
Our love was a lie and it's no secret 
It's no secret how you hurt me inside
And it's no secret because you told everybody
Our love was a lie and it's no secret 
It's no secret how you hurt me inside
And it's no secret because you told everybody
