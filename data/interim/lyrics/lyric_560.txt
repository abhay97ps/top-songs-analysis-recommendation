You are the only one
My one and only one
Together we've had a lot of fun
But what'll I do if you leave me?
If someone else should come along
And take your love from me
Darlin', you could never know
How lonely I would be
You are the only one
My one and only one
Together we've had a lot of fun
But what'll I do if you leave me?
I tried to be the kinda guy
You'd wanna call your own
So please don't go and throw away
The truest love you've known
You are the only one
My one and only one
Together we've had a lot of fun
But what'll I do if you leave me?
What'll I do if you ever take your love from me?
'cause in your arms is where I always wanna be
If you should ever go away
My eyes would fill with tears
And the heartaches I would feel
Would last a thousand years
You are the only one
My one and only one
Together we've had a lot of fun
But what'll I do if you leave me?
What'll I do if you leave me?
What'll I do if you leave me?
What'll I do if you leave me?
What'll I do if you leave me?
