Se la
You know sometimes I sit and wonder
Just how this world would be
If we had all the people laughing
And everybody living in harmony
We'd have to say se la, se la
Talking to the people se la, se la
It's time or about it se la, sela
There would be no more living in desperation
And no more hatred and deceit
Tell me, can you imagine
All the children playing
And everyone dancing in the street
We say se la, se la
Talking to yourself se la, se la
Talking to everybody, yeah se la, se la
You know what it's all about
You play it for the people
Yeah, for the people
It's time for everyone
To come together
I know it's hard
But this dream must come to be
Because tonight should be
One big celebration
I'm talking to you now
Only we can make things right
We say se la, se la, se la, se la baby
I'm counting on everybody se la, se la
I know all about it se la, se la
Sela, sela
