It's your money maker
It's what mummy gave you
Money maker
Pretty girl, shake your money maker
That's a big bum your mummy gave you
Me, I'm getting paper money, money paper
So I'm busy right now but I'll be coming later
It's your money maker, money maker, money maker, money maker
You're waking up on fleek and you don't come in makeup
Yo, I'm liking the way you shake your money maker
Got me feeling like I'll go and make some money later
And I was rated before I was nominated for any Rated Awards
One thousand and eight is the weight of the raw
2008, we started breaking the law
I'm in the hotel, make a grown girl go and wait by the door 
He said he's getting money but that's more lies
'Cause his watch cost the price of my .45
Bottles with the crew, this is more life
The bottom of my shoe, is on Saw V 
What you telling me, though?
What's the word on the streets? What you telling me, bro?
Yo, she's giving me the saliva from the end of her throat
And my youngin got life so that's the end of the road
I'm hitting block sales while she's drinking cocktails
In London, most the hot girls know my cock well, but I will not tell
'Cause that's none of their business
They might've done somethin', but no, none of them did this
Pretty girl, shake your money maker
That's a big bum your mummy gave you
Me, I'm getting paper money, money paper
So I'm busy right now but I'll be coming later
It's your money maker, money maker, money maker, money maker
You're waking up on fleek and you don't come in makeup
Yo, I'm liking the way you shake your money maker
Got me feeling like I'll go and make some money later
Pretty girl, your money maker, it's a troublemaker
I should go and thank your mummy, 'cause your mummy made you
Niggas still didn't give me nothing back, no fucking favours
Now I blow a hundred racks 'cause I'm a money maker
Fendi for my under layer, but it's nothing major
She's a nutty brain, I'm moving like the Undertaker
Niggas at home watching Netflix and Power
My niggas in the traphouse tryna stretch it with powder
Talking less than an hour
Got my jewels on, lookin' like I dressed in the shower
'Cause I'm wet like a fountain
And I'm filled up with colours
I'm looking in my DM and it's filled up with lovers
I'm looking in my bank account, it's filled up with numbers
Bicarbonate sodas, what's filling up the cupboards
'Cause I'm a money maker
But you niggas out here looking like the money made you
Every time they play with us, you know that something taped up 
Pretty girl, shake your money maker
That's a big bum your mummy gave you
Me, I'm getting paper money, money paper
So I'm busy right now but I'll be coming later
It's your money maker, money maker, money maker, money maker
You're waking up on fleek and you don't come in makeup
Yo, I'm liking the way you shake your money maker
Got me feeling like I'll go and make some money later
