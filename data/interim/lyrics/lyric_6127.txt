What a day
Everything's going my way
What a day
Everything's going my way, yeah
What a day
Everything's going my way
I got me a lovely girl
And she's okay, oh
What a day
Let me tell you
It was out of sight
It's gonna be a wonderful day
I had a wonderful night, oh, yeah
Ain't no use
Sitting around with the blues
You better enjoy yourself
And one thing else
Don't let life get the best of you
What a day, what a day
What a day, what a day
I wanna sing my song
If you wanna get in the groove
You gotta sing along
Oh, yeah, sing a song
One more time now
Say it again
....
What a day
What a day, what a day

Let me tell you it's outta sight
It's gonna be a wonderful day
I had a wonderful night
Oh, yeah 
What a day....
