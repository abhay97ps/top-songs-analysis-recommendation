Hey! Stand up! RUTHLESS PEOPLE!
Hey! Stand up! RUTHLESS PEOPLE! Real and evil!
They love the smell of the killing, the flesh
Gorging 'til they've had their fill of success
Dealing their mother to get into paradise
Pay Jesus special protection, and ain't it wise?!
Hey! Stand up! RUTHLESS PEOPLE!
So deceitful! I wanna tell you'
Hey!  Stand up'Get on your feet!
RUTHLESS PEOPLE! Real and evil! What I say'
Greedy forever and ever, success
Greedy and ever so clever, a mess
Given the right on to creep into paradise
They'll even blackmail St. Peter then pay the price!
Hey! Stand up'Get on your feet!
RUTHLESS PEOPLE! Greed and evil! Oh yes!
You can have it if you want it
It might take the rest of your life
If you want it you can have it
To a balancing act on a knife
You can have it if you want it
If you think it's cheap at the price
If you want it you can have it
But sweat your sweet soul out of lives!
RUTHLESS PEOPLE!
RUTHLESS PEOPLE!
RUTHLESS PEOPLE!
RUTHLESS PEOPLE!
You better watch your back now!
Hey!
RUTHLESS PEOPLE!
Ruthless, ruthless, ruthless, RUTHLESS PEOPLE!
Hey! Stand up!
