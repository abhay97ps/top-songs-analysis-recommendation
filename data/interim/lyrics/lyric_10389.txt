Here I sit all alone
Thinking about what I should have known
You made me think that I could need you
You weaved your magic spell and I believed you
Looking back on you and me
Promises that will never be
I truly thought that we were lovers
But now I find I'm just like all the others
Heartbreaker, wish I'd seen, but love is blind
Sweet little love maker, taking my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker, couldn't you be just a little more kind to me?
Played with fire, felt its burn
I would have thought that I would have learned
I melted every time you kissed me
Each time you would leave, I thought that you would miss me
Heartbreaker, wish that I'd seen, but love is blind
Sweet little love maker, taking my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker, couldn't you be just a little more kind to me?
Heartbreaker, wish I'd seen, but love is blind
Sweet little love maker, taking my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker, couldn't you be just a little more kind to me?
Heartbreaker, wish I'd seen, but love is blind
Sweet little love maker, taking my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker, couldn't you be just a little more kind to me?
