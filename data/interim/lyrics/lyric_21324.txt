Kingston, hey, face drop, oh
Kingston, I see your face drop, drop, drop
You touch my heart, disappear
I never knew how much it hurt here
My girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
First came trust, then came love
But this was none of the above, I'm aware
My girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, hey
Weren't you the one who said
That I'd be lost without you
You had your fun, couldn't write
This one without you, baby
And now I see your face drop
I told you not to leave me alone
And now that I got my own
I see your face drop
I told you not to count me out, hey
Cause you always try to fill me with doubt
Sayin' that I look better if I was thinner
Don't you know you shoulda love me for my inner
When I left you, yo, I came out a winner
Did all I can, I understand
That every girl do for their man
My girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
I cut it short, cause you got caught
You're not the girl you used to be no more
My girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
Weren't you the one who said
That I'd be lost without you
You had your fun, couldn't write
This one without you, baby
And now I see your face drop
I told you not to leave me alone
And now that I got my own
I see your face drop
I told you not to count me out
Cause you always try to fill me with doubt
Sayin' that I look better if I was thinner
Don't you know you shoulda love me for my inner
When I left you, yo, I came out a winner oh oh oh oh
Tellin' me come on back, what will I do from that?
I would still, still be yours if you knew how to act
But you underestimate a dude like me
And I love it when I see your
Face drop, I told you not to leave me alone
And now that I got my own
I see your face drop
I told you not to count me out
Cause you always try to fill me with doubt
Sayin' that I look better if I was thinner
Don't you know you shoulda love me for my inner
When I left you, yo, I came out a winner
And now I see your face drop
I told you not to leave me alone
And now that I got my own
I see your face drop
I told you not to count me out
Cause you always try to fill me with doubt
Sayin' that I look better if I was thinner
Don't you know you shoulda love me for my inner
When I left you, yo, I came out a winner
