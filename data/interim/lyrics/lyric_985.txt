Impossible They say it's impossible
That someone sweet as you
Could ever be really in love with me
And make all my wishes come true
But then you came
Setting my heart aflame
And showed me so many ways
Its possible
Anything's possible
When love is leading the way
But love is a gift from a heaven above
Warm, gentleâ€š and kind
You bless my heart with your heavenly love
The moment you said you were mine
It's not impossible
Cause you're so lovable
It's heaven the way that I feel
So wonderful
It's incredible
Your love made the impossible real
Your love made the impossible real
