I was hanging with some friends of mine
We were out having a real good time, yeah
I saw a girl who was so very fine
I started waving my hands, my arms, my head
Got the nerve; found the words to say, yeah
But to my surprise, she was passing
I mean, it was strange 'cause she just walked away
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me
Now you're nervous with the fever
Body heat to never quit
I'm in heaven when I see her
Hope she talks a little bit, a little bit
You can't sit there all night, no honey, all by yourself
 And nobody else, yeah
I just wanna tell her
She's the girl of my fantasy
How we meet in my dreams every night it seems
And how love can be, I wanna 
I'm gonna be 
It's not everyday you see the one
That your heart's been nightly dreaming of
There's that look in her eyes, so I don't know why
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me
She pretends she doesn't see me
Leaves me standing in the rain
'Cause I know she wants to meet me 
She's just playing silly games
Wanna show you a love that you just, you gotta see
 But she won't talk to me
And ooh, I'm telling everyone
I'm not dreaming anymore
'Cause I know she won't talk to me now
And at least she can't say no
And I'm going crazy, yeah
Trying to make her notice me
I go up, I get down, I turn all around
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me
I said 
I said 
But she won't talk to me
She won't talk to me
I said 
I said 
But she won't talk to me
She won't talk to me
She won't talk to me
She won't talk to me
And then I tried 
And then I said 
I said 
She won't talk to me, talk to me
