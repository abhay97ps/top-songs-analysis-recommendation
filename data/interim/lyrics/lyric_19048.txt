She's unusually unusual!
She introduced herself as Amy, said call me Caroline for short
She said, I just moved in three doors down
So I wouldn't be the girl next door
And I knew the shoes she wasn't wearing fit her just right
And she said "Hey, man did you know that somebody
Left your grass out in the yard all last night?"
She's unusually unusual
Absolutely unpredictable, yes she is
She's so different and that's what's wonderful, oh yeah
She's unusually unusual
And that's beautiful to me
She had a tattoo above her ankle of a trident submarine
She said it symbolizes awesome powers hidden deep within our dreams
And her diamond eyes, different in color, held me captive in their light
And she said "Hey, man did you know we used to be brothers
Yeah in some past life?"
She's unusually unusual
Absolutely unpredictable, yes she is
She's so different and that's what's wonderful, oh yeah
She's unusually unusual
And that's beautiful to me
Some people may thinks she's strange
A different cup of tea
But she just does it for me
She's unusually unusual
Absolutely unpredictable, yes she is
She's so different, and that's what's wonderful, oh yeah
She's unusually unusual
And that's beautiful to me
Oh, thats good enough for me
Yes she is
She unusually unusual
And thats beautiful to me
Yeah, unusual
