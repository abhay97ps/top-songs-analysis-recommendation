I ain't nothin' like these hoes 
Don't compare me to no one 
Money green like CeeLo 
Yeah, my pocket so swole up
Man, I ain't nothing like these hoes 
Don't compare me to no one 
Money green like CeeLo
Yeah, my pocket so swole up
Look, these hoes be fake flossin'
Fake ass jewelry, got a neck rash 
These hoes be fake ballin'
Tax money that shit won't last 
These hoes be dick-riding, think they gone come up 'cause they let you fuck 
These hoes be full of drama, they always with the extra 
These hoes, they wake up, they beggin'
On the Gram, they be fake flexin' 
These hoes, they wake up, they broke 
They mattresses be on the floor 
These hoes, they wake up, they messy
They runnin' they mouth, they so petty
These hoes, they feed off attention 
Zero time, that's what I give 'em
I ain't nothin' like these hoes 
Don't compare me to no one 
Money green like CeeLo 
Yeah, my pocket so swole up
Man, I ain't nothing like these hoes 
Don't compare me to no one 
Money green like CeeLo
Yeah, my pocket so swole up
Look these hoes be lackin', see me in the back
They talk all this shit but don't say it in person
Won't catch me off guard on no boulevard
Foreign my car, and my driver, my guard
Water, water drippin', come take a peek
You in a trailer hoe, bitch you can't compete
I'm riding solo don't need no one but me
Run up a check, yeah we runnin' the streets 
Red cup? No it ain't Kool-aid
Got me fed up, you hoes too fake 
One minute he your man, he your ride or die 
Next minute on the Gram with a new bae 
These hoes, these hoes, shame on these hoes 
I'm in the Maybach, I heard you got repoed
Hair done, diamonds on, need a pea coat 
Heard the feds listening, gotta speak low
I ain't nothin' like these hoes 
Don't compare me to no one 
Money green like CeeLo 
Yeah, my pocket so swole up
Man, I ain't nothing like these hoes 
Don't compare me to no one 
Money green like CeeLo
Yeah, my pocket so swole up
Look
