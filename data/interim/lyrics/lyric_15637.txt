I get my kicks from watching people
Running too and fro
And if you ask them where they're going
Half of the don't know
They're the ones who think I'm crazy
But they don't realize
Chorus
That I'm just groovin, groovin
Grooving out on life
I'm just groovin ooh groovin
Groovin till I die
I see a river flowing by me
Heading for the sea
I get a feeling deep inside me
It's so good to be free
I've got sunshine in the daytime
And moonlight every night
And I'm just groovin ...... Etc
I see a river flowing by me
Heading for the sea
I get a feeling deep inside me
It's so good to be free
I've got sunshine in the daytime
And moonlight every night
And I'm just groovin ...... Etc
Chorus
That I'm just groovin, groovin
Grooving out on life
I'm just groovin and I can't stop movinG...
Groovin till I die...
