I wish I knew what you were thinkin'
Sometimes with you it's hard to tell
You lay beside me without speakin'
Words are hard to find, better left behind
You pull me close as if to answer
The question runnin' through my head
If words could say it any better:
Does it feel good?
Do you feel like stayin' all night with me?
Does it feel good? 
Do you feel like stayin' all night with me?
Does it feel good?
If it feels right, stay all night
We'll wake up early in the mornin'
Or never go to sleep at all
So happy just to be together
Does it feel good?
Do you feel like stayin' all night with me?
Does it feel good? 
Do you feel like stayin' all night with me?
If it feels good, if it feels right, stay all night
It's a long night, there'll be time for playin'
Never felt so right just to hear you sayin'
That it's all right, and you feel like stayin' all night with me
Does it feel good? 
Do you feel like stayin' all night with me?
Does it feel good, does it feel right?
Why don't you stay all night with me?
Does it feel good? 
Do you feel like stayin' all night with me?
Does it feel good, does it feel right?
Why don't you stay all night with me?
Does it feel good? 
Do you feel like stayin' all night with me?
Does it feel...
