My love is drifting in a sweet dream
And my heart is beatin' like a drum
And my words don't make a sound
And I'm dancin' but my feet ain't on the ground
Chorus:
I am flyin', forever within your arms
Oh I'm flyin', forever within your heart, I am flyin'
I didn't mean to stay all night, oh no, but baby you hold so tight
I didn't mean to turn you loose, oh no, but baby you won't refuse
I didn't mean to turn you on, oh no, it's heaven it can't be wrong
I didn't mean to stay all night
My thoughts are runnin' in a race
And my mind is slippin' into space
Cause your world is all around
So I'm dancing but my feet ain't on the ground
I am flyin', forever within your arms
Oh I'm flyin', forever within your heart, I am flyin'
I didn't mean to stay all night, oh no, but baby you hold so tight
I didn't mean to turn you loose, oh no, but baby you won't refuse
I didn't mean to turn you on, oh no, it's heaven it can't be wrong
I am flyin', forever within your arms
Oh I'm flyin', forever within your heart
I didn't mean - I didn't mean to make you stay, oh but baby you got your way
I didn't mean - I didn't mean to fool around, but baby you held me down
I didn't mean to stay all night
I didn't mean - I didn't mean to make you stay - oh no
I didn't mean to let you get your way
I didn't mean - I didn't mean to fool around - oh no
I didn't mean to let you hold me down
I didn't mean - to turn you on baby - oh no
To make you fall in love, I didn't mean
I didn't mean - to turn you loose honey - oh no
But you just can't refuse, and I didn't mean
I didn't mean - to stay all night, oh no, but you won't let go
I didn't mean - I didn't mean to make you stay - oh no
I didn't mean to let you get your way
I didn't mean - I didn't mean to fool around - oh no...
