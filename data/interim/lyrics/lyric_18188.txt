CMR bitch. G -Code nigga, G-code nigga, G-code nigga
I ain't no pussy ass nigga 
I'm a rapper but I'm still a gorilla 
I'll whip ya like the Thrilla Manila 
You gon' make me have to kill me a nigga 
I'm a be here for a minute lil wodie 
Ain't bout to let nobody fuck over me 
I don't need ya playa hatin' on Juvey 
Don't be talkin' about what you gon' do with me 
I'll ride every day of the week 
Ya get ya issue when ya playin' with me 
I'll crawl at the spot that ya sleep 
Get with my niggas from the block and we creep 
Load it up cock it back and get ready 
Make sure you be holdin' it steady 
We gon' go in there and blow the bitch up

With choppers, doin' surgery on bodies like they doctors

I know when to get my ass outta Dodge 
Look them people ridin' I'm gonna hide 
I'm a wait until them bitches slow down 
'Cause I ain't tryin' to be jail bound 
It ain't over till the fat man fall 
I'm just waitin' on the right phone call 
You know them hoes gon' let me know where they at 
Nigga got me I'ma go get em back 
One by one they all gonna drop 
Right here is where the foolishness stop 
I'm tryin' to get the bullshit over 
'Cause I wanna go and chill in the 'Nolia 
We need to get some more ammunition 
'Cause somebody's bout to come up missin' 
Now everybody hop in the truck 
And when ya see one of them bitches ya bust 
Shhhh, be quiet
Tonight is the night that we ride
30 camouflage Hummers with niggas inside
With choppers, doin' surgery on bodies like they doctors
Shhhh, be quiet
Tonight is the night that we ride
30 camouflage Hummers with niggas inside

Fuck jumpin' out I'm a slang me some iron 
When I catch them niggas all of 'em dyin' 
Nigga listen up to what we gon' do 
I'm about to give the game to you 
That's the reason why I came to you 
'Cause playin' ain't the thang to do 
It ain't that hard I did it before 
You just gon' make sure let nobody know 
I'll bet ya them boys wanna rep 
They tryin' to get the shit off they chest 
It ain't over lil daddy be cool 
Nigga tired of the nigga we through 
You know you better stay pretty cool 
We bout to go and punish this fool 
Hop out the car and let that iron ring 
That's the end of this stupid ass thing 
Shhhh, be quiet

30 camouflage Hummers with niggas inside
With choppers, doin' surgery on bodies like they doctors
