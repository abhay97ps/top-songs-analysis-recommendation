Loser, loser
It's so hard being a loser
Always trying to find a way
To overcome this heartache inside
And find happiness someday
Listen to me
Look upon this empty face
And you'll see a lonely man
So all alone, so far from home
Reaching out for happiness
Only finding emptiness
Someone please, won't you help me?
It's so hard being a loser
Always trying to find a way
To overcome this heartache inside
And find happiness someday
I walk in silent solitude
Shattered dream never came true
Many night I cried, unsatisfied
A dark cloud's hanging over me
My life leads to nowhere
No peaceful times I've known were mine
It's so hard, yes, it is, being a loser
Always trying to find a way 
To overcome this heartache inside
And find happiness someday
I don't wanna be a loser, oh, no
Need a touch of tenderness
Lead me out of this wilderness
Please help me find
Some peace of mind
Endlessly, I wander on
Looking for hope to build upon
Oh, someone see, I'm so alone
It's so hard being a loser
Always trying to find a way
To overcome this heartache inside
And find happiness someday
It's so hard being a loser
Always trying to find a way
