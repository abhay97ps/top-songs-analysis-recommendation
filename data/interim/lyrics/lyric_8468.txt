You know, I can't get no more
Girl, you know you won't give me no more
Listen to me
Lord, have mercy!
You know that I lost that
But you don't see me
Packin' up my clothes
It's better to have and don't need
Yes, better
Whoa, when you ain't got nobody
You know
Yes, sho'
Girl, you caused me so much
Well, listen
Havin' nobody, mama
You better know it, yeah
Friends stopped by my house
But they don't know
It ain't gon' be no, yeah haha
It's better to have and don't need
Than need and don't have
It's better to have and don't need
Yea-hey-hey
Ooh!
Boogie!
My-my-my-my, clouds so dark
Have lost their silver linin'
But don't throw away
Your umbrella, ya'all
Oh, Lord!
I remember when your love, baby used to
But I like the lyrics to your song
But I just can't feel
Oh!
(It's better to have and don't need
It's better 
Take-a a chance!
No mo'
Ya'all
It's better, oh-oh
(It's better to ha-ha-ha-haave
