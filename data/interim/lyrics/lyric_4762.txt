Just sitting here
Alone and downhearted
I should be out somewhere tonight
Having a party
I don't know why I sit and cry
My eyes out for you, boy
I should go out and have some fun
Forget about you, boy
Are you never comin' home?
Come on home
If you're ever comin' home
And if you want me
You gotta come home and get me
But if you don't want me
Send a card sayin' "Forget me"
I don't know why I keep hangin' on
Waitin' for you, boy
But here I sit, a crazy fool
Waitin' for you, boy
Are you never comin' home?
Won't you come on home
If you're ever comin' home?
I never knew what made you tick
You left me so quick, boy
So hop a train, grab a plane
Come home and explain, boy
Are you never comin' home?
Bring it on home
If you're ever comin' home
