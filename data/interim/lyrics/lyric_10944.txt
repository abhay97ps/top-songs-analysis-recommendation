I'd rather leave while I'm in love
While I still believe the meaning of the word
I'll keep my dreams and just pretend
That you and I are never gonna end
Too many times I've seen
The rose die on the vine
Somebody's heart gets broken
Usually it's mine
I don't want to take the chance
Of being hurt again
You and I can't say goodbye
So if you wake and find me gone
Oh baby carry on
You see I need my fantasy
I still believe it's best to leave while I'm in love
Too many times I've seen
The rose die on the vine
Somebody's heart gets broken
Usually it's mine
I don't want to take the chance
Of being hurt again
You and I can't say goodbye
So if you wake and find me gone
Oh baby carry on
You see I need my fantasy
I still believe it's best to leave while I'm in love
I still believe it's best to leave while I'm in love
