If you don't take me to Paris
On a lover's getaway
It's all right
It's all right
If I'd rather wear your T-shirt
Than a sexy negligee
It's all right
It's all right
Every dinner doesn't have to be candlelit
It's kinda nice to know that it doesn't have to be
Perfect
Baby every little piece
Of the puzzle doesn't always fit
Perfectly
Love can be rough around the edges
Tattered at the seams
But honey if it's good enough for you
It's good enough for me
If your mother doesn't like
The way I treat her baby boy
It's all right
It's all right
If in every wedding picture
My daddy looks annoyed
It's all right
It's all right
Don't you know that fairy tales tell a lie
Real love and real life doesn't have to be
Perfect
Baby every little piece
Of the puzzle doesn't always fit
Perfectly
Love can be rough around the edges
Tattered at the seams
But honey if it's good enough for you
It's good enough for me
You don't mind if I show up late for everything
And when you lose your cool It's kinda cute to me
Ain't it nice to know that we don't have to be
Perfect
Baby every little piece
Of the puzzle doesn't always fit
Perfectly
Love can be rough around the edges
Tattered at the seams
But honey if it's good enough for you
It's good enough for me
It's good enough for me
Yeah good enough for me
Good enough for me
