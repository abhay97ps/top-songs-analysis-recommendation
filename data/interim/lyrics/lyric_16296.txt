Suntanned, windblown
Honeymooners at last alone
Feelin' far above par
Oh, how lucky we are
While I give to you and you give to me
True love, true love
So on and on, it will always be
True love, true love
For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothin' to do
But to give to you as you give to me
Love, forever true
Love, forever true
For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothin' to do
But to give to you as you give to me
Love, forever true
Love, forever true
Give me your true love, oh yeah
True love,  true love
Got to give me your true love
Oh yeah, oh yeah
True love,  true love 
For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothin' to do
But to give to you as you give to me
Love, forever true
Love, forever true
Love, forever true love
