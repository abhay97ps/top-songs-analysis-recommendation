Wind and fire and falling rain
I'll be coming through
There ain't nothing gonna keep me from you, my love
Nothing gonna keep me from you, my love, I'll find you
Anyplace where you may hide
I'll be by your side
There ain't nothing gonna keep me from you, my love
Nothing gonna keep me from you, my love, I'll find you
I admit it, I'm really a dreamer
And I'm reaching for a star too high up there for hanging on
And, baby, I believe in "for all time"
And the miracle of your love and mine
It's a lonely feeling when the meaning's gone
I confess, I don't wanna let you go
And I'm burning for the love
That you don't show me anymore
And all of the dreams that we whispered about
They went into my heart and they never came out
And a love like this can die if we don't let it grow
Wind and fire and falling rain
I'll be coming through
There ain't nothing gonna keep me from you, my love
Nothing gonna keep me from you, my love, I'll find you
Anyplace where you may hide
I'll be by your side
There ain't nothing gonna keep me from you, my love
Nothing gonna keep me from you, my love, I'll find you
Heaven and Earth I will move for you, darlin'
Whatever it takes to be where you are
With a stronger love, let me flow through you, baby
You ain't got the power for breaking my heart
And forever you'll be my paradise
And I'm reaching for a dream when you don't even want me to
And, baby, I believe you need me there
For the miracle of the love we share
And tomorrow I will still be following you
Wind and fire and falling rain
I'll be coming through
There ain't nothing gonna keep me from you, my love
Nothing gonna keep me from you, my love, I'll find you
Anyplace where you may hide
I'll be by your side
There ain't nothing gonna keep me from you, my love
Nothing gonna keep me from you, my love, I'll find you
Heaven and Earth I will move for you, darlin'
Whatever it takes to be where you are
With a stronger love, let me flow through you, baby
You ain't got the power for breaking my heart
Ain't got the power for breaking my heart
Wind and fire and falling rain
I'll be coming through
There ain't nothing gonna keep me from you, my love
Nothing gonna keep me from you, my love, I'll find you
Anyplace where you may hide
I'll be by your side
There ain't nothing gonna keep me from you, my love
Nothing gonna keep me from you, my love, I'll find you
Wind and fire and falling rain
I'll be coming through
There ain't nothing gonna keep me from you, my love
