Where did we go wrong
Where did we lose our faith
My brother is in need
But can he depend on me
Do you think if one of you tried
Maybe you could find
A better friend than any other
If you gave more than you took
Life could be so good
Come on and try
Now's the time
'Cause you're free
To do what you want to do
You've got to live your life
Do what you want to do
Do what you want
Do what you want to do
Are we all strangers
Does anyone really care
Deep down were all the same
Trying to hide our pain
You think you can never trust another
Cause they're all out to get ya
We have to live in this world together
If we open up our hearts
Love can finally start
Come on and try
Now's the time
'Cause you're free
To do what you want to do
You've got to live your life
Do what you want to do
When you're down and you're
Feeling bad
Everybody has left you sad
Feels like no one will pull you through
Its your life what'cha gonna do
Make that change lets start today
Get outta bed get on your way
Don't be scared your dreams right there
You want it reach for it
'Cause you're free
To do what you want to do
You've got to live your life
Do what you want to do
Do what you want
Do what you want to do
