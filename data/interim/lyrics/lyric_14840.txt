Well you're all grown up and lookin' good
Been painting your face like a geisha would
Been practising the art of treachery
Little girls learn this at their mothers' knee
Sugar Daddy gonna me you happy
Sugar Daddy gonna make it nice
Sugar Daddy gonna give you candy
But you gonna pay Sugar Daddy's price
Well I know what you want and you know how to get it
Nothin but money gonna make you feel better
I'll buy you a dress and I'll buy you a car
I might even buy you an electric guitar
Cause I'm your
Sugar Daddy gonna me you happy
Sugar Daddy gonna make it nice
Sugar Daddy gonna give you candy
But you gonna pay Sugar Daddy's price
 Oh smile for the camera
 Yeah smile for the world
 Oh smile....give me your, give me your best smile
 Like a sweet little girl
So don't bother me with all your personal life
And I will ignore those little white lies
And when the fairy falls from the Christmas tree
Don't ever think that you can run to me
Cause I'm your
Sugar Daddy gonna me you happy
Sugar Daddy gonna make it nice
Sugar Daddy gonna give you candy
But you gonna pay Sugar Daddy's price
Yeah Sugar Daddy gonna make you happy

But you gonna pay

But you gonna pay
You're gonna pay Sugar Daddy's price
