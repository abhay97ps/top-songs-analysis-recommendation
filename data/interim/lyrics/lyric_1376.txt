Arcane... that's a hard name
You know who you remind me of? Scarface
You fucking boss
When you meet him, it makes your heart race
He'll give you that hard shake
Your fucking arm breaks
Thug life, you know how he got here, car chase
He pulled out front and said, "Hey what's up?"
He said, "Don't get smart, k?"
He burnt Cheddar and dodged Bulletz to get that large chain
But your lines came through bills so I guess you are cane
What up Toronto?
The champ is here! It's going down
I'm about to roast this old clown in his own home town
If you say you're the people's champ, ha
Let's do this just to make a point
If ya'll want me to represent this country
Make some noise!!!
You know what's up
Now hold up wait, skrrt
Let me get this straight
Cause I don't quite understand
So Caustic gave you rhymes you paid him the money
But it wasn't for the rhymes you was just helping your man
Now I get it, it's like this hooker I bought the other night
Ten hours straight she bounced on my dick
Now I paid her, but I mean, it wasn't for the sex
I was just looking out for the bitch
Haha, you're an idiot, stop lying, I talked to you after the battle
And you admitted it, you told me he gave you rhymes at the Grand Prix
And you agreed you'd split the money if you ended up winning it
Which is ironic, cause when you battled The Saurus
You blamed the same shit on him and you did the exact same thing as him
You fucking hypocrite!
See Caustic agreed to give him bars in exchange for the change of the wealth
You Pay-Pal'd money for those bars cause you couldn't think of them yourself
So how the fuck do you deserve the Canadian belt
If you can't even win the shit without an American's help
He's a coward he knows it he's been average for years and now
All of a sudden now he's the dopest
All of these punchlines coming from nowhere
Shit was obvious how did we know this?
His own boy told me he's had a team of writers for half his opponents
So at the end of the day yeah his shit's dope
But how do we know who actually wrote it?
Yo, I'm the man for the throne, the champ's gotta go
His name's Cane, cause he don't stand a chance on his own
And foolin' me is just something you can't do
Cause you got Two Chainz but nothing you say's Tru
Hey guys, look he mad right now
Trying to log in to Pay Pal right now
He wants to get the mobile app so bad right now
Before the battle he was on his smart phone texting Caustic
"yo let me cop some bars bro"
Caustic sent him such a dope line he texted him back, "Don Demarco"
Fuck that though I ain't sweating that
The chain is mine if I lose he's getting jacked
I'll snatch his chain so fast it'll decapitate his ass
And then I'll rock it with his fucking head attached
This fraud can't step to Pat
After this battle he gon' forget his ass
Faster than a second flat like I flashed him
With the gadget from Men in Black
You thought these long rounds were going to fuck me up
And I'd have to adapt to the change
Dawg, this is my shit
You just brought back the wrath I had from back in the day
I cause impact with the strength to shake the earth and crash a plane
I'm Pat Stay, I'll rap my way around a thousand pound rattlesnake
The chain is mine!
Since you wanna talk about that Grand Prix
First off, ain't nobody ever consider Chedda my equal
And we all know you and Hollohan share bars so which is the lesser of evils
I already proved in that whole tournament all my weapons is lethal
And all Caustic proved is he's a desperate, deceitful, treacherous weasel
But yo, they say hindsight is 20/20
So looking back now I see things perfect
My last battle I was rocking the three rings and it turned into a three ring circus
Well I ain't got time for clowns instead I crafted these three verses to shine some light on the dark side that lies beneath P's surface
See, he's nervous
So why is this sucka trying to claim he's a boss
When all you do is promo battles cause you scared of taking a loss
I hit targets with large calibers, stock silencers
Snipe yo' shit
You Dodge Challengers like a Chrysler whip
So that's why I ain't step in this ring to talk about those weapons I bring
Nah, this a chess game, y'all just pawns in the rest of my scheme
Your white knight can only take the L if you check what I mean
We all seen him make crooked moves dodging Bishop trying to get to the king
So if you wanna put me on trial, launch a case and sue me
With all this baseless scrutiny trying to bait and lure me
You can't escape the fury
How you gon' act like Judge Dredd when you dread judges you too scared to face the jury
See that's why I don't fear Pat's name
This a fierce man's game
I already proven over the years most of my peers can't hang
So let's be honest Pat, you never had the balls to come near that chain
Until I was the heel coming off the heels of a smear campaign
See that's why Pat Stay in school
He plays it safe and takes the easiest route
He claims he ain't scared of shit, but I see reasonable doubt
Seems like you scared to do a rap you won't succeed and get wealth
So how we supposed to believe in you when you don't even believe in yourself?
Yo, I mean, let's be real Pat
Your career path in battling ain't a safe bet
If you Canada's biggest export then what's happening with your paycheck?
You battled the biggest names but you only get a fraction of what they get
And you haven't even tried to fucking an album or a tape yet
Man, you so lazy and complacent, if you the favorite this is bias
The way I put these rounds together, crazy, it's a science
I sling shots that rock 'em, straight between his eyelids
So y'all can witness the slaying of a giant cause this is David vers' Goliath
That's why Patrick Stay is a dead man walking
My bars is straight mescaline and you better take medicine
I'm something you ain't never been
Cane is a trained veteran
So keep acting wild these punches leaving gaps in his smile like Dave Letterman
See me and you? We not the same specimen bredren
It's game seven these rappers is plain feminine
The white boy killing 'em, I am spitting fire, get your jaw tapped and wired like the 5-0 listening
So yo, I brought that machete to hack his limbs off
Bare to the bone
Body parts getting thrown to the air cause I'm the true heir to the throne
You ain't the genuine article Pat
You just an embarrassing clone
So when it comes to these King Of The Dot chains, I'm wearing 'em home
Wigger bars, that's something you gotta deal with
No matter how low you wear that hat, you can't hide from this real shit
You rub cocoa butter on your elbows
And calls his Irish girlfriend his ebony queen
And he's always asking me if I have Vaseline cause he says he has ashy knees
He gets made fun of for them big ass hats he wears
But he's too embarrassed not to cause he says he has nappy hair
See, he thinks he's a black man and excuse me for this angle
But it's kinda fucked up
Cause you a slave to that chain bro
I know, I know, that's fucked up, but that's what boggles my brain though
Cause I don't understand why Django don't wanna let his chain go
Aye, if he pulled a name out his hat, it'd say, "Arcane you're not black."
If you check the tag in the back it'd say, "Shave your chin strap."
You're white!
I know he hates that shit
White is beautiful Alex! Embrace that shit
I'll take a Who Needs To Grow The Hell Up And Quit Wearing That Stupid Hat So God Damn Low for 300 Alex
Yo, you 35 years old, you gotta grow up sometime Arcane
Old wigger walking around thinking of punchlines all day
Bumping Losing Yourself to the music in his buddy's Sunfire all day
Hat pulled down all low, looking like an umpire all day
But enough with the roasting session I'ma keep this shit rap
I got some shit you gotta hear dawg, I'ma feed you some facts
Your own city wants me to win tonight there's a reason for that
I average twice the views per battle than you, there's a reason for that
I already know how much you got paid for this, we'll leave it at that
But I got five times more and you're the champ
Dawg, there's a reason for that
Bro, think about it, think about it
And that's serious, I'm being dead serious with you
Every big international name they feed them to Pat
You've been hoping through obstacles for the chain and winning Grand Prix's I've been kicking my feet up relaxed
See what you lack is a battler Alex
Or natural talents that no one can teach you to have
And that's personality and charisma, and you have neither, you just rap
So spit them punchlines and wordplay schemes you gotta think about
I spit that shit you gotta go home look in the mirror and think about
I'll make this easy to figure out
You're old, you have no image, you're not marketable
And you'll always be that hard working dude that nobody gives a shit about
Fuck a punchline, that shit's real
I can't imagine how that would feel
A Happy Meal to Ally McBeal, you just don't have the appeal
But he just thinks he's so lyrical
So I figured only for fun
Fuck it, I'ma show HIM how it's supposed to be done
I'm carnivorous, carve into him with sharp instruments
Artistic with the blade, I stick it so far in then start twisting so hard I rip out your heart on the tip of it
Godzilla when I stomp through the streets
Car alarms go off and lights start flickering
Darkness hits, my arms swinging I start flipping shit
A starfish swimming with a shark you aren't fit for this
Your arch nemesis better choose your words wisely and articulate
I don't care you popped an Oxy moron, don't get smart idiot
It's clear that his head blew/blue up on some Marge Simpson shit
But I'ma flip the script like Hitler acts at Bar Mitzvah shit
I'm Pat Stay!
Straight off a block like Tim Duncan
Stone Cold Steve Austin, Hacksaw Jim Thuggin'
LL Cool Stay, Fresh Prince Of The Dark Side
And 'King Of The Dot's Champ' 'bout to be another nick name in the archive
Now that I'm back on top looking down, I see a lot of disloyal snakes in the grass
Some of the same spoiled lame little brats that tried exploiting 'Cane in the past
My last opponent shit the bed, he left with a soiled stain in his path
Dizaster was never the real king, more like a royal pain in the ass
That same night you battled Math
Well when it comes to bars I'm the worst type of critic
You said you ain't the 'wolf', cause you're 'flow' backwards
That's one of the first lines I'd edit
Didn't you say the same exact bars against Shotty Horrah as if the world might forget it
Fuck is you stupid? That wasn't even hot the first time you said it
And he's suppose to be the white knight that's here to save the day
To tell the truth I ain't ever really been amazed with Stay
You must be a vocational level student, I ain't saying he's a straight fool
But since you had trouble with Math, I guess we gon' have to take him to trade school
Ayo, yo Organik, you know this battle might hit a mil' right?
So let's make sure these mics work, for blowing hot air I'll send him to that H-Vac in a white hearse, fix his plumbing
You'll find me with the ratchet when them pipe's burst
No electrical technician but when I'm spitting the shit is light work
You need to work on your construction, you got a couple little nice spurts
But you lack in the foundation, principles to build a tight verse
I already signed a general contract to what your life's worth
You better run and get the four man/foreman if I catch him on site/sight first
Let's go, so this is like putting Larry Bird versus Birdman Chris Anderson
Y'all can consider me one of the gods, I'm part of the new pantheon
I'll shit on any rapper regardless of who's camp he in
I got the soul of an underdog, but the heart of a true champion
I deliver straight punches, see I focus my craft
Pat, you're like a wrestler, you flex and get loud like someone's holding you back
You throwing hay makers that don't connect then you go for the trap
Throw in a couple low blows and the crowd over reacts
Well yo, I got more second round knockouts than Iron Mike and I'm snapping now
They persecuted me in the press but I ain't never backing down
You thought those Zab Judah jabs would have me tapping out
It's looking like I may weather/Mayweather the storm and murder the whole pack of y'all 
So what you looking at right here is grown man bars versus school yard jokes
Look at the proof kid, the truth is you not dope
In your last few battles, you barely had a few hard quotes
So all y'all judges better be real about who y'all vote
This ain't Patrick Stay, with bars that sloppy this ain't Patrick's day
Slow that down, I said with bars that sloppy it's St. Patrick's Day
You don't wanna see 'Cane let that ratchet spray
A clutch shooter and I'm good with the heat from long range like Shane Battier
Yo, so after Pat's done taking this loss, I know the failure will haunt him
All his hopes and his dreams 'bout to be derailed and forgotten
You should've known you can't prevail I'm a marksman
It's round 2, Pat's through but I'll be back to put the nail in his coffin
Let's go!
Your crew's a bunch of suckers, wannabe tough boys
A gang of old Catholic priests, a bunch of fuck boys
Like if I smacked you, what could his friends say?
They're pussy, period
They overreaction or get an attitude I'll set his men straight/menstruate
I'm a tank in this bitch
Only thing lanky is my dick
Sometimes I get it tangled around my ankle and trip
Only time he be strapped with a magnum is if he was banging a chick
But even that's far fetched cause lord knows it'd be baggy as shit
But he loves talking about guns, eh
But we know he just be fronting
Cause no dudes co-sign that shit like breast reduction
Never shot a gun in his life, that's why I hate these battle rappers
But since you a nerd, I use basic mathematics to break you down to a fraction
Check it out
Your trigonometry isn't co-signed/cosine
Triangles will have some shape, you're obtuse
If you just use the right angles you'd be straight
Now I know this geometry raps probably wack and I sound like a huge lame bro
But c'mon you gotta admit, to a certain degree it's acute/a cute angle
Eh, always acting like he's 'bout to grab a knife and slice my throat
Oh stop it Alexander, you're the nicest guy I know
But when I say that shit it's believable, that's what the difference is
Cause I'll fire this can' and smoke this bitch in the face like Dizaster throwing a hissy fit
But understand, I was Pat Stay before I was Pat Stay
That's why I'm so respected, it's more than a rap name
I could go on and on about old war stories but that's lame
Because when you've actually lived that life you don't glorify that phase
But I'll tell you right now, if you was around you wouldn't even last a second
I done tied up suckers like you and beat them half to death
Wrap my hands around your neck 'til you make Scott Jackson sound effects
And slam you just for impersonating a life you think's cool that stole half my friends
So quit lying about that life cause I really mean that shit
Quit rapping about somebody shot cause I really seen that shit
Close range, my man caught a bullet he had to eat that shit
Then dig it out himself with a knife he really bleeds that shit
That's why I don't condone that life and I don't act like my steel be clapping
But that choke slam shit? Dawg, that could really happen
Bitch, what you know about living in the hood?
You wanna fuck around with me, man I wish a wigger would
And to speak to y'all
Yeah, I used to hit that Pepsi can
But God gave me a second chance
God gave me a second chance
And my fucked up life experiences are what made me become a better man
If you were from where I'm from you would understand
And I swear I would never touch them drugs again
But I guess tonight my old life's seem to come in hand
Cause I just cooked 'Cane/caine and smoke him and now I'm the fucking champ
Let's go!
Yo, listen up
Pat was just talking some real shit
So rest in peace to your dead homies
And rest in peace to my homies that died over the years
Whether it was murders or suicides I ain't one to cry over spilt beers
That's why your size don't intimidate me Pat
I'm just trying to make this real clear
I've been through bigger disasters/Dizasters than Bachir in my life and I'm still here
And look at the size of this motherfucker
Yo Pat, you tall enough to be playing ball, you should've been wearing them hoops out
Instead homeboy got his ears pierced and said, "Fuck it. I'm wearing my hoops out."
Yo, now this gorilla growing so much hair his shoulders I bet his knuckles drag
I thought your boy Hollohan had juice, it looks like you stole it from his duffle bag
Yo, I gotta say, poking all that diesel in your veins, you probably lactate gas
But when it comes to bars I'm way about Pat Stay's class
You can't handle heavy bars, that's why you brought Hollohan here to spot you
He be squatting over the top of Pat's face like, "C'mon brother, I got you."
Yo, and you think that shit's fresh? I don't know if you really qualified duke
This meat head reminds me of genetically modified fruit
See you might be bigger on the outside but you ain't packing no juice
So how's this fruit pumped full of steroids but on the label "Organic/Organik produce"
See, you sit on the shelf all year
So the Jolly Green Giant should have the sharpest lines
Compare apples to oranges, your opponents all hand picked like market signs
So start with trying to cultivate smarter rhymes
How you supposed to be top seed when I'm the one that plowed through the field like it's harvest time
{​Chokes}​
All y'all booing man...that's why you remind me of the Canadian version of Diz'
Organik put you in a major position
This company gave you a huge boost, just look at the names he was given
And now you just trying to use your popularity to sway the decision or make a commission off of politics and favoritism?
Well if that's the case, I just wanna say, "Shout out to Organik and all the promotion he's done."
Putting me and Patrick in this final match up, that's an appropriate one
So now I'm just putting the finishing touches on him like an upholstery gun
Cause World Domination wouldn't be complete if I didn't show him how it's suppose to be done
They say, heavy is the head that wears the crown
With each chain a gift and a curse is given
Now I can't escape these bars just like I was meant to work in prison
Battle for stacks, got me seeing green, I went to thermal vision
But now my worst addiction is back and I sense a murder victim
Clap, after the first incision I left him in a worse condition
So if I pop off it'll take his top off like a circumcision
I'll have him sprawled out in that curb position
Perma-grinning 'til he squirting, twitching
I'm shutting down his fucking central nervous system
Yo, my circuits glitching
My mind frame is disturbed and twisted
So try 'Cane the consequence is worse than getting burnt from piff in a Turkish prison
I'll serve him with the migraine that slice cranial surfaces with word precision
Like, Titanium broad swords, piercing 'em
My bars more furious
A hardcore lyricist
So fuck Norbes and whoever said I ain't take the art
Form serious
You repping Dark Side? Pat you play with Star Wars characters, you from Dartmouth
I put holes in him like dart boards; period
So now you watching your chance for winning this chain gradually dissolve
But you never really had a chance cause see my strategy's evolved
I told the battle scene that causalities would fall
So I gonna leave this wig perm like Big Worm there's principalities involved
So yo, playing with my money is like playing with my emotions
And Pat's an emo bitch
Thought you could take Arcane's chain on some Debo shit?
I'd say, "Stay Sucka Free" but that slogan's getting washed the fuck out
I'd rather do him like Craig did Debo and tell him, "You just got knocked the fuck out!"
