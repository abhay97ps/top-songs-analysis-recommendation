I was so downhearted, baby, till I met with you
Oh, you took me, took me, out of the blue
You shook me, shook me, out of the blue
Out of the blue into your arms
Oh, I came out of the blue, leavin' the pain behind
Just as if the rain was fallin', you came into view
Oh, you took me, took me, out of the blue
You shook me, shook me, out of the blue
Out of the blue into a love
So real, yeah! Out of the blue, how very strange it feels
Everything was so unproven, till you pulled me through
Oh, you took me, took me, out of the blue
You shook me, shook me, out of the blue
You passed my way, I asked your name
And since that day I'm not the same
I fell so hard for you, for every little part of you
Oh, out of the blue into your arms
Oh, I came out of the blue into your love just in time
Everything was so unproven, till you pulled me through
Oh, you took me, took me, out of the blue
You shook me, shook me, out of the blue
Out of the blue, baby, you took me out of the blue
Out of the blue, baby, you shook me out of the blue
Repeat until fade out
