If you think I'd ever leave you
Girl, you're wrong, I'd never want to
And how could you know that my love is real?
A-take this kiss, and you'll know how I feel
Somebody cares, and I'm gonna make you see
Somebody cares, so put your trust in me, baby
Now the time is going and the sky is cloudy
The birds are leaving and the cold is nearing
A-trust in me and you'll know the reason
That our love will last through many a season
Somebody cares, and I'm gonna make you see
Somebody cares, so put your trust in me, baby
So give me a smile and you'll know that our love's true
Don't be in doubt, 'cause I'd never hurt you
A-trust in me and you'll know the reason
That our love will last through many a season
Somebody cares, and I'm gonna make you see
Somebody cares, so put your trust in me, baby
Somebody cares, and I'm gonna make you see
Somebody cares, so put your trust in me, baby
