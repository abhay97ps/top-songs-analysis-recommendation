When me and my friends go out on the town
We can't sit still, we can't sit down
We don't like to fight and we don't like to scuffle
Dancin' all night doin' the Curly Shuffle
Hey Moe, hey Moe 
Well, a nyuk-nyuk-nyuk-nyuk 
La-le-li-li 
Woo-woo-woo-woo 
Well, we never miss a chance
We get up and dance and do the Curly Shuffle
Well, me and my friends love Larry and Moe
We love Curly's brother Shemp and his fat clone Joe
It's such a delight to boogie and hustle
Dancin' all night doin' the Curly Shuffle
Hey Moe, hey Moe 
Well, a nyuk-nyuk-nyuk-nyuk 
We-be-be-be-be-be-be 
Oh, wise guy 
Well, we never miss a chance
We get up and dance and do the Curly Shuffle
That's right!
Well, me and my friends, we all love to see
Comedy classics on late night TV
Those knuckleheads always get in a scuffle
A push and a shove doin' the Curly Shuffle
Hey Moe, hey Moe 
Well, a nyuk-nyuk-nyuk-nyuk 
Look at the grouse, look at the grouse 
Ruff-ruff, ruff-ruff 
Well, we never miss a chance
We get up and dance and do the Curly Shuffle
That's right
We do the Curly Shuffle
What'd ya say?
We do the Curly Shuffle
That's what I thought you said!
We do the Curly Shuffle
We do the Curly Shuffle
Well, we never miss a chance
We get up and dance and do the Curly Shuffle
