King Tut 
Now when he was a young man
He never thought he'd see
People stand in line to see the boy king
 How'd you get so funky?
 Did you do the monkey?
Born in Arizona
Moved to Babylonia 
 Now, if I'd known
They'd line up just to see him
I'd taken all my money
And bought me a museum. 
Buried with a donkey 
He's my favorite honkey!
Born in Arizona
Moved to Babylonia 
 Dancin' by the Nile, 
The ladies love his style, 
Rockin' for a mile 
He ate a crocodile
He gave his life for tourism
Golden idol!
He's an Egyptian
They're selling you!
{Instrumental bridge}
Now, when I die
Now don't think I'm a nut
Don't want no fancy funeral
Just one like old king Tut. 
He coulda won a Grammy, 
Buried in his Jammies, 
{alternatively - His sister was a mummy}
Born in Arizona, moved to Babylonia
He was born in Arizona, got a condo made of stone-a
King Tut!
