Something about the way your eyes lately
Look up and down and everywhere but me, yeah
Something about tonight I know is missing
And I know it's more than insecurity, yeah
After all, all the time we've spent together
Don't you think I'd feel something
If I have to read your mind
Maybe we're just wasting time
Tell the truth
You know my heart is in your hand
So give it up or make a stand
Tell the truth
Come on, tell the truth
There's no sense in going on this way, baby
You know it's time to say what you mean
There's no sense in going out trying to replace
A love that never came clean
After all, all the time we've spent together
Don't you think it's worth something
If I have to read your mind
Maybe we're just wasting time
Tell the truth
You know my heart is in your hand
So give it up or take a stand
Just tell the truth
Come on, tell the truth
Let's start it over, or call it over somehow
Just bring your love back to me baby
Baby, somehow
So if you want to be mine
Baby, let's stop wasting time
Just tell the truth
'Cause you know my heart is in your hand
So give it up or take a stand
Just tell the truth
I said, if you want to be mine
Baby, stop wasting time
Just tell the truth
'Cause you know my heart is in your hand
So give it up, give it up
Come on, tell the truth
Let's start it over, or call it over
Just bring your love back to me baby
Baby, somehow
Over
Bring it on back to me baby
Baby, somehow, yeah
