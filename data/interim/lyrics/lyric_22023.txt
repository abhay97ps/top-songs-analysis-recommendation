Tell me what you see when I pass by
Shadow, a cloud, or a line in the sky
Am I getting you wrong or am I getting you right?
Well, all I can take is one, one step at a time
Look at me
I'm trying
Everyday
I fall down
Make mistakes
Get back up
Try again
Next time that you see me
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
Some people say walking takes too long
But I say with walking you can't go wrong
Why should you rush away through life?
You won't get very far running all the time
Look at me
I'm trying
Everyday
I fall down
Make mistakes
Get back up
Try again
Next time that you see me
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
Why does my life say about me
Can't anyone see
Does it show I rock with the greatest?
I can't get back the time I spent
Use the rest of it to show all the world how I made it
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
Said I'm walking
