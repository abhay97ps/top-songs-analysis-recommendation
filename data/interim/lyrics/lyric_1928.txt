You are my pride and joy
And I just love you, little darling
Like a baby boy loves his toy
You've got kisses sweeter than honey
And I work every day to give you all my money
And that's why you're my pride and joy
And I'm telling the world
You're my  pride and joy 
I believe I'm no  baby boy 
But I know you're mine 
My pride and joy 
Yeah baby  Yeah baby 
You, you are my pride and joy
And a love like mine, yeah baby
Is something nobody can ever destroy
You pick me up  when I'm down 
And when we go out, pretty baby
You shake up the whole town 
And that's why 
I believe you're my  pride and joy 
 My pride and joy 
And I love you like a baby loves his toy
