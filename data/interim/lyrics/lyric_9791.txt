You ask is my love real
All I can say is how I feel
Deeply
Deeply as can be
You seem to need to know
How I would hurt if you would go
Deeply
Down inside of me
Is our love forever, can anyone ever know?
For all I remember I never have felt love so
So deeply
Deeply
Our love is made by two and I can't make it without you
Deeply
Feel so deeply
For our love
Is our love forever? Can anyone ever know?
For all I remember I never have felt love so
So deeply
Deeply
Deeply
Deeply
For our love
