I am the one who can please you
Ain't that what you said
You seemed so alone
I guess I was easily led
I showed you my love and babe
I guess it went to your head
When you were hungry, I brought you breakfast in bed
Come on, even it up, even it up, even it up
Come on, even it up, even it up, even it up
Well, a good man pays his debt
But you ain't paid yours yet
Even it
It's time to even it, even it up
Well, I took you over the tracks when you wanted some sin
I brought you satin and herbs from the places I've been
Well, now something tells me, baby
You're going to use me again
You think you can lay down the how and the where and the when
Oh, you think you can
You better even it up, even it up, even it up right now
Oh well, even it up, even it up, even it up
I don't want to bum it all
No, but this ax, she's got to fall
Even it
Come on and even it, even it up, baby
Oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on now!
Even it up, even it up, even it up
Even it up, even it up, even it up
Yeah, even it
Even it, even it, come on
Even it up, even it up, even it up, yeah.  Whoo!
Even it up, even it up, even it up
Oh, got your hand!
Even it up, even it up, even it up
