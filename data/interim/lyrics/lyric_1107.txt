You're followin' me
Wherever I go
You'll always be there –
So, what do I care?
You're followin' me!
When I've got the time
I'll slip you a kiss
I'll keep you around
You'll always be found –
You're followin' me!
That's what I thought
That's what I said right along
But now it appears with time an' tears
Have proved that I was wrong!
You're followin' me!
But, not like before
Tho' we're far apart
You're stealin' my heart –
You're followin' me!
Come back baby!
I'll treat you right this time!
Come back baby!
I promise to change all my ways!
You're followin' me
But, not like before
Tho' we're far apart
You're stealin' my heart –
You're followin' me!
You're followin' me!
You're followin' me!
Ah! Come back baby!
I'll treat you right this time!
Come back baby!
I promise to change all my ways!
You're followin' me
But, not like before
Tho' we're far apart
You're stealin' my heart –
You're followin' me!
You're followin' me!
You're followin' meeeeee!
Yeah!
