One, two, three, four
Hey!
When you smiled at me
And I saw your eyes
All I ever wanted to be
Was in your arms tonight
You looked too young to know about romance
Oh, yes you did
But when you smiled, I had to take a chance
I had to take a chance and be with you
Tonight
I'll be with you tonight
Tonight
You'll love me too tonight
Woah baby, tonight
I'm making love to you, oh, tonight
Bop-om-doo-doh-woh-mop-shoo
Woah, tonight
You're gonna love me too tonight
Woah, tonight
Tonight
I'll be with you tonight
Tonight
You'll love me too tonight
Woah baby, tonight
I don't know myself
If it's wrong or right
All I know is what I can feel
So be my love tonight
You looked too young to know about romance
Oh, you know what I mean
But when you smiled, I had to take a chance
I had to take a chance and be with you
Woh, tonight
Won't you let me sleep with you, baby
Woh, tonight
I just wanna make you feel good inside, baby
Woh, tonight
Let me feel the love that's in you
Woh, tonight
Come on, come on, come on, come on
And let me
Come on, baby
Woh, tonight
