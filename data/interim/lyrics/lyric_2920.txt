Come back and take this hurt off me
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me
'Cause, I'm too young to be in misery
Now baby, come back and take this hurt off me
I'll be waiting at the bus station
'Cause that's where you left me standin'
I got my clothes in a twenty-five cent locker
 I be here 
'Till the Greyhound 
Bring you back again, girl
Come back and take this hurt off me
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me
'Cause I'm too young to be in misery, now
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me
I knocked on my mother's door
She said, a 'Don, walk on in'
'Son, you don't have to say a mumblin' word
I know your woman done and left ya, again'
I say, now
Come back and take this hurt off me
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, now
What kind of love could this be now?
Baby, baby, baby, I don't know what you've got
'Sho' that's it's got me'
(It's got 'em! it's got 'em! it's got 'em!
Mercy!
But now, I've been to see my doctor, yeah
He did all he could
But there was nothin'
He could do for me, girl
You're the only one who could
Come on baby, now
Come back and take this hurt off me
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me
It's hurtin' me
Heartbreak, now
It's hurtin' me, now
Heartache
Too much pain
Come back, again
I need your lovin'
Mercy, baby
Heartbreak, now
