Got a feeling in my heart
That it's time for us to start
To sing, sing together again
We can sing high
We can sing low
It's all the same, you know
Sing it high and sing it
Sing it low
Got a feling in my soul
We can sing a song
That we all know
So come now
Let's sing together again
We can sing high
We can sing low
It's all the same, you know
It's your lucky day now
It's your day
It's your lucky day now
It's your day
When you think straight
Straight, clean and simple
And no matter what you may do
It's all coming right back to you
Yes, it is, yes, it is
Yes, it is, yes, it is
Yes, it is, yes, it is
Yes, it is, yes, it is
Got a feeling in my heart
That it's time for us to start
To sing, sing together again
We can sing high
We can sing low
It's all the same, you know
Sing it high and sing it
