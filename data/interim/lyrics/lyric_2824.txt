Four strong winds that blow lonely seven seas that run high
All these things that don't change come what may
But my good times are all gone and I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
I may go out to Alberta weather's good there in the fall
Got some friends that I can go to workin' for
Still I wish you'd change your mind if I asked you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more
If I get there before the snow flies and things are going good
You could join me if I sent you down the fare
But if you'll wait until it's winter it would do no good
But the winds sure can blow cold way out there
Four strong winds that blow lonely...
