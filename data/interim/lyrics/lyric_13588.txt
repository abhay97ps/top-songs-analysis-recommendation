The finest...
As life goes on
You learn to hold on
You learn to appreciate the finer things in life
The finest
If I had a choice
I'd always choose love
Up or down, good or bad, I don't mind
Just as long as it's real
My friends say I'm lucky
To have found someone as good as you
My love's understanding 
Understanding how to hold onto you
After all that we've been through
Time won't change the way I feel about you
Out of all the loves before
You're the finest I've ever known
If I had to choose
I'd be by myself
I wanna be in love
But with nobody else
Time flies when you're with me 
Goes so slow whenever you're away
Made up my mind and I'm positive 
A better love will never come my way
After all that we've been through
Time won't change the way I feel about you
Out of all the loves before
You're the finest I've ever known
After all that we've been through
Time won't change the way I feel about you
Out of all the loves before
You're the finest I've ever known
Know 
You keep me in love
I'm lost 
Just call me, I'll come
No other love before 
Could do what you do
A little so much 
So much more from you 
No one else will do
There's no substitute
Your love's the finest love I've ever known
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest I've seen
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest one for me
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest I've seen
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest one for me
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest I've seen
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest one for me
Oh...
After all that we've been through
Time won't change the way I feel about you
Out of all the loves before
You're the finest I'll ever know
After all that we've been through
Time won't change the way I feel about you
Out of all the loves before
You're the finest I'll ever know
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest I've seen
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest one for me
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest I've seen
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest one for me
