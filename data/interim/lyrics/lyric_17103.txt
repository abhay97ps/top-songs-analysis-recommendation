Waiting for Wednesday
My stomach doesn't hurt enough
Pain always is the sign
Waiting for Wednesday
No proof of mine exists
So l don't have to take it back
Don't want to show you good-bye
Show you good-bye
Show you good-bye
Show you good-bye
But you're waiting for Wednesday
Waiting for Wednesday
Waiting for Wednesday
I pray you'll put me on the spot
I do believe you
That you'll love me
That you'll leave me
Don't want to show you good-bye
Show you good-bye
What will I do when you come near to me?
You'll put me on the spot
You've been doing this a long, long time
Not that you're better than me
But that you do it a lot
Now I'm waiting for Wednesday
Waiting for Wednesday
Waiting for Wednesday
I'm waiting for Wednesday
I'm gonna show you good-bye
Show you good-bye
Show you good-bye
Show you good-bye
Now I'm waiting for Wednesday
You're back from out of town
The West is dry
Your mind is clear
And I don't want to be here
I don't want to be here
I don't want to be here
To show you good-bye
And I'm waiting for Wednesday
Waiting for Wednesday
I'm waiting for Wednesday
To show you good-bye
I don't want to be here
To show you good-bye
Waiting for Wednesday
I don't want to be here
Waiting for Wednesday
To show you good-bye
To show you good-bye
