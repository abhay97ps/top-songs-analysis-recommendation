Papa worked but his cheque was small
Mama sewed just to help us all
And our old house sure needed paint
And when it rained the roof would leak
Well the teacher's pet was Susie Grout
Born with the silver spoon in her mouth
Miss "Goody Two Shoes" in sovereignty
And I was a "Little Miss Nothin'"
And they thought of me as:
The girl most likely
Yeah, 
The girl most likely
To wind up in uh-hu jam
They judged by the way I looked to not the way I am
Well I guess it's true I looked the part
But developin' fast was not my fault
Didn't know my sex appeal showed through
Those made over clothes and run down shoes!
Now the doctor's son is hidin' out
And the whole town knows what it's all about
Because the evidence is plain
Ha! It ain't me it's Susie Jane!
The girl most likely
Yeah, 
The girl most likely
Susie's daddy is on the run
And he sure looks funny with that hot shot gun!
Well the weddin' bells can't wait till June
It'd better be now or else real soon
Susie Jane is in the jam
Hey listen that gun go wam wam wam!
Well some of that talk is dyin' now
And there's a lot of most likely's in this town
Just because a house needs a coat of paint
That doesn't mean a girl is somethin' she ain't...
