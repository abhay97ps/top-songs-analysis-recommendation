Oh, when the sun beats down
And burns the tar up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot
You wish your tired feet were fireproof
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be
 Out of the sun
 We'll be havin' some fun
 People walking above
 We'll be making love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk
From the park you hear
The happy sound of a carousel
Mmm, you can almost taste
The hot dogs and French fries they sell
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be
 Out of the sun
 We'll be havin' some fun
 People walking above
 We'll be making love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk
Oh, under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be
 Out of the sun
 We'll be havin' some fun
 People walking above
 We'll be falling in love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk
