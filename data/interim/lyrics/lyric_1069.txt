Sometimes I cry when I'm lonely
Sometimes I cry when I'm blue
Right now I'm cryin' 'cause I love you
I'm cryin' 'cause you don't love me too
Come on & tell me that you love me
Won't you please answer yes or no
Tell me if I'm your one & only
So I can either stay or go, wo oh
Tell me, my darlin', if you love me
Now tell me if you feel the same
Tell me, my darlin', if you love me
Or if all the tears I she'd were she'd in vain
Oh tell me now
Sometimes I cry when I'm lonely
Sometimes I cry when I'm blue
Right now I'm cryin' 'cause I love you
I'm cryin' 'cause you don't love me too
I'm cryin' 'cause you don't love me too...
