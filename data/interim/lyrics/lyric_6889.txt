After loving you the longest time
Your eyes show me the exit sign
I can't ignore the sign I read
When I hold you how cold you feel
But it's so hard for me to say goodbye
Yes I know you see tears in my eyes
So I'll go before I break down and cry
'Cause it's so hard for me to say goodbye
Girl I'm leaving you, I won't try to push you back
Although I'll be losing you, at least my pride will stay intact
My heart says stay but my mind says no
The longer I delay I just won't go
But it's so hard for me to say goodbye
I can change I'm a lover to the end
I can change once I know it's the end
'Cause it's so hard for me to say goodbye
It's so hard, yeah, it's so hard, yeah, yeah
Yes I know you see tears in my eyes so I'll go
Before I break down and cry
'Cause it's so hard for me to say goodbye
'Cause it's so hard for me to say goodbye
'Cause it's so hard for me to say goodbye
Everytime I think about oh
'Cause it's so hard for me to say goodbye
I break down and cry every time
