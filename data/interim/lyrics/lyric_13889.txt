Knock, knock it out the box, Bronson
Knock, knock it out the box, Bronson
Yeah, uh, knock, knock it out the box, Bronson
Bitch I'm a superhero, I wasn't born with dinero
Somehow I turned into Deniro
Just give me one shot at the lead role
You'll be amazed, like the first time you seen snow
Down in Georgia on the Peach Grove
I shoot ninety-five percent from the free throw
Sixty from the field, strange sex appeal
The lone gunman, muffle the shotty with an old onion
This is no fun, never low funds, man, fuckin' crazy, uh
You must be out your mind
Back with a vengeance
Black MAC lookin' like Janet with extensions
I'm back on the bench presses, put the Audi in a red dress
Make ten lefts, I lost fifty on the Mets, I'm a mess
After practice hit the steps bitch
That's what I gotta do to be the best shit
Man these motherfuckers sleepin'
While Bronson bangin' pots and pans
Gotta understand these fake fucks are not your mans
Me, disappear, where? I'm right here
Creepin' in the cold nights air
To get on my level take fifty light-years
My jewelry boxes like the habitat for white bears
After I'm finished in the sauna
I jump into some freezing cold water
Shake it like I'm reading from the Torah
I'm 'bout to tat a skull on my skull
Hangin' from a snake's mouth comin' out a pyramid
Now I'm at the steakhouse gettin' dirty looks
Guess I shoulda wore a different shirt
Poppin' wheelies on the Harley down 53rd
Break the guitar on your head after my solo shit
I coulda been in Guns N' Roses dolo, bitch
Got the Box Chevy jumpin' like a pogo stick
Don't you motherfuckers know that I'm the logo kid? Uh
Yeah, don't you motherfuckers know that I'm the logo
Like Jerry West and Teddy Ballgame
I don't wear Balmain, swing the ball and chain executioner style
Dirty mountain tiger to the face
Better strap up, I'm 'bout to see space
As I entered, I felt everything was centered
Oh shit, I think I'm back in the placenta
But then I woke up in a Nissan Sentra
In the parking lot of Queens Center, uh 
My grandparents learned English watchin' Martin, uh, ha yeah
My grandparents learned English watchin' Martin, it's me, uh
Wild immigrants, my grandparents learned English watchin' Martin
Knock, knock, knock 'em out the box, Bronson
Knock, knock 'em out the box, Bronson
Knock, knock 'em out the box, Bronson
Knock 'em out the box, Bronson
Yeah, uh, it's me, motherfucker
That's a ill vision
That's pretty fucked up
It sounds so bad, like the dog pound is runnin' through his bitch
They all had their sneakers on, fuckin' fakin'
