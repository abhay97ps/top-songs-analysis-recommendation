If I can't love you
'Til the day I die
Then baby, oh baby
What good am I?
If I can't reach up
And know that you'll be there
Then this whole world
Ain't spinnin' anywhere
'Cause there's no livin' without your lovin'
Without the magic of your tender touch
There's no livin' without your lovin'
Baby, I love you too much
And I wouldn't want
To live my life through
Knowin' in my heart
I never will have you
If I can't hold you
And kiss you anymore
Then what on earth
Am I livin' for?
'Cause there's no livin' without your lovin'
Without the magic of your tender touch
There's no livin' without your lovin'
Baby, I love you too much
If I can't hold you
And kiss you anymore
Then what on earth
Am I livin' for?
'Cause there's no livin' without your lovin'
Without the magic of your tender touch
There's no livin' without your lovin'
Baby, I love you too much
There's no livin' without your lovin'
Without the magic of your tender touch
There's no livin' without your lovin'
Baby, I love you too much
