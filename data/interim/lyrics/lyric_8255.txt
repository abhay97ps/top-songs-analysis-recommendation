Jumping with my boy, Sid
Right here in the city
Don't you know that is was grand?
Really grand, so grand
And then you came along
Then you came along, boy
And sang your groovy song
Sang a song and I asked:
Mr. Whatchacallem, whatcha doing tonight?
Hope you're in the mood
Because I'm feeling just right
How's about a corner
With a table for two?
Where the music's mellow
Is a gay rendezvous
There's no chance romancing
With a blue attitude
You know you got to do some dancing
To get in the mood
Mr. Watchacallem, I'm indebted to you
You're here. It goes to show what good influence can do
Never felt so happy or so fully alive
He's a jam a jumpin', it's a powerful jive!
Swing-a-roo is giving me a new attitude
My heart is full of rhythm
And I'm in the mood
In the mood  be mine forever
In the groove  and leave me never
In the mood  give me some kissing
You know it won't be long
Before you're in the mood!
Don't be rude, I love you madly
It's up to you, I'll take you gladly
Love is blind, my vision's hazy
It didn't take me long to say
I'm in the mood!
Do ba do ba do bop boo da da day
Ba da-n-da da-n do da-n do day
Who's that guy with the beautiful eyes?
'N' look at those lips, I'd try 'em for size
Hey! Swing with me!
What a wing it'd be!
May I intrude? It's time to dance
And I'm in the mood!
Oh, hold me darling, let's dance
What a dreamy romance
It's a quarter to three
There's a mess-o-that moon
Let's share it with me
You know, I think it's rude
To keep me this way
When I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood, in the groove!
In the mood, ah, ah, ah!
Man-oh-man, wow!
Now you really got me lookin'
Oh, and you really got me cookin', oh!
My heart went flip, my brain went skip
I said c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I'm hot now! I love you madly!
Right now! I'll take you gladly!
Tight now! I'll be in!
And now I'm really in the mood, boy!
Rompin'! Stompin'! Smokin'!
Why don't we go somewhere and smooch, boy?
It's got to be right now!
It's gotta be right now!
It's got to be right now!
I'm only saying that it didn't take me long
Didn't take me long, didn't take me long
To say I'm in the mood
Your flat foot floozy wants a good boy!
