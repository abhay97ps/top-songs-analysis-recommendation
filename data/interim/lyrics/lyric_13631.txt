It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic
One dream, one soul
One prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Is this a kind of magic?
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be
Will soon be done!
This is  a kind 
Of magic 
There can be only one, one, one, one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done 
, it's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
Magic, magic, magic, magic!
, ha-ha-ha-ha, it's magic
Ha-ha
Yeah, yeah
Whoo
It's a kind of magic!
