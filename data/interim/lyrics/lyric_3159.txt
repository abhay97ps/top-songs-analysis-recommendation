Van McCoy
He wears a smile, I wear a frown
And I can tell whenever he's around
And all the eyes of everyone are staring
And I know that they're comparing the two
Whispering and a'saying when they do
See the difference between the old and new
Before and after
Losing you, losing you
His future's bright, my future's dim
And all the dreams we shared, you share with him
And all the eyes of everyone are staring
And I know that they're comparing the two
Whispering and a'saying when they do
See the difference between the old and new
Before and after
Losing you, losing you
I used to be happy as he, till I lost you some how
Though I don't show it, you wouldn't know it
To look at me now
He wears a smile, I wear a frown
He makes you happy when he's around
He wears a smile, I wear a frown
He makes you happy when he's around
