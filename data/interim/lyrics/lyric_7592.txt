Hey fellas
I'm talking to you, you, and you, too
You guys know who I'm talking to
Those of you who go out and stay out all night
And half the next day
And expect us to be home when you get there
But let me tell you something
The sisters are not going for that no more
'Cause we realize two things;
That you aren't doing anything for us
Than we can do better by ourselves
So from now on
We gonna use what we got to get what we want
So, oh...
You'd better think, think
It was the time when we had respect
That's the thing I never will forget
Now baby I got a life to live
And a whole lotta loving
That I wanna give, yeah
But before I give it up I gotta think, think
What the future holds for me
You go ahead and see
I don't need no heartache
I can't stand no misery
Let me think, think
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Alright, yeah
Don't say it's easy, know it can be rough
Just plain living, sometimes it's kinda tough
You bad, you bad
She bad, ain't she?
You bad, you bad
If it's not in your vision
Don't make no decision
Hey yeah alright
So I'm laying the cards on the table
When it comes to taking care of me
I know I'm able
You may not call it true
But I won't do nothing that you won't do
Said I won't do nothing that you won't do
So think about the good things
Come on and think about the right things
You got to think about me, too
Come on and think, I'll think about you
Come on and think about the good things
Come on and think about the right things
Come on and think, baby, about me, too
