Rozay a born stunner, I could blow money 
Fifty when I'm shoppin', that ain't no money 
I got my jeans saggin' , money stuffed in 'em 
I got forty whips , way too much in 'em 
I need me a queen , I need me a dime 
Livin' this fast life, just show me a sign 
I'm a G , I'm-I'm-I'm a G
Took her from the lame, put her on that condo on the beach 
All she needs, all-all-all-all she needs

Fur coats in the winter, look like a polar bear 
Stunting in the snow, these haters they can go somewhere, yeah
