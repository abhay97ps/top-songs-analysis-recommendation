Other girls are never quite like you
Do you know I'm lonely
There's a chance we can make it now
If you listen, if you listen
We were happy, what went wrong
Our love can't die, it was too strong
How long can this go on
Think what I am saying
Think, get it straight in your mind
Please, please don't discount me
Say these lines, say I love you
Say these words
