Yeah
I’m not that kind of guy who can take a broken heart
So don’t ever leave, I don’t want to see us part
The very thought of losing you means
That everything would go down under
I’ll be loving you forever
I’ll be loving you forever
 Yeah
 I’ll be
 Loving you
 Yeah, it’s forever
 I’ll be
 Loving you
Yeah
I count the blessings that keep our love new
There’s one for me and a million for you
There’s just so much that I wanna say
But when I look at you, all my thoughts get in the way
I’ll be loving you forever
I’ll be loving you forever
 Yeah
 I’ll be
 Loving you
 Yeah, it’s forever
 I’ll be
 Loving you
Yeah
We’ve come too far to ever turn back now
This love will last forever
I can see it all now
 I’ll be
 Loving you
 Yeah, is forever
 I’ll be
 Loving only you, girl
Oh girl
I’ll be loving only you
Be loving you girl
