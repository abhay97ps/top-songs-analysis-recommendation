Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Oooh, no, no, no, no
Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Oooh, no, no, no, no, no
Just like an old clich√©, one that simply says
You can't miss what you never had
I thought that love was just a feeling that I'd give to her
And in return, she'd give it back
But it's more than a friendly sensation
Oh, I had to be tripping out on the girls
Body vibration, but I knew.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Oooh, no, no, no, no
I'm so glad I can stand here today and say
I'm so glad about it
Love has finally come at last 
And I'm never gonna give it back
Oooh, no, no, no, no, no
Listen to me now
Just like a tender young virgin in her first love affair
I doubt if she'd ever do it again
Would she even care
But as time pressed on
Oooh, oooh, the girl caught on
Nothing more she'd do with the boy
She seemed to want it, want it, want it.  
Oooh
But there's one side of love I'd never, never, never known, baby
Until you came along
I can, I can tell the world
 Oh, I can tell it.  I can tell it
Oh, never, never, never.  
Say it again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
I'm gonna keep it, yes I am.  
Break it down to me easy
'Cause everybody needs some kind of love in their life
Some kind of shape, form or fashion
Some kind of shape, form or fashion
Oh, and just like the flowers need the rain
And they need, they need love to grow
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I got you, baby.  
That's all you'll ever need
Oh no.  Ooooooooooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Chased away the blues in my life
You got a way of making everything alright
Ooooooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Somebody understand me now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh.  
I'm so glad.  
Oooh, no, no, no, no
When something good happens to you
You just wanna let everybody know
 Let everybody know
Seems like it took so long, took so long
But now you're here.  
Now you're here.  
Yeah, and I'm so glad.  
Everybody sing the song 
If you can understand where I'm coming from
Where I'm from.  
Where I'm from.
