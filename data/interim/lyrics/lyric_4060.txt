My dear old mother told me
"Oh, please beware of things
That promise untold profit
Or lots of fun and games
Watch out for city women
They'll bring you down, my son
They'll take you to the gutter
They'll steal you blind and run"
"Oh, please don't worry
My dear, dear old mother, don't worry
Your son's heart is pure
Yes, it's snow white and pure
Please don't worry"
Her tone was confidential
She said, "Oh, please beware
Of things that promise kicks
Anytime and anywhere
Just one last tender warnin'
They're low, those gamblin' men
They hide in every shadow
And wait for you, my friend"
"Oh, please don't worry
My dear, dear old mother, don't worry
Your son's heart is pure
Yes, it's snow white and pure
Please don't worry"
He lied about the women
About the gamblin', too
There's fun in the big city
And, Mom, there's room for you
"Oh, please don't worry
My dear, dear old mother, don't worry
Your son's heart is pure
Yes, it's snow white and pure
Please don't worry"
