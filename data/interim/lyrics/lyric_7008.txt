I knew from the very beginning
What you had in mind
But I said to myself, baby
You're gonna just waste your time
But somehow during the night, baby
Things started to get out of hand
And I found myself
Falling in love again
I slipped, tripped, fell in love
Fell in love with you, baby, yes, I did
I slipped, tripped, fell in love
Fell in love with you, baby, oh yeah
Getting stuck on you, baby
Was the last thing I had in mind
But now you got me wanting you, baby
Want your love all the time
When you touch me, baby
I just lose control
And I find myself
Wanting more of you down in my soul
I slipped, tripped, fell in love
Fell in love with you, baby, yes, I did
I slipped, tripped, fell in love
Fell in love with you, baby, yes, I did
Lord, it's alright, yeah
I slipped, tripped, fell in love
Fell in love with you, baby and I like it like that
I slipped, tripped, fell in love
Fell in love with you, baby
I slipped, tripped, fell in love
Fell in love with you, baby
