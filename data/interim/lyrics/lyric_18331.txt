I live the life of a celebrity
A made nigga way bigger than them other cats you love to see
Lil Zane
Can I talk to you for a minute? 
It's like I been doin' a lot of interviews
Just people be callin 'my name everywhere, "Hey, Zane!"
Come on
I live the life of a celebrity
A made nigga way bigger than them other cats you love to see
I'm getting paid like I'm supposed to
My homies call me on my mobile wanna hang we still close too
I switched positions with them poâ€™ cats, I write raps
Make millions like that, I like that
And I never was a rich man
A rubber band for a wrist band
Got dough and had to switch plans
Drama still don't stop
The freeway, getting chased by some bad bitches
Wanting autographed pictures 
They want my name tattooed on them
Thinkin' for a minute, hit that ass, make a move on 'em
Hey! Hennessy with the chardonnay, mix it
I put the trees in the Garcay, twist it 
A true player smoking purple haze
Two shots in the air for my true thugs out there
This life I live of mine 
This life is crazy 
I waste no time at all 
They won't stop calling me 
This life I live of mine
This life is crazy 
I waste no time at all
They won't stop calling me
Calling me, calling me, calling me , say my name
Calling me, calling me, calling me , say my name
Let me explain what the game is like
I did a show in California, had to be in Las Vegas the same night
Me and 112 on the same flight, getting tired
It ain't easy being worldwide
I seen murder come with fame in this rap game
Gotta stay strapped if you rap so I pack thangs
All my niggas pack thangs, and plus we love to ball
Don't want no problem with you, homie, I mean none at all
And to my rich cats with them big faced bills in the air
My po' cats sell more sex to you there
Love green millionaires, been all around the world
Turned the squares into true players
Cheap watches turned to Cartiers, locals turned to gators
Point 3's turn to 5 C's all these car keys
Jump in the Benz, hit The Shark Bar
You know they love to see a hot star
This life I live of mine 
This life is crazy 
I waste no time at all 
They won't stop calling me 
This life I live of mine 
This life is crazy 
I waste no time at all
They won't stop calling me
Calling me, calling me, calling me , say my name
Calling me, calling me, calling me , say my name
And for my dogs I ain't seen in awhile
I still got love for y'all ain't got a chance to return your call
I'm in Chicago, I'm getting paid
Man, bigger figgas everywhere that I go
I'm still hearing about drama poppin' in the hood
Heard that you niggas doing good and I like that
Irv said niggas got the block locked
He tell me K and Big Chris riding drop tops
Flossin', I'm getting letters, hard to write back
Put a fly picture in the mail, hope they like that
Prayin' that the fame don't kill us all
The magazines to the big screen
It ain't easy as the shit seems
Throwin' up my deuces as a pass by
Showing love to the south side, all the players outside
And we gon' spend G's tonight
Hotel's on me, shit's free tonight
C'mon!
This life I live of mine 
This life is crazy 
I waste no time at all
They won't stop calling me
This life I live of mine
This life is crazy
I waste no time at all
They won't stop calling me
Calling me, calling me, calling me , say my name
Calling me, calling me, calling me , say my name 
This life I live of mine 
This life is crazy 
I waste no time at all
They won't stop calling me
This life I live of mine
This life is crazy
I waste no time at all
They won't stop calling me
Calling me, calling me, calling me , say my name
Calling me, calling me, calling me , say my name
This life I live of mine
This life is crazy
I waste no time at all
They won't stop calling me
1, 2, 1, 2
It's going down, baby
Mistafiss and Diggie Doms on the track saying
It's a worldwide thang
