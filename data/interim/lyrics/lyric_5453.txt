Malinda, Malinda
Malinda's the girl 
Who came to my world
And made my interest
In all other girls stop
Malinda's a dream 
Beauty to the extreme
Malinda is the cream of the crop
So many guys in love
With my Malinda 
You ought to see the presents
Others send her
Trying to make her surrender
Surrender them some of that tender
Love she's giving me 
Oh, but she doesn't know
She'll never go
She's where she'd rather be
In the arms of a man
Who fits in her plan 
She lets them know that man is me
So many guys have
Tried for my Malinda 
From the Casanovas
To the real big spenders
But all they do is offend her
Offend Malinda and send her
Calling out to me
In a lover's speed
Love me tenderly
 Oh
I love Malinda
Ooh, I love that girl 
Ain't gonna let no
Jill or Jane or Brenda
Come between me and my Malinda
I'll never let another girl hinder
The chance that Malinda's gonna
Spend her every night and day
Satisfy this day
In love with me this way
Oh, she only has eyes for me 
Yeah, she gives up all the
Other guys for me 
She is mine, all mine
That's the way it was meant to be
