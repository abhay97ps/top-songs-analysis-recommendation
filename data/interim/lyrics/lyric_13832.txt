Mozard!
I need nobody, I got it on me
I'm moving slowly, now listen closely
I need nobody, I got it on me
I'm moving slowly towards the trophy, yeah
Let me say it one more time
I don't need nobody over here on my side
I do it on my own, I just be by myself
All alone, I do it by myself, yeah
Get to the top and I might fall, yeah, I know that
But I got time I don't mind being by lonely
And I don't fear to fail or being at my lowest
'Cause everybody out there has a different motive
They tell me go one at a time, yeah
But I know I'm losing my time now 
I don't want it all to end now 
Energy enters all in my veins
They tell me I'm losing my grind now 
But I don't want all of the shine now 
Got plenty of ties on my end 
Whole lot of love, stay 'til the end
No one on my side but I don't care
It's fine, I like the ride
Baby, yeah, I'm living in the rain
And you know that I'm always gonna be the same, yeah!
I need nobody, I got it on me
I'm moving slowly, now listen closely
I need nobody, I got it on me
I'm moving slowly towards the trophy, yeah
Let me say it one more time
I don't need nobody over here on my side
I do it on my own, I just be by myself
All alone, I do it by myself, yeah
Eyes on fleek, in my whip, issa drop down
Hair so sleek, got the drip, 'cause I'm uptown
All on me, got your man 'cause he cuffed now
Eyes on me, got your girl, it's a showdown
And I'm making advances without moving them bricks
I don't pull up with sticks, no sleeve full of tricks
And when I fall down, I get back up, I be 10 toes down
When I glow up, I won't change now, imma still be around, yeah
I keep on chasing while you keep on hating
The steps that I be making while you keep on faking
I wanna see Cuba, stay calm like a buddha
I prowl like a puma, bitch, I'm Mona Mula, yeah
No one on my side but I don't care
It's fine, I like the ride
Baby, yeah, I'm living in the rain
And you know that I'm always gonna be the same, yeah!
I need nobody, I got it on me
I'm moving slowly, now listen closely
I need nobody, I got it on me
I'm moving slowly towards the trophy, yeah
Let me say it one more time
I don't need nobody over here on my side
I do it on my own, I just be by myself
All alone, I do it by myself, yeah, yeah!
