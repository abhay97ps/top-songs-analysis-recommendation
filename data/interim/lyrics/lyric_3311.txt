There's a chick in the magazine we all know
She's a swingin' little chick we all know
And what she's got she doesn't owe to luck
She owes it to a cat named Daddy Warbucks
She saves the world, there's no one bolder
She does all this and never gets any older
 she does all this and you wouldn't surmise
 this chick needs no disguise
 here's a thing that would be the prize
 to get Annie Fanny a pair of eyes
She always gets saved by a pooch named Sandy
But the dog's in trouble and it's a sin
He's as blind as Fanny, he needs contact lens
 she does all this and you wouldn't surmise
 this chick needs no disguise
 here's a thing that would be the prize
 to get Annie Fanny a pair of eyes, yeah
Good work, I can shake up my whole buzz
