Hi! Hi! We're your weather girls
And have we got news for you!
You better listen
Get ready all you lonely girls
And leave those umbrellas at home
Alright
Humidity is rising , barometer's getting low 
According to all sources  
The street's the place to go 
'Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half-past ten
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
I'm gonna go out to run and let myself get
Absolutely soaking wet!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Every specimen!
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean
God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel
She rearranged the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!

About to begin

Don't you lose your head!
Rip off the roof and stay in bed

She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel
She rearranged the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
