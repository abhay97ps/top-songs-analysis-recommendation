You know everybody been waiting on that Baby, man
I mean, it's like ever since Baby on Baby dropped, man, like, you know 
Ain't nobody drop shit 
Let's go, hah
I needed some shit with some bop in it 
I flew past the whip with that blunt in my mouth
Watch the swervin', that whip had a cop in it 
My bitch got good pussy, fly her 'cross the country
I finish the show and I hop in it
I got me a milli', I did it legit-ly
I'm still with the shits, I'm a hot nigga 
Oh, you asking for pictures with niggas? 
What's your name? Get the fuck out the spot, nigga 
Tryna figure which deal I'ma take 
I woke up, couple mil' on my plate 
I'm investing in real and estate 
I just went gave my mama a hundred 
Probably won't hear me open my mouth 'less you hearin' me talkin' 'bout finding some money 
As soon as I found it, I flipped that 
I'm a little bit different, they get it 
Know I'm stiff on a bitch and she dig it
Tryna find out why Baby ain't all in her mentions 
No, she ain't get no DM from me 
This rich nigga dick, it ain't free
She be throwin' that ass, yeah, she good at it
Turn around when we fuck, make her look at it 
I needed some shit with some bop in it 
I flew past the whip with that blunt in my mouth
Watch the swervin', that whip had a cop in it 
My bitch got good pussy, fly her 'cross the country
I finish the show and I hop in it 
I got me a milli', I did it legit-ly
I'm still with the shits, I'm a hot nigga 
I'm unorthodox than a motherfucker
Ayy, when you gon' switch the flow? I thought you'd never ask
Niggas ain't fuckin' with me
And ain't 'bout what the fuck they be rappin' 'bout with they lil' scary ass 
But to each his own, nigga 
If you like it, I love it, no biggie 
That boy say he get money, oh, really?
How much they just cut you a check for? A milli'
I'm going back to Cali like Biggie 
'Bout to go get a pound just to smoke 
They told me to come work on my album
I'm tryna go find out the price on a boat 
My lil' bitch act like Megan Thee Stallion
She ghetto and nasty, she drivin' the boat 
All this shit that they makin' be boring
Play me something to bop while I ride with the pole
Here you go 
I needed some shit with some bop in it 
I flew past the whip with that blunt in my mouth
Watch the swervin', that whip had a cop in it 
My bitch got good pussy, fly her 'cross the country
I finish the show and I hop in it
I got me a milli', I did it legit-ly
I'm still with the shits, I'm a hot nigga 
Like, this shit feel like, you know
The sophisticated ratchet hoes, you know
The ones that go to work by day, then, you know
Dance in the mirror by night 
I needed some shit with some bop in it 
I flew past the whip with that blunt in my mouth
Watch the swervin', that whip had a cop in it 
My bitch got good pussy, fly her 'cross the country
I finish the show and I hop in it
I got me a milli', I did it legit-ly
I'm still with the shits, I'm a hot nigga 
Oh, you asking for pictures with niggas?
What's your name? Get the fuck out the spot, nigga 
Tryna figure which deal I'ma take 
I woke up, couple mil' on my plate
