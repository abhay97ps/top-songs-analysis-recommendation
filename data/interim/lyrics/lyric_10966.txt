Car won't start, out of gas
Check past due, reserves won't last
Caught the bus to go downtown
Bus broke down, downtown bound
Left the bus, flagged down a cab
Driver said, "I want all your cash"
Don't let life keep you behind
Glide right on by, glide right on by
Don't let life keep you behind
Glide right on by, glide right on by
Let the groove blow your mind
Glide right on by, glide right on by
Let the groove blow your mind
Glide right on by, glide right on by
Let the groove blow your mind
Glide right on by, glide right on by
Let the groove blow your mind
Glide
