Turn up your radio and put your ear to the sweet, sweet music
And take your baby and hold her in your arms
And hear the music go "Ooh ooh"
And if you're feeling like it go get your lover
And reel and rock her and roll it over
And hold her tighter, hold her tighter
It's what she needs
You've go to take a hand, take a hand
You've got to let her know
Take a hand, take a hand
You've got to let it show
Turn up the music and put your ear to the radio
And take her gently and rock her in your arms
And hear the record go "Aah aah"
And if you're feeling like it go get your lover
And reel and rock her and roll it over
And hold her tighter, hold her tighter
It's what she needs
You've go to take a hand, take a hand
You've got to let her know
Take a hand, take a hand
You've got to let it show
