He walks like a man
And he talks like a man
He schemes like a man and whenever he can
He dreams like a man
But it's the little boy
It's the little boy in him I love
He's strong like a man
When he's wrong, he's a man
When he's right he's a man
'Cause he never ran
He'll pride like a man
But it's the little boy
It's the little boy in him I love
They say in every man
You'll find a little boy
And every now and then
When he's happy or blue
That little boy comes shining through
He walks like a man
He talks like a man
He lives like a man and since our love begun
He gives like a man
But it's the little boy
It's the little boy in him I love
But it's the little boy I love
But it's the little boy I love
But it's the little boy... I.... love....
