I'm a track star, gotta run far
And I'm ready to go
It's a long, long road
And I gotta make it on my own
Everybody's gainin' on me
Tryin' to slow me down
But if I'm gonna make it
Gotta fight, fight, fight all day
And night and day all right
Goin' home, goin' home, goin' home
I gotta make it, gonna make it all right
Goin' home, goin' home, goin' home
If it takes me the rest of my life
I'm a space man, from a different land
I gotta get back home
I've been gone so long
That I'm feelin' like a useless man
Everybody's lookin' at me
Tyrin' to help me down
I gotta fight, fight, fight
Even though it takes another day
And night, and day, all right
Oh me, why, why
Is it either win or lose
Somehow, someday
I'll never ever have to go away
Goin' home, goin' home, goin' home
I gotta make it, gonna make it all right
Goin' home, goin' home, goin' home
I gotta make it, gonna make it all right
Goin' home, goin' home, goin' home
I gotta make it, gonna make it all right
Goin' home, goin' home, goin' home
It it takes the rest of my life
Don't take it too easy
Don't take it too easy
Don't take it too easy
Don't take it too easy
