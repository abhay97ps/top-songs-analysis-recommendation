Maybe I should drop you at your door
Or leave tonight and vanish up the shore
Anywhere but here
It's three o clock we're driving in your car
You're screaming out the window at the stars
"Please don't drive me home"
Blame us cause we are who we are
Hate us cause you'll never get that far
And who'd suppose you would go
I've already learned enough to know
Tell me all the places we could go
And count the headlights passing on the road
A long long time ago
Chorus
Here we are
Foreign to their world
Straight and composed
Your sermons I can do without
And I finally found that everybody loves to love you
When you're far away
Could it be we've done something wrong
We'd make it home to your place before dawn
"Please don't drive me home"
"Please don't take me home"
Chorus
