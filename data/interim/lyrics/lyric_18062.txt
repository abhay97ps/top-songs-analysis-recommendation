Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright 
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
If tomorrow is Judgement Day 
And I'm standing on the front line
And the Lord ask me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright 
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
If I wake up in World War 3 
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I wanna go home
It's okay if you're comin' with me
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright 
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
If I lose my fame and fortune
And I'm homeless on the street 
And I'm sleepin' in Grand Central Station 
It's okay if you're sleepin' with me
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
As the years, they pass us by 
We stay young through each other's eyes 
And no matter how old we get, oh
It's okay as long as I got you, babe
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
If I should die this very day 
Don't cry, 'cause on Earth, we weren't meant to stay
And no matter what people say 
I'll be waiting for you after Judgement Day
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
