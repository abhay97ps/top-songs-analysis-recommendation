Where did she touch you
How did if feel
Why did you let it begin
What did she whisper and
What did it mean
And
Where do you think it will end
How long did it last
Do you think it will stop
Did you get to try anything
New
How good was she
Honestly
Where did you go and
Who made the very first move
Who made the very first move
Who made the very first move
You don't have to sneak in the doorway
Just come on into the room
I've been lying in our bed in the dark all alone
And I've been waiting I've been waiting for you
There's been no reason to move
It's been as still as a tomb
I needed you oh so badly tonight
But I guess you had better things to do
I should have known that it was coming to this
But I must have been blind
I bet you still got a trace of her love in your eyes
And you've still got her eyes on your mind
You swore you'd be with me at seven o'clock
Now it's a quarter to three
And whatever you got and whoever it was
I guess you couldn't get it from me
Whatever you got and whoever it was
I guess you couldn't get it from me
I know that you love me
There's no need to talk
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof
And there are no lies on your body
As I see you undress
Oh
I just want to get at the truth
I know that you love me
There's no need to talk
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof
And there are no lies on your body
As I watch you undress
I just want to get at the truth
And there are so many things that I've just got to know
You tell me who
You tell me where
You tell me when
But don't tell me now I don't need any answers tonight
I just need some love
So turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again
I'll be left in the dark again
I'll be left in the dark again
Left in the dark again
I should have known that it was coming to this
But I must have been blind
I bet you still got a trace of her love in you eyes
And you still got her eyes on your mind
You swore you'd be with me at seven o'clock
Now it's a quarter to three
And whatever you got and whoever it was
I guess you couldn't get it from me
I guess you couldn't get it from me
But down in my soul down in my soul
I know
I know that you love me
There's no need to talk
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof
And there are no lies on your body
As I watch you undress
Oo
I just want to get at the truth
And there are so many things that I've just got to know
You tell me who
You tell me where
You tell me when
But don't tell me now I don't need any answers tonight
I just need some love
So turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again
I just need some love
So turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again
I just need some love
So turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again
I just need some love
So turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again
I just need some love
So turn out the light and I'll be left in the dark again
I just need some love
So turn out the lights and I'll be left in the dark again
Left in the dark again
