All my friends have to ask if I'm shattered
I say the past is the past and it no longer matters
I made my mind up
I can make it
I'll be fine
Even if I gotta fake it
I'll keep surviving
Another night
Without you
Another night
I know I can get through
Another night
It's only
Another night
I won't be lonely
Another night, another night
Another night
It ain't much
Another night
Without your touch
I used to search through the crowd to find you
But I don't feel like it now
So don't look behind you
You better face it
I won't be calling
I hit my stride when the evening is falling
I'm going to make it
Another night
Without you
Another night
I know I can get through
Another night
It's only
Another night
I won't be lonely
Another night, another night
Another night
It ain't much
Another night
Without your touch
Out where the music is loud and the people are laughing
I'm going to step on out
I won't be down
Going to stand my ground for just another night
Oh yes for a another night
You were phasing out, my sweet, and I knew it
He didn't give a damn how I got through it
But like you I had someone else too
Always there to keep me warm, no time for blue
I made my mind up, I can make it
I'll be fine even if I gotta fake it
I'll keep surviving, yes I will
Another night
Without you
Another night
I know I can get through
Another night
It's only
Another night
I won't be lonely
Another night, another night
Another night
It ain't much
My man, I don't need you to be bringing me down
Hey, another night, another night
Another night, another night
Another night, another night
Another night, another night
Oh yes it is
I get so restless in my bed
Without you, boy
I'm going to make it
You know I am
I get so restless in my bed
