Twenty houses in a row
Eighty people watch a TV show
Paper people, cardboard dreams
How unreal the whole thing seems
Can we be living in a world made of paper maché?
Everything is clean and so neat
Anything that's wrong can be just swept away
Spray it with cologne and the whole world smells sweet
Ice cream cones and candy bars
Swings and things like bicycles and cars
There's a sale on happiness
You buy two and it costs less
Can we be living in a world made of paper maché?
Everything is clean and so neat
Anything that's wrong can be just swept away
Spray it with cologne and the whole world smells sweet
Read the papers, keep aware
While you're lounging in your leather chair
And if things don't look so good
Shake your head and knock on wood
Can we be living in a world made of paper maché?
Everything is clean and so neat
Anything that's wrong can be just swept away
Spray it with cologne and the whole world smells sweet
Like paper maché
