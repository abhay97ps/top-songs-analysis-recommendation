Happiness is when I'm near you
To share your smile if I love to
Happy's the day I found you
Happy's the world around you
I'll never cry as long as
We're together
My happiness is you
Happy's the way I love you
Happy's just thinkin' of you
I've found a lifetime of pleasure
A hidden treasure
In the happiness of you
You're the girl
I wanna marry
You're the girl that makes me
That makes me happy
Happy's our life together
Happy's our love forever
What more in life could you give me?
Happy is the day
All my life with you
Happiness is when I'm near you
To share your smile if I love to
Happy's the day I found you
Happy's the world around you
Happy's the way I love you
Happy's just thinkin' of you
Happy's our life together
