I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Some girl that knows the meaning of, uh
"Hey, hit the highway"
Well, I've been walkin' the streets up and down
Racing through the human jungles at night
I'm so confused, my mind is indifferent
Hey, I'm so weak, won't somebody shut off that light
Electricity runs through the video
And I watch it from this hole I call home
And all the stony's are dancin' to the radio
And I got the world calling me up here tonight on the phone
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Some girl to thrill me and then go away
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Some girl that knows the meaning of, uh
"Hey, hit the highway"
Well, I'm not wiped out by this poolroom life I'm living
I'm gonna quit this job and go to school, or head back home
And I'm not askin' to be loved or be forgiven
Hey, I just can't face shakin' in this bedroom
One more night alone
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Some girl that knows the meaning of, uh
"Hey, hit the highway"
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Some girl to thrill me and then go away
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Some girl that knows the meaning of, uh
"Hey, hit the highway"
You betcha
