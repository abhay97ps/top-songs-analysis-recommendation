You know it's cruel
Out here in this rat race
There's just one rule
Out here in this rat race
Out here in this jungle
You've got to fight from nine to five
In this steel and concrete jungle
You've gotta fight to stay alive
It's a rat race!
You know it's mean, yes, it is
Out here in this rat race
You can't stay clean, no-no
Out here in this rat race
If you don't wanna starve
You know you gotta be like a hog
There's no such thing as friendship
Out here, it's dog-eat-dog
It's a rat race!
Eat and sleep, sleep and eat
Oh, Lord, what a rut
Work and slave, slave and work
Work and slave, for what?
Sometimes I get the feeling that it isn't worth it, but
When I see my woman standing there with my kids
Look at 'em, just standing 'round
Then I say to myself, "You know it's worth it all"
And that's the reason why I ain't giving in, no, no, no, no
Out here in this rat race
I'm gonna win, yes, I will
Oh, in this rat race
