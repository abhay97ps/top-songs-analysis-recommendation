Fall in this bitch, transfusion with the drip drop
Sauce everywhere and got broccoli in my Ziploc
Tatted on my face, no role model, that's for Kid Bops
Got it on my waist, let that shit rock, I’m floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating
Swag on max, got no legs, bitch, I’m floating
Might turn into a ghost, punk bitch, yes, I'm floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating, floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating, floating
Swag on max, got no legs, bitch, I'm floating
Might turn into a ghost, punk bitch, yes, I'm floating 
Take it off, yeah, going off, yeah
Money been here, the body's in here
I'm bringing up hell, the chopper don’t fail
The product get late, the pussy gon’ wait
The money I chase, the 'Rari don’t break
You killing my pace, the Carti' my face
A mil' in my safe, now hand me that tape
Ten toes in the mud, who the plug getting wrapped?
Ten-tone yellow pill, selling seals and it's facts, ayy
I ain’t trying to wife you, too emotional 
Now take this in and out like it's supposed to go
Made it out the hood, had to bounce right quick 
Wonder how I drop out, learn to count like this 
Got a new house and a condo where I keep my shit 
Got a shoestring 'round the thing thing, they don't build like this
Okay, I'm floating, ayy
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating
Swag on max, got no legs, bitch, I'm floating
Might turn into a ghost, punk bitch, yes, I'm floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating, floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating, floating
Swag on max, got no legs, bitch, I'm floating
Might turn into a ghost, punk bitch, yes, I'm floating
I'm a Percocet floating 
AR toting 
Big blunt smoking ass nigga 
In the Maybach joking 
Drive the 'Rari like it's stolen 
He a broke Ford Focus ass nigga 
Pay me for a show, I got a chopper 
All this metal, they gon' call the coppers 
Can't run the game 'round rappers 
'Cause I hang around all robbers 
Little nigga, do you got a problem? 
Little nigga, we'll come and solve it 
Cash coming in, can't stop it 
I'm running to the money, y'all jogging 
Richard Milles represent victory 
Still the same, I'm just a richer me 
A washed-up bitch don't mean shit to me 
I'ma let your best friend nibble me 
You can't do nothing for me
Unless you leaving hickeys where my dick be 
I'm Slaughter Gang Savage
Freak hoes get punched just for trying to kiss me 
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating
Swag on max, got no legs, bitch, I'm floating
Might turn into a ghost, punk bitch, yes, I'm floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating, floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating, floating
Swag on max, got no legs, bitch, I'm floating
Might turn into a ghost, punk bitch, yes, I'm floating
