I saw him at the party
Standing in the corner
Looking just as good as he could be
And when he caught my eye
I knew I was a goner
You should have seen the way he looked at me
Well, I tell you
He really knocked me dead
So, I don't quite remember
Exactly what he said
I just stood there
And I shook my head
Cause, you should have seen the way he looked at me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The music started playing
And before I knew it
He put his arms around me tenderly
He asked me for a kiss
And I just had to do it
You should have seen the way he looked at me
Well, you know that
He walked me home that night
There was starlight and moonlight
Everything was right
So I kissed him, with all my might
And you should have seen the way he looked at me
Yeah
Whoa-oh-oh-no
He didn't let me down
Cause the very next day
You know he came around
And he told me that he loved me
Yes, he really did now
He said that he was mine eternally
I looked him in the eye
And said, you wouldn't kid now
You should have seen the way he looked at me
And then one day
I wore something new
Something old, and borrowed
And something blue
I remember, when he said, I do
You should have seen the way he looked at me
Whoa-oh-yeah
Whoa-oh-yeah
Whoa-oh-yeah
Whoa-oh-yeah
Whoa-oh-yeah
