I dont want to
Move from where im
At now i feel
Comfort, somewhat
I just like nostalgia
Catch me playin wind waker
Soul breaker, breath taker
Underrated casket
Im just chillin now
I dont want any
Ya i think ill stay home
I dont wanna go
Im just tryna feel myself
Feel my soul leavin
Fuckin dying young bitch yea im paranoid
Yea im cashed bitch
Still wasted
Tryna change yourself just another waste of time
Back to old habits smokin all the fucking time
Overthinker overthinker
Livin in repetitive
U knew what ur gettin into
Now u never wanna see me again
Honestly, can't say that i blame u
Hittin walls all over again
Lakeside, in the headlights, shinin
Tell me why u always gotta lie to me
Give me reasons to believe
That this isnt what it seems
All these ashes on my jeans
Gunna show me what it means to live my life in its entirety
Hate to say things twice
So apathetically, ill refrain one last time
And then its lights out
I been a burden
A disturbance
Yeah
Since fuckin day 1
Yeah i been hurting
Feening for the
Gift of life
To strike me down
Need not say twice
I long for
Your touch
Our lips lock
For the first time
You were finally all mine
But now you’re not
And thats how the story ends
No different
Plot to grow
Yo girl
Won’t leave me alone
I don’t won’t that hoe
If she ain't bringing
Ideas to the table
I need you bitches to be
Willing and able
To go further and further
Then you ever thought
We’ll be climbing to the top
Faster than you can drop
That shit
You call a hit
Motherfuckers know that we in this bitch
No one wants to see
This shit we do
Cause you motherfuckers scared on
What we act on
You bitches can’t see that
We past ya
This brain
Spinning faster and faster
Dizzy from the cardi
Mixed up
With a fuckin blunt
Next year we’ll be touring
Where y’all at
We out front
Finna yuke
If i don’t lay down soon
Gotta practice for tonight
Don’t hit my phone
When i get home
It ain't turning on
Im all alone
