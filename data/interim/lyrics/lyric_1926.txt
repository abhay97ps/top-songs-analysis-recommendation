If my pillow could talk
If my pillow could talk
If my pillow could talk
It would tell you 'bout
My sleepless nights
Tell you 'bout the rivers I cried
Ever since you said goodbye
If we just could have talked it over
Before you ever put me down
You know I love you much too much
To think about you running around
If my pillow could talk to you
Know how much I miss your kiss
It would tell you how much
I toss and I turn
Waiting for you, darling, to return
Yes, my pillow could tell you too
Not one word they said was true
If my pillow could talk to you
If my pillow could talk to you
Know how much I miss your kiss
It would tell you how much
I toss and I turn
Waiting for you, darling, to return
Yes, my pillow could tell you too
Not one word they said was true
If my pillow could talk to you
If my pillow could talk to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If my pillow could talk to you
If my pillow could talk to you....
