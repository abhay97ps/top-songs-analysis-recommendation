Anywhere you go, anyone you meet
Remember that your eyes can be your enemies
I said, hell is so close and heaven's out of reach
But I ain't giving up quite yet
I've got too much to lose
Hold me down, sweet and low, little girl
Hold me down, sweet and low, and I will carry you home
Hold me down, sweet and low, little girl
Hold me down, and I'll carry you home
The rain is gonna fall, the sun is gonna shine
The wind is gonna blow, the water's gonna rise
She said, when that day comes, look into my eyes
No one's giving up quite yet
We've got too much to lose
And I'll carry you all the way
When you say you're fine
But you're still young, and out of line
When all I need is to turn around
To make it last, to make it count
I ain't gonna make the same mistakes
That put my mama in her grave
I don't wanna be alone
