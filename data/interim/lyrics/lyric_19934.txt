I be on it all night, man I be on it 
All day, straight up pimp
If you want me, you can find me in the A!
Ayy! Ayy!
Ayy! Ayy!
Ayy! Ayy!
Ayy! Ayy!
Time and time again, I gotta turn back round and tell these hoes
That I am the H-N-I-C, bitch, that's just the way it goes
I be on that shit that'll have you on that "I don't want no more"
At this time, I need all my freak hoes to get down on the floor 
If you came to rep your set , right now, nigga, let 'em know 
If it's jail I get for stomping a hater to sleep, fuck it, I go 
Freak, I'll be off in the whip
Straight geeked swerving down your street
In a stolen Bonneville with 23s on the feet
The Legend, Rocky D Brown, back in town to plea you down
Give me face, I love the sound, slap the taste, they hit the ground
Back in the A, cliqued up, picked up with some P.I.s that don't play
On that Kryptonite, we stay, so high, we might fly away!
I be on that Kryptonite
Straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that
I be on that Kryptonite
I be on that Kryptonite
Straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that
I be on that Kryptonite
I-I-I-I-I be on it all night, man I be on it 
All day, straight up, pimp
If you want me, you can find me in the...
Ayy!  Ayy! 
Ayy!  Ayy!  
Ayy!  Ayy, 
AYE!  Ayy! 
I'm on that Kryp, tonight 
I'm on that Kryptonite 
I'm on that Kryp, tonight 
I'm on that Kryptonite 
Time and time again, I gotta tell these niggas and these hoes
I'm from College Park where we move that weed and we slang that blow
Get dope on a daily basis
Get high, make them ugly faces
Toke the 'dro, and I'm on probation
My blunts, I don't be lacing
I'm on that Kryptonite 
Come to my crib tonight
Let me beat that puss all night
Run, tell your buddies I fucked you right
Tell 'em bout all the plaques on the wall
Tell 'em how you licked my balls
Tell 'em how Konkrete run the streets, Big Boi, he put us on
Chevy ridas, slangin' powders, Simpson Road to Dixie Hills
Diamond pressed against dat wood, candy paint, spinning wheels
Grind Time Rap Gang member, bitch it's Killer Kill
Purple Ribbon rolling O's, and we all be on that Kryp
I—I—I—I be on that Kryptonite
Straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that
I be on that Kryptonite
I be on that Kryptonite
Straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that
I be on that Kryptonite
I-I-I-I-I be on it all night, man I be on it 
All day, straight up, pimp
If you want me, you can find me in the...
Ayy!  Ayy! 
Ayy!  Ayy!

AYE!  Ayy! 
I'm on that Kryp, tonight 
I'm on that Kryptonite 
I'm on that Kryp, tonight 
I'm on that Kryptonite 
Time and time again, I gotta turn back round and tell C-Bone
Grab that cologne on out my book-bag, I smell dro all on you, homes
Suppose the po-po's get whiff of the spliff
That you just smoked, them folk gon' trip
Probable cause, call the canine unit to the side of the road
Let's take a sniff 
Shit, the only thing we ridin' dirty is this UGK CD, Tackleberry
So may we be on our merry way?
'Cause you just ain't gon find no yay
Play, I got a tough team of attorneys
Make a judge lean like he sipping syrup
They play durr-ty, he cain't touch me
Verdict be not guilty, search me
Chevy ridas, slangin' powders, Simpson Road to Dixie Hills
Diamond pressed against dat wood, candy paint, spinning wheels
Grind Time Rap Gang member, bitch it's Killer Kill
Purple Ribbon rolling O's, and we all be on that Kryp
I be on that Kryptonite
Straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that
I be on that Kryptonite
I be on that Kryptonite
Straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that
