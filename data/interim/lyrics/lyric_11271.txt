Darling, don't you call me
Until the sun is goin' down
And don't expect to hear from me
'Til the evening comes around
Find yourself a daytime friend
To walk you in the park
'Cause you know I'm just coming alive
When the sky starts gettin' dark, mmm
If you're the kind of woman
That likes to be impressed
All I need's one chance to prove
I do what I do best
You can find another man
To spend your afternoons
But he can't do what I can do
In the light of a lover's moon
You gotta wait for late at night
Keep on waitin' for late at night
You'll be glad you stayed up
To find out what it's like
Late at night
Hold on
The sun is almost gone
Starlight
I love to see it shining in your eyes
There ain't no use to fight it
And change the way I am
Don't you see I'll always be
A nighttime lovin' man?
So when the evening finds you, baby
Feeling all alone
That's when you need a man like me
To love you all night long
Keep waitin' for late at night
Keep on waitin' for late at night
You'll be glad you stayed up
To find out what it's like
Late at night
Keep on waitin' for late at night
Keep on waitin' for late at night
You'll be glad you stayed up
To find out what it's like
Late at night
