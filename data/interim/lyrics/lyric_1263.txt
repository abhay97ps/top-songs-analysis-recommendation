They say we're searching for love we'll never find
They say we're foolish kids, we're two of a kind
We know we've found our love when your lips meet mine
That's when we know they're right, we're two of a kind
No matter what they say when it's all said and done
And we are old enough, we two will be one
And when we pass them by with your hand in mine
Then they'll just smile and say "they're two of a kind"
No matter what they say when it's all said and done
And we are old enough, we two will be one
And when we pass them by with your hand in mine
Then they'll just smile and say "they're two of a kind"
