No, I don't say it often
And I probably should’ve told you I hurt this bad, I know
And I probably shouldn't want this so bad
It's weighing, weighing on me
Don’t wanna wake up in the mornin'
Cannot undo what we did in this bed
And I can't get you out, so I gotta go
No, I'm not ready for, you want me all alone
But I'm undecided, excited, ignited
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flying
But I'm still indecisive
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided
I know I shouldn’t be doing this, but here we go again
Girl, you know that pussy is my weakness 
Girl, you got me addicted when you switching positions
You tell me, "Shut up"
And you know I listen, I hit it
Wish I never did it
I can’t keep sinning and pretending 
I'm taking off your clothes
We getting sexual
Hit it so good, think I’ll propose
I don't know but
I'm undecided, excited , ignited 
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flying 
But I’m still indecisive 
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, yeah
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, I said I just don't know
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Ayy, 'cause I'm undecided
No, no, baby
I'm afraid of your love
Oh, ooh, you got me, baby
'Cause I can't get enough, oh, woah
I'm undecided, excited , ignited 
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flying
But I'm still indecisive
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided
