This thing is just the beginning
But it's beginning to get me
But I don't know about you, boy
That's speaking just for me
If you don't to lose
This feeling between me and you
Now don't let go and I think you know
We got to give in to love 
Baby, baby, baby
Got to give in 
Oh, yeah, got to give in
You know just what I'm thinking
I'm thinking, I'll make it clear
Now it's up to you, boy
Just how far we got from here
If you don't to lose
This feeling between me and you
Hey, don't let go
I think you know
We got to give in to love 
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Got to give in
Yeah, yeah, my, my baby
Got to give in
Oh, I need your loving, honey
Got to give in
Give up to you
Got to give in
Oh, I need your loving
If you don't to lose
This feeling between me and you
Don't let go
I think you know
We got to give in to love
