You were my conscience
So solid, now you're like water
And we started drowning
Not like we'd sink any farther
But I let my heart go
It's somewhere down at the bottom
But I'll get a new one
And come back for the hope that you've stolen
I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world
From turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder, how we survive?
Well, now that you're gone, the world is ours
I'm only human
I've got a skeleton in me
But I'm not the villain
Despite what you're always preaching
Call me a traitor
I'm just collecting your victims
They're getting stronger
And I hear them calling
Calling
I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world
From turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder, how we survive?
Well, now that you're gone, the world is ours
Well you find your strength in solutions
But I like the tension
And not always knowing the answers
But you're gonna lose it
You're gonna lose it
I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world
From turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder, how we survive?
Now that you're gone, the world
I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world
From turning into a monster and eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder, how we survive?
Now that you're gone, the world is ours
