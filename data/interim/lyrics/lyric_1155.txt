I need someone
Whoa, how I need someone
I need someone
Someone like you, you, you
Today, my love has gone away
She won't be back
She wants it this way
I need someone to take her place
Someone with a warm embrace
She promised me he would be true
And said I love no one but you
But here I stand, I'm all alone
Nothing to do but to stay at home
And I need someone
How I need someone
Yes, and I need someone
Somеone like you, you, you
Yeah, wе used to travel
Around and around
And then we always
Went from town to town
But since my gal
She's gone away
I haven't had, I haven't
Had a happy day
And even though we
Went together for so long
I can't imagine what went wrong
But here we are, so far apart
And now she's thinking
That she's so smart
And I need someone
Oh, how I need someone
Yes, and I need someone
Someone like you, you, you
Yeah, we used to travel
Around and around
And then we always
Went from town to town
But since my gal
She's gone away
I haven't had, I haven't
Had a happy day
And even though we
Went together for so long
I can't imagine just what went wrong
But here we are, so far apart
And now she's thinking
That she's so smart
I need someone
Oh, how I need someone
Yes, and I need someone
Someone like you, you, you
