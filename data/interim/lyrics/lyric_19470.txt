Hey, hey good lookin', what you got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
Hey, hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe?
I got a Hot Rod Ford and a two-dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancing's free
If you wanna have fun, come along with me
Hey good lookin', what you got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me
Let's stir it up, boys
I'm free and I'm ready, maybe we can go steady
How's about saving all your time for me?
No more lookin'
I know I've been tooken
How's about keepin' steady company?
Well, I'm gonna throw my date book over the fence
And find me one for five or ten cents
I'll keep it till it's covered with age
'Cause I'm writing your name down on every page
Hey, hey good lookin'
What you got cookin'?
How's about cookin' something up with me?
