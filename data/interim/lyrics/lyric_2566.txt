It's an ill wind that blows no good
And it's a sad heart that won't love like I know it should
And, oh, how lonesome you must be, yeah
And it's a shame if you don't share your love with me
And it's a heartache when love is gone
But it's bad and even sad later on
Oh, there's no one blinder than he who won't see, yes
And it's a shame if you don't share your love with me
And I can't help it, oh no, if she is gone
You must try to forget, oh you must live on
And I swear it's a good thing to love someone
But it's bad and even sad when it's not returned
And, oh, how lonesome, yes, you must be, yeah
And it's a shame if you don't share your love with me
And I said it's a shame, oh, if you don't share your love with me, oh, yeah
