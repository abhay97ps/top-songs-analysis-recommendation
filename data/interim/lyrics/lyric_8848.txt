Keeping my eyes on the road, I see you
Keeping my hands on the wheel, I hold you
99 miles from L.A
I kiss you, I miss you, please be there
Passing a white sandy beach, we're sailing
Turning the radio on, we're dancing
99 miles from L.A
I want you, I need you, please be there
The windshield is covered with rain, I'm crying
Pressing my foot on the gas, I'm flying
Counting the telephone poles, I phone you
Reading the signs on the road, I write you
99 miles from L.A
We're laughing, we're loving, please be there
The windshield is covered with rain, I'm crying
Pressing my foot on the gas, I'm flying
Counting the telephone poles, I phone you
Reading the signs on the road, I write you
99 miles from L.A
We're laughing, we're loving, please be there
99 miles from L.A
99 miles from L.A
99 miles from L.A
99 miles from L.A...
