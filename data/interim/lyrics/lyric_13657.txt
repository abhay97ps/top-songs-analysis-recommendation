The two of us are one of a kind
This combination ain't easy to find
But why do I get a feeling from you
Things ain't right?
Do you need something new?
Knowing how both of us live
Leaves us so little to give
If I could grow wings
I would do anything
Just to keep you with me
Can't you see?
If I could fly high
I would give you the sky
Don't you make that mistake
What does it take?
It's not like I've been mean to you
Its not like I've got something better to do
The life I live you'll never understand
If you fly with me we'd never have to land
Its easy to live hard and fast
But inside we know it won't last
Oh yeahhhhhhh
Knowing how both of us live
Leaves us so little to give
Yeahhhhhh
What does it take?
What does it take?
What does it take?
What does it take?
