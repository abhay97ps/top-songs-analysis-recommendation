I worked so hard to get me a man
Don't try to take him away
I love my man like nobody can
Don't try or you're gonna pay
You've been gettin' too close, you've been goin' too far
How do you think you are
Some kind of star
You're headin' for a red light
Hot night
Satisfy
Dynamite
Red light

Now I don't want you hangin' around
My man is too hard to hold
But if you plan on hangin' around
I plan on stoppin' you cold
'Cause I'm ready to rock and I'm ready to roll
I'm raging out of control
Look out below
You're headin' for a red light
Hot night
Satisfy
