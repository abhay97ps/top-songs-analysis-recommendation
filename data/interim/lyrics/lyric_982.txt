Well, I went and lost her
To the great imposter
I stood and watched her fall
Couldn't help her at all
Poetry, so sweet, has her at his feet
She thinks she's the one but he has just begun
All her friends they just watch her
For they know the great imposter
Don't she know he's on a stage
It's not real, it's just a play
And he's playing a part
That is soon to break her heart
Oh, can't she see tomorrow's misery?
Soon she'll learn her fate but it will be too late
All her friends they just watch her
For they know the great imposter
Poetry, so sweet, has her at his feet
She thinks she's the one but he has just begun
All her friends they just watch her
For they know the great imposter
And she's soon to join the roster
For they know the great imposter
And she's soon to join the roster
For they know the great imposter
And she's soon to join the roster
