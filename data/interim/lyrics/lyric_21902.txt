Haha
Dance
Back door cracked, we don't need a key
We get in for free
No VIP sleaze
Drink that Kool-Aid, follow my lead
Now you're one of us
You're comin' with me
It's time to kill the lights and
Shut the DJ down 
Tonight, we're takin' over
No one's getting out
This place about to blow 
Blow 
This place about to blow 
Blow 
This place about to blow 
Blow 
This place about to blow 
Blow 
This place about to—
Now what?  We're taking control
We get what we want
We do what you don't
Dirt and glitter cover the floor
We're pretty and sick
We're young and we're bored 
It's time to lose your mind and
Let the crazy out 
Tonight, we're takin' names 'cause
We don't mess around
This place about to blow 
Blow 
This place about to blow 
Blow 
This place about to blow 
Blow 
This place about to blow 
Blow 
This place about to—
Go-go-go-go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them Hands
Let me, let me see them Hands
Go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them Hands
Let me, let me see them Hands 
We're taking over 
Get used to it, okay?
This place about to blow 
Blow 
This place about to blow 
Blow 
This place about to blow 
Blow 
This place about to blow 
Blow 
This place about to—
