Aye, Torero, she is here
Aye, matador
I feel her eyes
They are wide with excitement and fear
I feel her heart for it cries when the horns are too near
I will be bold, brave, and swift will I be and I will be numero uno, torero fino. She'll dream tonight of me
Ole, ole, ole! 
Viva el matador!
Ole, ole, ole! 
Viva el matador!
Aye, Torero, she is here
Aye, matador
I see her smile and I see there's a reason she came
Toro, come closer
Come here and I'll whisper her name
You may be brave and as bold as you're black, but I will be numero uno, torero fino, toro come back
Ole, ole, ole! 
Viva el matador!
Ole, ole, ole! 
Viva el matador!
Ole, ole, ole! 
Viva el matador!
Ole, ole, ole! 
Viva el matador!
Toro, aqui. Closer, closer, closer
