White lies in her blue eyes
Goodbye is on the way
White lies in her blue eyes
Evil's the game she plays
Well, she's trying to tempt you
With her music and her line
Well, her lips look so inviting
And those sultry eyes
They get to shine
Oh, but look a little deeper
At all that come on stare
Then you might be able
To see what's lying there
It's those
White lies in her blue eyes
Goodbye is on the way
White lies in her blue eyes
Evil's the game she plays
Don't you ever
Let her get to you
The way that she got to me
Though the signs were plainly written
I just didn't want to see
But she could do most anything
If you give her time
A living testimonial
Don't make me color blind
There are
White lies in her blue eyes
Goodbye is on the way
White lies in her blue eyes
Evil's the game she plays
White lies in her blue eyes
Goodbye is on the way
White lies in her blue eyes
Evil's the game she plays
White lies in her blue eyes
Goodbye is on the way
White lies in her blue eyes
Evil's the game she plays
White lies in her blue eyes
Goodbye is on the way
White lies in her blue eyes
Evil's the game she plays
