The way I like it
Is when you ask me to hold you tonight
When I wake up next to you ooh oh
Being with you it gets me by
Let me hold you closer
When I stress you out don't be afraid
Tell me baby you really need to work it out
And show me your ways
You need to know I notice it's what you got
But then you feel like that is not enough
You need to know I know that what you got is
Is what I need is what I need
Slow down and turn around
And let me see the way you work it
Did you know you are the one for me
Wanna hold you forever together we share this love, this love
Now let me show you how I feel my love
I always want you next to me my love
I wanna show you how I'll be my love
I wanna be your everything my love
 x2
Its elementary the way you were sent to me
1s and 2s and I love you's and
The way you walk the way you groove
Makes me wanna sing to a different tune and
You need to know its those things you do
That got me locked me into you is
What drives me to be the dude thats lovestruck
By you my hearts for you and only you
Dont think you notice
That what you got is all I need
That what you got is all I need
