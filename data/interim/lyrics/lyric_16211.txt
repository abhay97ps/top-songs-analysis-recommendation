Mmmm
Hey, baby
It's you I truly adore
I finally found the peace of never wanting more
Singing a sweet song
Of who and where I belong
I see a vision of a love
That's more than strong
I feel so fine, truly divine
My dream has come to life, hey yeah
You're always there on my mind
Cause when I need two arms that can hold me tight
A tender loving kiss that can make it right
Someone to chase the darkness into the light
I know it's true
Baby, there's none better than you
Cause my love is true
Ooh
Oh, my dear
I can't say the way that I feel
You're more than words
You're more than pictures can reveal
Sugar is sweet
But with you
It's hard to believe
There's nothing to compare
You're all I want and need
Eternally
I'm gonna see all that love can be
Yeah, yeah
Heaven has given to me
Hold me tight
Can make it right
Someone to chase the darkness into the light
I know it's true
Yeah, yeah
Baby, there's none better than you
And I know in time
Our hearts will be together
I see your smile and I see forever
Baby, baby
And our love is true
Ooh!
There's no one better, oh
There's no one better than you
Cause when I need two arms that can hold me tight
A tender loving kiss that can make it right
Someone to chase the darkness into the light
I know it's true
Baby, there's none better than you
Cause when I need two arms that can hold me tight
A tender loving kiss that can make it right
Someone to chase the darkness into the light
I know it's true
Baby, there's none better than you
Cause when I need two arms that can hold me tight
A tender loving kiss that can make it right
Someone to chase the darkness into the light
I know it's true
Baby, there's none better than you
