Speaking of all those girls in love
With a guy in their eye, they're lookin' so adorable
Gee, I want one for me
Since the world's made of all those girls in love
It's a factuality one is bound to fall in love with me one day
You gotta live each day with this logical philosophy
Come with me; she'll come in time
'Cause I found out that love is not supposed to be mine
Till I find her & I'll find her
If I fall in love & the girl's in love
Then I wait for the day when I say that I'm thinkin' I do
If the girl's in love too
You gotta live each day with this logical philosophy
Come with me; she'll come in time
'Cause I found out that love is not supposed to be mine
Till I find her & I'll find her
If I fall in love & the girl's in love
Then I wait for the day when I say that I'm thinkin' I do
If the girl's in love too
