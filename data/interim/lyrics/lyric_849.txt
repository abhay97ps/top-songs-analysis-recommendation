No, No, No
Don't kiss me anymore
No, No, No
I told you once before
No, No, No
Don't kiss me anymore
No, No, No means Yes, Yes, Yes
I love you
And no one else will do
My heart sings
So never say we're through
Please tell me
Our love was meant to be
Please be mine
You know I love you
With all my heart
Please don't say that we will ever part
Your kisses thrill me when you are in my arms
Kiss me darling I'm lost in your charms
No, No, No
Don't kiss me anymore
No, No, No
I told you once before
No, No, No
Don't kiss me anymore
No, No, No means Yes, Yes, Yes
No, No, No
Don't kiss me anymore
No, No, No
I told you once before
No, No, No
Don't kiss me anymore
No, No, No means Yes, Yes, Yes
