I
Watch with open eyes
Till it's time
To take it all the way, hey
Everyday
The game is ours to play
Oh, tell me why
There are no alibis
'Cause winner takes it all
Loser takes a fall
Fight to the beginning of the end
Winner takes it all
Till he breaks the fall
In time he'll make it over the top
Hey
Hey
You listen when I say
There's a dream
Oh, that's comin' true today, yeah
Never turn away
When the challenge is alive
The choice is yours to make
In every chance you take
'Cause the winner takes it all
Loser takes a fall
Fight till the beginning of the end
Winner takes it all
Till he breaks the fall
In time he'll make it over the top
First the mind
Then the soul
And when the heart
Gets pumped up for the goal
There's no defeat
You'd sooner die
It's man to man
As we stand eye to eye
Oh, winner takes it all
Loser takes a fall
Fight till the beginning of the end
Winner takes it all
Till he breaks the fall
In time he'll make it over the top
Winner takes it all
Loser takes a fall
Fight till the beginning of the end
Winner takes it all
Till he breaks the fall
In time he'll make it over the top
Winner takes it all
Loser takes a fall
Fight till the beginning of the end
