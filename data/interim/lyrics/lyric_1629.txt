Do, dooby, dooby
Sha, la, la, la
Everyone in town
Just wants to put me down
With their rumors
They've been telling you
That your baby's been untrue
But it's rumors
Aw, people love to talk
Let them have their say
They can take a walk
We'll make out okay
Darling, this you must believe
I would never, never
Ever leave you
People jealous of a boy
And girl in love started rumors
Don't believe a word of
Those silly things you heard
They're just rumors
Aw, let the rumors fly
You'll find by and by
Deep within my heart
You're the only one that I adore
So don't believe the rumors anymore
Aw, let the rumors fly
You'll find by and by
Deep within my heart
You're the only one that I adore
So don't believe the rumors anymore
Do, dooby, dooby
Sha, la, la, la
