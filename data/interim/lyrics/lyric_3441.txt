I still love you even though I know I shouldn't
I still want you even though I know it wouldn't
Do me any good to say I love you more each day
For I know now that your love for me has gone astray
When I held you in my arms the other night
I could tell that something just wasn't right
My love for you was not returned in that same old way
Then I knew that very soon there would come a day when I'd lose you
Oh, yeah - when I'd lose you
Everyone told me it would happen someday
But all I did was laugh and say
Now you're just jealous  'cause I've found a love that's true 
But now I realize that they were only trying to help me
When I held you in my arms the other night
I could tell that something just wasn't right
My love for you was not returned in that same old way
Then I knew that very soon there would come a day when I'd lose you
Oh, yeah - Oh, yeah - Oh, yeah - Oh Yeah ...
