Lil’ nigga, what? Shit
You got me fucked up, shit 
We gon' shoot that bitch up 
Ayy, I swear to God, bitch
Ayy, I shoot this bitch on the other night, they gon' let a shot off behind me
Don’t come back to the North
What the fuck they talkin' 'bout? They gon' let Lil Top in
Know I had my Glock out as soon as I walked in
Want you for to mouth off, I'm gon' let it spark then
I pull up with the top down with a dirty stick
And some shit to distribute
White or blue, cotton too
Demon baby inside that coupe
Masked down, tryna step on you
I want it all, that penny too
Bitch, move, I'm put this stick on you
That bitch get extra extensions too
Lowdown and dirty only way to do
Homeless shelter, they be servin' food
Mama can’t walk
Comе up to this house, shit, they gon’ servе her two
Catch him in that North, take his ass off
Fuck him, put him on the news
Diamonds in my mouth, screamin', pissed off
Bitch, I’m on them white and blues
Bootin' up, could barely chew
Fuck a nigga, shoot him in his ink
Molly came out pink
Blood in the streets 'til they gone, fuck the stink
Extinct, insta-kill
Brains left in the street when a nigga fuck with me
Had to leave somethin' up inside the North
Tryna rub off somethin’ that thug with me
Bitch, you must think that I'm a whore or somethin'
Hell the next time that he gon' see me
What the fuck they talkin' 'bout? They gon' let Lil Top in
Know I had my Glock out as soon as I walked in
Want you for to mouth off, I'm gon' let it spark then
I pull up with the top down with a dirty stick
And some shit to distribute
Get you a few, your mammy too
Cock it back and do that dude
No shell cases, he too improved
Made it out of middle school
By high, ain't have to point a tool
Niggas I been with 'fore introduced to you
Step on heroin and step on fools
Bitch, don't tell me what you gon' do
On that Eight, I'ma have 'em waitin' on ya
Get a bitch to build a case on him
Leave him stretched out on the state corner
To bury him, mom turned to a state loner 
Now you know you did that bad
Tryna beef, ain't even got no money
Now your family assed out in the inn 
She see I got that shit up in me
Now she want me to beat her in
Beefin' with my bitch, so how I'm comin'
I want you and your friend
Draco with a seventy-round drum in
Come out there and party in
4KTrey, bitch, you know that we the dumbest
Think not? We gon' fuck with somethin' then
What the fuck they talkin' 'bout? They gon' let Lil Top in
Know I had my Glock out as soon as I walked in
Want you for to mouth off, I'm gon' let it spark then
I pull up with the top down with a dirty stick
And some shit to distribute
Yeah, I'm passin' out these hollows to you and you
In the cut, dawg, that K, boy, and that Schedule II
With a dropout with his mop out
Tryna murder somethin' all he wan' do, yeah, gang, uh
