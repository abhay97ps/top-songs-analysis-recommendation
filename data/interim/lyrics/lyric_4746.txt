Ooh
Lonely man am I
Ever since you said goodbye
Girl I know that I should have woke up
'Cause it seems now that we've broke up
Your farewell kiss is haunting me
My two lips cry out constantly
Let your heart ,let your heart be your guide
Forget about your foolish pride
Starting tomorrow I keep telling myself
I'm gonna get out and find me somebody else
Somebody thats sweet and kind
Who will erase you out of my mind
But tell me how can I find somebody new baby?
When my two arms keep reaching out for you
And my two lips keep right on repeating
Its you that I need, woah
You know that even when I close my eyes to forget ya
I see your face and your memories too
Girl I've never felt this lonelyness before
And whoa, girl I just can't take it no more
Every night a million tears I shed
Girl I'm only goin out of my head
Just take a good look and you'll see
What this loneliness is doin' to me
Ooh dont you know that its you that I need 
Oh I can't take this loneliness, 
Awww baby I need ya, 
Oooooh
Some fool im gonna be no more
'Cause I'll soon be knockin', knockin' on your door
Gonna get down on my bended knees
Beg and plead girl come back to me
It's you that I need 
Girl it's you that I need 
Girl take a good look and you'll see a
What does this loneliness
