Nah, nah, nah
Nah, this can't be true
I got this feeling, and I just can't turn it loose
That somebody's been getting next to you
I don't want to walk around knowin' I was your fool
'Cause being the man that I am, I just can't lose my cool
My friends keep telling me about the things that's going on, babe
But deep in my heart, baby, I hope that I'm wrong
Yes, I hope I'm wrong but I know it, babe
Somebody's sleeping in my bed, my bed, baby
Somebody's takin' my place, baby
Somebody's sleeping in my bed, baby
And you know just what I mean, oh oh oh oh oh
I come home early expecting your warm embrace
But something is wrong 'cause it's written all over your face
It hurt so bad when I walk through the door
But 'ya know one damn thing, baby
I ain't coming back no more, no no no
Now don't try to tell me things are still the same, yeah
'Cause when we made love, I heard you call out his name
Call out his name
Somebody's sleeping in my bed tonight, baby
Somebody's taking Sisqo's place
Somebody's sleeping in my bed, baby
Somebody's taking my place, yeah
Girl, I want you to know
I gave you money and every li'l thing that you need
I gave you the world 
'Cause you were my girl 
But you still ran out on me, oh yeah
Somebody's sleeping in my bed, baby
Said you're sleeping in my bed
Messin' with my head, ooh
Somebody's taking my place
Tell me why, oh why oh why
Why oh why oh why
Why oh why oh why oh why oh why
Somebody's sleeping in my bed, baby
I said you're sleeping in my bed
Messin' with my head
Somebody's takin' my place
Oh yeah, mmm
Now if you truly love me 
Then this would not be happenin'
Sleepin' in my bed, messin' with my head
Oh no no no no, gotta let you go
Yes I do, baby, babe
Why'd you do it to me?
Why'd you do it?
I don't wanna be a fool no more
