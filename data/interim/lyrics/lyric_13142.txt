Turn around
Look at what you see
In her face
The mirror of your dreams
Make believe I'm everywhere
I'm hidden in the lines
Written on the pages
Is the answer to a neverending story
Ah
Reach the stars
Fly a fantasy
Dream a dream
And what you see will be
Rhymes that keep their secrets
Will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon a rainbow
Is the answer to a neverending story
Ah
Story
Ah
Show no fear
For she may fade away
In your hand
The birth of a new day
Rhymes that keep their secrets
Will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon a rainbow
Is the answer to a neverending story
Ah
Neverending story
Ah
Neverending story
Ah
Neverending story
Ah
