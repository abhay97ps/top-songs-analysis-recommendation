I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
’Cause my roots, they run deep, oh
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
I know it, I know it
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ”You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed
’Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, “You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Still rise
Don't be surprised, I will still rise
