Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed 
Louder 
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher 
It's like standing in the ocean
We just rocked Coachella, I gave her half of the check
It was good sex, honorable mention to the neck
Didn't pass the loud, that was out of respect
Afterwards, pass the towel, I was out of Kleenex
If you take your girl out, do you expect sex?
If she take her titties out, do you expect checks?
First visit, I gave her a pearl necklace
Next visit, I'ma need your girl naked
Took a church visit, you know, 'cause the world hectic
Like floating, if I can't be in time
I don't know, I don't know 
In the ocean, if I can't be loved
I don't know a sound
Standing in the ocean 
Just let this wash on me 
Bad memories like waves
Echoing , echoing
Standing in the ocean
Standing in the ocean
Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed
