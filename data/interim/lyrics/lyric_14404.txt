Late night my mind is driftin'
Stressin' and overthinkin'
I got some shit that’s on my mind
Deep thoughts are creepin'
I’m thinkin' bout my family
Contemplatin' decisions
And hope the ones I pick pertain to my vision
But now these voices in my head
Man I don’t know who to trust
The world keep changin' everyday
And I’m just tryna adjust
Feelin' the pressure like a diamond that come out from the rough
I think I need to talk to God cuz I don’t do it enough
But I know that
I’m not perfect
I’m still workin'
Been diggin' deep for my purpose
I’m growin'
Still learnin'
Fire inside of me burnin'
I’m really just tryna make this shit work
Push problems to my side, but it still hurt
Smile on my face
But I’m cut deep
That explains why
I get no sleep
Umbrellas don’t stop the rain like
Teardrops don’t stop the pain
Gotta stay up despite the change and
Keep straight never switch lanes
And never complain about the life I was given
Pray that all of my sins are forgiven
Been buildin' faith from the very beginning
I just want my dreams to all come to fruition
You wanna go deep, I'll take you deep
You wanna go deep, I'll take you deep
You wanna go deep, I'll take you deep
You wanna go deep, I'll take you deep
I used to be a Christian, now I'm wishing
That my daddy daddy daddy never came without permission
See I'm missing all the points where my bible really different
Coming to America?
More like coming to a prison
Shout out Issa cause a negro really bright cause of my prism
1864 good riddance
Now I'm supposed to celebrate these people Christmas?
I think I'll settle for taking they white women
I really moved to the meadows
Next to all these nice fellas
DBT found my levels
I stopped recording in the ghetto
Keep the purple flag Donatello
But I still feel like Michelangelo
Hoes blow my kazoo
I play the banjo
Don't activate my whole bando
Not Good Enough, so I'm signing up
My head ain't been
Touched in months
Come line me up
Next chance I get I'm taking drugs
I'm either popping something or I'm taking slugs
I'm hella young, but hella sprung
These hoes hate me, they hella dumb
But then again these hoes is hoes
And we all know they eat hella cum
All this pressure on me, hope I turn into a diamond
Honestly I'm really pissed I should've fucked ****
Kicked out of school because of ****, should've fucked ****
Oh my God
Why the fuck you lying?
All these damn bars, boy who are you supplying?
Maybe Lucifer himself
Shit they thought I was a Zion
Read the Bible more than you
In fact I read some of two
King James shit, the cult one too
They the same damn thing one just look brand new
What if I can't make it out of the basement?
A brand new slave in the making
Will I surpass my limitations?
Or just get lost in amazement
Am I really destined for greatness?
Cause I've been losing my patience
I can't even come up with a hit
Can I make it on to your playlist?
I just wanna transcend while I'm still young
Just starting to learning my lessons and the reasons we conform
Since '98 still a baby, but my growth was for real stunted
By a fear of failure 'til Kru came with the pills fronted
My homie fronted me courage
So I took it to the stove, rocked it up
And whipped the beat like some porridge
I quit recording with the vocals distorted
I swore on life Growth was gorgeous
But your reaction only made me discouraged
Shit got me devastated
I put my pen to my pad
People say that I'll never make it
I've been dreaming too many dreams
I guess it's time to wake up
I ain't never been hated on
Ain't got enough credentials
Better put your brain to the pencil and draw you a picture
Now you're living without a stencil
Cause there ain't shit given
And ain't shit written in your story
Got to make a living
Get in the system and make em listen
Make em pay attention
Better get your ass on a stage and get your recognition
Let everybody know the Sage has got a pot to piss in
And when they hear ya make them wonder
"How the hell we miss him?"
He kept talking about his dreams, so we just had to diss him
Man when he's gone we'll miss him
But I've got a lot to learn before I get to that level
And I've realized that I'm standing toe to toe with the devil
And I know this is a Long Cold Journey to shuttle
But when I finally make it there will be no more rebuttal
And no more shit to shovel
But yo the struggle is hard
I put my life in these measures for y'all to go and judge the bars
That's just opening scars
And realize that this life is hard, but it's all that want
I've been counting my tarot cards and I'm all down to one
I'm all out of luck and all out of fun
And since Imma plan for the future
Keep my eyes on the sun
No surprise when I'm done, but I will shed my eyes If I'm on
Never mixing lies in my songs
So I'll never hit number one
And I know I'm not good enough
I'm just trying to be versatile
Putting everything I've got into these verses now
So imma let you hold me low 'til I can hold it down
Cause I was born to be the king
I'm fixed to grow into the crown
But now I'm starting where the lords can't see
Where the homeless can't eat
And where the peasants can't sleep
Dreaming big about a world where the change on me
Too far from where I want to be
Man shit get deep
You wanna go deep, I'll take you deep
You wanna go deep, I'll take you deep
You wanna go deep, I'll take you deep
You wanna go deep, I'll take you deep
