I walk downtown in my broke down shoes
To the side street pub with the bar band blues
Take a backseat at the front door table
Order me a Bud and a shot of Black Label
Closed this place down once again
Sitting here wishing you would walk right in
Down my shot, shoot my beer
I have to got to go home but I cannot stay here
It is a short, short walk down to my second home
But that boulevard gets longer when you are walking back alone
And I do not know where you might be
Wherever it is, it will be without me
I keep thinking I will come home
One day and find you
Long as I got that neon light
Shining like a beacon in the night
I know I can make it downtown by myself
Because if you do not know where you are going
You might end up somewhere else
Kicking off my shoes, tumbling through the front door
Knowing too well the kind of night I am in for
Cubs got beat again on Sports Center
My bedroom is cold as my TV dinner
One more cigarette and I will kill the light
And I will lay there wishing you were sleeping at my side
And I do not know where you might be
Wherever it is, it will be without me
I keep thinking I will come home
One day and find you
Long as I got that neon light
Shining like a beacon in the night
I know I can make it downtown by myself
Because if you do not know where you are going
You might end up somewhere else
And I do not know where you might be
Wherever it is, it will be without me
I keep thinking I will come home
One day and find you
Long as I got that neon light
Shining like a beacon in the night
I know I can make it downtown by myself
Because if you do not know where you are going
You might end up somewhere else
Ah, somewhere else
You might end up somewhere else
Somewhere else
Hey
