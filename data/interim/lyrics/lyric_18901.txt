Real love  true love 
Tainted love  real love 
True love  tainted love 
Real love  true love  real love
Think of her think of me
Think about us, it's a intimacy
I'm trying to strum like guitars in this beat
And consider riding she'll kick the blahzay spleen
Plus you got a man, but he ain't quite me
The type of man that try to give you what you need
And he wanna know where you are, where you be
Where you going, where you stay, where you subject to be, damn
If I was him I wouldn't even leave
I would trust you what you say that you are where you be
Say he the type of nigga that's hella cheap
Take his girl on a date and they go to Mickey D's
See, I'm the type that try to stab in a jeep
Try to take you out to see things and occasionally creep
Yeah, your man is doing things I can't really see
Don't sound too good, it sound tainted to me
Real love  true love 
Tainted love  real love 
True love  tainted love 
Real love  true love  real love
How many years does it take for a record to blow?
I'm doing exactly how many licks it took for my hoes
Spending your cash flow cause she was so out ho
Scandal love, cause love full of scandal
Too much chick for that ass she couldn't handle that
Well it's the same tainted love in the music business
People they lose their brain just to get up in this
Let's be a star for a day, everything in life is just okay
People say things they don't really wanna say
Hey but it's okay, cause you're a star for the day
People'll smile at you when they really wanna frown
Well a that's just the way tainted folk get down
Just keep it real and, we'll see
When the situation is tainted love is always free
Love is always free
Real love, true love, tainted love, real love
True love, tainted love, real love, true love, real
You say you love me, but is it really real?
Would you, fix me green tea if I'm feeling ill
Could you, give me a back rub to sooth after a long day?
Dinner by candlelight but you're the main entree
And if so, I do the same with other treats to give you
Trailing rose pedals from your door to beneath your pillow
With a bucket of champagne on your night stand
Experience what some women won't in they lifespan
I'm sayin
Real love, real, real, everybody knows that love's real love
Someone to trust in you for real
Everybody need love; that's real
I would never want nothing tainted
Wait a minute, what you feel?
Faded if your loving was tainted
True, oh, I know true love is hard to find
Just let it find you; for real
If you found love to keep it real
Keep love from being tainted, being tainted
Oooh then you'll, be, alright
Then you'll, be, alright
