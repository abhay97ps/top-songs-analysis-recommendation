She's real fine, my 409
She's real fine, my 409
My 409
Well I saved my pennies and I saved my dimes 
For I knew there would be a time 
When I would buy a brand new 409 
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up 409 
Giddy up 409 
Giddy up 409 
Giddy up 40...
Nothing can catch her
Nothing can touch my 409 
When I take her to the track she really shines 
She always turns in the fastest times 
My four speed, dual quad, Posi-Traction 409 
Giddy up giddy up giddy up 409 
Giddy up 409 
Giddy up 409 
Giddy up 40...
Nothing can catch her
Nothing can touch my 409 
Giddy up 409 
Giddy up 409
