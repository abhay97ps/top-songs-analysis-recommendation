I can't do it by myself
I can't do it by myself
I need somebody else to help me
I need willing arms to share
And a loving heart to care
I just can't do it by myself
I wanna know just what a heart is for
And all the thrills that someone's kiss can bring
I wanna know just what love has in store
I wanna know so many things
I can't do it by myself
I can't do it by myself
I need somebody else to help me
I need willing arms to share
And a loving heart to care
I just can't do it by myself
The many wonders I have read of love
Have made me long to know that feeling too
But I find lonelieness instead of love
And though I've done
All I can do
I can't do it by myself
I can't do it by myself
I need somebody else to help me
I need willing arms to share
And a loving heart to care
I just can't do it by myself
I just can't do it by myself
I just can't do it by myself
