Hell naw we ain't forget how to do this shit
We still rich, bitch
World Tour
Milt tapped in, and he said he got two bitches for me
Whole lot of ice, lot of money, who gon' take it from me ?
You can keep that bitch, you can have her if you take her from me
I'ont love that bitch, hell nawl im just perky fuckin'
Since they say we demons, white buffs i got the horns on me
I then had this road for 12 months and yall still bummy
Dev bored as hell, man that nigga wanna kill somethin'
Fiends up early, up knockin' when the pills comin'?
Money feel good, goddamn my ex feel dumb
I dont want a hoe that be fuckin', need a real one
In the stu chillin', give a fuck about opinion
Thinkin' bout me, but im thinkin' bout a million
Eddie in a 'Vette, he just peeled off the ceiling
He then swiped six different cards in 10 minutes
Gang was sprayin' Ace at the room at 10 bitches
Dev sprayed the whole damn block with no witness
Road runner, thats the only time I get fitness
Lobster on my stomach, boy yo mama cookin' chitterlings
Askin' where I shop, lil nigga mind yo business
I then fucked a whole lot of hoes off of drippin'
I can't go broke, I'mma have a heart attack
They took my brother from me, They can't get my brother back
Cross state boys, we Jugg across the map
I ain't got a M, so I can't take a nap
