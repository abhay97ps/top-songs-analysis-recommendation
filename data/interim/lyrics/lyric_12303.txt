Ah, ah, ah, ah
 put on your red shoes and dance the blues
 to the song they're playing on the radio
 while colour lights up your face
 sway through the crowd to an empty space
If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms and tremble like a flower
 for fear your grace should fall
 for fear tonight is all
 you could look into my eyes
 under the moonlight, this serious moonlight
And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms and tremble like a flower
 put on your red shoes and dance the blues
 to the song we're playing
 under the moonlight, this serious moonlight
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
Let's sway
Let's sway
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
