All the way home 
All the way home
Crossroad, I know
Tonight somebody won't make it home
Out here on my own
Somebody tell me where I went wrong
I need ten of 'em
Too rich for that bullshit, all these niggas gonna make me tend to 'em
Nigga came up out the bullpen ridin' with a full clip, I say give it to 'em
I'm the one took that L
They who gained, they ain't win nothin'
Tryna get over his pain, leave a stain, okay
Caught a nigga lackin', got him 'round my way
I'ma move around, you just pull up and spray
Meet me in Vallеy Park, get the payment aftеr dark
Homicide ridin' down 38
Brainstorm at night, don't see nothing
Look for you at night, guess that love shit, it don't mean nothing
These killers with me, they mean all harm, oh
Lost in the streets and that shit taking my soul
They'll step on me, shit, that's for all that I know
Back against the wall, I'll blow my pole
Trapped, I ain't get no code
I don't owe them shit, probably owe my bros
My love on full, I'm fucking on her with no rubber
It's gutter, I struggled
I let her go shopping for me 'cause I know that it's all on the muscle
Teach you how to hustle
This Givenchy 'fit I got on that you bought me, these hoes love it
Brand-new whip, tell them people don't touch it
Fear of God on, they can't tell I'm clutching
I need ten of 'em
Too rich for that bullshit, all these niggas gonna make me tend to 'em
Nigga came up out the bullpen ridin' with a full clip, I say give it to 'em
I'm the one took that L
They who gained, they ain't win nothin'
Tryna get over his pain, leave a stain, okay
Maserati truck , I'm gone
Murder, I'ma pray that I make it back home
Dump dead, Q feel everything gone
Dave dead, I just want everybody gone
Late-night blues at the cemetery
Go and catch a body, I'll see you in Heaven
Northside 38, 4Trey steppin'
Green leave you red, that's flag activity
Stay sticked up, that's real infinity
Big bro chemist in the kitchen
Young bad bitch, I ain't got no chemistry
Gravedigger chain, that's history
I know for a fact broke niggas not feelin' me
Nigga, just keep your distance
I can bet a hundred racks that they plan on killing me
Fuck that, better yet, bet a million
All the way home
All the way home
All the way home
All the way home
Crossroad, I know
Tonight somebody won't make it home 
Out here on my own 
Somebody tell me where I went wrong
