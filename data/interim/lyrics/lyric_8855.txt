He came riding in on the sunrise
Of a hot west Texas day
A fancy man in a painted wagon
With some fancy things to say
Looks like you folks need some water
Well, water is my game
And for the small price of $100
I betcha I can make it rain
Step back, non believers
Or the rain will never come
Somebody start that fire a-burning
Somebody beat the drum
You know some may think
I'm crazy for making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over
You folks are gonna see some rain
They all just stood there a-staring
Trying to believe
But there was one named Lizzie Cooper
Who said he was a lying cheat
You say you call yourself a rainman
Well, you oughta be ashamed
Starting all these people dreaming
Thinking you can make it rain
Hey Lizzie
Well, a mans got to have a dream
And if you can't walk on the inside with me
I'll meet you in between
Oh, come with me, Lizzie
And the stars will write your name
And if you still think I'm lying to you
Look yonder
There comes the rain
