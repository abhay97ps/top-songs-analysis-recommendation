I double-cross you
And you get mysterious mail
I've tried hard not to shock you
It's hard not to
With the things I could say
Tell me why
Don't we try
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?
Why
Don't we try
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?
You lock your letters in a box
And you've hidden the key
I go one better
I'm indebted
To a contact magazine
Tell me why
Don't we try
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?
Why
Don't we try
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for us?
Everybody's got to live together
Just to find a little peace of mind there
If you give up your affairs forever
I will give up mine
But it's hard
So hard
I'm always hoping you'll be faithful
But you're not, I suppose
We've both given up smoking
'Cause it's fatal
So whose matches are those?
Tell me why
Don't we try
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?
We make it so hard
Tell me why
Don't we try
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard?
Tell me why
Don't we try
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves
We make it so hard for ourselves
We make it so hard
So hard
We make it so hard
