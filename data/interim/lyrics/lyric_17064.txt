Every window in my hometown is empty
And I really don't know why
And the house you used to live in
Is cold and falling down
And I am tired and I'm weary
And Lord those gray skies bring me down
And I came home for just one reason
To find myself in this quiet town 
And I'm thinking. . 
Oh I'm thinking time's been my teacher
I don't want to leave you
So please give me one more try
I'm tired and I'm weary but I want you near me
So please give me one more try
Oh, just give me one more try
One more try
Oh I don't know where to go for
One more try
All the days we spent together doing nothing
It all seems so long ago
I thought the world turned around without me baby
But I just didn't know oh
That I was wrong to go and leave you
To go and leave your world behind
But now time has been my teacher
And now I finally found
Oh I'm thinking time's been my teacher
I don't want to leave you
So please give me one more try
I'm tired and I'm weary but I want you near me
So please give me one more try
Oh, just give me one more try
One more try
Oh I don't know what to do
One more try
