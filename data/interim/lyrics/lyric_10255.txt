Joey was pretty
Like the flowers he brought me
But just like those flowers
He faded away
Michael was witty
He almost caught me
Words without music
Got nothin' to say
Baby, you keep me dancin'
You are the number one song
Going 'round in my head
Baby, you keep me dancin'
Baby, hold me, hold me, love me, love me
Baby, just keep me dancin'
Listen to the beat of your heart now, baby
Listen to the beat of your heart now, baby
Johnny had money
He offered me diamonds
He said if I love him
He'd buy me the moon
But all of his money
Just couldn't buy me
The feelin' I get
When you play me your tune
Baby, you keep me dancin'
You are the number one song
Going 'round in my head
Baby, you keep me dancin'
Baby, hold me, hold me, love me, love me
Baby, just keep me dancin'
Listen to the beat of your heart now, baby
Listen to the beat of your heart now, baby
Listen to the beat of your heart now, baby
Listen to the beat of your heart now, baby
Give me your diamonds baby
Give me your gold
You are the treasure
Of love in my soul
You keep me dancin'
You are the number one song
Going 'round in my head
Baby, you keep me dancin'
You are the number one song
Going 'round in my head
Baby, you keep me dancin'
You are the number one song
Going 'round in my head
Baby, you keep me dancin'
Baby, hold me, hold me, love me, love me
Baby, just keep me dancin'
