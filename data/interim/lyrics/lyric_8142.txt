I raise my head in a touchy situation
Yes, I make my bed in the heart of the nation
I know its a trait of human love to make all the people holler
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Send them looking out for their woman
Send them reaching out for their dollar
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
A, hey, hey
Ooh, I'm rolling flowing through the whole population
Oh, the high and the low born are my friends and relations
I can bring you pain, I can bring you sudden pleasure
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Your life will only gain if your love's final measure
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Ah Mr. Mr. Skin, you know where you've been
Ah Mr. Mr. Skin, you know where you've been
Ah Mr. Mr. Skin, you know where you've been
