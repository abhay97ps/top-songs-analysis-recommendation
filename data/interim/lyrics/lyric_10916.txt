I've been saving the things you gave me
I've been holding 'em close to me
All the letters that said you loved me
And the picture of you holding me
And I've been meaning to call and tell you
After all that we've been through
I know what to do with the memories
But I found something here I can't use
What can I do with this broken heart?
And a goodbye that leaves me nowhere
What can I do with this broken heart?
And a love I can't get over
I remember the words that were spoken
How we used 'em so carelessly
What we thought would last forever
Ended so suddenly
So suddenly
What can I do with this broken heart?
And a goodbye that leaves me nowhere
What can I do with this broken heart?
And a love I can't get over
And a love I can't get over
Can't get over you
What can I do with this broken heart?
And a goodbye that leaves me nowhere
What can I do with this broken heart?
And a love I can't get over
I can't get over you
What can I do with this broken heart?
And a goodbye that leaves me nowhere
What can I do with this broken heart?
And a love I can't get over
I can't get over
Can't get over you
What can I do with this broken heart?
And a goodbye that leaves me nowhere
What can I do with this broken heart?
And a love I can't get over
