Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk
From a hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can you do?
Mmm
Tears from your little sister
Crying because
She doesn't have a dress
Without a patch for the party to go
But you know she'll get by
Cause she's living
In the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it
In the snow on the ground
You gotta walk into town to find a job
Trying to keep your hands warm
When the hole in your shoe
Let the snow come through
And chill you to the bone
Somehow you'd better go home where it's warm
Where you can
Live in a love of the common people
Smile from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can
Living on a dream ain't easy
But the closer the knit
The tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
Just to take 'em in stride for family pride
You know that faith is your foundation
With a whole lotta love
And a warm conversation
But don't forget to pray
Just making it strong where you belong
And we're living
In the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just
As much as she can
And she can
Yes, we're living
In the love of the common people
Smile's from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
Living in the love of the common people
Smile's from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
Living in the love of the common people
Smile's really hard on a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can
