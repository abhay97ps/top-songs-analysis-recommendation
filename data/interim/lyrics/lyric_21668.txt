In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
Butane in my veins, so I'm out to get the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spraypaint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stockcar flaming with a loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat
Someone came sayin' I'm insane
To complain about
A shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You got a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps for burning down the trailer park
Yo
Cut it!
Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
Forces of evil on a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with a phony gas chamber
Cause one's got a weasel and others got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folk singers slop
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck and it's hangin' from a pigeon wing
Ya' can't write if ya' can't relate
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax, fallen on a termite
Who's chokin' on the splinters?
Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby  so why don't you kill me
Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me 
Yo bring it on down
Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me
I'm a driver, I'm a winner things are gonna' change I can feel it
Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby  so why don't you kill me
Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
So why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby  so why don't you kill me
So why don't you kill me 
Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
So why don't you kill me?
