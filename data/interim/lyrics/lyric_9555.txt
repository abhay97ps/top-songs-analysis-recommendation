I'll play the fool for you, oh girl
If that will get me over
And I'm gonna go to school again, boy, for you
Just to get my equivalency diploma
There's nothin' honey, that I won't do
When I meet a guy lovely as you
Ain't it funny what a little love can do
Better than poison, so much stronger than glue
I'll be a joker for you, oh girl
Make you smile when you're feelin' blue
I'll grow a tail or two for you
Spend the rest of my days locked up in the zoo
'Cause there ain't nothin' doubtful daddy, that I won't do
When I meet a guy lovely as you
Ain't it
So much better than poison, stronger than glue, hey
When your body's close to mine, my baby, ooh
I get a feelin' that's so divine, ooh
Say, blows my mind
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, keep on dancin'
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, keep on dancin'
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, keep on dancin'
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, keep on dancin'
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, keep on dancin'
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, keep on dancin'
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, keep on dancin'
I'll play the fool for you, oh, girl
Buy you things that I cannot afford
Now that ya be a two for me, honey, honey, hey
Fix all the phones and lock all the doors
There ain't nothin' baby, that I won't ever do
When I meet a guy who is lovely as you
Ain't it funny, babe, what a little love can do
It is better than that poison, it's so stronger, stronger than glue
My love, ain't it, ain't it, ain't it kinda, ain't it kinda funny?
When I need to talk with  you
No baby, baby, can't ya see? I need you to love me
And always be by my side
Love me, baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Oh baby, my baby, yeah
