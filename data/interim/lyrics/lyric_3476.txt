Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever  when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight 
Fever in the mornin'
Fever all through the night
Sun lights up the day time
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right
You give me fever  when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight  
Fever in the mornin'
Fever all through the night, wow!
Everybody's got the fever
That is somethin' you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long time ago
You give me fever
Baby, turn on your lovelight 
Let it shine on me  
Well, baby, turn on your lovelight 
And let it shine on me 
Well, just a little bit higher 
And just a little bit brighter, baby 
Owww!
You give me fever, yeah , yeah 
You give me fever,  yeah , yeah 
You give me fever, yeah , yeah 
You give me fever
