Remember hallways, you're waiting always
To see behind the door
You never seen her, you're gonna meet her
The first time's so unsure
She smiles your way through a window
You smile right back, she runs away
You wish little girls'd sit still
Just a little bit longer, longer
And she's still a mystery to me
I thought, I'd grow up gracefully
I'd understand my woman thoroughly
But the more I see
The more, I see there is to see, there is to see
And she's still a mystery to me
She's still a mystery to me
I used to wonder when in thunder
Understanding's done
But now, I'm graspin'
That understandin' is only part of love
She'll smile your way through a window
You'll smile right back, she'll run away
You wish little girls'd sit still
Just a little bit longer, longer
And she is still a mystery to me
I thought, I'd grow up gracefully
I'd understand her thoroughly
But she's a mystery to me
But she's a mystery to me
And she's still a mystery to me
She's still a mystery to me
She is still a mystery to me, mm, hmm
