Oooh, you have won
Take my heart
I think about you night and day
Am I wrong in this game
Sometimes you seem so far away
And I'm longing for your touch
Darlin' don't leave me this way
Darlin' don't leave me at all
Ooh you're here
And you're there, everywhere
But I never know just where you're at
Do your eyes tell me lies
I thought that they were saying that
You were longing for my touch
Darlin' don't leave me this way
Darlin' don't leave me at all
You are the sweetest thing I found
In New York City 
You are the sweetest thing I found
In my life
You are the sweetest thing
I really think you're pretty 
You are the finest thing that's happened to my life
Oooh, you have won
Take my heart
I think about you night and day
Am I wrong  in this game
Sometimes you seem so far away
And I'm longing for your touch
Darlin' don't leave me  this way
Darlin' don't leave me at all
Please don't leave me now...
Darlin' don't leave me  this way
Darlin' don't leave me at all
Don't leave me oooh, don't leave me
Darlin', Darlin'
Please don't leave me
Darlin' don't leave me at all
Ah, ha ah, ha
