I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterdays
Those happy hours that we once knew
Though long ago, they still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart
I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterdays
 Those happy hours
 That we once knew
 Though long ago
 They still make me blue
 They say that time
 Heals a broken heart
 Time has stood still
 Since we've been apart
I said I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
Sing the song to me
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life of dreams of yesterdays
