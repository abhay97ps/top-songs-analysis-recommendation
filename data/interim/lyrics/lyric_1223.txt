Oh-oh-oh-oh
La, da da da
Hey, hey
I shouldn't have walked away
I would've stayed if you said
We could've made everything OK 
But we just threw the blame back and forth
We treated love like a sport
The final blow hit so low
I'm still on the ground
I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall
Shattered in pieces, curled on the floor
Supernatural love conquers all
'Member we used to touch the sky
And lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
C'mon, babe, can't our love be revived?
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge just trying to survive
As the angels cry
I thought we'd be forever and always 
You were serenity, you took away the bad days
Didn't always treat you right, but it was OK
I do somethin' stupid and you still stay with me 
But you can only go for so long
Doing the one you claim to love wrong
Before too much is enough
You look up, find your love gone, and...
We were so good together
How come we could not weather
This storm and just do better?
Why did we say goodbye?
'Cause lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you  and I said goodbye 
I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
Baby, I'm missing you
Don't allow our love to lose 
We gotta ride it through
Ooh, I'm reaching for you
And I'm gonna say
Baby, I'm missing' you
Don't allow our love to lose 
We gotta ride it through 
I'm reaching for you
And I'm gonna say
Lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
'Cause true love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
Oh, babe, don't let angels cry
