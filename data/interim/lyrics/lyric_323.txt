Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
The air is so clear that it's fuckin me up
I can only breathe with smoke inside of my lungs
Im a city kid, ashes be the place i grew up
And im insidious, bodies i be baggin em up
The air is so clear that it's fuckin me up
I can only breathe with smoke inside of my lungs
Cuz im a city kid, ashes be the place i grew up
And im insidious, bodies i be baggin em up, yup
I woke up with a horrible sore throat oh the irony
I overused my robitussin supply to get high and now
I could actually use some, but i really have no drugs
Except for my medicine, my downers
My downers got me lower than some stepped over flowers and collapsed aegis towers, lost my mojo like im austin powers
Often lost in thought in showers, mind wobblin hours, charles darwin empowering athiests and they prowess for pretension apprehension
In detension that dimension's where i stay far from the fuck shit
I dont stay in line i just fly to the front bitch
I dont got no mind im just alive so i function
Meaning machine lurkin in the submarine
Pullin up w my team, bubbles and blowin steam
Be yourself cuz im nobody else
Nicotine scream keep my thoughts to myself
I dont like days i be asleep until twelve
Ion like nights cuz its me and myself
Ion like anything all on my own
Keep a couple a people chillin up in my home
I got no energy left like im a cellular phone
But id give it all out baby come and chill in my home
The air is so clear that it's fuckin me up
I can only breathe with smoke inside of my lungs
Im a city kid, ashes be the place i grew up
And im insidious, bodies i be baggin em up
The air is so clear that it's fuckin me up
I can only breathe with smoke inside of my lungs
Cuz im a city kid, ashes be the place i grew up
And im insidious, bodies i be baggin em up, yup
Fuck it up, april said, yea she gave me the go-ahead
Im goin in like motorhead, i motorize like mo-ped
Im sippin on some code red
It's christmas time  let's go sled
I do symphonies, yall solfege
And i can't fuck im so dead
Im done with these guests get out of my gingerbread house
It's just me and my lizards cuz that's what im about
Im from boston like the scouts, so i got a badder mouth on me than yo baddest bitch, she can taste the rainbow like trout
Yall can freeze out in the cold being sour like kraut
You can send me them complaints, they's the ones im finna flout
Yea, im disrespectful, call myself out, im a lout
And im chillin with my reptilian posse such clout
I be holding it together, i dont even know how
I just try to crack a smile, always bein foul
Cuz that's what im comfortable with
And i don't owe y'all shit
Yall don't even back me up when i fuckin need it
Clean air, nightmare, headaches bitch it ain't fair
Here for everybody like I'm all ears, wait there
Clean air, nightmare, headaches bitch it ain't fair
Here for everybody like I'm all ears, wait there
If you dont fuck with my friends u dont fuck with me
Wit my clique till the end like watching credits, b
Smokin pixels, bitch adam sandler
Im chillin in the burbs on fuckin chandler
Smokin spirit's in a macy's parking lot
Keep my fidelity low like how i like my songs
I dont got a nice mic you can hear all the pops
But if im trynna pipe yo bitch make that pussy pop
I been chillin in the dark cuz i like it
In the mall like a goth librarian
In the mall yea everybody starin
Cuz my hair dreaded all black what im wearing
Lipstick black, my baby taught me that
Hair half black, my baby did that
Hoodie all black, yea i designed that
My skirt matte black, ex bitch gave me that
Goth bitch yea the devil is my dad
Feel like marceline im a vampire bat
I be drinkin blood bet u never did that
Fuck yo bitch in the ass bet u never did that
Bitch i look like marla singer
Messy hair and cigarette
Your bitch ass really got no stinger
A wasp that imma split in half
Killin shit like opioids
Drippin like it's opium
I can see the stars when it's dark
Cuz im one of them 
Yea, yea
I can see the stars when it's dark
Cuz im one of them 
The air is so clear that it's fuckin me up
I can only breathe with smoke inside of my lungs
Im a city kid, ashes be the place i grew up
And im insidious, bodies i be baggin em up
