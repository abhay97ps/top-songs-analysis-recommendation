I thought for the rest of my life
You'd see me through it
Guess all along I knew it
Nothing mattered, everything was all right
When you saw to it
Before I knew it, you were
Gone, long gone
Ooh ooh
You said you would always be there
Well, I believed you
I was a fool to need you
Gave my love, then I gave you my heart
And then you flew it
Before I knew it
You were
Gone, long gone
Hard facing another day
Just crying the night away
Said more than I meant to say
When I knew that you were gone
Hard facing another day
Just crying the night away
Said more than I meant to say
When I knew that you were gone
Ahh ah ah ah ah...
Ahh ah ah ah ah...
Ahh ah ah ah ah...
Ahh ah ah ah ah...
Hard facing another day
Just crying the night away
Said more than I meant to say
When I knew that you were gone
Hard facing another day
Just crying the night away
Said more than I meant to say
When I knew that you were gone
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I thought for the rest of my life
You'd see me through it
Yes, all along I knew it
Didn't matter and it didn't seem right
And then you flew it
Before I knew it you were
Gone, long gone
Gone, long gone
You were
Gone, long gone
