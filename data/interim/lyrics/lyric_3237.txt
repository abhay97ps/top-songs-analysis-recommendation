Doo da doo doo doo doo da doo doo doo
Who is the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Rolling down the highway in my Jimmy hauling freight
From Chicago to St Louis Lord I see her every day
A double clutching weasel like me can hardly ever get a girl to look at him that way
Like the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Well what a girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
I bet it wouldn't take her very long to be gone
If someone would pull a dirty trick and take her hot pants away
I slow my Jimmy down to twenty that's how many wrecks I see there every day
Caused by the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
A doo da doo doo doo doo da doo doo doo
Doggone that girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Sleepy headed painter said the girl wasn't real better get the  on my way
On Route 66 from the billboard to Chicago
You'll find tiny pieces of my heart scattered every which a way
Shattered by the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
A doo da doo doo doo doo da doo doo doo dee da dee dee doo
