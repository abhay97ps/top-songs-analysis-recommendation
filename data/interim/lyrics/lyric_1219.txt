Anniversary, Anniversary
Tomorrow will be our anniversary
I'm so glad, so happy to know that your still mine
Congratulations, congratulations
Together we shared all the heartaches and the tears
And I hope it will last for a very long time
One, two, three years ago
That's when I fell for you
Four, five, six years will go by
And I promise to keep on loving you
Tomorrow will be our anniversary
I'm so glad, so happy to know that your still mine
Congratulations, congratulations
I love you
