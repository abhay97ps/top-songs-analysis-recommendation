Hey man I'm glad you asked
'Cause I know more about that than I want to
And I'll share it with you
If you don't work things out
And save your love somehow
You'll know it then
What it's like at the bitter end
First comes the downpour, an emotional uproar
Brought on by "don't love you anymore"
Followed by a slammin' door
Then ol' lonely moves in
And the hurt begins
That's what it's like my friend
If you let it come to a bitter end
If time were on my side
Then it would let me fly back to the night
Of our last fight
And I could hold my tongue
And hold on to the one I should've never let go
Then I wouldn't have to know everything about
The downpour, that emotional uproar
Brought on by "don't love you anymore"
Followed by a slammin' door
Then ol' lonely moves in
And the hurt begins
And that's what it's like my friend
If you let it come to a bitter end
First comes the downpour, an emotional uproar
Brought on by "don't love you anymore"
Followed by a slammin' door
Then ol' lonely moves in
And the hurt begins
That's what it's like my friend
If you let it come to a bitter end
Hey man I'm glad you asked
'Cause I know more about that than I want to
