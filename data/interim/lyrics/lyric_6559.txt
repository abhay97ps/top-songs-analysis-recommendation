Have you been around?
Have you done your share of comin' down
On different things that people do?
Have you been aware?
You got brothers and sisters who care
About what's gonna happen to you
In a year from now
Maybe I'll be there to shake your hand 
Maybe I'll be there to share the land 
That they'll be givin' away
When we all live together, we're talkin' 'bout together, now
Maybe I'll be there to shake your hand 
Maybe I'll be there to share the land 
That they'll be givin' away
When we all live together, we're talkin' 'bout together, now
Did you pay your dues?
Did you read the news
This morning when the paper landed in your yard?
Do you know their names?
Can you play their games
Without losin' track
And coming down a bit too hard?
Maybe I'll be there to shake your hand 
Maybe I'll be there to share the land 
That they'll be givin' away
When we all live together, we're talkin' 'bout together, now
Maybe I'll be there to shake your hand 
Maybe I'll be there to share the land 
That they'll be givin' away
When we all live together, we're talkin' 'bout together, now
Maybe I'll be there to shake your hand 
Maybe I'll be there to share the land 
That they'll be givin' away
When we all live together, we're talkin' 'bout together, now
Maybe I'll be there to shake your hand 
Maybe I'll be there to share the land 
That they'll be givin' away
When we all live together, together together
You know I'll be standing by to help you if you worry
No more sadness, no more sorrow, and no more bad times
Everyday comin' sunshine, everyday everybody laughin'
Walkin' together by the river, walkin' together and laughin'
Everybody singin' together, everybody singin' and laughin'
Good times, good times, everybody walkin' by the river now
Walkin', singin', talkin', smilin', laughin' diggin' each other
Everybody happy together, I'll be there to worry you if you need-a me
Call on me, call on me, call my name, I'll be runnin' to help you
Everybody walkin' by the river now, everyday everybody laughin'
Everybody singin' and talkin', smilin', laughin', diggin' each other
