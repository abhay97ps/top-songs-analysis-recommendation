Going to terry town
Everybody knows me there
I've been away too long in a concrete world
Where no one cares
So you say you've got a little bit lonely
It's a sign that can never change
I'll paint a patch of blue
On the weather beaten
Skies for you
Oh I'll make the sun come
Through for you, girl
You know I will
If you believe in love
Take my hand and come along
Loneliness never ends when you're
Living wherе you can't belong
Set your mind for a chance to bе happy
Let your heart find a way to love
I'll paint a patch of blue
On the weather beaten
Skies for you
I'll make the sun come
Through for you, girl
You know I will
I'll paint a patch of blue
On the weather beaten
Skies for you
And I'll make the sun come
Through for you, girl
You know I will
I'll paint a patch of blue
On the weather beaten
Skies for you
Hey I'll make the sun come
Through for you, girl
You know I will, you know I will
Oh, I'll paint a
Patch of blue on the
Weather beaten skies for you
