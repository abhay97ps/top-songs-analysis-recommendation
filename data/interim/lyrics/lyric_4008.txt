You go by with some other guy
While I stand here alone
You don't think that I should cry
But I'm not made of stone
And I can cry just like anyone can
And I can die just like anyone can
If you hurt me and you hurt me
Every time that you go by
And you are with another guy
It hurts me
Every time that I see you
It hurts me 'cause you know
How I need you so bad
You're the one love
That I ever had
Used to be just you and me
And no one else was there
Now you're gone, I'm all alone
And you don't even care
But I can cry just like anyone can
And I can die just like anyone can
If you hurt me and you hurt me
Every time that you go by
And you are with another guy
It hurts me
Every time that I see you
It hurts me 'cause you know
How I need you so bad
You're the one love
That I ever had
It hurts me
Every time that I see you
It hurts me
Don't you know how I need you
It hurts me
Every time that I see you
It hurts me
Don't you know how I need you
It hurts me
Every time that I see you
It hurts me
Don't you know how I need you
It hurts me...
