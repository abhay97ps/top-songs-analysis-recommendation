I don't want no one but you
Find no one else, my dear, will do
My darling you are my love
I swear by stars above
My turtle dove
My love for you
I can't hide
Could not even if I tried
You with your head full of curls
You are my girl
I tell the world
My love for you
I can't hide
Could not even if I tried
You with your head full of curls
You are my girl
I tell the world
Your lips look so tender
Here is my heart it's yours I surrender
You are the one I desire
You set my heart afire
Don't make me cry
Your lips look so tender
Here is my heart it's yours I surrender
You are the one I desire
You set my heart afire
Don't make me cry
