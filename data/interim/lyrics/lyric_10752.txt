I've got somethin', somethin' I want you to know
I've got somethin' I want you to know
I'm in love with you, darlin', 'cause you so good to me
And I feel that you need me, it's so plain to see
When I'm chained in my self pity, pity
Your tenderness sets me free and I
Feel that you're feelin' what I get to feelin'
Feel that you're feelin' what I get to feelin'
Feel that you're feelin' what I get to feelin'
For you, baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
Get it up, get it up, get it up, get it up
You just do everything like nobody else
And I need you, need you beside me, girl
I wanna give you myself
If I hurt you and you feel bad
Your lovin' ways makes me sad, I
Feel that you're feelin' what I get to feelin'
I feel that you're feelin' what I get to feelin'
