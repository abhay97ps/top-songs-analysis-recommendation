Boy walk in the spot, he's so fresh, and 
He got what he needs to impressin' 
Just look at the way that he dressin'
Ain't no question, chicks like, "Ooh!"
Girl walkin' the spot, she stop traffic 
She's blowin' your mind with her asset 
So Jessica Alba fantastic
Instant classic, boys like, "Oh!"

Maybe I can see us touchin' like that

"Stop talkin', let's get with it"

She said, "Then why you waiting?"
"No more deliberating, what you doin'? Let's get to it"
Just like that, they
Boy actin' as if there's no pressure 
He do anything to get with her 
He say anything to convince her
Money spent too, diamonds send her 
Girl playin' it cool, but she's with it 
She lovin' the fact that she's gifted 
Everything he do, she gets lifted
Feels so wicked lovin' like, oh

Just like that, they
One night with you 
Boy, just one night with you 
All the things we could do
Every day I think of
One night with you

All our dreams would come true 
If we'd just get together 
Maybe I can see us movin' like that 
Maybe I can see us touchin' like that
