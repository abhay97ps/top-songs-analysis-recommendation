All that style, all gone to waste
All that beauty
But you never show your face
I'm going to make my way to you
Knock down your door and walk on through
I'm impatient, times a wasting
Girl, if you give me an occasion
I'm going to rise to it
You know I really can do it
I'm going to rise, I'm going to rise
I'm going to rise to it
When you're lying next to me
Baby, I can guarantee
I'm going to rise to it
Listen
I'll give you fever, I'll give you chills
Make you a believer
Well, baby, baby, I'm going to break your will
A little danger, a little fun
We're going take them one by one
Walk the wire of desire
And if you dare to take it higher
Hey, get up, lights, camera, action
It's getting time for the show
Because tonight you're the main attraction
And if you want a lover who can play the other role
I'm going to, I'm going to
You know I really can do it
I'm going to rise to it
You know I really can do it
I'm going to rise to it
I'm going to rise, I'm going to rise
I'm going to rise to it
