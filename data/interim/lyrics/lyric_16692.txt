Girl you take my breath away and when I'm with someone new
I'd rather be here with you baby, forever
My heart belongs to you 'cause I think about you all the time
I know my love is true when we're together
I've played around girl and I made you cry
When I looked up, you were saying goodbye
I'm begging you please, I need you so bad
Don't leave me now, you're the best that I've had
I've never, I'll never find someone like you, I promise it's true
No I'll never, I'll never find someone like you
Girl I love the way that you are, girl I won't, no I won't let you go
No one could ever do the way I would make love to you
All I have is just my heart and my feelings, I give to you
That's all that I can do, give you forever, oh oh oh
You don't know that you're hurting me 'cause it's not just a sexual thang
I want to share my dreams, baby together
Girl, I'm afraid just to give you the love
My heart's still in need to hold back on my love
But when you get close, I just want you to know
I start to get weak I can't let you go
I've never, I'll never find someone like you, I promise it's true
No I'll never, I'll never find someone like you
Girl I love the way that you are, girl I won't, no I won't let you go
No one could ever do the way I would make love to you
Just your smile, tenderness
Girl, I won't let you down, won't let you down
Girl, I will never find no one that compares to you
Never find anyone
I've never, I'll never find someone like you, I promise it's true
No I'll never, I'll never find someone like you
Girl I love the way that you are, girl I won't, no I won't let you go
No one could ever do the way I would make love to you
I've never, I'll never find someone like you, I promise it's true
No I'll never, I'll never find someone like you
Girl I love the way that you are, girl I won't, no I won't let you go
No one could ever do the way I would make love to you
