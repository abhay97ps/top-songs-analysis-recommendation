There's a food goin' around that's a sticky sticky goo
Oh well it tastes real good, but it's so hard to chew
All my friends tell me that they dig it the most
Early in the morning when they spread it on toast
I like peanut butter, creamy peanut butter
Chunky peanut butter too
C'mon now, take a lesson now
Open up your jar now
Spread it on your cracker now
Chomp now
I like peanut butter, creamy peanut butter
Chunky peanut butter too
Well, I went to a dinner and what did they eat
Ah-well, I took a big bite and it stuck to my teeth
Now everybody look like they got the mumps
Just-a eatin' peanut butter in-a great big hunks
I like peanut butter, creamy peanut butter
Chunky peanut butter too
I like peanut butter, creamy peanut butter
Chunky peanut butter too
