Oh, yeah
She's got a certain way about her
I don't think I could go
A day without her love
It's on the rise
Just like the morning sun
She gets me up
And the feeling's good
It lets me know I can't compromise
I tell you, there's
Different strokes for different folks
But for me, there's only one girl
She's my sunshine 
And she's so fine 
And I think of her every day
And all night, yeah
She's my sunshine 
And she's so fine 
And I just can't get that girl
Out of my mind, yeah
She makes it so nice on a rainy day
All of the clouds just go away
Her smile is shining bright
And every little single opportunity
I try to let her know
That she's the one for me
She's such a pretty sight
I tell you, there's
Different strokes for different folks
And for me, there's only one girl
She's my sunshine 
And she's so fine 
And I think of her every day
And all night, yeah
She's my sunshine 
Ooh, my baby's so fine 
And I just can't get that girl
Out of my mind, no, no, no
Ooh, she makes me happy
She gives me all the love that I need
And makes it snappy
She's my sunshine
When I'm feeling down
I just look around for my sunshine
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's my sunshine 
And she's so fine 
And I think of her every day
And all night, yeah
She's my sunshine 
Ooh, my baby's so fine 
And I just can't get that girl
Out of my mind
She makes every day
So bright in my world
She makes feel, oh, so bright
My girl
