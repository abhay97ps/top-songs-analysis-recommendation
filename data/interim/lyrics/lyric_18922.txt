Mmm, yeah
No-no-no-no-no
Yeah, oh
Hey, my baby, why you lookin' so down?
Seems like you need a lovin'
Baby, you need a girl like me around
Hey, my baby, tell me why you cry
Here take my hand and 
Wipe those tears from your eyes
Can I talk to you 
Comfort you 
Let you know 
I care for you
Can I talk to you? 
Comfort you 
Let you know 
I care for you
Hey, sexy baby, why'd your girl leave you in pain?
To let a fine man like you go, she must be insane
Hey, sexy baby, there's no need to worry, no
Oh, boy, if you call on me
I'll come, I'll come in a hurry
Can I talk to you 
Comfort you 
Let you know 
I care for you
I love you, yes, I do
Can I talk to you 
Comfort you 
Let you know 
I  care for you 
Hold on 
Stay strong 
Press on 
I care  for you 
Hold on 
Stay strong 
Press on 
I care for you 
Can I talk to you? 
Comfort you 
Let you know 
I care for you 
Can I talk to you?
