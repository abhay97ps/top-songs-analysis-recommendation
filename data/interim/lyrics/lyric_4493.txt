There should be a holiday for clowns
There should be a big parade downtown
So girls like you could see
What fools you've made of guys like me
A day that clowns don't have to hide
The feelings that they have inside, oh
There should be a holiday for clowns
A day for guys like me to paint the town
Festive clown affair
To make believe that we don't care
A special day, a holiday for clowns
Time after time I have tried to say goodbye to you
But somehow when I try to leave you
I just can't go; I love you so
If there could be a holiday for clowns
I would lead the big parade downtown
And see you standing there
And tell myself that I don't care
But we both know that that's not true
Tomorrow I'll be back lovin' you, oh
There should be a holiday for clowns
There should be a big parade downtown
If I could have my way
Just once a year, there'd be a day
A special day, a holiday for clowns
A special day, a holiday for clowns
