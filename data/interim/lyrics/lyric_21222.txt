Down a back road
Long, hot summer
A couple kids running loose and wild
He kissed her
She said mister
Take an inch and I'll give you a mile
I ain't here to do anything half-way
Don't give a damn what anyone might say
I just wanna free fall for a while
That rebel moon is shining
Those stars burn like diamonds
Hell bent on chasing down that crazy spark
I'll follow you where you're leading
To the first sweet taste of freedom
You got me running, baby
Wild at heart
About midnight, he tells her
I ain't got no come-on lines
Well, I'll love you, or I'll try to
We got nothing to lose but time
Stick your hand into my back pocket
Light me up like a bottle rocket
I just wanna free fall for a while
That rebel moon is shining
Those stars burn like diamonds
Hell bent on chasing down that crazy spark
I'll follow you where you're leading
To the first sweet taste of freedom
You got me running, baby
Wild at heart
Oh-oh, alright
Tonight is telling us we're way too young
Oh-oh, that's alright
I've got forever on the tip of my tongue
That rebel moon is shining
Those stars burn like diamonds
Hell bent on chasing down that crazy spark
I'll follow you where you're leading
To the first sweet taste of freedom
You got me running, baby
Wild at heart
That rebel moon is shining
Those stars burn like diamonds
Hell bent on chasing down that crazy spark
I'll follow you where you're leading
To the first sweet taste of freedom
You got me running, baby
You got me running, baby
Wild at heart
Oh-oh, alright
