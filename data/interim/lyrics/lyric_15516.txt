Let's go
Break!
Boy, you've been running around too long
And I think that you're running out of time
No more jumping in and out of bed
It's time for me to draw the line
So you think that you can call me the only one
Then walk out the door
And you think that you can run around having fun
And come back for more
I think that you're living in a fantasy
It's gotta be them or me
So if you try it one more time
Baby, don't expect me to come running back
Running back to you
Then you'll think about love, all the good love I gave to you
I won't come running, running back to you
And I'll find someone, somebody else to give it to
Oh, oh.  Oh, oh
I won't come running back, I won't come running
Oh, oh.  Oh, oh
I won't come running back, I won't come running
Boy, hope you see before too late
I won't play the fool, no, not this time
I'll show you just how wrong you are
To think I just can't get you off my mind
So you think that you can call me the only one
Then walk out the door
And you think that you can run around having fun
And come back for more
I think that you're living in a fantasy
It's gotta be them or me
And if you diss me once more
Baby, don't expect me to come running back
Running back to you
Then you'll think about love, all the good love I gave to you
I won't come running, running back to you
And I'll find someone, somebody else to give it to
Oh, oh.  Oh, oh
I won't come running back, I won't come running
Oh, oh.  Oh, oh
I won't come running back, I won't come running
You can't just diss me when you wanna
Or come and go when you wanna
I hear you're playing around when you wanna
Anytime that you wanna
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Or just tell me lies when you wanna
I got more than you wanna.  
Oh, and by the way, this one's for you
I won't come running back, I won't come running, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I won't come running back, no.  I won't come running
 Running, running, running, running
Running, running, running
I won't come running, running back to you
Then you'll think about love, all the good love I gave to you
I won't come running, running back to you
And I'll find someone, somebody else to give it to
Oh, no.  I won't come running back, I won't come running
No, oh no.  I won't come running back, I won't come running
Running back to you.  No, no, no
