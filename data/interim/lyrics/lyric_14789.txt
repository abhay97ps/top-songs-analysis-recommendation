I'm driving home from work
Knowing you're not there
I used to hurry home
Now I don't even care
The sun is in my eyes, so I can't see
But when it sets down behind the mountain it's gonna be
My first night without you
My first night without you
My first night without you, oh
Oh, without you
I sit here like a fool
Remembering everything
The way we used to talk
The songs that we used to sing
I gotta to try and leave the past behind
But my memory's so good
I think that I'm losing my mind
My first night without you
My first night without you
And I wonder what I'll do, oh
Oh, without you
Will I be able to sleep?
Will I lie in my bed and weep?
What if I forget and reach for you?
Will I dream about you?
My first night, my first night
My first night without you
My first night without you
And I wonder what I'll do, oh
My first night, my first night
My first night, my first night
My first night without you, oh
My first night without you...
