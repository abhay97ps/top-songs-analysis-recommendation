She loves her man
And lets him know every way she can
Soul on soul, hand in hand
Together
She knows his mind
Every way, all the time
Soul on soul, hand in hand
Together 
Mmm, oh yeah
She stands along
All the way, right or wrong
'Cause one and one, twice as strong, yeah
Together
She
She
She's a woman
She
She
She
She
