If only you believe like I believe, baby 
We'd get by
If only you believe in miracles, baby 
So would I
If only you believe like I believe, baby 
We'd get by
If only you believe in miracles, baby 
So would I
I might have to move heaven and earth
To prove it to you, baby 
So we're making love
And you feel the power
And I feel the power
Then there's really nothing we can't do
If we wanted to, baby
We could exist on the stars
It'd be so easy
Now, baby
All we gotta do 
Is get a little faith in you 
Oh, I've been so many places
I've seen some things 
I know love is the answer 
Keeps holding this world together, yeah
Ain't nothing better
Ain't nothing better 
And all the answers to our prayers
Hell, it's the same everywheres, baby 
Nothing ever breaks up the heart 
Only tears give you away 
Then you're right where I found ya 
With my arms around ya 
O-o-o-o-o-o-oh, baby
Baby, baby
Love is a magic word, ooh, yeah 
Few ever find in a lifetime
But from that very first look in your eyes
I knew you and I had but one heart 
Only our bodies were apart 
That was so easy 
So easy 
I had a taste of the real world 
When I went down on you, girl
Oh, if only you believe like I believe, baby 
We'd get by
If only you believe in miracles, baby 
So would I
If only you believe like I believe, baby 
We'd get by
If only you believe in miracles, baby 
So would I
I can hear windmills and rainbows
Whenever you're talkin' to me 
I feel like swirling and dancin'
Whenever you're walking with me 
You ripple like a river when I touch you 
When I pluck your body like a string 
When I start dancin' inside ya 
You make me wanna sing 
Yeah 
Baby 
Baby 
Baby 
Baby 
Oh, yeah 
All right 
Baby, we're sure doin' it tonight 
Every time you come by, let me try 
Pretty please with sugar on it
That's how I like it, ooh
I can't even believe it with you
It's like having every dream I ever wanted come true 
I picked up your vibes
You know, it opened my eyes 
But I'm still dreamin', yeah 
And you're right where I found ya 
With my arms around ya 
Oh, if only you believe like I believe, baby 
We'd get by
If only you believe in miracles, baby 
So would I
If only you believe like I believe, baby 
We'd get by
If only you believe in miracles, baby 
So would I
So would I
So would I
Oh, if only you believe like I believe, baby 
We'd get by
If only you believe in miracles, baby 
So would I
If only you believe like I believe, baby 
We'd get by
If only you believe in miracles, baby 
So would I
