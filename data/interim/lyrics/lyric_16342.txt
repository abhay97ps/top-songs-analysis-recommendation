U send me swingin'
Oh u send me swingin'
I wait for the day
A sweet, gentle sway
Rocks your love right my way
Oh you send me swingin'
U send me swingin'
Oh U send me swingin'
I never thought I really find
Someone so beautiful and kind
Oh what you've done to me
With just the little things you do
You've got me crazy over you
And it's getting stronger
When I'm with you
I fall deeper in love
Swingin'
This feeling is the one thing my heart is sure of
So I...
Just thinking 'bout you
And all the things that we could do
If only you could see
How sweet your love is to me
So Heavenly
No other way
To say just how I feel for you
Swingin'
See everyday that passes
My heart swings closer to you
When I'm with you
I fall deeper in love
Swingin'
This feeling is the one thing my heart is sure of
So I...
Oh you know you
Swingin' me
'Round and Round
My heart's
A joyful sound
Waiting for you
To come my way
I'll swing you, I'll swing you
My way
