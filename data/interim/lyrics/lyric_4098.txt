Run, run, look and see
Run, run, look and see
I thought I saw you yesterday
I could have sworn you'd passed my way
But it was too good to be true
And there was nothing I could do
CHORUS:
My heart says:
Run, run, look and see
Are my eyes just foolin' me?
While I'm runnin', I keep prayin'
All the time my heart keeps sayin':
Run, run, look and see
Run, run, look and see
Each time I hear our favorite song
I can't believe you're really gone
I hear your voice, I see your face
But then you're gone without a trace
My heart says
Run Run look and see
Are my eyes just foolin' me
While I'm runnin', I keep prayin'
All the time my heart keeps sayin'
Run run look and see
Run run look and see
Each time I see a crowd I stare
Just hopin' someday you'll be there
My heart says:
Run, run, look and see
Run, run, look and see
2:00
I hear your voice, I see your face
But then you're gone without a trace
My heart says
Run run look and see
Are my eyes just foolin' me
While I'm runnin', I keep prayin'
All the time my heart keeps sayin'
Run run look and see
Run run look and see
Run run look and see
