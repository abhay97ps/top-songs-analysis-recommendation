Ding dong, ding dong, ding
I call you ding-a-ling, ya, ya
Your my ding-a-ling
'Cause you've got everything
Every single thing
It takes to make us swing
Ah, ding-a-ling
When your near I hear bells that ring
I get a charge every time I'm in your arms
You're my ding-a-ling
Yes, I hear bells when you hold me tight
Bells, when we kiss goodnight
Bells, don't you hear 'em to
Beause I'm in love with you
Let's swell it now
Bells, mean a honeymoon
Bells, goin' hear 'em soon
I'm savin' up just to buy a wedding ring
Your my ding-a-ling
---- musical interlude ----
Cause you've got everything
Everything single it takes to make us swing
---- musical interlude ----
I get a charge every time I'm your in my arms
Your my ding-a-ling
"Everybody now"
Bells, when you hold me tight
Bells, when we kiss goodnight
Bells, don't you hear them to
Because I'm in love with you
"Just the girls now"
Bells, mean a honeymoon
Bells, gonna hear 'em soon
"Now it's the boys"
Bells, wedding bells will ring
Because your my ding-a-ling
"Ya, all together now"
Bells, when you hold me tight
Bells, when we kiss good night
Bells, weddin' bells will ring
Because your my ding-a-ling
"Once again now"
Bells, when you hold me tight....
