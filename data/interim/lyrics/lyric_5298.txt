Girl I love you, you know I do
And I do not doubt that you love me too
Aw but you're so young
Your life's just begun
Something tells me there'll come a day
When you just might wonder what slipped away
While you've been with me
And you will want to be free
So Shoot 'em up baby
Shoot 'em up baby
Shoot 'em up baby
Get on out and shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoota, shoota
Come on shoot 'em up baby, shoot 'em up baby
If I lost you now I would surely cry
But to lose you later, you know I'd die
Don't misunderstand
Girl I have nothing planned
You should go where the lights are bright
And make all the scenes and stay out all night
And have no fear
Girl I'll be right here
Shoot 'em up baby
Shoot 'em up baby
Shoot 'em up baby
Get on out and shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoota shoota
Come on shoot 'em up baby, shoot 'em up baby
Shoota, shoota, shoota, shoota, shoota, shoota
Shoot 'em up baby, shoot 'em up baby
Go on and spread your wings and fly
Try to touch the sky
But keep your powder dry
Shoot 'em up baby, shoot 'em up baby, shoot 'em up baby
Get on out and shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoota shoota
Come on shoot 'em up baby
Shoot 'em up baby
Shoot 'em up baby
Shoot 'em up baby
