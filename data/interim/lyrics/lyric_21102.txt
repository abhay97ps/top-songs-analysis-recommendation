Jai Ho! Jai Ho!
I got shivers
When you touch away
I'll make you hot, get all you got
I'll make you wanna say
I got fever
Running like a fire
For you, I will go all the way
I'm gonna take you higher
I keep it steady
'Cause steady is how I feel it
This beat is heavy, so heavy
You gon' feel it
You are the reason that I breathe
You are the reason that I still believe
You are my destiny 
Jai Ho, o-o-o-oh!
No, there is nothing that can stop us
Nothing can ever come between us
So come and dance with me
Jai Ho!
Catch me, catch me, catch me, come and catch me
I want you now
I know you can save me, come and save me
I need you now
I am yours forever, yes, forever
I will follow
Anywhere in anyway
Never gonna let go
Escape  away 
I'll take you to a place
This fantasy of you and me, I'll never lose the chase
I can  feel you 
Rushing through my veins
There's an ocean in my heart, I will never be the same
Just keep it burnin', yeah, baby
Just keep it comin'
You're gonna find out, baby
I'm one in a million
You are the reason that I breathe 
You are the reason that I still believe 
You are my destiny
Jai Ho, o-o-o-oh!
No, there is nothing that can stop us
Nothing can ever come between us
So come and dance with me
Jai Ho! 
Catch me, catch me, catch me, come and catch me
I want you now
I know you can save me, come and save me
I need you now
I am yours forever, yes, forever
I will follow
Anywhere in anyway
Never gonna let go
I need you
Gonna make it
I'm ready
So take it!
You are the reason that I breathe 
You are the reason that I still believe 
You are my destiny 
Jai Ho, o-o-o-oh!
No there is nothing that can stop us 
Nothing can ever come between us
So come and dance with me
Jai Ho! 
Baila, baila!
Baila, baila!
