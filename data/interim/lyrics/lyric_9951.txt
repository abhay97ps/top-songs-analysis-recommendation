Hello, sunshine
It's mighty good to see
You're doing really fine
And although it's been
A long, long time
I still find that you're heavy on my mind
And, oh, I see
You're still looking good, baby
Just like I knew you would
But there's only thing wrong
I don't see you, baby
Not like before
My sunshine has faded away
And my skies are cloudy and gray, baby
I can't stop these tears from falling
From my eyes, yeah, yeah
 from my eyes
Yeah, yeah....
I'm missing you
Ooh, hoo
Hello, love child
I see you still got your pretty smile
Tell me, is it true what they say, baby?
That you're married
And have a baby on the way
And, oh, here I stand
Just a half of a man
Just holding on the best I can
I know this might be
The wrong thing to say
But without your love
I can't face another day
My sunshine has faded away, baby
The skies are cloudy and gray, baby
I can't stop these tears from falling)
 from my eyes, yeah, yeah
 from my eyes
Yeah, yeah.....
I'm missing you, baby
Baby
And the skies are cloudy and gray, baby
I can't stop these tears from falling
 from my eyes
Yeah, yeah, from my eyes
But I still miss you more
And more each and every day
Sunshine has faded away
My skies are cloudy and gray
