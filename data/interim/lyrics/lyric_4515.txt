Here he comes now
I've got to tell him somehow
I could put it off 'til later
But it's best I do it now
Baby, listen to me
There is something I must try to say
I've put it off so long
But I've decided that today is the day
My love for you is dyin'
Oh, no, please don't start cryin'
I take it back, I didn't mean it
Please forget the things I said
I take it back, I'm sorry
I must have been out of my head
He's such a man
It must have hurt him a lot if he let me see him cry
But I must try again
This time I'll say goodbye
Baby, you've been good to me
You've always been the best you could
So try and understand me now
The way you've always understood
I can't go on another day
Oh please, don't look at me that way
I take it back, I didn't mean it
Please forget what I just I said
I take it back, I'm sorry
I must have been out of my head
Sometimes it's better to be loved
Than it is to love
