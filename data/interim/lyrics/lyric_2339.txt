Live wire, ooh
Live wire, ooh
Live wire, ooh
Live wire, ooh
It's my birthday and he forgot again
Every time we date
He's always late
Tired of abuses and excuses
I've made up my mind
Gonna tell him this time
We're through, yeah
But everything I plan to say
Just seems to fade away
Every time
I see his face
My eyes light up
Sparks start to flying
'Cause he's a live wire
A real live wire
He's like a bolt of lightning
That sets my soul afire
Sweet kisses are his ali
And that's
That's where my weakness lies
Though I plan and rehearse
Things I want to say
The words never
Never come my way
'Cause everything I plan to say
Just seems to fade away
Every time
I see his face
My eyes light up
Sparks start to flying
'Cause he's a live wire
A real live wire
He's like a bolt of lightning
That sets my soul afire
'Cause he's a live wire
A real live wire
He's like a bolt of lightning
That sets my soul afire
'Cause he's a live wire
A real live wire
He's like a bolt of lightning
That sets my soul afire
Yeah
Live wire
My eyes light up
Yeah
