Yeah, kid, you don't stop
We won't stop, you don't stop
Come on
Baby, whenever I'm with you
No one else exists but you
'Cause you're the one for me
Every time that we're apart
You're always in my heart
And there you'll always be
Baby, don't go
Your love's so special
Can't let me go now
If I did wrong, I'm sorry
No other love is for me, oh yeah
Love me, hold me
Squeeze me
Hug me, kiss me
And love me
Whenever I'm on my way home
Just can't wait to be alone
With you, my baby
Anticipating how you'll feel
Listen to me, I'm for real
When I say I love you
Baby, don't go
Your love's so special
Can't let me go now
If I did wrong, I'm sorry
No other love 
Love me, hold me
Squeeze me
Hug me, kiss me
And love me
Uh, uh, yeah ,yeah, yeah, what, what, what
Come on, yeah kid, Harlem on the rise
With 112 and you don't want no problem with these guys
Yo, you cats never want no problem like we want it 
When Harlem World double up, we put G's on it 
I'm pushin' new 700 AMGs on it 
And if you can't see the ice, that means my sleeve's on it 
You know I dress as I'm suppose to
Stretch Lex with a chauffeur
Never sober, red Testarossa, cherry Rover
Baguettes in my Jehovah
Me and Puff at the Grammys, sittin' next to Oprah
All we hear is platinum that, platinum this
Platinum whips, nobody got no platinum hits 
Cats know with me, platinum always wrap my wrist 
I come to the awards, quadruple platinum chicks
Little ones like 25, what cats get smacked with
Big ones like 45, what cats get clapped with 
I react sick whenever my dough ain't accurate
Harlem World, Junior M.A.F.I.A., yeah, and that's it, come on
Love me, hold me
Squeeze me
Hug me, kiss me
And love me
Love me, hold me
Squeeze me
Hug me, kiss me
And love me
Love me, hold me
Squeeze me
Hug me, kiss me
And love me
