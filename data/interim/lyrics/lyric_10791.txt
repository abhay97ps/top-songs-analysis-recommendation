Doing all right
A little jiving on a Saturday night
And come what may
Gonna dance the day away
Jenny was sweet
She always smiled for the people she'd meet
On trouble and strife
She had another way of looking at life
The news is blue 
It has its own way to get to you 
What can I do? 
I'll never remember my time with you
Pick up your feet
Got to move to the trick of the beat
There is no elite
Just take your place in the driver's seat
Driver's seat, ooh
Driver's seat, yeah
We're doing all right 
A little jiving on a Saturday night 
And come what may 
Gonna dance the day away 
Driver's seat, ooh
Driver's seat, yeah
Jenny was sweet 
There is no elite 
Pick up your feet 
Pick up, pick up 
Pick up your feet 
Gonna dance the day away 
Driver's seat, ooh
Driver's seat, yeah
Driver's seat, ooh
Driver's seat, yeah
Yeah
Driver's seat
