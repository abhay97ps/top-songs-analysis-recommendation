Aww, I'm itchy
And I don't know where to scratch
Come here baby, scratch my back
I know you can do it, so baby get to it
"Aww, you're workin with it now"
"You got me feelin' so good"
"Look up to the sun now, baby"
"This little girl sho' knows how'd scratch"
"Now, you're doin' the chicken scratch"
"Aww, its lookin' good baby
"Just gettin' scratch"
"That's what I'm talkin' bout"
