I was born in a crossfire Hurricane
In a house  in the fallin rain
Well it's all right, in fact it's a gas
It's all right,  jumpin jack flash is a gas gas gas
I was raised by a toothless bearded haag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back 
Well it's all right, in fact it's a gas
It's all right  jumpin jack is a gas gas gas
I was drowned, washed up and left for dead
I looked down at my feet and I saw they bled
I looked down at the cross from across my bed
I was crowned with a spike right through my head
Well it's all right, in fact it's a gas
It's all right  jumpin jack flash is a gas gas gas
