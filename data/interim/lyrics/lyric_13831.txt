Someone just like me
Running into someone just like you
An accidental touch
Turned into a gentle kiss or two
Love has finally come
Somehow found my someone
Close to you
That's how I feel
When the world's asleep
And we're sharing sweet
Solitude
Almost gave up
Trying to find someone else in love
Long walk
Soft talk
Still can't believe it
What were the odds of
Was that me?
Not long ago
No one here to care
No one's dreams to share
You agree
Nights can be rough
When you can't find someone else in love
Long walk
Soft talk
Hard to believe it
What were the odds of
You and me
All alone
That's my favorite time of night
Nothing for us to do
But finding ways to hold each other tight
Imagine
