Goodbye blues
I'm not gonna sing you no more
I finally got my hands on what I've been looking for
I've found me a man that knows how to
Keep me eatin' from the palm of his hand
Talk about sunshine
I've got the sunshine man
Man what a man
What a man
What a man my man is
There's not a day when he doesn't say
He needs me and loves me
Man what a man
What a man
What a man my man is
He's always around when I'm down
The most with two lovin' arms to hold me close
Man what a man
What a man
What a man my man is
Hello rainbow
I've finally found your pot of gold
I finally got my hands on a real live dream I can hold
I've found me a man
That knows how to keep me sittin' up on cloud nine
Talk about the music
I hear it all the time
Man what a man
What a man...
