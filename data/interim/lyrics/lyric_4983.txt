When you were just a child you built a wall
In your sheltered world like an antique doll
You always took and never learned to give
Don't you know that ain't no way to live
Give me the green light, come on baby
Turn on the green light, let's go baby
How can I break down your resistance
When you keep me at a distance
Give me the green light, come on baby
Turn on the green light, let's go baby
The basic facts of life have been denied
You buried your emotions deep inside
Don't keep running in the wrong direction
Come on baby, give me some affection
Give me the green light, come on baby
Turn on the green light, let's go baby
How can I break down your resistance
When you keep me at a distance
Give me the green light, come on baby
Turn on the green light, let's go baby
Give me the green light, come on baby
Turn on the green light, let's go baby
Give me the green light, come on baby
Turn on the green light, let's go baby
