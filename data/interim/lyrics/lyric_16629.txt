Always and forever
Each moment with you, yeah
Is just like a dream to me
That somehow came true, yeah
And I know tomorrow
Will still be the same
'Cause we got a life of love
That won't ever change and
Every day, love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together
Ooh baby, I'll always love you forever
Ever, ever, ever
There'll always be sunshine
When I look at you, yeah
It's something I can't explain
Just the things that you do 
If you get lonely
Call me and take
A second to give to me
That magic you make and
Every day, love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together
Baby baby, I'll always love you forever
Ooh baby, ooh baby, yeah baby, yeah baby, forever
Love you, love you, you, you, always
Always, ever, ever, ever, forever
And oh yeah, oh, ooh
Love you, ever, ever, ever, and always I
Ever, ever, ever, yes I'm the one who
Yes I'm the one who loves you, always
And forever, I love you
