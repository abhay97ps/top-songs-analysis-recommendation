Every time I kiss somebody new, I, uh
Make believe I'm kissing you but, uh
I can't kid my aching heart 'cause, uh
My heart know we're still apart and, uh
Each night is like a thousand years, oh, oh
I can't lose these young boy blues
I wanna cry when I hear your name, but
If I cry, I feel ashamed, so
I let my pride be my guide and then
I keep those tears inside, so
Each night is like a thousand years, oh, oh
Since I lost these young boy blues, mmm
Don't know where to go
Don't know what to do
I'm so lonesome and lonely
Since I lost you
Every time I kiss somebody new, I, uh
Make believe I'm kissing you but, uh
I can't kid my aching heart 'cause, uh
My heart know we're still apart and
Each night is like a thousand years, oh, oh
I can't lose these young boy blues, mmm
Each night is like a thousand years, oh, oh
I can't lose these young boy blues, mmm
Each night is like a thousand years
