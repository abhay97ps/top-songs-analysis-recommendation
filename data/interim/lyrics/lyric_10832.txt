Come on down Miranda
Your window's open wide
Take a chance on a midnight dance
So I can see it in your eyes
Come on down Miranda
No need to fix your hair
Shake the town with the windows down
Fly in the midnight air
Fly in the midnight air
There are dreams that fly in the midnight wind
Souls that cry in the midnight wind
Lovers who try in the midnight wind
You and I in the midnight wind
Come on down Miranda
You know your time has come
You beauty queens come on so clean
But you're, you're missing all the fun
Yeah you're missing all the fun
There are dreams that fly in the midnight wind
Souls that cry in the midnight wind
Lovers who try in the midnight wind
You and I in the midnight wind
Midnight wind
Midnight wind
There are dreams that fly in the midnight wind
Souls that cry in the midnight wind
Lovers who try in the midnight wind
I said you and I in the midnight wind
Midnight wind 
C'mon down 
There are dreams that fly in the midnight wind
Souls that cry in the midnight wind
Lovers who try in the midnight wind
You and I in the midnight wind
Midnight wind 
C'mon down 
Oh please babe
