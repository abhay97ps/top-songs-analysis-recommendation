I thought that there goes my honey
My happy shoes
Find someone
To help me lose these blues
I'm takin' my body down
Goin' down...
Goin' down...
I didn't miss you
I didn't miss you
I'm goin' down...
Goin' down...
I didn't miss you

I didn't miss you
I didn't miss you
I didn't miss -- didn't miss you!
I thought that there goes my honey
My happy shoes
Find someone
To help me lose these blues
I'm goin' down to the town!
Down, down, down love town!
Goin' down...
Goin' down...
Goin' down...
Goin' down...
I didn't miss you
I didn't miss you
I didn't miss you
I didn't miss you
I'm rid of you
I didn't miss -- didn't miss you!
