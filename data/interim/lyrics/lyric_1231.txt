Please don't ask about Barbara
Don't ask me if she's found somebody new
'cause I would try to smile but in a little while
My tears would show and then you'd know it's true
Please don't ask about Barbara
The hurt will bring the teardrops to my eyes
Though I would pretend that now she's just a friend
You'd look at me and see right through the lies
Tears, tears, go away, come again another day
How can I hide this pain I feel inside
When little teardrops give my heart away?
Don't you ever tell Barbara
I'd rather die than let her know I'm cryin'
Let her run around until the day she's found
She needs me back again but this I ask till then
"Please don't ask about Barbara
