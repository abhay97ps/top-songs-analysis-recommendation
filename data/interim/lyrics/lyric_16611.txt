You know I've seen that face before
I'm not sure if I want it to be
That old face I used to see
Cause that's the one that left me all alone
Took my feelings and hung them out to dry
Never gave a reason why
Yes I know I fell from grace before
But all that's gonna end
Sun's gonna rise again
I'll be listening to those lies again
Sun's gonna rise
Cos  I went back for more
Guess I never learned my lesson well
I went straight back into hell
But when the lightning hits the stormy sky
No one cares about who'll be left to cry
And there ain't no reason why
Yes I know I led the chase before
The chase is gonna end
You feeling sorry for yourself
Don't affect my mental health no more
I've had enough and it's over
Chorus again
