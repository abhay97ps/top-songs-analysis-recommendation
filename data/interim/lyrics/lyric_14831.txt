I gave my heart and soul to you, girl
Gave you the love you never knew, girl, oh
I've cried so many times and that's no lie
It seems to make you laugh each time I cry
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I, this time?
I thought that heart of yours was true, girl
But this time I'm really leaving you girl, oh
Ten times or more, yes, I walked out that door
Get this into your head, there'll be no more
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I, this time?
Ten times or more, yes, I walked out that door
Get this into your head, there'll be no more
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I, this time?
Girl, can we talk for a second?
I know it's been a long time
Since someone blew your mind, like I did
But there'll be other times
For me and you
And I can see the tears fallin' from your eyes
Tell me girl did I blow your mind?
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I, this time?
