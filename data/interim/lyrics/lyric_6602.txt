Ain't no two ways about it
I just can't live without ya
Let's get together, I can't wait forever
Here I am, take my hand
I'm your man
Ain't no two ways about it
I just got to shout
Let's get together, I can't wait forever
Here I am, take my hand
I'm your man
Baby, let me be your one man band, your one man band
Baby, let me be your one man band, your one man band
I just wanna be your one man, your one man band
I just wanna be your one man, your one man band
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
I just wanna be your one man band
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
I just wanna be your one man band
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
I just wanna be your one man band
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
I just wanna be your one man ban', oooo
