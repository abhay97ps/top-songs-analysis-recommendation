Huh? 
Ah, I thought a broke nigga said somethin' 
Talkin' shit, but they still ain't sayin' nothin' 
We gon' trap this bitch out 'til the feds come 
Huh? 
Ah, I thought a pussy ho said somethin' 
How it goes, when I'm talkin, you listen 
Cut her off 'cause she spoke on the business 
Hundreds and fifties, can't swap a dime for a penny
You know that's a stupid decision 
Headfirst with it
I shot a shot at my nigga bitch, really didn't think before I did it 
Make it make sense 
Luckily, I was on point with the last ho, kept my receipts 
Warranty good, made sure I got a full refund when I gave her back to the streets 
Forever I rep, put the set on the chain
I'm thuggin', you already know how I came 
Yeah, he got money, but niggas be lame
I Lambo'd her life, told her, "Get out that Range"
Her mani and pedi same color as my teeth 
She got a blue check and a check without me 
Hood nigga ridin' in a foreign on E 
Sick of these niggas, COVID-19 
Karate’d the wock, he tryna kick the cup  
Came up like Giannis, I get bigger bucks 
Got four different choppers, right there in this truck 
I'm just being honest, I could get you touched 
Put you in the blender, I could get you slushed 
I see the comments but really unbothered
I know it's hurtin', she salty, I scarred her
Beware what you lay up and say to these bitches, they can't hold water

I thought a nigga who watch what I do
But he can't get his bitch back said somethin' 
Is it true that he postin' another nigga money?
Probably, I don't put that past him 
I thought a ho that be speakin' on me
But be fuckin' a broke nigga said somethin' 
Hol' up, lil' bitch, get a nigga that's lit
I'm the whole loaf, he the breadcrumbs 
Rappers with their mixed feelings 
I ain't fuckin' with 'em 
Like a Richard Mille, let me know what time it is
Bagg, where the Runtz at?  Know you got it on you '
'Posed to be smell-proof, bussin' out the vacuum seal
These niggas lil' boys, childish, Fisher Price
Confident, I'm not cocky, so get it right
She bendin' over, but I want some head first
I don't even wanna know what the pussy like
Trippin' too close to fallin', so I'm ballin'
It's crazy, my opp got shot but I ain't call it 
I come around, niggas gon' put they ho up
These bitches stay on my channel, yeah
Must've seen me on TV, yeah
It took me six hours to count a mil' exactly, I'm accurate with the cheese, yeah
