A happy tune
You'll love to croon
Hey, you don't seem to understand
I must agree
The melody
Looks like I'm gonna
Have to explain this thing
You don't dig this scene
I'm saying, Dean
The song is Sam's song
But, Dean, here's the scam
The song was named after Sam
 Sam Houston 
(May I say with pride
Where I reside
They call it Dean's song)
And that's quite a group
You have going for you
(There's no bigger choir that you
Could hire for singing Dean's song)
They make the Mormon Tabernacle
Sound like a trio
(Sam, it's plain to see
That you're put out with me)
No, I'm not just singing along
(Tell you what I'll do
Since I'm with you
We'll call it Clyde's song)
Clyde's song
It's a sweet melody and I'm
Happy to say it was named
After me but he's calling it
No, I don't like to beef
And I'm sorry to say
The man is a thief
Cause he's calling it
There's a lot on my mind
And I'm standing here
Saying you're being unkind
Cause you're calling it
My Italian friend
We have reached the end
Oh, I hear what you say
But by that do you mean
That you'll do it your way
And keep calling it 
Did he say Sam's song
Let's give the ending a rhyme
That the name of this song
It's not Irving's song
It's not even Mona's song
Only thing I know is
When this record comes out
It better have Sam's song on it
Or else you'll get a nasty letter
From Calhoun and a telephone call too
Hmm, I'm thinking you're starting
To get dirty down there
