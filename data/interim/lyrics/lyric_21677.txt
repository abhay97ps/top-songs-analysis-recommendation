Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I dreamed of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true...
Oh, someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are
Far behind me...
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me...
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then, oh, why can't I...?
