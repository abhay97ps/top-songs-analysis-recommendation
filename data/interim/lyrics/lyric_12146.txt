There's no time for changing plans
I must leave, it's in your hands
I know you'll wait for how long

When I'm away you're gonna have a good time
What can I say, will you remember you're mine?
What will you do when they wanna touch ya?
What will you do when they wanna get you?
I know what they'll do
If you ever let 'em, are you gonna let 'em?

Will you take them in at all
Or will you send them far away?

Why don't you run and do what you wanna do?
Ain't nothin' wrong 'cause I'll be doing it too
If you give in, I don't wanna hear it
And if he wins I don't wanna see it
Whatever you do maybe you can hide it
Try to keep it quiet
