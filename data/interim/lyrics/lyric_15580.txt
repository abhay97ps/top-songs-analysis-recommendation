Mama always used to say
Good things come to those who wait
Just give it time
Now your out there on your own
Got no place to call your home
Make you lose your mind
Busy workin' day and night
Tryin' to bring your dreams to life
It just ain't right
Each time they knock you down
Get your feet back on the ground
Don't let 'em stand in your way
So if you feel that you just can't take it
And the world isn't what it seems
Don't forget that life can be what you make it
Baby when you live on a street of dreams
Street of dreams
No-one seems to understand
All they do is make demands
Tell you where to go
Got no business in your life
Tryin' to tell you wrong from right
You already know
Chasin' rainbows in the sky
Got to have the nerve to try
You've got to see it through
Hold on to what you know
Don't ever let it go
Someday you'll see it come true
So if you feel that you just can't take it
And the world isn't what it seems
Don't forget that life can be what you make it
Baby when you live on a street of dreams
Street of dreams
Each time they knock you down
Get your feet back on the ground
Don't let 'em stand in your way
So if you feel that you just can't take it
And the world isn't what it seems
Don't forget that life can be what you make it
Baby when you live on a street of dreams
Street of dreams
So if you feel that you just can't take it
And the world isn't what it seems
Don't forget that life can be what you make it
Baby when you live on a street of dreams
Street of dreams
Chasin' rainbows in the sky
Got to have the nerve to try
Busy workin' day and night
Tryin' to bring your dreams to life
