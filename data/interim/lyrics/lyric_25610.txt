I'm a motherfuckin' train wreck
I don't wanna be too much
But I don't wanna miss your touch
And you don't seem to give a fuck
I don't wanna keep you waiting
But I do just what I have to do
And I might not be the one for you
But you ain't allowed to have no boo
'Cause I know we be so complicated
But we be so smitten, it's crazy
I can't have what I want, but neither can you
You ain't my boyfriend 
And I ain't your girlfriend 
But you don't want me to see nobody else
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend 
And I ain't your girlfriend 
But you don't want me to touch nobody else 
Baby, we ain't gotta tell nobody
Even though you ain't mine, I promise the way we fight
Make me honestly feel like we just in love 
'Cause, baby, when push comes to shove 
Damn, baby, I'm a train wreck, too 
I lose my mind when it comes to you
I take time with the ones I choose
And I don't want a smile if it ain't from you, yeah
I know we be so complicated
Lovin' you sometimes drive me crazy
'Cause I can't have what I want and neither can you 
You ain't my boyfriend 
And I ain't your girlfriend 
But you don't want me to see nobody else
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend 
And I ain't your girlfriend 
But you don't want me to touch nobody else 
Baby, we ain't gotta tell nobody
I wanna kiss you , don't wanna miss you 
But I can't be with you 'cause I got issues 
Yeah, on the surface, seem like it's easy
Careful with words, but it's still hard to read me
Stress high when the trust low 
Bad vibes, where'd the fun go? 
Try to open up and love more 
Try to open up and love more
If you were my boyfriend
And you were my girlfriend
I prolly wouldn't see nobody else
But I can't guarantee that by myself
You ain't my boyfriend 
And I ain't your girlfriend 
But you don't want me to see nobody else 
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend 
And I ain't your girlfriend 
But you don't want me to touch nobody else 
Baby, we ain't gotta tell nobody 
You ain't my boyfriend 
And I ain't your girlfriend 
But you don't want me to see nobody else
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend 
And I ain't your girlfriend 
But you don't want me to touch nobody else 
Baby, we ain't gotta tell nobody
