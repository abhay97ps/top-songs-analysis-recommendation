 I got my twin Glock forties  cocked back
 Me and my homies , so drop that
 We rollin' on twenties,  with the top back
 So much money  you can't stop that
 Twin Glock forties  cocked back
 Me and my homies , so drop that
 We rollin' on twenties,  with the top back
 So much money  you can't stop that
Now, where'd you get that platinum chain with them diamonds in it?
Where'd you get that matchin' Benz with them windows tinted?
Who them girls you be with when you be ridin' through?
Man, I ain't got nothin' to prove, I paid my dues, breakin' the rules, I shake fools while I'm takin' a cruise
Tell me who's your weed man, and how do you smoke so good?
You's a superstar, boy, why you still up in the hood?
What in the world is in that bag? What you got in that bag?
A couple of cans of whoop ass, you did a good-ass job of just eyein' me, spyin' me
 I got my twin Glock forties  cocked back
 Me and my homies , so drop that
 We rollin' on twenties,  with the top back
 So much money  you can't stop that
 Twin Glock forties  cocked back

Man, that car don't come out until next year, where in the fuck did you get it?
That's eighty thousand bucks gone, where in the fuck did you spend it?
You must have eyes on your back 'cause you got money to the ceilin'
And the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin', the better I'm feelin', the more that I'm chillin', winnin', drillin' and killin' the feelin'
Now, who's that bucked naked cook fixin' three course meals?
Gettin' goosebumps when her body taps the six inch heels
What in the world is in that room, what you got in that room?
A couple of gats, a couple of knives, a couple of raps, a couple of wives, now it's time to choose
 I got my twin Glock forties  cocked back
 Me and my homies , so drop that
 We rollin' on twenties,  with the top back
 So much money  you can't stop that
 Twin Glock forties  cocked back
 Me and my homies , so drop that
 We rollin' on twenties,  with the top back
 So much money  you can't stop that
Are you custom made, custom paid, or you just custom fitted?
PlayStation 2 up in the ride, is that Lorenzo-kitted?
Is that your wife, your girlfriend or just your main bitch?
You take a pick, while I'm rubbin' the hips, touchin' lips to the top of the dick and then, "Whew"
Now, tell me who's your housekeeper, and what you keep in your house?
What about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in your mouth?
What in the world is in that case, what you got in that case?
Get up out my face, you couldn't relate, wait to take place at a similar pace, so shake, shake it
 I got my twin Glock forties  cocked back
 Me and my homies , so drop that
 We rollin' on twenties,  with the top back
 So much money  you can't stop that
 Twin Glock forties  cocked back
 Me and my homies , so drop that
