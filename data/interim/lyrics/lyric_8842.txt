When the world was in trouble
And it looked like there was hell to pay
Fire, Fire everywhere!
And the news got worse each day
Well, people really wondered
Just how long they could hold out
God looked down from heaven above
And He began to shout
Let there be music
Let it shine like the sun
Let there be music
Everybody's got to have some fun
It's so hard to keep on smillin'
When people try to make you frown
But, we're all in this together
So why run one another down
You know we can't expect our problems
To grow wings and fly away
So fight the fight just as hard as you can
When it's time for you to play
Let there be music
Let it shine like the sun
Let there be music
Everybody's got to have some fun
Let there be music
Let it shine like the sun
Let there be music
Everybody's got to
Everybody's got to have some fun
Let there be music
Let it shine like the sun
Let there be music
Everybody's got to have some fun
