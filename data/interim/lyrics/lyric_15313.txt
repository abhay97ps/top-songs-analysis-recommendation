Just wanna hold you tight
All day, all night
Just wanna hold you tight
Just wanna hold you tight
All day, all night
Just wanna hold you tight
I look at you
You look at me
And then we smile
Knowing what we're here for
The kiss that you give
Makes me want you more and more
We're having the time of our lives
And then you say that
I will always be the one
Someone right for your dreams at night
I wish we could be right here, right now, always
Touching and loving you so right
Just wanna hold you tight
All day, all night
Just wanna hold you tight
Just wanna hold you tight
All day, all night
Just wanna hold you tight
Seeing you here by my side
Words come out that I can't hide
You're an image of my dreams
I need you and you need me, too
As long as we keep holding on
I'll be there for you
Just wanna hold you tight
All day, all night
Just wanna hold you tight
Just wanna hold you tight
All day, all night
Just wanna hold you tight
Love
Your body
Your beauty
I want more
I want you to
Hold me, love me, squeeze me
I need you to
Touch me, please me, tease me
I want you to
Hold me, love me, squeeze me
I need you to
Touch me, please me, tease me, whoa-oh, oh
Just wanna hold you tight
All day, all night
Just wanna hold you tight 
Just wanna hold you tight
All day, all night
Just wanna hold you tight 
Just wanna hold you tight
All day, all night
Just wanna hold you tight
Just wanna hold you tight
All day, all night
Just wanna hold you tight
Just wanna hold you tight
All day, all night
Just wanna hold, just wanna hold you tight
Just wanna hold you tight
All day, all day
Just wanna hold you tight
Just wanna hold, just wanna hold you tight
