I've been alone inside myself for far too long
I never really wanted it that way but I let it happen
If I could do it all again my life would be infinitely better than before
I wouldn't waste a moment
I'd Make time for laughing with my friends
Make love, make music, make amends
Try to make a difference, try to love, try to understand
Instead of just giving up I'd use the power at my command
'Cause there's always tomorrow to start over again
Things will never stay the same
The only one sure thing is change
That's why there's always tomorrow
I guess it took a little time for me to see
The reason I was born into this world and what I'd have to go through
For I've finally realize that I could be
Infinitely better than before, definitely stronger
I'll face whatever comes my way
Savor each moment of the day
Love as many people as I can along the way
Help someone who's giving up
If it's just to raise my eyes and pray
'Cause there's always tomorrow to start over again
Things will never stay the same
The only one sure thing is change
That's why there's always tomorrow
Before your last setting sun
And everything your heart has longed for
Has yet to be one
Yes, there's always, always, always tomorrow
Though people come and they go
But if you've brought some love to their lives
Then you've got something to show
There's always, always, always tomorrow to start over again
Things will never stay the same
The only one sure thing is change
That's why there's always, always, always...
Always tomorrow
