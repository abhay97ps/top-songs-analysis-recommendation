I wish I could be
Anybody but me
I wish I could be
Anybody but me
Lonely, lonely as I can be
Well, I had a true love
Had the world in my hands
Now I got a hurt
I can't hardly stand
A little bit of loving would be so grand
I'm not the same old me
That I use to be
I wanna be somebody
Just anybody but me
I got the blues on my mind
Blues won't let me be
Now I wanna be free
From what's holding me
Take away these tears
Take away these tears and let me see
'Cause I wanna be back
Like I use to be
I said I wish I could be
Yes, anybody but me
Yeah, now I wanna be
Just any old body but me
Because I'm lonely
Lonely as I can be
