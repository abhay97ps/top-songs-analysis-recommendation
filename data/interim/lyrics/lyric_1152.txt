I told the brook that runs down through the valley
A secret my best friend never knew
The brook told the trees and the trees told the breeze
That I was in love with you
The trees told the flowers hiding there by the hilltop
The clouds told the moon that shone above
So angry, yet blue, when they found out that you
And your heart had another love
The brook became angry and changed to a river
Rushing so madly along
The soft summer breeze that played tag with the trees
Became so wild and so strong
The bashful, white flowers hiding there by the hilltop
Grew dark when the rain came pouring down
Their hearts couldn't hide all the tears that were cried
And had carpeted on the ground
The storm passed, gone over, there's sunshine again
The chains that held me are now gone
The trees wave, hello, as I stand here below
And the brook sings the sweetest song
The bashful, white flowers are again by the hilltop
The sun and the moon are still my friends
I promise there'll be no more heartaches for me
Till I fall in love again
