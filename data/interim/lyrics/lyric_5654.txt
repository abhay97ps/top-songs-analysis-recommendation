Idaho
Where I long to go
Thrilling checker games
Spelling bees, cherry trees
Idaho, lovely Idaho
Daisies on the grass
Grandma's stew
The cows and you
Idaho, lovely Idaho
Playing pick-up sticks
Santa Claus, apple sauce
Idaho
Rain or sleet or snow
You'll be in my heart
I love you so, just
Thought you'd like to know
My Ida
Sweet as apple cider
How I love you so
My Idaho
