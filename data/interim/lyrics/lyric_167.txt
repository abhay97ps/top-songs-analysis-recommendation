MOUNTAIN OF LOVE
Standing on a mountain looking down on a city
The way I feel is a doggone pity
Teardrops falling down a mountainside
Many times I've been here, many times I've cried
We used to be so happy when we were in love
High on a mountain of love
Night after night I've been standing here alone
Weeping my heart out till the cold grey dawn
Praying that you're lonely and you'll come here too
Hoping just by chance that I'll get a glimpse of you
Trying hard to find you somewhere above
High on a mountain of love
A mountain of love, a mountain of love
You should be ashamed
We used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name
Way down below there's a half million people
Somewhere there is a church with a big tall steeple
Inside there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing and they should have been ours
That's why I'm so lonely, my dreams gone above
High on a mountain of love
