It's not the way you smile that touched my heart 
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart
Woh oh oh, many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do?
I can't help myself
'Cause baby, it's you 
Baby, it's you 
You should hear what they say about you, "cheat," "cheat."
They say, they say you never never never  been true 
Uh oh
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, when it's true
I don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause baby, it's you 
Baby, it's you 
Woh oh oh, many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do?
I can't help myself
'Cause baby, it's you 
Baby, it's you 
Don't leave me alone 
Come on home 
Baby, it's you
