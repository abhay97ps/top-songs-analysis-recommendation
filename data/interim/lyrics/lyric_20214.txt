You make me feel out of my element
Like I'm walkin' on broken glass
Like my world's spinnin' in slow motion
And you're movin' too fast
Were you right? Was I wrong? Were you weak? Was I strong?
Yeah, both of us broken
Caught in a moment
We lived and we loved and we hurt and we jumped, yeah
But the planets all aligned
When you looked into my eyes
And just like that, the chemicals react
The chemicals react
You make me feel out of my element
Like I'm driftin' out to the sea
Like the tide's pullin' me in deeper
Makin' it harder to breathe
We cannot deny how we feel inside
We cannot deny
Were you right? Was I wrong? Were you weak? Was I strong?
Yeah, both of us broken
Caught in a moment
We lived and we loved and we hurt and we jumped, yeah
But the planets all aligned
When you looked into my eyes
And just like that, the chemicals react
The chemicals react
Kaleidoscope of colors turnin'
Hopes on fire, sun is burnin'
Shinin' down on both of us
Don't let us lose it, don't let us lose it
Were you right? Was I wrong? Were you weak? Was I strong?
Yeah, both of us broken
Caught in a moment
We lived and we loved and we hurt and we jumped, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We lived, we loved, we hurt, we jumped
We're right, we're wrong, we're weak, we're strong
We lived to love
But the planets all aligned
When you looked into my eyes
And just like that, watch the chemicals react
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And just like that, the chemicals react
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The chemicals react
