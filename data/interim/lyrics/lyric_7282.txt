I went down to see lonesome Mary
She was sitting all alone
She was crying for the contrariness
That made a desert of her home
She was weeping and a-wailing
You know she does it every day
I said Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
How can you live that way
She said I don't know
Must be in my soul
I guess I must be the most contrary
Hard to get along with
Person in this world
Ooh, Lonesome Mary
Ooh, Lonesome Mary
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I went down to see lonesome Mary
She was sitting all alone
She was crying for the contrariness
That made a desert of her home
She was weeping and a-wailing
You know she does it every day
I said Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
How can you live that way
She said I don't know
Well, it must be in my soul
I guess I must be the most contrary
Hard to get along with
Person in this world
Ooh, Lonesome Mary
Ooh, Lonesome Mary
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
