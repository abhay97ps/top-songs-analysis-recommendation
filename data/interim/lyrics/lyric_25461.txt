I'm feeling so cool
From top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Well, dammit, I'm feelin' so cool, yeah
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old school scene
I'm feelin' high like a late night summer of last year 
Standin' there with the red dress on ya
A Killer Queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me or am I just havin' a good year?
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool 
Top to the bottom, just cool 
Every little thing that I do 
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like, ooh , maybe I should bottle my moves 
Sell 'em for a dollar or two 
Dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool 
Must've done something right 'cause all these
Lights are green, man, they look like palm trees
And every time that song comes on it's about me
Oh, I feel like Post Malone when I get home
Sittin' there, winning like it's Game of Thrones
And now that we've made it, how complicated was last year?
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool 
Top to the bottom, just cool 
Every little thing that I do 
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like, ooh , maybe I should bottle my moves 
Sell 'em for a dollar or two 
'Cause dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool 
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old school scene
When I grow up, I wanna be just like me
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool 
Top to the bottom, just cool 
Every little thing that I do 
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like, ooh , maybe I should bottle my moves 
Sell 'em for a dollar or two 
'Cause dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool 
Cool
