Change my attempt, good intentions
Crouched over, you were not there, living in fear
But signs were not really that scarce, obvious tears
But I will not hide you through this, I want you to help them
Please see the bleeding heart perched on my shirt
Die, withdraw, hide in cold sweat, quivering lips
Ignore remorse, naming a kid, living wasteland
This time you've tried all that you can, turning you red
Change my attempt, good intentions
Should I? Could I?
Here we are with your obsession
Should I? Could I?
Crowned, hopeless, the article read, "living wasteland"
This time you've tried all that you can, turning you red
But I will not hide you through this, I want you to help
Change my attempt, good intentions
Should I? Could I?
Here we are with your obsession
Should I? Could I?
Heave the silver, hollow sliver
Piercing through another victim
Turn and tremble, be judgmental
Ignorant to all the symbols
Blind the face with beauty paste
Eventually, you'll one day know
Change my attempt, good intentions
Limbs tied, skin tight
Self inflicted his perdition
Should I? Could I?
Change my attempt, good intentions
Should I? Could I?
Should I? Could I?
