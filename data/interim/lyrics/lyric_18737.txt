I know they say if you love somebody, you should set them free
But it sure is hard to do, it sure is hard to do
I know they say if you don't come back again, then it's meant to be 
Those words don't pull me through, 'cause I'm still in love with you
I spend each day here waitin' for a miracle
But it's just you and me goin' through the mill, climbin' up a hill
This is the long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breakin' a heart?
No matter how hard I try
I always make you cry
Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it
All that's happenin' here is a long goodbye
Sometimes I ask my heart, "Did we really give our love a chance?" 
But I know without a doubt, we turned it inside out
And if we walked away, would it make more sense?
But it tears me up inside just to think we could still try
How long must we keep runnin' on a carousel?
Goin' 'round and 'round and never gettin' anywhere, on a wing and prayer
This is the long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breakin' a heart?
No matter how hard I try
I always make you cry
Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it
All that's happenin' here is a long goodbye
Long goodbye
Oh-oh, oh
Long goodbye
Oh, it's a long goodbye, it's a long goodbye
