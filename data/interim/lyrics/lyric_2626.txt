I'm so happy to be here tonight
So glad to be here in your wonderful city
I have a little message for you
And I want to tell every woman and every man tonight
That's ever needed someone to love
That's ever had somebody to love them
That ever had somebody's understanding
That's ever had someone that needs their love all the time
Someone that's with them when they're up
Somebody that's with them when they're down
If you had yourself somebody like this, you better hold onto them
'Cause let me tell you something
Sometimes you get what you want
And you lose what you have
There's a song I sing
And I believe if everybody was to sing this song it would save the whole world
Listen to me
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody wants somebody to love
Honey to hug, yeah
Sugar to kiss, mmm
Baby to miss now, yeah
Baby to tease
Sometimes to please, yeah
And I need 
And I need 
In the morning, baby, 
When the sun goes down 
Ain't no nobody around 
Whoa, listen to me
Sometimes I feel like
I feel a little sad inside
My baby mistreats me
And I can't get a little, little mad
But I need you 
Just to see me through, sugar
Somebody to hold my hand
When I feel a little lonely
But I wanna hear you say yeah
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
I just want one woman to stand up and say, "I love you"
I want someone to be a witness tonight
I just wanna hear you say, "I love you"
Oh
I just want somebody to squeeze me tight
