Pop pop pop pie, here's the dance of the day! Hey!
Pop pop pop pie, come on I'll show you the way
Come on and take your turn, you're gonna start to learn
To do the Pop-Pie...
Pop pop pop pie, it's not as new as it seems
Pop pop pop pie, came outta New Orleans
There was a rockin' hop, the kids all started to Pop
Pop pop pie...
Now clap your hands 
Swing your hips 
Shout, scream like an alleycat at midnight that's the
Pop Pop Pop pie!
Pop pop pop pie!
Once you get in the groove, you really start to move
Doing the Pop-pie...
