All aboard that funkboat that
I'm about to start sailin' now on
All you reaggers and all your party trickers
Everybody's in the funky blowout
You know Wez said sell from just around the corner
From the Porter Bella Road
Downtown W Tender my bass a-baby
Baby do what ya done till, I got
Bottles of beer and a deck of two
All my friends are now coming in
Lousiana Jones, looking good girls
So open the bottle let the party begin
I'm on a mic, make ya dance, make ya funk, make you sweat
From now until the break of dawn
So get off the rollers, have a ball
From now till the morning comes, and I said
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
Have fun living in the city
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
Have fun living in the city
Come along, come along
Come along everybody, everybody in the place to be
It's Capita-B, Capita-B on a microphone
Hit-T on the funkybase tree
Now Barrada-B, you've got a disc-crop, trance-crop, dance-crop
Just what you've got to do
I said, "Ladies and gentlemen
This one goes out to you", and I said
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
Have fun living in the city
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
Have fun living in the city
So let it be, let it be my, my turn to dance
So make in a space up and on the floor
'Cuz I really wanna take this chance
Bust the move, thrust the move, lust the move
You know I got no chain
I wanna do it again, I wanna do it again
I wanna do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it again
I like it, I like it, I like it
Oh, my God I think I like it alot
When you shake your funky tursha in front of me
Like you know what you giving like you know what you got
'Cos it's a high brow, bull crowd, hang out, club house
Just where I wanna be
You said, "Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me, yes"
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
Have fun living in the city
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
Have fun living in the city
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
Have fun living in the city
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
Have fun living in the city
