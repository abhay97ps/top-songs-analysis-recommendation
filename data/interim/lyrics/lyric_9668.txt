You can't turn a bad girl good so why try?
Yet we lust for the bad ones severely, why lie?
The thrill of that chase, just a taste of that high
We experience when given face time with her thighs
So we commit to dates we can't make
Get a cut, clean the place
Order in a little bit of dinner then we wait
For hours, just get a call that she's an hour late
And she'll be on the train, she can't wait to see your face
But hey, that's the game, and that's all she'll ever do
Cause she been made a fool, by every man she ever knew
Her scars, you can't see the way she keeps em outta view
So she might bare her body but she'll never share her truth
She's a, beautiful monster just destroying herself
Unemployed and out of school, just avoiding the help
That you thinking you could give her as the misses to your mister
Just watch, you'll be another notch under her belt....
See I know you
You're confused
But I can help you find yourself
I see through
Everything you do
But I can't help but love you...
It seems that like every talk we have that's not screaming
That she's focused now, on saving up her money cuz she's leaving
She's starting over, 'til we draw closer to the weekend
She's at H&M, spending all those ends for this evening
Out with new best friends, cause her old ones was sleeping
Around with her boyfriend, on whom, she was cheating
They say "birds of a feather flock together" for a reason
And they share the same cheap taste in dress, plus the heathens
They all hang around with, they all done laid down with
Got pounded out a couple times and acted dumbfounded
Like you ain't know just what he wanted from you, girl you kidding me
And I'mma be the guy with whom you'll choose to do it differently?
Until that Blackberry light lights up
You'll pulling your tights up
Back to sleeping days cause you've been spending your nights up
At this rate, you'll never have your friends throwing that rice up
White dress matching that Rolls, beau in a nice tux
And girls supposed to have them nice kind of dreams
It kinda seems you ain't fond of them type of things
You're just a fallen angel with a pair of dirty wings
Head above the clouds, indulging in what the drama brings...
See I know you
You're confused
But I can help you find yourself
I see through
Everything you do
But I can't help but love you...
You can't turn a bad girl good, yet we try it everyday, though
But you can't interchange a set of horns with a halo
There's no reparations, for relations with a-holes
There's no road maps for the dark places, that they go
When they're having alone time, phone line cut
And every story that she ever gave you don't line up
Yet you stay trying to figure it
There's bliss in the ignorance
You might wanna turn a blind eye, just consider it
The time you spend together, is your time spent together
The time she ain't around, then just treat it like whatever
She's terminally ill, ain't no way she's getting better
She's a bittersweet pill you could never be her medi-
Cine , is what she's into, though she looks like a virgin
She's in love with the pain and mayne, you's a diversion
So please act according, walk straight, don't trip
Cause you when fall for the wrong one, to leave that ditch
Is impossible, patna, she's that chick
When she feels you getting close, she gon' leave you quick
So on I everything I love, just believe that bitch
When she tells you that she ain't shit
She's a beautiful monster...
See I know you
You're confused
But I can help you find yourself
I see through
Everything you do
But I can't help but love you...
