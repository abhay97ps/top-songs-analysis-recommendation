I got a secret that keeps me feeling fine
It's not a lotion, drink or potion and it makes it every time
It's that little loving you give me everyday
It's that little loving that keeps me here to stay, yeah
I live and breath just in your embrace
I wear a grin
No vitamin could ever put upon my face
It's that little loving every single day
It's that little loving that keeps the Doctor away
Chorus:
You keep it coming
That's why I'm so satisfied
That little loving
Best medication I've tried
It keeps it coming
My remedy night and day
That little love keeps the Doctor away, yeah
Your tender body snuggles up to mine
You better slow dance full of romance
And I'll turn in on a dime
It's that little loving you give me everyday
It's that little loving that keeps me here to stay, yeah
It's such a pleasure to never get uptight
You got the style
You got the smile that keeps my circulation right
Little loving every single day
It's that little loving that keeps the Doctor away
Repeat Chorus
I feel fantastic
I feel like I could fly
It's nothing new
It's quiet and true
It's just an artificial high
Little loving every single day
It's that little loving, ah-ha, that keeps the Doctor away
Repeat Chorus
