V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N, in the summer sun
Put away your books, we're out of school
The weather's warm, but we'll play it cool
We're on vacation, havin' lots of fun
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N, in the summer sun
We're gonna, grab a bite at the pizza stand
Write love letters in the sand
We're on vacation, and the world is ours
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N, under summer stars
Hey we'll hop in a jalopy, to a drive-in movie
And never look at the show
We're gonna hug and kiss, just like this
I can't wait to go go go!
We're gonna, mash potato to a Jukebox tune
Park your car 'neath an August moon
We're on vacation, till the start of fall
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N, we're gonna have a ball
GO!!
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N, gonna have a ball
Uh-huh we'll hop in a jalopy, to a drive-in movie
And never look at the show
We're gonna hug and kiss, a-just like this
I can't wait to go go go!
We're gonna, mash potato to a Jukebox tune
Park your car 'neath an August moon
We're on vacation, till the start of fall
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N, we're gonna have a ball
Yeah!
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N, Yeah! we're gonna have a ball
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N, we're gonna have a ball
