But for today it's riding shotgun since niggas like to front
And if this nigga run and this nigga done, I'ma soak a nigga like he in the tub
These rappers acting like Ice Cube now tell Doughboy to come pick him up
Fuck niggas I never like 'em, got no problem with killin' one
I do real hits and don't brag about it, just rap about it, I don't give a fuck
I remember way back when we was broke, we was crying, momma high as hell
To us she was a loving mother but to other motherfuckers she was clientele
And I remember begging her to stop and every single night when I told her that
I'ma get big and buy a bunch of guns
And kill every nigga that done sold her crack
It's almost 20 years later, now she finally sober
But that was the shit that I prayed about
I thank God I made it out
Damn it feels good to go pick up my momma and take her out
Lil Tony got paper now all in my bank account, and it ain't shit to debate about
If you cross me like Jesus, I'll come back with heaters
Be outside your crib like we stakin' out
It's really fucked up in my city I'm sorry but I'm bout to add to the body count
I'll Rocky Part 4'em I'm rushin', show all you niggas exactly what I be 'bout
My choppas, they shit on them bitches, when spittin, I think they might got a potty mouth
I might come baseline like Kobe Bryant, did way back in '03 and then body yall
Keep runnin' your mouth I'ma run in your house
Paramedics they gonna' bring bodies out
I'm sonnin you niggas like J. Rock and word on the streets is that they done let Bobby out
Be strapped at the mall, strapped at the studio, you better be strapped at your momma house
When Montana hoppin' out, hollow tips poppin' out
I caught his ass takin' the garbage out
Moment of silence, text messages sent around my city, the moment they find it out
Black on black everything
We own black everything
That's the motto when we ridin' out
The ratchets stay on me, just know I was all me, whenever if ever you saw me out
Been playin' with iron, since the age of nine
Shoutout to my daddy he taught me how
My dad was a killer, my mom was an addict, a nigga grew up in a slaughterhouse
I am the one that they talk about
I am so cold that you might have to Thaw me out
That money be callin', I won't stop ballin', now I am up next like Jabari now
See niggas was sleepin' on me, but I just woke them up and they sayin' they sorry now?
I'm a dough stacking
Dope rapping, no lacking
Po' packing, Four blasting
Soul snatching, toe tagging, cold bastard
Better close your mouth or get a closed casket
Show you what I'm saying like closed captions
Put them in two, make them disappear, when I spit fire, that's old magic
I'll put the chopper to a nigga top, and then let it fly, Go-Go Gadget
Might fuck his bitch or say fuck this shit, and get straight face, that's no passion
I'm the illest nigga that you ever heard
I'm the flyest killer that you ever seen
If a fuck nigga ever jump stupid, I'ma catch a body like a trampoline
Bitch I'm Freddy Kruger in a hockey mask
About to kick door like karate class
Ask a nigga where he hide his stash
He better tell the truth like a polygraph
One false move and that shotty blast
Leave a nigga stiff like a body cast
And we don't know nothing about nothing nigga, we was out of town If somebody ask
Real shit, I'm a father first, my son's need me, I ain't bailing on them
Be with real niggas, doing real shit
If I get caught, I ain't telling on them
No tool, I ain't never going
Iron Man with that metal on him
Only God knows where the hell I'm going
Make a nigga wish he was never born
These niggas broke, put a brace on 'em
I'm super fly, put a cape on them
I'm upstairs up in Adrianna's throwing cake on them while they hate on them
From Chiraq, not Miami, but I'm wearing heat like I play for them
I'll come at night and put the nine on them
With the long clip, DeAndre Jordan, 
I'll come at night and put the nine to them
With the long clip, DeAndre Jordan
I was kicked out with my shit out
But I been out with my pen out
The paper here when I dish out
I got a thick snout when that fish out
I want the money, cars, got the hoes
But that skrilla all on my search route
No growth spurts but my money sprout
Got a bad bitch with a fat ass
When she twerk out that's a workout
But the first scout, I done passed out
With her ass out and my cash out
She opened up and I splashed out
I done broke the , bring a cask' out
I'm the best in it and the last out
I'm the last out and the best in it
Y'all hiding niggas bring the mask out
Y'all garbage niggas keep the trash out
If you talkin' shit you better watch your mouth
Cause your snot box will get busted out
I don't talk 'bout it, I walk it out
I'm 19 and my stance strong
My money green and my pen lean
I'm a damn fiend for this damn green
Hit the damn scene with the fam, homies, and the damn team
I been here and I been there
Her pussy wet, no swimwear
But I'm in there with my army gear
Can't trust hoes, don't trust niggas
Just trust yourself and your fucking figures
I did this and I did that
Her pussy fat, I did that and I did this
And I'm all about my business
And there ain't no competition, I'm vicious
In the booth I put a nigga on the hit list
Dear god can I get a witness?
I slayed that and I slaughtered this
Cause I'm a motherfucking menace nigga
I'm 19, when that light green
She might scream for that pipe me
These light bars for that ripe cheese
Homies got bars for that hype fees
I got loud, come holler at me
Etcetera, some OG
A quick talk for that QP
And I'm out the sky with a blue dream
Brooklyn where I reside at
Money all in that sty rack
A couple niggas that's OT
If you can't handle, they'll fly back
Studio, and I'm on beats
No time for me to get sidetracked
In the booth steady going skytzo
I'm working hits with my mind strap
Can't stop me then fuck with me
Or follow up, get in line scrap
Fuck you and who you fuck with
This money here, this paper fat
Gotta grind so I'm a go-getter
Niggas fake and I'm so realer
Beat war and I'm a gorilla
MJ and I'm so Thriller
Can't fuck with me, I'm that nigga
You typing scared, nigga that figures
I can take your thot, I bring back figures
Flipping musically with a couple hitters
That's  to get it with a crip triggers
Gotta hit a nigga, backflip a nigga
Pistol whip a bitch and ziplock a nigga
Go kill a nigga when he feeling froggish
Throw me a beat and I'm getting on it
And I'm getting on it and I'm shitting on it
A bad bitch in my radar, I'm murking it, then I'm dipping on it
In the booth spitting and I'm killing on it
And I'm living on it
Pay attention bitch cause my dick enormous
And they looking gorgeous and they getting on it
And they only want me cause a nigga ballin'
It's RedLyfe, man it's RedLyfe
Man it's RedLyfe, ain't no joke
Rollin' with so many blue 30's nigga would've thought I was loc
Call my  up, said I'm heavy up, man a nigga need that coke
'Cause my boaty niggas wade, and my Russians need that dope
Stay with that four-five for niggas thinking I'm 
Yeah kiate la boca 'fore I hit 'em when I drove by
 any nigga approach La, you know why 'cause they no lie
If you know La, I don't lie
If I say so you gon' die
I'm the shit, more niggas than a 
Done pimped more bitches than Don Juan
I'm pimping right now while the song's on
My bitches don't play, them 30's on
My niggas don't play, our arm is long
Feeling like Jordan nigga, this our song
23 hour shifts all night long
Y'all regular niggas act like shones
That 40 cal gon' take him away
Like a landlord I put him in place
Nigga dead from a pole off the waist
Seperate his head from the front of his face
Take his legs, turn them under his waist
Bitch ass feds tryna build a case
Lookin' ass niggas, I'll give 'em DNA
I fuck your wife and I nut in your face
Everybody who I'm with
Strapped down with AR's and mack
First nigga get outta line
Get mopped up with this thirty clip
Niggas talkin' this world shit
When I see niggas we sayin' shit
We the same niggas, no fuck boys
Smoke a lotta good, we makin' noise
BBG nigga, we the winning team
Nigga and I touched a lotta green
And I fucked a lotta hoes
You niggas don't do it how we do it
36 oh, that's a brick nigga
And the claims are coming like Wal-Mart
Yo, Spook and me writing from the start
We don't care what's happnin' just know we clappin
When the tappin' is with the action
All my niggas they shoot us, nigga
All my niggas we move, nigga
Fuck around with y'all ho niggas

Surfed up, we ain't done
Perked up and I'm racked up
Summertime, we gon' strap up

Free baby 'fore the touch down
Backed in, bitch would let me fuck
Got me all up in them guts now
Imma fuck a bitch, where them licks at
Dawg gotta stick, we gon' hit that
And we bringin' around pounds like a Kit-Kat
Probably be there 'fore we get back

What's on my grind, that's all the time
Got a Meech on the sides that's satisfied
Bitch all you got was Dennis Rod
Them days in the 
All them shootoffs we done survive

Damn my niggas, they down to ride
Come at me, that's a homicide
Come a nigga bullet he fishin' for the ride
Got money, power, enemy 'spect

Me and Quaddy Goon tryna talk about life
When I be on the lean, he checks with a Sprite
Man, y'all never get me on shit like I can't rap
Hey, yo, cut the fucking beat back on before Spook get back
Qu-Qu-Quaddy Goon's up in the mix

Text your bitch, she coming through
She coming through, she sucking dick
Suck my dick so good, I'm like
"God damn, you dirty bitch
You dirty bitch, you dirty bitch"

You already know the team
BBG my crew!
