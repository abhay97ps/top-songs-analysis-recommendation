Weeell,. they had to have something new
A dance to do for recreation so someone started twistin'
A cat who was really hep, put down a step
A new gyration soon, all the kids were twistin'
It didn't take long before the grown-ups were trying it
Who's who was buying it all over town
You see them, a-squirming and a-worming and a-twistin' around
It spread like a forest blaze, became a craze
That rocks the nation now, everybody's twistin'
Well oh well oh well oh well, they had to have something new
A dance to do for recreation so someone started twistin'
And a cat who was really hep, he put down a step
A new gyration soon, all the kids were twistin'
No, it didn't take long before the grown-ups were trying it
Who's who was buying it all over town
You'll see them, a-squirming and a-worming and a-twisting around
It spread like a forest blaze, became a craze
That rocks the nation now, everybody's twistin'
There's a-hopping, and a slopping, and a floppin'
Sacroilliac's a popping, everybody's twistin'. Bop!
