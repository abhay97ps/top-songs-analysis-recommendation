Traveling with the rodeo
It's the only life I'll ever know
I started in New Mexico
Must have been a thousand years ago
I used to be the best they say
At riding young wild horses for my pay
But now I'm much too old it seems
I only ride wild horses in my dreams
They used to tell me
Ride em, cowboy
Don't let em throw you down
You can't make no money
If you hit the ground
They said, ride em cowboy
Don't let em throw you down
You're the toughest cowboy in town
I've always been a traveling cowboy
But now there's no place left to go
What am I supposed to do
Seems I'm left out in the cold
Old Midnight was a champion
He's the only bronc I couldn't ride
But now I hear old Midnight's blind
And rides the little children for a dime
Ladies used to hang around
I must have been a hero in their eyes
My silver spurs are rusty now
Lord, I wish I'd tried to settle down
They used to tell me
Traveling with the rodeo
It's the only life I'll ever know
