Ar Let's Twist
To the pretty melody of the dove
Let's Twist
Baby baby this is the dance of love
Ar Let's fly
To the heaven's high in the sky above
And I
Wanna tell you  dreamin' of
Yeah
I got my eyes on you on through the twistin'
Hopin' that when we're through we'll do some kissin'
Baby you know it's wrong to be resistin'
We gotta fall in love if we keep twistin'
Ar Let's twist
To the pretty melody of the dove
Yeah Let's twist
Baby baby this is the dance of love
Ar Let's fly
To the heaven's high in the sky above
And I
Wanna tell you  dreamin' of
I got my eyes on you on through the twistin'
Hopin' that when we're through we'll do some kissin'
Yeah Let's twist
To the pretty melody of the dove
Yeah Let's Twist
Baby baby this is the dance of love
