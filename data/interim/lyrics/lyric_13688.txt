You wear a mask of burnin' gold
Your heart is wild, but your touch is cold
I ask myself, are you my enemy?
Or is it just the fire, the fire in you and me?
Two sides to every soul
And in my most unfaithful hour
I keep a vision in my mind of you
Am I forgiven?
Let me be forgiven
You wear your love much too thin
You push me away just to pull me in
I ask myself, is faith that way?
If I reason it, do I reason it all away?
Two sides to every soul
And in my most unfaithful hour
I keep a vision in my mind of you
Am I forgiven?
Let me be forgiven
Am I forgiven?
Let me be forgiven
There are times
When I feel alone
Then I find
That you're there all along, yeah
Am I forgiven?
Let me be forgiven
I'm on my way
Let me be forgiven
I said on, on my way
To a promised land
