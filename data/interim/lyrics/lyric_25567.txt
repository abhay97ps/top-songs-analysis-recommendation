Cook that shit up, Quay
Lil Baby
I've been riding around, yeah, hundred times around
I been riding 'round in rental cars, tryna lay low
I'm a real soldier, boy, I really play with Dracos
Took the whole gang from out the hood and put 'em on the payroll
Having flashbacks of hittin' the red with the Karo
She just had a baby for me, so I paid to get her makeover
I was being calm, it's like it's they beg for me to take over
180 on the Range Rover, 400 on a Rolls truck 
300 on a G-Wagen , I'm a big dawg, you can add it up
Something wrong with him, he ain't addin' up
We laugh at them, they mad at us
It's a home run, I'm batter up
My earrings like baseballs
Clout chasers, I hate y'all
I don't see people like Ray Charles
Where I'm from, we don't do fraud
You a kingpin or a takegod?
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love 
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up 
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up 
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love 
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud
Who you know, nigga? Street niggas call me Pluto
Really I'm a trap nigga, I can wrap a kilo 
Sippin' sizzurp took me number one, no promo 
I'm in spaceships, I'm in Mars on the low-low 
I'm in the Phantom with the stars, feel like Fabo 
I got million dollar stars on my payroll, huh
I feel like you different once you make it out the mud
Got a brand new Richard, I can't wait to hold it up
VV, cut it up, got all new baguettes in it, cut it up 
One, brrt, call, that's all, brrt, pu-pullin' up 
This bag make a bad, bad bitch call up and quit her job 
Where I'm from you either gotta murder, if you make it out, you a god
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love 
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up 
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up 
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud
Out the mud
I feel like you different when you get it out the mud
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up
