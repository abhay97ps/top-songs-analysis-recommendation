Whodunit
Who stole my baby
Whodunit
Everyone in the room looks shady
Whodunit
Who stole my girl from me 
Whodunit
Who took my honey
Whodunit
I know the motive was not funny
Whodunit
It's a bedside mystery 
Hey, where's the phone to call Sherlock Holmes
I've been framed by what's his name
And he's gettin' away
Charlie Chan, see if you can
Help me find those two, won't you
Where were you on the night of the 12th
She went dancin' in the dark
Somebody stole her heart
Ellery Queen if you're so keen
Won't you help me find my sweet thing 
Whodunit
Who stole my baby
Whodunit
Everyone in the room looks shady
Whodunit
Who stole my girl from me 
Whodunit
Who took my honey
Whodunit
I know the motive was not funny
Whodunit
It's a bedside mystery
The place is surrounded
Nobody leaves till I found her
Until this case is solved
It's up against the wall, you all
Whodunit
Who stole my baby
Whodunit
Everyone in the room looks shady
Whodunit
Who stole my girl from me
Whodunit
Who took my honey
Whodunit
I know the motive was not funny
Whodunit
It's a bedside mystery
Whodunit
Who stole my baby
Whodunit
Everyone in the room looks shady
Whodunit
Who stole my girl from me
