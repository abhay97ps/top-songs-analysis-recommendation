There she goes, she's walkin' away
Each step she takes brings heartaches my way
He's won her heart, I lost her some way
There she goes, she's walkin' away
If I hadn't cheated, if I hadn't lied
I'd be the one who's walkin' by her side
I love her still and I guess that it shows
She's walkin' away, there she goes
There she goes!
She's walkin' away
Each step she takesâ€¦ brings
Heartaches my way
If I hadn't cheated, if I hadn't lied
I'd be the one who's walkin' by her side 
I love her still and I guess that it shows
She's walkin' away, there she goes
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes
