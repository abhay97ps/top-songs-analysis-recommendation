Oh yeah
Watch it, ooh!
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right
And aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away and make it OK
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control
So we waited
I put on a show
Now I make it
I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you 
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you 
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas
I don't need to try to control you 
Look into my eyes and I'll own you 
With them moves like Jagger 
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
Maybe it's hard when you feel like you're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right
But when you're with me, I'll make you believe
That I've got the key
So get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
Like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you 
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you 
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas
I don't need to try to control you 
Look into my eyes and I'll own you 
With them moves like Jagger 
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain 
But it's all right 
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you  {Take me by the tongue}
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you  {Yeah yeah}
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas {Oh yeah}
I don't need to try to control you  {Yeah}
Look into my eyes and I'll own you  {Oh oh}
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas
