Where in the world
Did I do it wrong
My little chickadee
You still belong here
In my arms, no matter what you do
Where in the world
Did I let you down
My little chickadee
When you were around
The world was sunny, seems funny now
It used to be roses
It used to be wine
Two crazy people only havin' a time
Then out of the blue
It seemed to flicker and die
You never tried to save me from the broken heart 
All the time you told me that we'd never part
Where in the world
Did I do it wrong
My little chickadee
You still belong here
In my arms, no matter what you do
Where in the world
Did I let you down
My little chickadee
When you were around
The world seemed sunny, all funny now
It used to be love fires
And barbecue stew
And walks in the rain
A home we got soaked through
I thought you would always be happy with me
I never saw this thing that came about you 
I only know I'm lonely girl, without you
Where in the world
Did I do it wrong
My little chickadee
You still belong here
In my arms, no matter what you do
Oh baby, yeah now
My pretty little chickadee
Everything is gonna be all right
Yes it will, yes it will now
