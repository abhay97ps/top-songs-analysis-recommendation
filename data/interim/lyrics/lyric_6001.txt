Sitting in the morning sun
I'll be sitting till the evening come
Watching the ship roll in
And I'll watch em roll away again, yeah
Watching the tide 
Ooh, Lord, sitting on the dock of the bay
Wasting time, time
I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco Bay
I have nothing to live for
Seems like nothing's
Gonna come my way
Let me hear you say
Watching the tide 
Ooh, Lord, sitting on the dock of the bay
And I'm just wasting time
Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything remains the same
I can't do what ten people
Wants me to do now
So I guess I'll remain the same
Hey, sitting here resting my bones
Cause this loneliness won't leave me alone
Two thousand miles I roam
Just to make this dock my home
Let me hear you all say now
Watching the tide 
Ooh, Lordy, Lord, now
Sitting on the dock of the bay
And I'm wasting time, ooh
