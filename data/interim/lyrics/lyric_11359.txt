Here we are baby just you and me
Holdin' each other tight as can be
If I ask the question and you don't answer me
Well say not tonight and then I'll leave
Well say maybe later I don't know
Say maybe baby but don't say no
Here we are baby under the moonlight
Everything feels right - oh what a night
If I ask the question and you don't answer me
Well say not tonight and then I'll leave
Well say maybe later I don't know
Say maybe baby but don't say no
Well baby hold me tight
Turn them lights down low
And if it feels alright
You can never say no
Never say no
Here we are baby under the moonlight
Everything feels right - oh what a night
If I ask the question and you don't answer me
Well say not tonight and then I'll leave
Well say maybe later I don't know
Say maybe baby - don't say no
Maybe later I don't know
Say maybe baby - don't say no
