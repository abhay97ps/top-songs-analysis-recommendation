All alone I sit looking out at the window
And the rain just keeps coming on down
Well, I cried to myself so many things I've done wrong
Now I'm watching you walk out
There goes my baby moving on down the line
Wonder where, wonder where
Wonder where he is bound
I broke his heart and made him cry
Now I'm alone, so all alone
What can I do?  What can I do?
 What can I do?
Said I'll sing this sad, sad song.  
Oh, oh, oh
I broke his heart and I made him cry
Now I'm alone, so all alone
What can I do?  What can I do?
Where is he going?
How is he?  What is he going through?
Where is he going and what on earth could he be going through?
I wanna know
There goes my baby moving on down the line
Wonder where, wonder where
Wonder where he is bound
I broke his heart and made him cry
Now I'm alone, so all alone
What can I do?  What can I do?
Where is he going?
How is he?  What is he going through?
Where is he going and what on earth could he be going through?
I wanna know
There goes my baby moving on down the line
Oooh, baby.  Come on home.  Oh, oh, oh
I broke his heart and made him cry
Now I'm alone, so all alone
What can I do?  What can I do?
 Sing this song forever
 Till we're back together
 Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh
 Wee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee
There goes my baby
