You can't stop an avalanche as it races down the hill
You can try to stop the seasons, girl, but you know you never will
And you can try to stop my dancing feet, but I just cannot stand still
Cause the world keeps spinning 'round and 'round
And my heart's keeping time to the speed of sound
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way
Cause you can't stop the beat
Ever since this whole world began
A woman found out if she shook it she could shake up a man
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it the best that I can today
'Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the sun in the sky
You can wonder if you wanna, but I'll never ask why
If you try to hold me down I'm gonna spit in your eye and say
That you can't stop the beat
What do you have to say Penny?
I am now a checkerboard chick!
You can't stop the river as it rushes to the sea
You can try to stop the hands of time, but you know it just won't be
And if they try to stop us, Seaweed
I'll call the NAACP
'Cause the world keeps spinning 'round and 'round
'Round and 'round
And my heart's keeping time to the speed of sound
Speed of sound
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way
'Cause you can't stop the beat
Ever since we first saw the light
A man and woman liked to shake it on a Saturday night
So I'm gonna shake and shimmy it with all of my might today
'Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the rain from above
You can try to stop the paradise we're dreaming of
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay
'Cause you can't stop the beat
Tracy I have a little something I'd like to add
You can't stop my happiness, 'cause I like the way I am
And you just can't stop my knife and fork when I see a Christmas ham
So if you don't like the way I look, well, I just don't give a damn
Cause the world
Keeps spinning 'round and 'round
Keeps spinning 'round and 'round
And my heart's
Keeping time to the speed of sound
Keeping time to the speed of sound
I was lost
'til I heard the drums, then I found my way
'Til I heard the drums, then I found my way
Cause you can't stop the beat
Ever since this whole world began
A woman found out if she shook it she could shake up a man
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it the best that I can today
Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the sun in the sky
You can wonder if you wanna, but I never ask why
And if you try to hold me down I'm gonna spit in your eye
And say
That you can't stop the beat
Step aside  It's time to wrap this mother up!
Oh, oh, oh, you can't stop today 
As it comes speeding down the track 
Yesterday is history and it's never coming back 
'Cause tomorrow is a
Brand new day
Brand new day
And it don't know white from black 
'Cause the world
Keeps spinning 'round and 'round
Keeps spinning 'round and 'round
And my heart's
Keeping time to the speed of sound
Keeping time to the speed of sound
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way
'Til I heard the drums, then I found my way
Cause you can't stop the beat
Ever since this whole world began
A man and woman like to shake it on a Saturday night
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it with all of my might
'Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the rain from above
You can try and stop the paradise we're dreaming of
If you try to hold me down I'm gonna spit in your eye and say
That you can't stop the beat
*vocalizing*
Come on Von Tussle's you can shake your dandy muscles
No we can't!
Yes you can!
No we can't!
Yes you can!
Yes we can!
You can't stop the beat
Ever since we first saw the sun
It seems Vantussle girls are always tryin'
Please someone
But now we're gonna shake and shimmy
And just have some fun today
'Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the rain from above
You can try and stop the paradise we're dreaming of
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay
You can't stop the beat
You can't stop the beat
You can't stop the beat
You can't stop the beat
You can't stop the beat

Blood on the pavement, what a mess
Is that your eyeball on my dress?
Don't drink and drive, please keep your head
Or come graduation day, you'll be dead
Hands on the wheel, though I know it's a drag
I'd hate to see that body in a body bag
Hey listen up 'cause I'm a Mom
Put on the belt or we'll ruin your prom
