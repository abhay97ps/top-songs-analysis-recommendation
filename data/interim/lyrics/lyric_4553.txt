I like the way, you call my name
It sounds so nice
I could never explain
I like the way, you hold my hand
It lets me know that you understand
I like the way, you wanna kiss me
And I like the way, you always miss me
I like the way 
I like the way, you come around
To cheer me up, whenever I'm down
I like the way, you make me feel
The love we have, is so very real
I like the way, you wanna kiss me
And I like the way, you always miss me
I like the way 
I like the way, we kiss goodnight
It feels so good when you're holding me tight
I like the way, you wanna kiss me
And I like the way, you always miss me
I like the way 
I like the way
Oh, I like the way
I like the way
Oh, I like the way
