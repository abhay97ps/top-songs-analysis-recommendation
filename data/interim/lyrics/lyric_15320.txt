Maybe you and I see life with two different visions
And neither one of us is wrong or right
And maybe we're too serious and don't wanna listen
I just wanna make you laugh tonight
We're like day and night, night and day
We are both so different in so many ways
We're like night and day, day and night
And we go together just like black and white
Seems you're always out one door when I'm in the other
It's so hard to find some quiet time
Wish that we could spend our lives alone with each other
And never think about the world outside
We're like day and night, night and day
We are oh, so different in so many ways
We're like night and day, day and night
Still we know it's gonna be all right
And if we never really get the picture right
How many of us ever really win the fight?
I never want to loose your love
Or let the distance get the best of us
'cause time is moving fast enough!
Maybe we don't always share a common opinion
It's true that you and I don't think alike
But when I look into you eyes and all is forgiven
All I wanna do is hold you tight
We're like day and night, night and day
We are both so different in so many ways
We're like night and day, day and night
Still we know it's gonna be all right
We're like night and day, day and night
We go together just like black and white
We're like, we're like, we're like, we're like
Day and night, night and day
Day and night, night and day
We're like, we're like, we're like
Day and night, night and day
Like black and white
