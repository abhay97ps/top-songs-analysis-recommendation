I don't want to lose this good thing
That I've got, 'cause if I do
I would surely, surely lose a lot
'Cause your love is better than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock on wood, baby
I'm not superstitious about you
But I can't take no chance
Got me spinning, baby, baby, I'm in a trance
'Cause your love is better than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock on wood, baby
No secret, that woman fills my loving cup
'Cause she sees to it that I get enough
Just one touch from her
You know it means so much
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock on wood, baby
I better knock, knock, knock
Oh yeah, think I'd better knock, knock, knock on wood
Think I'd better knock, knock, knock on wood
Think I'd better knock, knock, knock on wood
Think I'd better knock, knock, knock
