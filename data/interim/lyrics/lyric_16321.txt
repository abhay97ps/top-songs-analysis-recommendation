I'm lying beside you, just thinking about us
To tired to go to sleep, I'm too much in love
I know I'm crazy, but I can't close my eyes
I'm scared you won't be there, in the morning when I rise
Will you be there..
Now who do you dreams about, when you're alone in your sleep
To who do you reach out, oh let it be me
Now baby, you're my obsession, my addiction, my drug
Don't wanna be without you, when I wake up
Oh no..
Chorus:
Will you be there in the morning
Will you be there when I want to
Will you be there when I wake up
I need you to be there
In the morning
Will you be there..
You're so close to me, but I feel so alone
The more that I touch you, the more I want
Don't know what to do, about me loving you
But I pray to God, that you feel it to
Now baby, you're my obsession, my addiction, my drug
So let the candle grow, into a great fire of love
Chorus:
Will you be there in the morning
Will you be there when I want to
Will you be there when I wake up
I need you to be there
In the morning
I wanna love you forever
Don't want a love that now or never
Can't you see you got me down on the floor
I want more, more
Chorus:
Will you be there in the morning
Will you be there when I want to
Will you be there when I wake up
Will you be there in the morning
Will you be there
Will you be there when I want to
Will you be there when I wake up
