Y'all know what's goin' on
21 Gang 'til I'm gone
4L Gang 'til I'm gone
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon'â€”
Roll the window down, stick the Glock out 
This chopper got a AMP, I'ma rock out 
When it's time for smoke, they gon' cop out 
This AK47 made in Moscow 
All these dead bodies got me seein' strange things 
Both sides of the gun, I done dealt and felt the pain 
Drive-by? Nah, we the walk-up gang 
I come from the 6 where they chalk up lames 
Slide in and out 
Spend the night? I doubt 
Gold grill mouth 
I come from the South 
We was stealin' cars
You was inside the house 
I know he gon' be a rat one day
Right now we call him a mouse 
I got lots of stripes, all my niggas shyst
You can roll the dice, you might lose your life
Keep my Desert Eagle on me, he not nothin' nice
I just need one Glock, Nas need one mic 
I done did a lot in the streets and them facts 
PTSD like I came from Iraq 
You made it from the gutter, then I'm tippin' my hat 
Don't go big on me, you might get hit with this MAC 
I don't need no holster, you get burned like toaster 
I don't drink no liquor, but I'm smokin' on mimosa 
We been gettin' that Jewish money, everything is Kosher 
Bought myself a 'Ventador and bought my bitch a Roadster 
Drive my Lambo to the store, I'ma wave with my doors
I'm on Glenwood, not the Ave., nigga, the road 
Talkin' on the pillow, nigga, that shit for the hoes 
I'd never snitch on my enemies or my bros 
I'm so 21, dawg, I'm so SG 
I'm so 4L Gang, I keep a Glock, not an XD 
Head so good, she not even white, I still call her Becky 
Richard Mille cost so much I could push a button and see next week 
.30 on the glizzy, got my pants dizzy 
Playin' 'round with Savage, you get shot in the kidney 
So many drums, he gon' think a band hit him 
Chopper clapped his ass, he thought a hand hit him 
I do the BlocBoy JB on a brick 
Make your crew do the Electric Slide with this stick 
She don't get no new Chanel, she gon' throw a fit 
I wanna buy that girl the world, the way she suck this dick 
Fronted me some bags, I ran out the same night 
When I was in jail, on my momma, I ain't kite 
Niggas know I'm solid, I shoot and I fight 
You just wear Adidas, but in real life, I got stripes 
I got lots of stripes, all my niggas shiest'
You can roll the dice, you might lose your life
Keep my Desert Eagle on me, he not nothin' nice
I just need one Glock, Nas need one mic
My brother down the road, they tried to give him life
He swear he so creative, turned a toothbrush to a knife
Savage got your wifey playin' with herself on Skype
She thought the AC was on, it was just my ice
We pull up ready to shoot 
Y'all ready to fight 
Pull up, ready to kill 
Y'all ready to die 
Broke-ass nigga get killed ridin' a bike 
Savage left his gun at home, nigga, yeah, right
