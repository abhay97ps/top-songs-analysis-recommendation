If you want a time to soul
Baby, it's time to soul time
Say you want a time to soul
Baby, it's time to soul time
We can have a time that's fine
If your time is soul with mine
Then we sing from nine to soul
Baby, we'd be on soul time
Ready, get set, now
Two, four, six, eight, ten
Two, four, six, eight, twenty-two
Two, four, six, eight, ten
Two, four, six, eight, twenty-two
One more time now
Two, four, six, eight, ooh
I'm synchronized with you
It's the feeling that gets to you
It's the feeling that gets to me too
Then we can synchronize the soul
Baby, we'll be on soul time
Ready, get set, now
Two, four, six, eight, ten
Two, four, six, eight, twenty-two
Two, four, six, eight, ten
Two, four, six, eight, twenty-two
One more time now
Two, four, six, eight, ooh
I'm synchronized with you
Ready, get set, now
Two, four, six, eight, ten
Two, four, six, eight, twenty-two
Four, six, eight, thirty-two
Four, six, eight, forty-two
Four, six, eight, fifty-two
Four, six, eight, sixty-two
Four, six, eight, seventy-two
Four, six, eight, eighty-two
Four, six, eight, ninety-two
Four, six, eight, twenty-two
Four, six, eight, thirty-two
Four, six, eight, forty-two
Four, six, eight, fifty-two
Four, six, eight, sixty-two
Four, six, eight, seventy-two...
