1 Fergie:
I ain't got time for you baby
Either you're mine, or you're not
Make up your mind sweet baby
Right here, right now's all we got
A little party never killed nobody
So we gonna dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now's all we got
All these diamonds, trips around the world
Don't mean a thing if I ain't your girl
A little party never killed nobody
So we gonna dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now's all we got
A little party never killed nobody
So we gonna dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now's all we got
Q-Tip
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got
Glad that you made it, look around
You don't see one person sitting down
They got drinks in their hands
And the rooms a bust
At the end of the night maybe you'll find love
Fake chit chat bout the things they got
And my scout reputation keeping it hot girl
At the party of the year I'm a master plan
If you make me realize I'm your man
If the people get lost, underneath the moonlight
Hotsy-totsy, paparazzi, hold it while I take this flick
Speak easy, rocking the feathers I'm breezy
Hope you can keep up boys, cause believe me, I'm the bee's knees
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, oh
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes
Papa that ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, oh
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, oh
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes
Papa that ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, oh
Just one nights all we got
Just one nights all we got
Just one nights all we got
Just one nights all we got
What do you think Goonrock?
Are you ready?
A little party never killed nobody
So we gonna dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now's all we got
A little party never killed nobody
So we gonna dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
