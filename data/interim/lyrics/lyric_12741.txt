Walkin' sadly through the park
I hear cryin' in the darkness
And though I act like I cannot hear
Their situation is very clear
A girl who's trying to tell her guy
The time has come that they say goodbye
And his answer tears my heart apart
Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl, I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you
Walkin' with you through the park
Now it's my voice in the darkness
Just like the girl tryin' to tell her guy
I'm telling you we must say goodbye
I can't believe when I hear once more
The very words that were said before
Come from deep within your broken heart
Your voice echoes in the dark
Your voice echoes in the dark
Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl, I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you
Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl, I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you
Gim-gim, gimme tonight
Gi, gi, gi, gi, gi, gi, gi, gi, gi, gi, gi, gi, gimme tonight
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gim-
His voice echoes in the darkness
Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl, I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you
Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl, I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you
Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl, I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you
Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl, I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you
