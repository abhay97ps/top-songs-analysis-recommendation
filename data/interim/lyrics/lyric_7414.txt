You do me wrong but still
I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long
And I can't do without you
Every chance you get
You seem to hurt me
More and more
But each hurt makes my love
Much stronger than before
I know that flowers
Grow with the rain
But how can love
Grow with the pain
Ain't that peculiar
Ain't that peculiar
You tell me lies that
Should be obvious to me
But I'm so much
In love with you, baby
That I don't want to see
That the things you do and say
Are designed to make me blue
Now, it's a doggone shame
My love for you makes
All your lies seem true
Now, if the truth
Makes love last longer
Why do lies make
My love stronger
Ain't that peculiar
Ain't that peculiar
You do me wrong but still
I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long
And I can't do without you
Every chance you get
You seem to hurt me
More and more
But each hurt makes my love
Much stronger than before
I know that flowers
Grow with the rain
But how can love
Grow with the pain
Ain't that peculiar
Ain't that peculiar
Ain't that peculiar
Ain't that peculiar
Ain't that peculiar
Ain't that peculiar
