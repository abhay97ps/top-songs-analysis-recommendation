They talkin bout pullin up with a pole
I fight for mines and that's on my‚ÄÖsoul
Nighas‚ÄÖactin hard like‚ÄÖthey Alcapone
Smoke em out with that‚ÄÖantidote
You say you iced out below 32 on froze
Ya you‚Åüsomeone‚Åüthat‚Äôs‚Åüwell known
But I'm‚Åüsomeone that everybody‚Åüknows
Ride on the track and vibe with the flow
Stay on my feet gotta stay 10 toes
At the start line I ain't gonna look back
Seein ahead checkered on the flags
Ain‚Äôt slowin down Imma keep goin fast
Starin down the barrel that's 45 on the mag
NASCAR flo like I'm racin on my track
Lookin at the ghanja sittin in the bag
Always gotta be 1st sore loser hate bein last
Saw what the name said up on the toe tag
Feelin like I'm slowin down smokin on this pack
Do em like tereo ooo Imma kill em
In the jungle and I'm hangin with gorillas
You real I'm üíØ can't get no more realer
I'm drinkin henny you drinkin on that miller
It‚Äôs my nightmare ya it‚Äôs goin be a thriller
100 shots ya 99 hit em
Make that choppa sing like it's Bryson Tiller
Ain‚Äôt on my level nigha needa get his skill up
Got some bad bitties with me and they all be vanilla
Like I'm Malcom cause I'm all up in the middle
Like I'm Malcom cause I‚Äôm all up in the middle
Like I'm Malcom cause I'm all up in the middle
Walk out like that nigha like I hit the lotto
Cause I'm gettin money talkin bout that guapo
Smokin on the package ya that shit gellato
Ain't comin like Freddy on Elm St. but like Jimmy Woppo
Got a white girl with me I'm trappin like the Narcos
So much weight on me I feel like I'm El Chappo
Nighas wanna run my fade
Y'all nighas jus love to hate
That 6 and that 9 runnin mates
Full house like Mary Kate
Switch it up I'm gainin the rate
No hope, faith, or grace
Destiny wants to decide my fate
Runnin up the money, goin thru a paper maze
Look you in your soul it's filled with hate
Tape comin soon jus waitin for a date
Shit be funny, Goophy is my trait
Exquisite done been my taste
See you in person now what you gotta say
Now that we face to face
No words needa exchange
We can throw em if need be, these hands is my trade
You a shame a big disgrace, actin scary cause you afraid
Loyalty, Honesty, Trust, and Realness was how I was made
Goophs the new wave, play with my words, my lyrics persuade
High class, while I'm high in class, high score, A be my grade
My legacy is a legend, my performance on Tony the Tiger cause I'm great
Clean off my slate, empty off my plate, and stack up my crates
Flyin without a cape, lay you out flat like a pancake, foreign be my crepes
Speaking out your neck, talkin reckless when you prate
Get my mind right, need to get my head on straight
I said before feel like El Chappo with the weight
Bring the shipment in by the freight
Movin with the way, Gooph the current when I sway
Without a contract, I be all up front like I'm prepaid
Bust, bust, bust down pendant not emerald or ruby talkin all jade
