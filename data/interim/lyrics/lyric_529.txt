Just a little girl in love
Counting every star above
A certain boy has caught her eye
A certain boy has caught the eye
Of Little Miss Blue
Oh, Little Miss Blue
You'll give away your heart, it's true
To someone who'll never care
Someone who'll never ever care
For Little Miss Blue
And I wonder if you'll always
Always, always be blue
Or someday, you will find
A someone who loves you
Oh, Little Miss Blue
Tell you what I'm gonna do
If you'll give me a chance
If you'll just give me a chance
I really love you
She's counting every star above
A certain boy has caught the eye
Of Little Miss Blue
And I wonder if you'll always
Always, always be blue
Or someday, you will find
A someone who loves you
Oh, Little Miss Blue
Tell you what I'm gonna do
If you'll give me a chance
If you'll just give me a chance
I really love you
Mm, Little Miss Blue
I really love you
