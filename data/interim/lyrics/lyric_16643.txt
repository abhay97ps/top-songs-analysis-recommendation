Operator, get my baby on the line
'Cause just the other night
We had a horrible fight
I admit that I, I was out of control
But I still love my man
With my body and soul
When the road gets rough
You say thangs you should not say
I never meant to treat my baby that way
I apologize
Oh, believe me I do
I apologize
Oh honest and true
Because I know I was wrong
And so I'll sing you this song
And I'm tryna get through
And make it up to you, yes
Operator, it was like a bad dream
And Lord you should have heard
The way he shouted and the way that I screamed
I regret it 'cause I was unfair
I took it all out on him
Just because he was there
When the road gets rough
You say thangs you should not say
I never meant to treat my daddy that way
I apologize
Oh, believe me I do
I apologize
Oh honest and true
Because I knew I was wrong
So I'll sing you this song
And I'm gonna get through, yeah
And make it up to you
I apologize for I was unkind
And I wish that I could go back in time
Erase the good-byes
And rewrite my life
But come rain or come shine
I'm wanna do it right this time
I apologize
Oh baby, I do
Because I knew I was wrong
That's why I'm singing my my my song
Yeah yeah yes
I apologize, oh yes
I apologize, oh yes, oh yes
Because I know I was wrong
And so I sing you this song
And I wanna get, I gotta get, I need to get through to you, yeah yeah
 Oh listen, oh baby
 I'm talking to you right now, oh, I'm talking to you
I was wrong, baby, listen to me right now
Singing it to you right now, I was wrong
