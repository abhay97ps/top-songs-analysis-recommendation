Everything will be alright, yeah
The heart is stronger than you think
It's like it can go through anything
And even when you think it can't
It finds a way to still push on, though
Sometimes you wanna run away
Ain't got the patience for the pain
And if you don't believe it, look into your heart
The beat goes on, oh
I'm tellin' you, things get better, through whatever
If you fall, dust it off, don't let up
Don't you know you can go be your own miracle?
You need to know, ooh yeah
If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough
But the heart keeps telling you don't give up
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Don't give up
Through it all, just stand up!
Ooh, it's like we all had better days
Problems getting all up in your face
Just because you go through it
Don't mean it gotta take control, no-oh-oh
You ain't gotta find no hiding place
Because the heart can beat the hate
Don't wanna let the mind keep playin' you
And sayin' you can't go on
I'm tellin' you, things get better, through whatever
If you fall, dust it off, don't let up
Don't you know you can go be your own miracle?
If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough 
But the heart keeps telling you don't give up 
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what? 
Don't give up 
Through it all, just stand up! 
Through it all, just stand up! 
You don't gotta be a prisoner in your mind
If you fall, dust it off
You can live your life 
Let your heart be your guide 
Oh-ooh 
And you will know that you're good if you trust in the good
Everything will be alright, yeah 
Light up the dark if you follow your heart
And it will get better
Through whatever
If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough 
But the heart keeps telling you don't give up 
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?  
Don't give up 
Through it all, just stand up! 
If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough 
But the heart keeps telling you don't give up  
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what? 
Don't give up 
Through it all, just stand up!
You got it in you, find it within 
You got it in you, find it within now
You got it in you, find it within
You got it in you, find it within now 
You got it in you, find it within 
You got it in you, find it within now
Find it within you, find it within
Through it all, just stand up!
