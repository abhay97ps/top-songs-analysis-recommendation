My love is higher than a mission bell 
Deeper than wishin' well 
Stronger than a magic spell
My love  for you
It's wider than the widest sea 
Longer than a memory 
Sweeter than a honey tree
My love , oh, oh, oh 
My love , mm, mm, mm  for you
Give me your heart of gold
Your heavenly magic touch
To cherish, have, and hold
I need your love so much
My love is warmer than a day in spring 
Brighter than a diamond ring 
Braver than a mighty king
My love  for you
It's taller than the tallest tree 
Softer than a summer breeze
All I ask you, please
Give  your love 
Your love , sweet love  to me
 higher than a mission bell
 deeper than a wishin' well
 stronger than a magic spell
