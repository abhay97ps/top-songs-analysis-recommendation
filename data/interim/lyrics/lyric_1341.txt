Follow that dream, I got to follow that dream
Keep a-moving, move along, keep a moving
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need
When your heart gets restless, time to move along
When your heart gets weary, time to sing a song
But when a dream is calling you
There's just one thing that you can do
Well, you got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
You got to follow that dream to find the love you need
Keep a-moving, move along, keep a moving
Got to find me someone whose heart is free
Someone to look for my dream with me
And when I find her I may find out
Just what my dreams are all about
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need
Keep a-moving, move along
Keep a-moving, move along
Keep a-moving, move along
