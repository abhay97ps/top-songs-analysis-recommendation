Wanna take it all back to where it started
Life of the party
Right where my heart at
Soon as what I want come in, I say anything goes
On the road, cool, ridin' 'round with the top down
Nowhere to go to, decide that I'll just ride 'round
She a drug abuser from a broken heart, oh, oh
Got a bad addiction, I been druggin' hard all month long
I'm in that Wraith, I ain't got nothin' but some residue on me
I'm chasin' a check to the morning
I'm in the trenches with smokers and steppers and loners
Somethin' more than one Schedule II on me
Matter fact, just a convicted felon, I'm keepin' my weapon
I'm pourin' more blood on that money
Owe it all to the youngin who feel that he owe the ones
Put addiction 'fore hunger
I ain't got no peak, leave blood inside the streets
Used to wash my clothes inside the sink, now a young nigga walk on mink
Takin' care of my dawg, made myself a boss, they gon' take one off, he blink
'Fore a nigga had fame, I was sittin' in a cell, young nigga takin' off them links
She gon' play with her nose all night
Shoot three doses 'fore the night end
Lipstick bottle full of white, I know
Told her that I like it, I like it
These niggas, they talk too much, can't tell what I did, I did
I always been there for you, you don't even excite me
Tryna take it all back to where it started
Life of the party
Right where my heart at
Soon as what I want come in, I say anything goes
Puttin' you over them hoes, my money gon' grow
Tell 'em it's tax evasion
I ain't discussin' business, not over the phone
Meet up, I'm real impatient
Relocate, I'ma switch locations
Tell 'em I need me a spot where it's vacant
Rep where I'm from, I'm a 38 Baby
Never give up, try again like Plankton
Bitch nigga still hatin' and his ship start sinkin'
Titanic watch,gon' save my life, they can't keep that plank in, yeah
His money right, he gon' take your life, he armed and dangerous, yeah
Pain in his eyes, up all night, constant thinkin'
Tryna take it all back to where it started
Life of the party
Right where my heart at
Soon as what I want come in, I say anything goes
