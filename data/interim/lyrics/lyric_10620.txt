I swear that was the last time I'm gonna replace the stars
With heaven in a mason jar
Stuck with ugly faces, scarred
Makes it hard to keep composure for the camera
Still the lights flash
Now I'm frozen with my hands up
They told me what the plan was but i left it at the bus stop
Now it's probably riding down Chicago with a traffic cop
It has to stop
Or my theory's out the window
And down the street behind the building
Back where broken men go
I swear that was the last Jack Pollock I'll be splattering
Never should've dove head first into the shallow end
Hey, welcome back again
I heard you got your head stuck
Between a rock, a hard place, a gypsy and and a bread truck
I swear that was the last time I'll swear that was the last time
Last time was different 'cause I came back from a flatline
And walked around with pamphlets
Asking if you heard the good news
Looked through the stained glass
And sang the pop the hood blues
Overheated car smoke dancing out the engine block
Hot enough to tie the brutal sun into a crimson knot
Prison thoughts pace round my skull with no escape plan
Grey hands flip coins and lie wherever fate lands
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
What's the use of beating old war drums for past crimes?
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
Lend a helping hand to a man that walks the path blind
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
What's the use of beating old war drums for past crimes?
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
I won't come round here again until the flask's dry
Itâ€™s time to take the stand, raise your hand
Try to beat the case again
Why'd you shake the branch deeply rooted in forsaken land
It's not your place to operate on patience you keep locked away
Not today, yesterday, tomorrow
What you got to say?
No excuse, searching for words that never come
Spent your youth and all your kids'
Trying to stay forever young
Place the severed tongue of Saint Paul upon the pedestal
List the lives you'd settle for and all the truths you'll never know
Let it go, let it go, let it go forever more
Chalk it up to weathered storms
This ain't the worse you're better for
Took it down to the bone, bone marrow
Shot a lone, lone arrow at a stone, stone sparrow
Killing two birds with one word
Spell it with a searchlight
Honor it for two days and sell it on the third night
The path to hell is paved with politician's promises
A handshake, a smile, and every lie that's crossed their lips
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
Lend a helping hand to a man that walks the path blind
