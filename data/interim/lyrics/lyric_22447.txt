Ah, your butt is mine
Gonna take you right, ah
Just show your face
In broad daylight, ah
I'm telling you
On how I feel, ah
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
Shamone, shamone
Get on me all right...
Ah, I'm giving you
On a count of three, ah
Ah
I'm telling you
Just to watch your mouth, ah
Ah
But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true, ah
But my friends, you have seen nothing
Just wait 'til I get though
Because I'm bad, I'm bad 
Come on, ah
You know I'm bad, I'm bad 
You know it, ah
Uh, you know I'm bad, I'm bad 
Come on, you know
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again who's bad
Ah, ah, the word is out
You're doin' wrong
Gonna lock you up
Before too long, ah
Your lyin' eyes
Gonna take you right 
So listen up
Don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap
You're not a man 
You're throwin' stones
To hide your hands 
But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true, ah
But my friends, you have seen nothing
Just wait 'til I get through
Because I'm bad, I'm bad 
Come on
You know I'm bad, I'm bad 
You know it
Uh, you know I'm bad, I'm bad 
Come on, you know
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again who's bad
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Huuuuh
Hwoah, woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah!
Ah, we can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place, dah
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Then won't you slap my face
{Because I'm bad}, I'm bad 
Come on, ah
You know I'm bad, I'm bad 
You know it, ah
You know I'm bad, I'm bad 
Come on, you know
Woo! Woo! Woo!
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
You know I'm bad, I'm bad 
You know it, ah
You know I'm bad, 
You know, woo! Ah
You know I'm bad, I'm bad 
You know it, you know, ah 
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again who's bad?
