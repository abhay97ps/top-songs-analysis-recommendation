Love, what have you done, oh wow
I was sure up 'til now
That she was a friend
I stayed 'til the end
I once believed that love was fair
But I don't anymore
She said I'm a bore
My heart hit the floor
Each time around I tell myself
"It's the game of love"
Ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love
Well, I've decided I can't let nobody hurt me again
So I'll say it 'til the end
I just don't wanna be a fool 
Said I don't wanna be a fool ever again
Whenever a fool's in love
He doesn't know he's to blame
He's caught in the game
It all ends up the same
He looks at love in a different way
It breaks his heart every time
They all turn estranged
But he'll never change
Oh, next time around I'll tell myself
"It'll be better than before"
I won't look back, there'll be no one
Tearing my heart out anymore, my baby
I've just decided I can't let nobody fool me again
So I'll swear 'til the end
I just don't wanna be a fool 
Said I don't wanna be a fool ever again
 I mean no more
 Ooh, no never
 Can't be, no way
No way, no way
Ooh, I don't want to be
I don't want to be a fool, no
Any way, any way, any way, no
I know, I know it'll be alright now
'Cause I decided not to let nobody kill me again
So I'll say it 'til the end
I just don't wanna be a fool 
Said I don't wanna be a fool never, never again
 Can't be a fool
 Ever again
 Never, oh never, oh never again
 Can't be a fool
