I hear tell it's far away
And no one goes there now
But if we set our sights you know
We'll get there somehow
Come on darlin' let's
Take our chances we'll
Take them all the way and ...
Shoot for the moon
Remember nights you blinked your eyes
And the moon winked back at you
Now it was not so distand then
If your aim was true
Let's throw our dreams together
And seal it with a kiss
There is no way we can miss...
We'll shoot for the moon
Shoot for the moon
