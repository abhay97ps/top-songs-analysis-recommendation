Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes
Watching the ships come in
And I watch 'em sail away again
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time
I left my home in Georgia
For the San Francisco bay
I felt I had nothing to live for
But I know something's gonna come my way
So I'll just sit here on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time
Yeah, and it looks like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yeah
Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
I'm too tired for having fun
So I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time
Oh, where were you, baby?
Nothing's gonna change
Yeah, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Everything's the same
Nothin', no, no, nothin's gonna change, baby
I ain't gonna change
I'm just gonna sit here
Sit, sit, sittin' on the dock of the bay
