It's so nice coming home to you
My heart belongs
Right at home with you
The road is a road
And it always is the same
It goes on and on
And never seems to change
Life on the road
Is the people we meet
And each one is like
A different street
There's so much to see
And so many things to be
But whatever you do
Don't forget about me
Come on
It's so nice coming home to you
Baby, my heart belongs
Right at home with you
One more time
It's so nice coming home to you
My heart belongs
Right at home with you
Lonely hours when I'm gone
All I want is to get back home
So look out your window
It won't be long
And let everybody know I'm coming home
It's so nice coming home to you
My heart belongs
Right at home with you
Everybody sing now
 It's so nice  coming home  to you
My heart belongs
Right at home with you
It's so nice coming home to you
My heart belongs
Right at home with you
