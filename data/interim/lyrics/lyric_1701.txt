I found a new baby
I found a new girl
My fashion plate baby
Has got me whirled
Her new kind of lovin'
Done made me her slave
Her sweet turtle dovin'
It's all that I crave
Sweetest miss
With a kiss full of bliss
Can't resist her somehow
Tells me lies but she's wise
Naughty eyes mesmerize
I vow and how
I don't mean maybe
I just had a fall
I found a new baby
Brand new baby, that's all
Sweetest miss
With a kiss full of bliss
Can't resist her somehow
Tells me lies but she's wise
Naughty eyes mesmerize
I vow and how
I don't mean maybe
I just had a fall
Found a new baby
Brand new baby, that's all
I found a new baby
Brand new baby, that's all
