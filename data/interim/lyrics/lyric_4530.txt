Yeah, uh , big blrrt
Yeah, blrrt, , blrrt, blrrt , blrrt
Let's go, let's go
Pooh, thats my snake with that Glock in the ride 
Pour up a four in the pineapple snap 
Life like a movie, I'm flippin' through chapters 
Seventeen months, I done turned to a rapper 
Said he want the smoke, now his folks lightin' candles 
She brought her friend, give a fuck 'bout the past 
Ayy broad daylight toe tag, we whack 'em 
Evеryday, buyin' new guns, we active
Big booty bitch, from thе back, make it tap 
Brand new hundred, two stick, can't count 
Pop a lil' Perc' while I'm tryna relapse 
Spin the block twice, nigga, that's a relap 
Drac' in my pants, now I walk with a limp 
If I'm feelin' offended, I'm takin' it out 
Bitch this is a robbery, better not move
Scarr strippin' 'em naked, I'm shakin' em down 
I love performin' with hoes on stage 
I just be pickin' bitches out the crowd
Designer Glocks, no throwaways 
We shoot to kill, gettin' shot in style 
I done got rich, now a lot of niggas nervous 
And I just been with a sister named Curry
Shootin' on the court, had them young niggas perishin' 
I can draw back, cut his life short early 
Fix a nigga's ass with the choppa like a surgeon 
Remember I was broke takin' baths in detergent
Now these red bottoms bleedin' on my feet like a virgin 
I could still sell a 'bow at the store by Curry 
Shots get pumped, yeah, a nigga, put the word in 
Call about some P's, I'ma get to it, urgent 
Young rich nigga, yeah, you know I'm still servin' 
Ain't gotta touch no money out of my deal
Nigga, been gettin' to it, now we just gettin' noticed
And we still in the hood on the green box posted
Settin' up shop every day, we open
If you on some dangerous shit, I'll promote it
If we wasn't slidin', we probably was scopin'
I got a play, you just gotta be cool
Give me some time, let me put it in motion
And you know they look up to slimy lil' dude
It ain't none but one of me, you niggas bogus
Uh, you niggas bogus , yup , yup
I done came up, hoes sayin' I'm cocky 
Thirty bad hoes in the hotel lobby 
Water drippin' off me like a Section 8 faucet 
Poppin' my shit, all my hoes say I'm toxic 
James Harden step back, hit 'em with the rocket 
Still wake up in the hood with them hittas with the spotty 
Cut my choppa, bullets soundin' like a car wreck 
My bitch quit school, now she rich off Forex 
Niggas talkin' down on me, hate it, I ignore it 
Supercharged Dodge, hit the gas, yeah, floor it 
Talk down, I'ma hit you in the eye like Floyd 
Too much drip, take a bitch overboard , uh
Drip, splash
So Icy, So Icy, gang
Yup, yup
Ho, yeah, I get your main bitch spinnin' like a windmill 
So much ice, you walk by, you get a wind chill 
Yeah, they call me Big Foo, you know I do a big drill
I ain't do a drive-by, bitch, I did a standstill 
Shout out to Big Wop, boy, I got a big deal 
Yeah, I got the big drip, bitches call me big spill 
Boy, don't call me dangerous if you don't like a bad peel 
Boy, I killed the main opp, know that that's a big kill 
Caught the pussy nigga slippin', yeah, that was a free kill 
Know I pour a four up with the mud, I had to break the seal 
Disrespect the mob, and yeah, hollow bullet he gon' feel 
From the corner, niggas know I'm good just like Bradley Beal 
In the kitchen, beat the bowl just like Betty 
If I said it, pussy boy, don't forget it 
I'm direct, I never send you a message 
I'll kill him and you 'bout the fetty 
Pull up with a stick, niggas know I got a hundred rounds
Choppas hit and make ya break dance, call you Bobby Brown
Double R, Choppa Gang and the mob'll hunt you down
We gon' dump his ass in the lake, ain't no bodies found 
Pussy ass nigga
Y'all can't fuck with us, ho 
Ho, ho
Foog
