Trapping like the narco 
Got dope like Pablo 
Cut throat like Pablo  
Chop trees with the Draco 
On the Nawf, got Diego 
Say "Hasta luego" 
Muy Bien wrap a  kilo 
Snub nose with potato
Straight out the jungle 
This real rap, no mumble 
My skin black like mamba 
Got stash boxes in Hondas 
Straight out the jungle 
Woo, bricks in the brick house 
Use to hit licks and go to ma house 
Straight out the jungle 
Young nigga don't know nothin' now 
Young nigga know too much now 
Bow bow bow, that'll slow them down 
We pick up the hundos 
Then drop them off to Huncho 
I came from the bando 
Here go the wide load
Trapping like the narco 
Got dope like Pablo 
Cut throat like Pablo 
Chop trees with the Draco 
On the Nawf, got Diego 
Say "Hasta luego" 
Muy Bien wrap a  kilo 
Snub nose with potatoes
Straight out the jungle 
This real rap, no mumble 
My skin black like mamba 
Got stash boxes in Hondas

Hey, cold gang with the cocaine 
The more money make more rain 
Pourin' up a pint while I'm baggin' propane 
Point blank range give a nigga nose rings 
Skip to my lou with a pack in the cat 
Jiffy, Lube, where the bricks, where they at? 
Dripping, ooze, the Patek all wet 
The birds in the trap, they ain't leavin' out they nest 
Baguette, pavé set like meth 
Yup, runnin' with the pack got slept 
Hands in the cookie jar, cut his finger off 
Nigga bein' greedy, we gon' cut his tummy out 
Hundred bricks on the roads, took a couple routes 
Plush momma's house, Hermes and Fendi couch 
Uh, I ain't really with the razzle dazzle 
Knock him off and then I throw him off the boat paddle 
Go to Tijuana, put the kilo on the saddle 
Sack him, hit a lick and cop a pterodactyl 
Pap him, choppa biting down like an apple 
Mansion with the acres with the horses and the cattle
Trapping like the narco 
Got dope like Pablo 
Cut throat like Pablo 
Chop trees with the Draco 
On the Nawf, got Diego 
Say "Hasta luego" 
Muy Bien wrap a kilos 
Snub nose with potatoes
Straight out the jungle 
This real rap, no mumble 
My skin black like mamba 
Got stash boxes in Hondas 
Straight out the jungle

Take-Takeoff
No monkey in the jungle block hot like a sauna 
Bustas knocking on me, tryna weave with anacondas 
Jumpin' in the water, tryna sneak across the Waterglass 
Gotta seek guards out, got me bit by a piranha 
I'll bag it, bag a money, know I gotta have it
Savage, but I'm still a gentleman in Cali 
Static, nigga turn to mean about the cabbage 
Kill his whole family if he run off with your package 
I just put a pack on the way to Bogota 
Poke his eyes out, ain't no tellin' what he saw 
I'ma wire his jaw, I don't know if he will talk 
Get the chainsaw and I'ma saw his legs off 
They knew that we was gang but they sayin' that we a ring 
Investigatin', takin' pictures of the whole team 
Undercover, tryna do a sting
10 mil' on a plane, going straight to Medellín
Trapping like the narco 
Got dope like Pablo 
Cut throat like Pablo 
Chop trees with the Draco 
On the Nawf, got Diego 
Say "Hasta luego" 
Muy Bien wrap a kilo 
Snub nose with potatoes
Straight out the jungle 
This real rap, no mumble 
My skin black like mamba 
Got stash boxes in Hondas 
Straight out the jungle
