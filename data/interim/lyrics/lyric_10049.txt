Every night is a different flight to a different galaxy
Do a sold-out show, then I hit the road in my starship limousine
Get so damned tired and uninspired doing all these one-night stands
It's a giant leap for rock 'n' roll, but it's too much for just one man
I'm a spaceship superstar
Got a solar-powered laser beam guitar 
I'm at the top of all the charts on Mars 
I'm a spaceship superstar
On Mercury, they're crazy about my stellar rock 'n' roll
And I always sell out in advance at the Martian Astrobowl
The fans, they swarm like meteorites to our concerts on the moon
You should have seen us knock 'em dead on Venus doing all our favorite tunes
I'm a spaceship superstar
Got a solar-powered laser beam guitar 
I'm at the top of all the charts on Mars 
I'm a spaceship superstar
