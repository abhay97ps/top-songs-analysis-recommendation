I give myself to you
It's what I wanna do
You don't need no vows to hold me
You don't have to wear a sign
Saying that you're mine
I can feel it when you hold me
Knowing you're not really holding me
We can split
So we don't split, you see
We're free
You and me
Free to come and go as we please
We're not forced to love each other
We just love each other naturally
Darling, we're free
You and me
Who has the right to say
We can't live this way
Married to this thing we feel now
I wonder would we stay
If we had to stay
Would we feel the way we feel now?
Who could see us
And then disagree
This is love like love should always be
We're free
You and me
Free to come and go as we please
We're not forced to love each other
We just love each other naturally
Darling, we're free
You and me
Who has the right to say
We can't live this way
Married to this thing we feel now
Who could see us
And then disagree
This is love like love should always be
We're free
You and me
Free to come and go as we please
We're free
You and me
Free to come and go as we please
