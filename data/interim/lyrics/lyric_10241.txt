Back home you'll see those ruby berries shine
Tip your head back, drink that summer wine
Sister, brother tell dad and mom
Not to worry, it won't be too long
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Back home, you'll hear the ring of your telephone
Put your feet up, make yourself at home
Sister, brother tell dad and mom
Not to worry, it won't be too long
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Oh, I'm leaving the city
This time, it's for good
Oh, and my baby's so pretty
If you like him, like him, like him, I'll stay for good
Back home, you'll feel that country feel all the time
When the sun comes, you really want to rise and shine
Sister, brother tell dad and mom
Not to worry, it won't be too long
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Sister, brother tell dad and mom
Not to worry, it won't be too long
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
