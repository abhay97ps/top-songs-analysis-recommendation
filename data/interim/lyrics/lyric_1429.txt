Here I stand heart in hand
Looking like a fool
Left behind by you
There was I so starry eyed
I couldn't see that you didn't
You didn't love me
Yes, I was the last one
I was the very last one to know
I was believin', you were deceivin'
And now as my tears flow
Here I stand heart in hand
Looking like a fool
Left behind by you
Here I stand
I've got my heart in my hand
Looking like a fool
Left behind by you
