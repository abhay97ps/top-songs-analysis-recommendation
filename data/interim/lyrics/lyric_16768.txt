I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da my love
I'm waiting for a chance
To get to know you
To ask for a dance
Just look into my eyes
And I'll take you to paradise
REFRAIN
I'm falling, I'm falling
'Cause life's not easy for me
Please touch me like you do
To have you near me
To go where you go
Why waste a lot of time
My love is not a serious crime
REFRAIN
I'm falling to pieces
Who do you think you are
Maybe I've gone too far
Maybe I'm in love with you
Don't hurt me or treat me bad
'Cause I will fight for what is mine
Say Yaki-Da
'Cause life is meant for living
