I am the magnificent
I'm backed by the shack of a soul boss
Most turnin', stormin' sound o'soul
I am double u, o, o, o
And I'm still up here again
Ouch!
Hey
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, build it up
One time
Work it on baby, hey
Mush, mush, mush, mush
Come on
Hit me one time
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh
Break it up for me
Ouch
Press your lips now
You're good, baby, you're fine
I got too much sport, baby
Girl
I am the magnificent
Double u, o, o, o 
Smash it, smash it, smash it, smash it
Good God
Too much, I like it
Soul party
Work it up one time
Work it two time
Shack it
Back it
I am the magnificent, baby
Double u, o, o, o
This is the shack at the back of your soul baby
Work it out huh
Hit me one time
Uh, uh
Two time, baby
