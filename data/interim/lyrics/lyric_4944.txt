When you see some puddles on the ground
You lay down so she don't have to walk around
You think that will protect her from the rain
But you'll never ever stop the pain
She walks all over you
She knows she can
You're the carpet man
You're the carpet man
You take such care to keep that girl's feet clean
Like she's some kind of figurine
The world's so far below her it's not her scene
And so she uses you to stand between
She walks all over you
She knows she can
You're the carpet man
You're the carpet man
I would think you'd get tired of hurtin'
Every now and then
It's no good down there and that's for certain
And carpets do get then
And that's when they have to be thrown away
That's what she'll say to herself some sunny day
And she'll say "come to my wedding" and, of course, you do
And then the groom and her will have a dance on you
She walks all over you
She knows she can
You're the carpet man
You're the carpet man
Carpet man
Carpet man
Carpet man
Carpet man
Carpet man...
