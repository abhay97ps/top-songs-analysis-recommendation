Whoa, babe
I don't wanna lie, I'm gonna take what you're giving
'Cause I know you're willing to take me all the way
You got me right here, combustible
And I can't wait to finally explode
The big, big bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide
In this universe inside
The big, big bang
The big, big bang
The big, big bang
Some people like to talk, but I'm into doing
What I feel like doing when I'm inspired
So if we take a walk down the beach tonight
I bet that we could light up the sky
The big, big bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide
In this universe inside
The big, big bang
The big, big bang
The big, big bang
Take it from me, I don't wanna be mummified
Sometimes I feel so isolated I wanna die
And I'll take it from you if you got it every time
So baby, bring your body here, next to mine
Next to mine
When I don't wanna dream
I just wanna live it
So baby, let's not miss this thing
Ayo, it's the big, big bang when her hips dip sway
When her lips kiss me, we eclipse broad day
Her high heels echo like an empty hallway, hauntingly
I watch her walk away when she calls me
Pull her close then pray to her skin
She got a god complex and a layer within
It's beyond just sex, so I post-fuck grin
We're as close to the universe as we have ever been
The big, big bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide
In this universe inside
The big, big bang
The big, big bang
The big, big bang
Hit the big, big, big bang
Whoa, babe
Whoa, babe
Whoa, babe
