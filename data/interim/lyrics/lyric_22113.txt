Ow!
Somethin' cool went down as I was walkin' with a friend of mine
And I still remember how she was smellin' like the summertime
And ooh, how it changed my mind
Changed everything about that kind of girl
It feels so good, loving you
Yeah, it's so good, the way you do the do
It feels so good, and I need oxygen
Little bit of Heaven doin'  twenty-four-seven again
Yeah, again and again
Like I was sayin'
My little cupid was real super freak
And by the time that I came down
I'd been locked up in that room for a week
And ooh, how she changed my mind
Changed everything about this crazy world
It feels so good, loving you
Yeah, it's so good, the way you do the do
It feels so good, yeah, and by the way
Little bit of Heaven twenty-four-seven times a day
A long hair
A double dare
And I swear, a little bit'll do you some good
You say where
I'm goin' there
And I swear, can't get enough of you
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My bonsoir
Excusez-moi
Your ooh la la is gonna do me good
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah
It feels so good, loving you 
Yeah, it's so good, the way you do the do
It feels so good, yeah, I need oxygen
Little bit of Heaven doin' twenty-four-seven, ahh
It feels so good, loving you 
Yeah, it's so good, the way you do the do
It feels so good, lovin' you 
It feels so good, making love to you
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
