The mixtape bully is taking this shit over, nigga
Yeah, yessir
Bryson Tiller, huh
My instinct, let me shine now
I tell 'em, "Now go and throw your hands up for some real talent"
Haters try and throw a nigga off but I'm still balanced
They say don't act a fool at the top, I can care less
'Cause when I hit that height, I swear I'm beating on my bare chest
King Kong, I'm the villain in this movie
I swear I didn't know she was a fan until she blew me
Yes I found my calling, I just hope it doesn't lose me
'Cause reception in my city is terrible, no one knew me
From the start but that subject is changing in the end
My grandma's two cents was to change all my friends
I agree, some of my niggas think my flame is for them
And the bitches think that every song I sang is for them
That's a lie, I advise quitting school ain't your best move
'Cause everywhere you go, someone gonna test you
And I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
You know we killing this shit like we should bitch
Yeah
Uh, they be telling me stop wasting my time
'Cause ain't nobody made it out of the 'Ville 
Yeah but I'ma keep on grinding on this music
Dropping bangers until I get a deal 
And they say they ain't hating on my shit
When they say quit and they just keeping it real 
And I'm glad 'cause they think I won't 
But I ain't hearing that, baby we will 
Show these lame niggas how to get into the game right now
We will
Show these lame niggas how to get into the game right now
We will, we will, we will
Do it for the money and the power
And the fame right now, we will, we will, we will
Show these lame niggas how to get into the game right now
We will
We will
DJ Edubb, cutting the hottest mixtapes in your mama's basement
I tell 'em , now go and clap your hands for me
Need the mixtape, then go-go super saiyan for me
Real recognize real, you don't look that familiar
Earn your wings then you can diss me 'till he caterpillar
That bitch can't break my heart, she finally know the reason
'Cause I don't let these hoes offend me, I got hella defense
Industry hiding from me and I really hate this game
I don't mind seeking but these locals tryna do the same
I tell a whack nigga he whack so wack niggas don't like me
These days the term "realest" used real lightly
Young Envy with me, and he know what I mean
Tweedle bomb and shut a nigga down if he disagree
On everything I love, I do this for my city
And if a nigga killin' me, I'm taking him down with me 
And I'm Ray Charles to the foolishness
I only want the best, I'm refusing less 
Uh, they be telling me stop wasting my time
'Cause ain't nobody made it out of the 'Ville 
Yeah but I'ma keep on grinding on this music
Dropping bangers until I get a deal 
And they say they ain't hating on my shit
When they say quit and they just keeping it real 
And I'm glad 'cause they think I won't 
But I ain't hearing that, baby we will 
Show these lame niggas how to get into the game right now
We will
Show these lame niggas how to get into the game right now
We will, we will, we will
Do it for the money and the power
And the fame right now, we will, we will, we will
Show these lame niggas how to get into the game right now
We will
