I got miles of trouble spreading far and wide
Bills on the table getting higher and higher
They just keep on coming, there ain't no end in sight
I'm just holding on tight
I've got someone who loves me more then words can say
And I'm thankful for that each and every day
And if I count all my blessings, I get a smile on my face
Still it's hard to find faith
But if you can look in my eyes
And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave
You just might make me believe
It's just day to day trying to make ends meet
What I'd give for an address out on easy street
I need a deep margarita to help me unwind
Leave my troubles behind
I used to believe in us
When times got tough
But lately I'm afraid that even love is not enough
