He's so fine
Wish he were mine
That handsome boy over there
The one with the wavy hair
I don't know how I'm gonna do it
But, I'm gonna make him mine
He's the envy of all the girls
It's just a matter of time
He's a soft-spoken guy
Also, seems kinda shy
Makes me wonder if I
Should even give him a try?
But then I know he can't shy
He can't shy away forever
And, I'm gonna make him mine
If it takes me forever
He's so fine
Gotta be mine
Sooner or later
I hope it's not later
We got to get together
The sooner, the better
I just can't wait
I just can't wait
To be held in his arms
If I were a queen
And, he asked me to leave my throne
I'd do anything that he asked
Anything to make him my own
For he's so fine
So fine
So fine
So fine
So fine
Oh, yeah
So fine
