They say he doesn't love me
But they don't know
He makes me feel so happy when I'm feeling low
My friends just can't seem to see
That he means the world to me
And that is why I adore him
Oh, I adore him
Yes, I adore him
Do anything for him
Yeah, yeah, yeah
When we're with other people
He treats me when
But when we're off together
Oh, you know, I'm his queen
Though, sometimes when I cry at night
He makes things turn out alright
And that is why I adore him
Oh, I adore him
Yes, I adore him
Do anything for him
Yeah, yeah, yeah
When we walk hand in hand
Through the roughest part of town
I never feel afraid
Knowing he's around
He maybe cheating on me
But I don't care
Cause when I need his loving
He's always there
I can't help but wonder why
I've been blessed with such a guy
And that is why I adore him
Oh, I adore him
Yeah, yeah, I love him so
You know I'll never, never, never let him go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
He's mine
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna love him all the time
