Well I got a girl, what a girl
I don't know what to do
When she's with me
It's plain to see
There's someone else there too
I'm wondring my only scheme
Was park with the other cars
And when I did I could see
She was happy as could be
Her eyes were full of stars
There was Fabian, Avalon, Ricky Nelson
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bobby Rydell and I know darned well
Presley's in there too
I asked her friend, her very best friend
To plan some strategy
So she'd forget her other pets
And concentrate on me
This little gal said, listen pal
Don't worry, she loves you
I know she does with her big hugs
My little gal is true
She's been to Fabian, Avalon, Ricky Nelson too
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bobby Rydell and I know darned well
Presley's in there too
What a night in the moonlight
I long to hold her tight
I plan the days and everything I'd say
The evening goes just right
She said no one else will do
Hold me, we're alone
But as she spoke her locket broke
And I guess I might have known
Inside was Fabian, Avalon, Ricky Nelson too
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bobby Rydell and I know darned well
Presley's in there too
