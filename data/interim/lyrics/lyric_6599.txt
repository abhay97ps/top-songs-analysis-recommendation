Here in this room this narrow room
Where life began when we were young last night
I feel your back pressed close to me
And hear your steady breathing as you sleep
Then as the first soft glow of dawn moves silver grey
Like paint along the wall
I touch your hand and feel your ring
And know this night is all we'll ever have
Suddenly I look into your sleepy eyes
You breathe my name and it just seems to dangle there
Then I feel your fingers running through my mind
Jumbling up my thoughts to leave them tangled there
I know so well, that this is all there is
And when we leave this room it's gone
My mind is clear as we walk down
The crooked little steps to the front door
A ray of sun that ricoches
From off a rooftop light our stumbling way
I touch your hand and feel your ring
And know this night is all we'll ever have
Suddenly I look into your sleepy eyes
You breathe my name and it just seems to dangle there
Then I feel your fingers running through my mind
Jumbling up my thoughts to leave them tangled there
Suddenly I look into your sleepy eyes
You breathe my name and it just seems to dangle there
Then I feel your fingers running through my mind
Jumbling up my thoughts to leave them tangled there
Suddenly I look into your sleepy eyes
You breathe my name and it just seems to dangle there
Then I feel your fingers running through my mind
Jumbling up my thoughts to leave them tangled there...
