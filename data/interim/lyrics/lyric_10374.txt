You got your Tony Lama's on your jeans pressed tight
You take a few tokes make you feel alright
Rockin' and a rollin' on a Livingston Saturday Night
Got the pickup washed and you just got paid
With any luck at all you might even get laid
'Cause they're pickin' and a kickin' on a Livingston Saturday night
Yeah now listen to the sound of the hot country band
Boot heels a' shufflin' on the dance floor sand
Drink a little, think a little, shoot a little pool
Hittin' on the cuties right outta high school
Sixteen may get ya twenty, that's all right
'Cause they'll be rockin' and a rollin' on a Livingston Saturday night
Wooo...
Yeah well now some folks smoke, some folks chew
Some do both for any excuse
A rockin' and a rollin' on a Livingston Saturday night
It ain't the same old west, no that's for sure
But I think beats anything that's here before
A rockin' and a rollin' on a Livingston Saturday night
So want you listen to the sound of the hot country band
Boot heels a' shufflin' on the dance floor sound
Play some pong, sing a song, shoot a little shit
And if the fightin' starts just don't get hit
And if the cowboys still can't find a thing in town to do
Well there's a whorehouse on the edge of town where anybody able to screw
Oh...no
Yeah now just listen to the sound of the hot country band
Boot heels a' shufflin' on the dance floor sound
Play some pong, sing a song, shoot a little shit
And if the fightin' starts just don't get hit
And if the cowboys still can't find a thing in town to do
Well there's a whorehouse on the edge of town where anybody able to screw
Yeah now we're just a rockin' and a rollin' on a Livingston Saturday night
One more time baby, now boys
We'll be rockin' and a rollin' on a Livingston Saturday night
