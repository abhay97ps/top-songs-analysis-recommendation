Pardon me, boy
Is that the Chattanooga choo choo?
Track twenty nine
We gotta get there on time
We can afford
To board the Chattanooga choo choo
We got our fare
And just a little to spare
You leave the Pennsylvania Station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner
Nothin' could be finer
Do another number down in Carolina
When you hear the whistle blowin' and make to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in
Gotta keep it rollin'
Woo, woo, Chattanooga, there you are
There's gonna be
A certain party at the station
Satin and lace
I used to call "Funny Face"
She's gonna cry 
Until I tell her that I'll never roam 
So Chattanooga choo choo
Won't you bring me home?
She's gonna cry 
Until I tell her that I'll never roam 
So Chattanooga choo choo
Won't you bring me home?
 Won't you bring me on home?
 Won't you bring her home?
 Won't you bring me home?
 Won't you bring it on home?
 Won't you bring me home?
 Won't you bring it on home?
