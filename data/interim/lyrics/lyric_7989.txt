Look at you, girl
Walking down the street
For all the world to see
And if it seems you walk on air
Well, who wouldn't be?
You're closer to your brand new love
With every step you take
And I can almost tell you
Every little move he'll make
Does he hold you till you're sleeping softly every night?
Does he wake you with a kiss to share the morning light?
And when he loves you
Does he close his eyes?
And reach for you each time you rise?
Has he told you yet
He'll never set you free?
He did with me
I used to smile at how he'd leave
His clothes all scattered on the floor
And leave the shower running
And forget to close the door
The way he said each Sunday
Let's have breakfast here in bed
And all the toast that used to burn
While we'd make love instead
Does he hold you till you're sleepig' softly every night?
Does he wake you with a kiss to share the morning light?
And when he loves you
Does he close his eyes?
And reach for you each time you rise?
Has he told you yet
He'll never set you free?
He did with me
