Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
It's been so long
Since I touched a lady
And I'm still waiting
For you to come back to me, baby
Now will you forgive me
For the wrong I've done?
And let's try again
To make it last so long
I'm still waiting
For you to come back to love
To fulfill this life we're dreaming of
Another day might be too long
Go slow so nothing goes wrong
Listen, baby
Whoa, oh oh, oh oh
I can't wait to feel your love again
'Cause you can stop this pain
That I've been feeling, baby 
So let's start all over
And put the past behind
And make a love to stand
To the test of time
I'm still waiting
For you to come back to love
To fulfill this life, yeah
We`re dreaming of
Another day might be too long
Go slow so nothing goes wrong
I just can't take it no more, baby
No, baby
The feel of your warm embrace, baby
Ooh yeah, I'm still waiting on you, yeah
I`m still waiting
For you to come back to love
To fulfill this life
We`re dreaming of
Another day might be too long
Go slow so nothing goes wrong
Sometimes I get so lonely
Wanna call you, baby
Just a little love is all I need
Just a little love is all I need
Another day might be too long
Go slow so nothing goes wrong
Just a little love is all I need
Just a little love is all I need
The feel of your warm embrace, baby
I'm still waiting
For you to come back to love
To fulfill this life
We're dreaming of
Another day might be too long
