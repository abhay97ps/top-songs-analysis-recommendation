Gem on a necklace
Hero is late to win as a menace
Slim Shady ain't gonna win it
He has  no nonstop, there's a limit
Tank loaded
Like a showman
Nuts like a rodent
Live life for the moment
Like a suit need a codette
You’s an opponent
The mansion looks like it was built by Romans
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, postin’
Ray gun
Bust it broken
ASS HOES
The door is open
M extricerials
Pussy as an ocean
Timmy Turner
Ghastly potion
I have a ho getting through
How can I compare a straw and a flute
Then give me recruit
I can taste a bowl of fruit
Such bullshit
Like a coolin’
They dumbass droolin’
I feel like Henry Newman
I rip the paper like a doodle
Junk in a box and thrifty and frugal
Chopsticks and cheddar with Chinese noodle
My acts I do are always brutal
Arm like a muscle
Dick like a mussel
Gucci belt and a buckle
Chet mode, ho, fuck them puzzles
Dream king and the nightmares
Laboratory only has five stair
Live like a thug, turn to a pioneer
Hung themselves in the chandeliers
Rich Boi
Broad in Illinois
Melt it, immature with toys
Not Pith Floyd, only Rolls Royce
Take time off, you're fired
Be the better, get retired
You’s an elder, you’re not hired
Bitches eaten meat, it’s expired
Chain in my chest
Andy and me is a pest
Dragon Breath, breathe it like retch
Harry’s like meth, dog kill himself by fetch
Donkey look like you, get a plastic surgery
Coke in a secret stash, the cops gon’ murder me
Gem stolen, is it Jeff, he is in Mercury
My thoughts be hidden, many insecurities
Fuck it, hoes cornered me in a labyrinth
Franny is dead, the devil is after him
The goons bitchy like they Mavericks
Kill the plug, the forest freak, gatherin’
Mall day, the one store in Afton
He a ho ass bitchy in a ass shit
Stole a sang, like padic
They ought to be like Patrick
They be like a roach, biting like a bad bitch
Vegan bread loaf, the grains are germs that’s fastened
The bitches are all broke, since I was born I was a savage
You still smokin’  dope, but I tune to an average
Rigid frame pallets, motor drive like Alan
You gon’ need some talent, no need for a palace
Fuck a conscience Alek, my dicks are like talons
I’d be full of malice, Stanley killed Nazis, Stalin
Johnny Baker
Houses with the acres
Circuit Breaker
I set no man, I ’ma meet your maker
That’s god for sure, like Moure
Ain’t no way, to be a level taker
I sent shaper, staker
Salty like a saltshaker
You look like a faker
Electrocuted, Taser
The plug chaser
Telescope in Mars, like stargazer
Rich Boi
Broad in Illinois
Melt it, immature with toys
Not Pith Floyd, only Rolls Royce
Tent pointer better be damming them
This is shit and shenanigans
Lights in the chandelier
Baller boy better stand in clear
Tricky bitch hurt with old Samuel
We had to make him manual
My soul is a spirit animal
Metal arm seems to be mechanical
Bras in my chest with manly boobs
Fuck all you noobs
Makeup brush, no dupes
Station wagon, like the coupes
Play-do, primitive variation
Draco, shooter shot by facin’
Halo, angels is always animated
Rodeo, like I’m not medicated
Basement lab like FNAF Sister Location
Recreated by the creator of  bein’  famous
Hag ho, get it motivated
Jacko, still need more of a reputation
I do another extra band
Hell and back, like I’m from the nether, fam
I’m from the future, not a Bender fan
Like be in the forest, beware of me and Slenderman
Chipper looked like a Mercedes
Live like in the caves like it’s Hades
Use the oxy, it would make them crazy
Like I’m dissin’ up Shady
H3, medikit for my HP
So spacey, chromium and platinum AP
Drool baby, like the Richard Mille is like KB
Video gaming ‘80’s, like TryHardNinja and JT
Shawty bad like a vigilante
Pop the Perc along with the Xanny’s
Ass is big to fit a landing
Fuck a Ghost, drive a Pocorani
Gill Sanders
Jimmy Camper
Show banner
Ban hammer
Rap faster than Flash
Faster than Dash
Sonic has no advantage
Bullet hole, bitch, no bandage
Twenty tix topped thirty tombs
Till he tuck his tummy to a tune
Transferred titties to a toon
Testicles like a trap of tricks of two
Peter Piper picks a peck of pepper
And a pussy ass picker like Peppa
Petty puss to pitchy punks of pebbles
Pee in prissy potties pup pop Perc in pedals
Sal sell sea shells in a sea shore
Shit sold soon in a shifty store
Sick sniffle’s like Sean strangest score
Sammy Spears sunk strait to seven snails sore
Cargon like crazy cocky candle crate
Christian carts and coupe clicked the cane
Cop the clique, chains lift the case
Class-shit chunks creeps the camera crud in a cape
Framed on you nigga
My boo is a gold digger
Doomed by a sky drifter
Keep jeering and get withered
