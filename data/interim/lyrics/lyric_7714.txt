She wakes up in the morning with the new sunrise
Looks at her husband sleeping still
Inside she cries
She makes the children breakfast
Gets them on their way
Watching them through the window
She prepares to face another day
Then her husband tells her
That he won't be home ‘til late
There's so much work he'll have to stay behind
But she knows it isn't work that's on his mind
But still he'll never leave her
Cause what would the children think
Where would the children go
What would the children do
If they knew the way it was
But they'll never learn because
What would the children think
Where would the children think
At the gate she kissed him
And watched him walk
Hoping this small charade
Will stop the neighbors talk
She turns to hide a tear
Inside her gilded cage
She cries for the love she could not hold
And lost to someone half her age
Then her pride and breakin' heart
Tell her to run away
But she values what she's got a little more
Two kids, one 9 and nearly 4
And she would never leave them cause…
What would the children think
Where would the children go
What would the children do
If they knew the way it was
But they'll never learn because
What would the children think
Where would the children think
What would the children think
Where would the children go
What would the children do…
