Well, it'll just get you down
If you let life get to you
Cause everybody's saying something
None of it's true
Well, I just don't care
When them times get hard
Cause I got everything I need
Right out in my yard
I love my truck
She's right outside
I ain't got much luck
But I sure got a ride
It don't matter who lived
It don't matter who lied
I got my truck right by my side
You got Sally and you got Sue
And I got a Chevrolet
She takes me home after work
Don't ever miss a day
She don't care what I am
She don't care what I ain't
But she ain't no cheap pickup
'Cause she just needs a couple coats of paint
I love my truck
It's right outside
I ain't got much luck
But I sure got a ride
It don't matter who lived
It don't matter who lied
I've got my truck right by my side
Yeah
She don't care
If I don't work a lick
She'll start every time
If the choke don't stick
I know that she will never
Never doubt me
Cause she never leaves home without me
You see, I love my truck
It's right outside
I ain't got much luck
But I sure got a ride
It don't matter who lived
It don't matter who lied
I've got my truck right by my side
I got my truck right by my side, yeah
I've got my truck right by my side
