Everybody likes a celebration
Happy music and conversation
I'd be lying if I said I never got the blues
So pardon me for my disposition
You see, I just can't keep
From wishing that I was celebrating too
I know this night won't last forever
I know the sun's got to shine sometime
I got some hope for a bright tomorrow
I know this heart gonna mend just fine
In the corner there's a couple dancing
From the kitchen I can hear 'em laughing
They're playing the same old songs on the radio
I wish I didn't have to sit and listen
And be remindеd of what I'm missing
No I'd rather be lonesomе all alone
I know this night won't last forever
I know the sun's got to shine sometime
I got some hope for a bright tomorrow
I know this heart gonna mend just fine
Suddenly, a strange vibration
From my head to my toes
Filling me with a warm sensation
Somebody's letting me know, yeah
It isn't right to be so downhearted
Telling me that the party started
And I got some celebrating to do
Hey I know this night won't last, can't forever
I know the sun's got to shine sometime
Now I got some hope for a bright, such a bright tomorrow
I know this heart gonna mend just fine
