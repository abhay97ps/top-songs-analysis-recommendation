Woke up this morning, my head was so bad
The worst hangover that I ever had
What happened to me last night
That girl of mine, she loved me so right  
She loved me so long and she loved me so hard
I finally passed out in her front yard 
It wasn't wine that I had too much of
It was a double shot of my baby's love
Double shot of my baby's love, yeah yeah, yeah
Double shot of my baby's love, yeah yeah, yeah
A potion that I had too much of
It was a double shot of my baby's love
It was such a thrill it was hurtin' me 
I was sufferin' in ecstasy
She had me turnin' flips and-a shoutin' out loud 
A sip of her love and I was walkin' on a cloud
One night a week is-a plenty enough
It's a good thing for me they don't bottle that stuff 
Well, my heart begins to fly like a dove
When I take a double shot of my baby's love
Double shot of my baby's love, yeah yeah, yeah
Double shot of my baby's love, yeah yeah, yeah
A potion that I had too much of
It was a double shot of my baby's love
Double shot of my baby's love, yeah yeah, yeah
