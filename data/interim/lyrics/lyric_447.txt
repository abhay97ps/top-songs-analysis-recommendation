Hook:
She speak double language
Thats my word thats my word
2Pac in the whip
That’s my word that’s my word
Remy In her VIP
Thats my word that’s my word
Baby brought a zip
1st Verse:
I speak lovely language
This is good game
Light a candle in this bitch
You know we got the flame
Its different when I talk
I be sounding like a coach
The way I coach her straight to heaven
Baby ain’t no other flow
Said she packed the piff
For the trip
Now we float
She probably had the grip in the whip
But I ain’t know
She don’t need no man
She just get it on her own
She so independent
Baby girl think she HOV
Dollar Dollar after Dollar
Running through her tips
She my motivation
We gone get this bag together
Flip it dip it fill it
Shit we just might buy the curb
Flip it dip it fill it
Thats my motherfuckin word
Hook:
We don’t know your crew
Heard you only talking shit
Word to his crush
I don’t move like a bitch
I got off the drugs
Now I’m addicted to a Queen
She really rock Crown
She need flowers at the scene
She speak double language
Thats my word thats my word
2Pac in her whip
That’s my word that’s my word
Remy In her VIP
Thats my word that’s my word
Baby brought a zip
2nd Verse:
She made me buy rubbers on monday
We might have a baby
But thats one day
Rick and Morty on the dash
Blue notes in her stash
Damn that girl a goddess
What the fuck is being bad
She my highest pleasure
I can’t argue with her ass
You was crushin after school
But she ain’t in your class
Bottle after bottle
Man she told me cut it out
Bottle after bottle
She said God will hear me out
She truly stay consistent
I had to stay persistent
Go past all limits
And he ain’t never timid
He a captain and lieutenant
5 star poet
But I doubt they ever get it
Cause I doubt they ever lived it
