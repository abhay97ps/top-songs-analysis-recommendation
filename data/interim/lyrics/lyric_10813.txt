Everybody likes a celebration
Happy music and conversation
But I'd be lyin' if I said, I didn't have the blues
In the corner there's a couple dancin'
From the kitchen I can hear her laughin'
Oh, I wish, I was celebratin' too
I know this night won't last forever
I know the sun's gonna shine sometime
I need some hope for a bright tomorrow
To show this heart is gonna mend just fine
So pardon me for my disposition
Wish, I didn't have to sit and listen
She's playin' the same old songs on the stereo
She's been lyin' since the day I met her
I'd be better off to just forget her
Oh, I would rather be lonesome or go
I know this night won't last forever
I know the sun's gonna shine sometime
I need some hope for a bright tomorrow
To show this heart is gonna mend just fine
Such a ridiculous situation
Pretending there's nothing wrong
She's comin' on with the invitation
I wonder, who is takin' her home
I know this night won't last forever
I know the sun's gonna shine sometime
I need some hope for a bright tomorrow
To show this heart is gonna mend just fine
I know this night won't last forever
I know the sun's gonna shine sometime
I need some hope for a bright tomorrow
To show this heart is gonna mend just fine
I know this night won't last forever
I know the sun's gonna shine sometime
I need some hope for a bright tomorrow
To show this heart is gonna mend just fine
