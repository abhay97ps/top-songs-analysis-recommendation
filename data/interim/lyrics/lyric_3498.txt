Looks like you've been eating magpie eggs again
'Cause your face is a stamp
That's rejecting the little red marks to comprehend
What's not that good, and what's bad
So, first I'll have a day off to recover
And then another week to make my plans
And if you're not back when that first day's over
Looks as if your eggs are all rotten
And now is the time to rely
On the spellbinder's hat and his magic
Blue tie as our oceans run dry
The first day's when you'll get your toothbrush back
And the second one's made to compare
As you put the lotion in your backpack
I am already there
There's no longer no one asking your name
At the beach house grill on the fourth floor
And when you go out for a swim
You'll probably leave that face indoors
Looks like the eggs are ready hatched now
And like you chose wrong when you went for tails
But how am I to forget you're there
With your skin under my nails
And it's always the same
And it's always the same
It is always the same
