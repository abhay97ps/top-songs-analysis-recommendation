I have made up my mind years ago
When I first gazed upon you, I'd never let you go
And it's amazing baby 
And we'll always be 
Always together
We'll have our problems
But we'll face them with pride
Our love, our love is protection
And we don't have to hide
And a thousand nights I'll kiss away 
And we'll always be 
Always together
Just you, just me
Always , always , always 
Always , always 
When the years have turned your hair to silver
And the days of our youth
Have left us so very far behind
Golden, golden memories
Will keep in our minds
And we'll always be 
Always together
Just you, just me
Always , always , always 
Always , always , always now 
Always
