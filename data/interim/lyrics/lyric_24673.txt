Yeah, yeah
Mmm, ayy
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
Candy paint with the white on top 
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop 
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot 
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch 
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot 
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
Didn't know that was your girl when she gave me top 
Kicked her out the Rolls said, "Thanks a lot"
Goddamn, I love paper like I'm Michael Scott 
I can do things that your man cannot 
Slide boy comin' down, damn, I'm hot 
Everybody say that I gotta be stopped 
Even though my final form ain't unlocked 
I'm so ahead of you muhfuckas'
How you comprehend what you ain't understandin'?
Count a hundred bands and I watch it vanish
Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor
Got a lot of ass, nothin' I can't handle
Flavor lasts forever, you should try a sample 
Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza 
Everybody tryna tell me what I stand for
But you don't fuckin' know me, homie, you don't want war 
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot 
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want 
Candy paint with the white on top 
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop 
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot 
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top 
Half price my whip, same price my watch 
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot 
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
I've been rollin' twenty ash, hit the road 
Hit the switch up the suicide doors 
We already know you vanished though 
Hit my momma when I ride in that, oh
All these muhfuckas' so false with me 
If your money funny, don't talk to me 
I know there ain't shit that you could offer me 
Take a second if you think about crossin' me
It lasts forever, you should try a sample 
Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza 
Everybody tryna tell me what I stand for 
But you don't fuckin' know me, homie, you don't want war 
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop 
If you busy plottin' on what I got 
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top 
Half price my whip, same price my watch 
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot 
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
