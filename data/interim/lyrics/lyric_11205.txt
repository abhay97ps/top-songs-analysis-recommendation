Thirty two teeth in a jawbone
Alabama's tryin' for none
Before I have to hit him, I hope he's got the sense to run
Reason the poor girls love him
Promise them everything
Why they all believe him? He wears a big diamond ring
Run, run!
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me, just get down and leave and walk away
Major Domo Billy Bojangles
Sat down and had a drink with me
Said "What about Alabama that keeps a-coming back to me?"
I heard your plea in the courthouse
Witness box began to rock and rise
Forty-nine sister states had Alabama in their eyes
Run, run!
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me, just get down and leave and walk away
Major said, "Why don't we give him rope enough to hang himself?
No need to worry the jury
They'll probably take care of themselves"
Twenty-third Psalm, Major Domo
Reserve me a table for three
Down in the Valley of the Shadow, just you, Alabama and me
Run, run!
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me, just get down and leave and walk away
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me, just get down and leave and walk away
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me, just get down and leave and walk away
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me, just get down and leave and walk away
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
