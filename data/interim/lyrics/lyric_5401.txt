You know, sometimes, a man or a woman makes a mistake
Try to find a reason for making a mistake
But there's no reason to make a mistake
The only thing you can do when you make a mistake is say "I'm sorry"
It takes a man or a woman to say "I'm sorry"
And takes a fool to walk away
So right here, I wanna say "I'm sorry"
I don't know where you are, but you know I need you
Now, there's one more thing I'd like to say right here
I could say, maybe, you just don't understand
I could say, baby, I believe you got another man
And then I could say, I just can't help myself
But I wouldn't be a man
And then I could say, maybe you don't have nothin' left
But I want you to know
I still love you
OH, no matter where you go
I still love you
WHOA, OH, take it down, Jimmy
Goodbye, my love
Throw me away
Goodbye, my love
Now, there's one more thing
You know, to have somebody to worry when you worry
To feel the need of a real person when your friends drop you behind
To kill your anger just by being nice and kind
I could say if you leave, it wouldn't bother me
But I know that would be a lie
'Cause baby, deep down inside, you're part of me
But I want you to know and I don't care who knows
I still love you
WHOA, OH, I still love you
WHOA, OH, take it down, Jimmy
Now, looka here
You always been in my corner
Never let me be a loner
There's one more thing I'd like to say right here
You told me that no one would ever be able to take my place
That every time, the feeling was nice and you fall in my embrace
You said everything would be all right
You had no other love, no other, no other person in your sight
You said there wouldn't be another
There would never, never, never be another, and I believed you
I believed you
Yes, I believed you, 'cause I want you to know
I still love you
OH, OH, I still love you
I don't care who knows, NO, OH
Take it down, Jimmy
Goodbye, my love
You throw me away
Goodbye, my love
You're throwing me away
You're throwâ€”you're throwing me away
You walked away from me
Tell me why you walked away from me
It's one more thing
It's one more thing I got to say right here
It's one more thing I got to say right here
I still love you
OH, OH, I still love you
OH, OH, OH, take it down, Jimmy
Goodbye, my love
So long, baby
Goodbye, my love
You're throwing me away
You're throwing me away
You're throwing me away
Goodbye
