Baby
You've been so distant from me lately
And lately
Don’t even wanna call you "baby"
Saw us gettin' older 
Burnin' toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high
Waiting up for you upstairs 
Why you act like I’m not there?
Baby, right now it feels like
It feels like you don't care
Why don't you recognize I'm so rare?
Always there
You don't do the same for me, that's not fair
I don't have it all
I'm not claiming to
But I know that I’m special , yeah
And I’ll bet there's somebody else out there
To tell me I’m rare
To make me feel rare
Baby
Don't make me count up all the reasons to stay with you
No reason
Why you and I are not succeeding, ah-ah 
Saw us gettin' older 
Burnin' toast in the toaster 
My ambitions were too high 
Waiting up for you upstairs 
Why you act like I’m not there? 
Baby, right now it feels like 
It feels like you don't care
Why don't you recognize I'm so rare? 
Always there
You don't do the same for me, that's not fair
I don't have it all
I'm not claiming to
But I know that I'm special , yeah
And I'll bet there's somebody else out there
To tell me I'm rare
To make me feel rare 
I'm not gonna beg for you
I'm not gonna let you make me cry 
Not getting enough from you 
Didn't you know I'm hard to find? 
Saw us gettin' older
Burnin' toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high 
Waiting up for you upstairs
Why you act like I'm not there?
Baby, right now it feels like
It feels like you don't care 
Why don't you recognize I'm so rare? 
I'm always there
You don't do the same for me, that's  not  fair
I don't have it all 
I'm not claiming to 
But I know that I'm special , yeah
And I'll bet there's somebody else out there
To tell me I'm rare
To make me feel rare 
Ah, ah 
Rare
Ah, ah
Rare
