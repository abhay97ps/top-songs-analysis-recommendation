I'm up in Oakland on a Saturday night
Lord, I said I just didn't feel right
Goodnight ladies all around
But the right one hadn't found me such a bad night
I didn't feel right
Then a friend came over 'fore it got too late
Asked me if I'd like you a s double date
My stars above, I fell in love
With queen of the roller derby
Yeah, the queen of the roller derby
Now Queenie's a lady, she's quite a child
Oh, she'll make you feel fine
Remember the when a trucker from Dallas
Was callous to Queenie with his rude side
Now he can't deny, that he gotten much more than he bargained for
Queenie's right cross run him to the floor
Now he knows better than to mess
With the queen of the roller derby
The queen of the roller derby
Oh, as fast as a bullet she can jam all night
Makes a full grown wonder bull die with fright
When we get home alone in love
She murmurs like a sweet moaning dove, ooh
Oh, such a lady, she's quite a child
She'll make me feel good in this heart of mine
She's my love, she's a lady
She's the queen of the roller derby
Ah, the queen of the roller derby
I'm talking about the queen of the roller derby
Yeah, she's the queen of the roller derby
O queen of the roller derby
The queen of the roller derby
Ooh
