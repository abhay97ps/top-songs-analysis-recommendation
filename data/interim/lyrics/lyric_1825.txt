When you're young and in love
The whole world seems to know
Love is like a candle light
Always giving off a glow
When you're young and in love, so in love
All your troubles pass on by
There is nothing in this whole wide world
That could ever make you cry
When you're in love you walk in the clouds
The night time turns to day
And the dark clouds that cover the sky
They just seem to float away
When you're young and in love, so in love
The whole world seems to know
Love is like a candle light
Always giving off the glow
The whole world seems to know
When you're young and in love
