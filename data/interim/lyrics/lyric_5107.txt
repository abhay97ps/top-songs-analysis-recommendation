In the fury of the moment
When the words of wrath rang out
When my mind was filled with questions
And my head was filled with doubt
I can still see sadness heartbreak
And the sorrow in your eyes
How can flowers live in darkness
How can I apologize
For the blackness I've created
In the world that used to shine
I have wilted all the roses
And I've spoiled all the wine
Just get out your magic pencil
And erase the cloudy skies
Just draw a picturе of me
Saying, I apologize
Give mе back
The words I spoke in haste
Give 'em back
Or love will go to waste
Give 'em back
See the sunlight reappearing
Through the shrouds of darkened blue
As I hear the words forgiving me
And watch the flowers bloom
And when time has lost that moment
And we mended broken ties
I will stay be on my knees
Saying, I apologize
Give me back
The words I spoke in haste
Give 'em back
Or love will go to waste
Give 'em back
