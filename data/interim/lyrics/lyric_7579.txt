I'm up on the tight wire
One side's ice and one is fire
It's a circus game with you and me
I'm up on the tightrope
One side's hate and one is hope
But the top hat on my head is all you see
And the wire seems to be the only place for me
A comedy of errors and I'm falling
Like a rubber-neck giraffe
You look into my past
Well maybe you're just too blind to - see
I'm up in the spotlight
Oh, does it feel right
Oh, the altitude seems to get to me
I'm up on the tight wire
Flanked by life and the funeral pyre
Putting on a show for you to see
Like a rubber-neck giraffe
You look into my past
Well maybe you're just too blind to - see
I'm up in the spotlight
Oh does it feel right
Oh the altitude really gets to get to me
I'm up on the tight wire
Flanked by life and the funeral pyre
Putting on a show for you to see
