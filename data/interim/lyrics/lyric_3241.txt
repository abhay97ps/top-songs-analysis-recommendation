I'm 'enery the Eighth I am
'enery the Eighth I am, I am
I got married to the widow next door
She's been married seven times before
And every one was an 'enery 
She wouldn't have a Willy or a Sam 
I'm her eighth old man, I'm 'enery
'enery the Eighth I am
Second verse same as the first
I'm 'enery the Eighth I am
'enery the Eighth I am, I am
I got married to the widow next door
She's been married seven times before
And every one was an 'enery 
She wouldn't have a Willy or a Sam 
I'm her eighth old man, I'm 'enery
'enery the Eighth I am
{Instrumental}
I'm 'enery the Eighth I am
'enry the Eighth I am, I am
I got married to the widow next door
She's been married seven times before
And every one was an 'enery 
She wouldn't have a Willy or a Sam 
I'm her eighth old man, I'm Henery
Henry the eighth I am
H-E-N-R-Y
'enery 
'enery 
'enery the Eighth I am, I am
'enry the Eighth I am
Yeah!
