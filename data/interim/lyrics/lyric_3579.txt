Hey, hey, hey, snowflake 
My pretty little snowflake 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, the change in the weather
Has made it better for me
Hey, hey, hey, snowflake 
My pretty little snowflake 
You've got me warm as a fire
With the burning desire for you
Snow was falling when love came calling
On this lonely heart of mine
You were standing there with snowflakes in your hair
You kept stalling while my thoughts were calling
On every way I knew
For one excuse to get acquainted with you
Then I said, snowflake 
My pretty little snowflake 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, the change in the weather
Has made it better for me
Hey, hey, hey, snowflake 
My pretty little snowflake 
You've got me warm as a fire
With the burning desire for you
The ice was breaking and
Love was waking in a winter wonderland
When I felt you slip your fingers in my hand
Now snow is gleaming and
I'm not dreaming I know this is for real
The love I have is too much to conceal
Hey, hey, hey, snowflake 
My pretty little snowflake 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, the change in the weather
Has made it better for me
Hey, hey, hey, snowflake 
My pretty little snowflake 
You've got me warm as a fire
With the burning desire for you
