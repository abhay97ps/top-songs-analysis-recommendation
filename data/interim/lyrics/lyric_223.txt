When I was only twelve years old
I fell in love with you, oh heart and soul
So tell me that you love me, wouldn't put no one above me
Oh, me
My love is real, and it's oh-so strong
I'll be loving you from, from now on
So tell me that you love me, wouldn't put no one above me
Oh, me
My love for you will never die
Even though sometimes it makes me cry
So tell me that you love me, wouldn't put no one above me
Oh, me
My love is real, and it's oh-so strong
I'll be loving you from, from now on
So tell me that you love me, wouldn't put no one above me
Oh, me
My love for you will never die
Even though sometimes it makes me cry
So tell me that you love me, wouldn't put no one above me
Oh, me
