Yeah, Lets get real comfortable
Lay back

Lemmie tell you what i'm thinkin'
Look
We known each other
For some time
I think it's time 
I been havin' visions
Fantasies 
Am I out of line?
Just back into it
And let it touch 
Come on and move
And let it touch 
We cannot lose
Just let it touch 
I will be true
Come on and let it touch
I see you naked
I'm bout to do it with the lights on 
Keep the lights on 
Your right wit me next to my bed
Giving me head
My eyes have seen
Nothin' like you
Wanna bite you
So sweet
Not tryna be
Disrespectful
But I just want to get you to
Just back into it
And let it touch 
Come on and move
And let it touch 
We cannot lose
Just let it touch 
I will be true
Come on and let it touch
When you walk in
In your sexy lingerie
In the middle of the doorway
You know what I'm sayin
Ima take it off slowly
Peel you like a banana
Oh baby by the way 
Tell me no I want you 
Cause you know at the end of the day 
Everything is up to you 
Just back into it
And let it touch 
Come on and move
And let it touch 
We cannot lose
Just let it touch 
I will be true
Come on and let it touch

Keep the lights on 
I'm comin' to you, real slow
Yo

For partying with me, yeah
Oh yeah
You can turn the lights off now
