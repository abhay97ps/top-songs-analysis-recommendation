Hello, hello again
Hello, hello again
You might have forgot
The journey ends
You tied your knots
You made your friends
You left the scene
Without a trace
One hand on the ground
One hand in space
Oh, you passed on mercy
You tried the rest
You gave your body
You gave the best
Staring at the green door
Living in the sky
You don't want to know it
You just want to fly
Hello , hello again
Hello , hello again
I know 
Who's under the gun
I know 
Who's only just begun
Hello, hello again
 Hello, hello again
Oh, and when there's nothing
Nothing left to lose
You leave it all
To fade to blue
 electric
 loose
 eclectic
You want to call a truce
 at the profile
Staring at the flame
 for the sunshine
Standing in the rain
Hello, hello again
 Hello, hello again. 
 Hello , hello again
Hello , hello again
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
