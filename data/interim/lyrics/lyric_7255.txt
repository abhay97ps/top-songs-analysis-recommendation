We never talk
There was a time when there weren't enough words to say
We never touch
But I remember when I couldn't keep my hands away
The thrill is gone, there's no desire
Girl we've got to feed the fire
We've got to get it on again
Work it out together
Learn to love again
We've got to make a try
Hey girl, we've got to get it on again
Get our act together
Fall in love again
To keep our love alive
We never laugh
We used to know so many happy songs
We never kiss
In the penetrating way that used to turn me on
Once there was fire in our lives
Silver sparks that used to fly
We've got to get it on again
Work it out together
Learn to love again
We've got to make a try
Hey girl, we've got to get it on again
Get our act together
Fall in love again
To keep our love alive
Once there was fire in our lives
Silver sparks that used to fly
We've got to get it on again
Work it out together
Learn to love again
We've got to make a try
Hey girl, we've got to get it on again
Get our act together
Fall in love again
To keep our love alive
Hey girl, we've got to get it on again
Work it out together
Learn to love again
We've got to make a try
Hey girl, we've got to get it on again
Get our act together
Fall in love again
To keep our love alive
