We got London on da Track
I should've known better
Can't even pretend like I don't want it again
On the brain all the time
Thinkin' of all the things that we did
You did somethin'
'Cause shit like this don't happen too often
It's the way you put it down
I don't want no one else around
Got me takin' a step on the wild side
Cuttin' all ties
With them other guys
Way you, way you look in my eyes
Lovin' me nice and slow
You make me wanna come through
Quarter after two
Just to put it down on you
You make me wanna replay
All of the things
That you and me, we do
You make me wanna come through
Quarter after two
Just to put it down on you
You make me wanna replay
All of the things
That you and me, we do
Look at what you make me wanna do
I'll drop all my niggas for you
Got my feelings runnin' on a loop
This ain't what I'm really used to
Before anything happens between us
Be sure you're ten toes down before I pull out this car 
And the only thing that's comin' beside me
Out this situation is you waitin' to get some more 
I told you, I'ma take you places 
I seen it in your face 
And I knew that you would say this
So how you wanna play this?
Yeah, you got somebody 
I been in this predicament 
Don't trip, creep discrete
That's just what we dealin' with
You make me wanna come through
Quarter after two
Just to put it down on you
You make me wanna replay 
All of the things 
That you and me, we do 
You make me wanna come through
Quarter after two
Just to put it down on you
You make me wanna replay
All of the things 
That you and me, we do 
Look at what you make me wanna do 
I'll drop all my niggas for you 
Got my feelings runnin' on a loop 
This ain't what I'm really used to
Ain't what you used to, but you used to
Oh, oh
Oh
New relationship too, this is what you do
Think about her, cuddle up
Love her
