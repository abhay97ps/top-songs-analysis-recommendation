I come out of hiding by and by
'Cause I've been immobilized for so long
Slowly emerging from the dark
I feel like I wasted so much time
I've been
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Finally decided on a change
No more cowards holding hands
Well, I'm gonna break up all the rules
Tear down the barriers, on the loose
'Cause I've been
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Oh, livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
We're part of all the story
Well, can't you see
That love has control?
Got no reason now to worry
Just count on me
'Cause love has gotta take control
You can take hold
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background
Livin' in the background
Livin' in the background
Finally decided on a change
No more cowards holding hands
Well, I'm gonna break up all the rules, rules
Livin' in the background
Livin' in the background
Livin' in the background
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Don't you go livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background 
Livin' in the background
