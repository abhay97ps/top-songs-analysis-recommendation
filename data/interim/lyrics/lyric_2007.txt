La la la la la la la la
La la la la la
Stand beside me all the while
No matter what goes wrong
Separately we're weak
Together we'll be strong
For true love
Never runs smooth
But I don't care, 'cause true love
Is worth all the pain, the heartaches and tears
That we may share
When the world outside my arms
Is pulling us apart
Press your lips to mine
And hold me with your heart
For true love never runs smooth
That's what they say, but true love
Is worth all the pain, the heartaches and tears
We have to face
For true love never runs smooth
That's what they say, but true love
Is worth all the pain, the heartaches and tears
We have to face
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la
