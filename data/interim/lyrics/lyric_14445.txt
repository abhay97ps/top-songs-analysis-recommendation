We are friends, we are brothers
Always there lookin' out for each other
In a world where so many dreams are broken apart
But when the world tries to beat us
We hang tough, ain't no way they'll defeat us
You and I will always survive, together we're strong
Heart to heart
Any storm we can weather
You and I we've become
United forever
Two hearts that can beat as one
There ain't a single thing, we can't overcome
We're indestructible 
We've got the power of love
So strong we can generate
A wall of solid love
Nothing can penetrate
We're indestructible
There's a power, deep inside us
Ain't no one that could ever divide us
We won't fall, we'll show 'em all
Just what we're made of
You and I
We're in it together
We stand strong through it all
United forever
Two hearts that can beat as one
There ain't a single thing, we can't overcome
We're indestructible 
We've got the power of love
So strong we can generate
A wall of solid love
Nothing can penetrate
We're indestructible
Heart to heart
Any storm we can weather
You and I we've become
Untied forever
Two hearts that can beat as one
There ain't a single thing, we can't overcome
We're indestructible 
We've got the power of love
So strong we can generate
A wall of solid love
Nothing can penetrate
We're indestructible
