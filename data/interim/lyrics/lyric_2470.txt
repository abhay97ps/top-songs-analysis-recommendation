When no one else can understand me
When everything I do is wrong
You give me love and consolation
You give me hope to carry on
And you try to show your love for me
In everything you do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you
And when you smile, the world is brighter
You touch my hand and I'm a king
Your kiss to me is worth a fortune
Your love to me is everything
And you're always there
To lend a hand
In all I try to do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you
I guess, I'll never know
The reason why you love me as you do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you
