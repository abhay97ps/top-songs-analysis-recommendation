No I can't believe you love me
No I can't believe you love me
No I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
Anymore, not like before 
Whenever we're together, not one word do you say
When I speak your name in the sweetest tone
It's just as though I'm all alone
I...
Can't believe you love me
No, no, I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
Anymore, not like before 
Anymore, not like before 
You don't kiss me like you used to
You don't say those pretty words
There's no thrill in your kiss, there's no sincerity
I do believe you've gotten over me
That's why...
I can't believe you love me
No, no, I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
