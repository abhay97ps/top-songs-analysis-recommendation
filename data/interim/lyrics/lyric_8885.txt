It's 9:51 pm. And I wasn't trying to think of you and yet here I am again
I try to resist these thoughts, I promise to God, I do
But you and I both know that I can never resist anything that has to do with *you!*
It's 9:52, and my face is lit up by my iPhone screen instead of the moon,
because for some reason even the pixelated version of your eyes shines ten times better than the stars *ever* do!
Listen, to the thoughts that go through my head before I decide whether or not you'll think that
I'm annoying as shit for texting your first
I think maybe **he's** busy and that's why **he/she** didn't
watch my Snapchat story, like my Instagram post, or my status I posted 17 minutes ago
I think maybe **he** just lost his phone in a mess of bedsheets
That **boy** is going crazy, wondering if **he's** missed a call from me; I do not worry at all, I know **he'll** text me
I tell myself **she's** busy
**His/Her** phone died and **his/her** charger got stolen at a bus stop
**She's** busy.
I tell myself not to text **him** first
It shows weakness in a man: Women are not weak
Let **him/her** come to me
It's 9:53-3, the amount of dogs I saw at the park today
What if **her** dog died? I'd be devastated, I wouldn't want to text anybody either. So I understand
Maybe there are things more important than me; **she's** planning a funeral for a loved one
It's 9:53-3
The amount of girls, or should I say HP copy machines that decided
to do the kind service of copying **his** history homework this morning
Like we all don't know that Christopher Columbus sail the ocean deep!
Stop being lazy! Do your own homework!
Homework!
I tell myself **he's* doing homework and he's busy because he's doing homework
Not because **he'd** much rather relive the Cold War than talk to me
It's 9:54, and as time passes, **her** eyelashes turn my stomach into butterflies, and fireflies, and why do I--
**New message**
**She** texted me
Every centimeter of my body interested--
**She** was busy, now **she** isn't
Yeah, she wrote me up a message
Let me up and push the button, I'm excited just to see--
"Hey, yo, what's up, homeboy? You wanna meet me up and Nico down at the court?"
**NO!**
Typing...typing...typing...
I told you not to text me, I've been waiting for my Queen
The **girl** that drives me crazy, I can see **her** in my dreams
The only place **she** isn't, is the image on my screen
**Her** beauty is a beauty the *world* has ever seen
But now, it's 9:55, and I think, hey, maybe I should text him
Leave my pride and nervousness behind,and just forget them
But why should I have to be the one that has to go out on a limb
**He's** the boy; **he's** the one that's supposed to do this
It's 9:55, and I'mm tired of waiting for this boy to realize--
5 minutes ago, **she** posted a picture with this guy
And 5 minutes ago, I decided that these feelings were alive
It's funny how love can make you romanticize, turning a slight glance at you during class into something so sublime
When in reality, I just needed the answers to number 2 and number 5
It's 9:59, and I don't need you
When the teacher asked me "what elements were necessary to maintain human life?"
I told them "nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and you!"
Now you're like Uranium, but you like your heart, but it's the only thing that's powering mine
And I don't know why you haven't called yet
And I don't know if this is true, but hey, wouldn't it be crazy if you were lying awake right now, thinking about me, too?
What the hell are you *scared* for?
It's not like the world will be destroyed by some kind of atomic bomb
The worst thing that ever happened is that you don't respond
Now it's 10
So what's it gonna be??
Typing...typing...typing...
Hey
Typing...typing...typing...
Hey, I was just thinking about you
