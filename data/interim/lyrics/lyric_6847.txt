The future, the future, the future, yeah
Joining our forces once again
To prove the good we've tried to the very end
Won't ever stop the situation
From blooming
Teaching everybody, that's the ruling
We see the future of the world
Together we can make the world a place for all of us
To share
Everybody, somewhere, not forgetting the wya it should be
Make a dream come true for you and me
We must try hard to understand
Reach out, lend a hand
We see the future of the world
We can make it if we try
If we can't, I don't know why
We see the future of the world
For the brotherhood of man into the promised land, yeah
We see the future of the world
For the babies for the babies
We see the future of the world
Happiness, joy, no need for tears
Elevate your soul
Release the fears
Happiness, joy, no need for tears
Elevate your soul, release the fears, ooh yeah
We see the future of the world
Of wonder and splendour
We see the future of the world
Something to remember
We see the future of the world
To the promised land, to the promised land
We see the future of the world
We can make it if we try, can, I don't know why
We see the future of the world
