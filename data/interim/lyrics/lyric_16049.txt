All the world's a masquerade
Made up of fools and philosophers
Were it to rain on our charade
All washes away, except for our true colors
If any people bothered looking for truth, please
Instead we choose to follow footsteps of fools,please
If nothing's new under the sun for me and you
Won't somebody please...
Stop the world
Stop the world
I wanna get off
Stop the world
Stop the world
I wanna get off
If we forget yesterday
We're bound to repeat it tomorrow
It's not too late to start today
Better off safe than sorry
Do unto those as you would do to yourselves,please
We need more feet to walk in one another's shoes,please
There's nothing new under the sun for me and you
Won't somebody please...
Stop the world
Stop the world
I wanna get off
Stop the world
Stop the world
Where there is love
Where there is love
Stop!!...the world
Stop the world
I wanna get off
Stop the world
Stop the world
I wanna get off
You gotta stop...
You gotta stop it
You gotta stop...
Stop the world
Stop the world
I wanna get off
Stop the world
Stop the world
Where there is love
Aaah...Stop the world
Stop the world...ooooh
All the world's a masquerade
Made up of fools
