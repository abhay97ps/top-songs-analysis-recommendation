I heard about her from a friend of mine
He said she lived across the county line
The sweetest grape that ever grew on the vine
And now that's where I'm spending all my time
Her daddy Robert and her mama Ruth
They had a daughter they named Bobbie Sue
And now she's eighteen and she knows the truth
Nobody's gonna tell her what to do
Bo-Bo, Bo-Bo, Bobbie Sue
Ca-can't you see my love is true?
I want to ma-ma, ma-ma, marry you
Bo-Bo-Bo-Bo-Bo- Bobbie Sue
I'll take her riding on a Friday night
Straight down the highway in the clear moonlight
My Chevyâ€™s humming and she holds me tight
We'll find a preacher and we'll do it right
Her daddy told her that she'd have to wait
Her mama said, "don't make a big mistake"
But we'll keep driving till we're out of state
And when they find us it'll be too late
Bo-Bo, Bo-Bo, Bobbie Sue
Ca-can't you see my love is true?
I want to ma-ma, ma-ma, marry you
Bo-Bo-Bo-Bo-Bo- Bobbie Sue
Bo-Bo, Bo-Bo, Bobbie Sue
Ca-can't you see my love is true?
I want to ma-ma, ma-ma, marry you
Bo-Bo-Bo-Bo-Bo- Bobbie Sue
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob Bobbie Sue
Bo-Bo, Bo-Bo, Bobbie Sue
B...o...b...b...y Sue
