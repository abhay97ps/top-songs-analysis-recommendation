There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us somewhere
There's a time for us
Someday a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to learn
And a time to care
Someday
Somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find there's a way of forgiving
Somewhere
There's a place for us 
Somewhere there is a place for us
Hold my hand and we're half way there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Some day, some day, somewhere, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find there's a way of forgiving
Somewhere
There's a place for us
A time and a place for us
Somewhere
Somewhere
Somewhere
