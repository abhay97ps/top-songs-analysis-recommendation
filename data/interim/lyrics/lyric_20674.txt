I'm so glad that I met you baby
I'm so proud when we walk in the room
I know it's crazy to worry like I do
I get this feeling that I'm losing you
I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh suspicions
I can't help it you're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's going to steal you away from me
When I go out to a party with you
You always turn every head in the room
I just know what's on every man's mind
I try to fight it, but it gets me sometimes
I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh suspicions
I can't help it you're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's going to steal you away from me
Ooh, suspicions
When I'm with you I feel so satisfied
The way you touch me when you lay by my side
That look in your eyes when we make love
Makes me hate myself for what I'm thinking of
I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh suspicions
I can't help it you're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's going to steal you away from me
Suspicions
Even though I know that you love me baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh suspicions
I can't help it you're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's going to steal you away from me
Suspicions
Oh baby Oh darling
'Cause I love her
'Cause I love her
I love her and she loves me
Arenâ€™t nobody going to take my girl from me
