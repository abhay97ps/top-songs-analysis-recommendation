Aw, shit 
Get your towels ready, it's about to go down 
Everybody in the place, hit the fucking deck
But stay on your motherfucking toes
We running this, let's go 
I'm on a boat 
I'm on a boat 
Everybody look at me, 'cause I'm sailing on a boat 
I'm on a boat 
I'm on a boat
Take a good, hard look at the motherfucking boat, yeah
I'm on a boat, motherfucker, take a look at me
Straight floating on a boat on the deep blue sea 
Busting five knots, wind whipping out my coat
You can't stop me, motherfucker, 'cause I'm on a boat
Take a picture, trick ; I'm on a boat, bitch 
We drinking Santana champ, cause it's so crisp 
I got my swim trunks, and my flippie-floppies
I'm flipping burgers, you at Kinko's straight flippin' copies
I'm riding on a dolphin, doing flips and shit 
The dolphin's splashing, getting everybody all wet 
But this ain't Seaworld, this as real as it gets 
I'm on a boat, motherfucker, don't you ever forget
I'm on a boat, and it's going fast, and
I got a nautical themed pashmina afghan
I'm the king of the world, on a boat like Leo
If you're on the shore, then you're sho' not me-oh
Get the fuck up, this boat is real!
Fuck land, I'm on a boat, motherfucker 
Fuck trees, I climb buoys, motherfucker 
I'm on the deck with my boys, motherfucker 
This boat engine make noise, motherfucker
Hey, ma, if you could see me now 
Arms spread wide on the starboard bow 
Gonna fly this boat to the moon somehow 
Like Kevin Garnett, anything is possible
Yeah, never thought I'd be on a boat 
It's a big, blue, watery road 
Poseidon, look at me, oh 
Never thought I'd see the day
When a big boat coming my way
Believe me when I say
I fucked a mermaid, whoah
I'm on a boat
I'm on a boat
Everybody look at me, 'cause I'm sailing on a boat
I'm on a boat
I'm on a boat
Take a good, hard look at the motherfucking boat
Sha-sha-sha
Sha-sha-sha
Sha-sha-sha
Shawty, shawty
Yeah, yeah, yeah
