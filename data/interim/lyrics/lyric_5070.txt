Baby, baby
Baby, make your own sweet music
Baby, make your own sweet music
Take a loving feeling
Add some kissing to it
Mix it in your heart and
You'll be dancing on the ceiling
Baby, baby
You got to make your own music
You got to let it groove inside you
You only need your soul to guide you
And make me wanna play it with you
Baby, baby
The melody of love is in you
Just open up your heart and listen
Hear the beat you're missing
Baby, make your own sweet music
Straight from your heart and
Let me show you how to use it
I could teach you the part
Every night and we could use it
Playing all the music
Whoa, baby, baby
I'm weeping every night without you
Baby, baby
Make your own sweet music
Take it straight from your heart
And let me show you how to use it
I could teach you the part
Every night and we could use it
Playing all the music
Whoa, baby, baby
I'm weeping every night without you
I love you, won't you
Please believe me
I'll make you never want to leave me
With every burning kiss I give you
Baby, baby
You got to make your sweer music
You got to let it groove inside you
You only need your soul to guide you
Now, now, now, now
Baby, baby
The melody of love is in you
