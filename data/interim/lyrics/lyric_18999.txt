Right here waiting
Staying strong
Come and
Fall into me
You say you've turned it off
Hid your heart up on a shelf
Scared of what it might cost
To take it down for someone else
Cause loving him you lost
Too much of yourself
Baby can't you see
That he's
Not me
And I need you
To know you can
Fall into me
That my arms
Are wide open and
Will always be
Right here waiting
Staying strong
Come and
Fall into me
I'll follow any road
Anywhere to get to you
I'll open up my soul
If that's what you need me to do
Now baby it's your move
All you got to do is believe
In love
Just believe
In us
Just believe in love
Just believe in us
Baby I need you
To know you can
Fall into me
That my arms
Are wide open and
Will always be
Right here waiting
Staying strong
Come and
Fall into me
Come and
Fall into me
