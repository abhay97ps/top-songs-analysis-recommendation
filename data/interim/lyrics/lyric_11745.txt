She comes on like daylight softly creeping
Sneaking through the glass
When I taste her lips
I know the night time ain't for sleeping
Cause morning comes too fast with Merilee
Sweet Merilee
Merilee please don't go
Merilee please don't go
I need you so
You've got to know
I'll never let you go
Merilee
Laying on her side
The clouds desert the sky
Washing her with moonlight
In a Cinderella sleep
The twilight kissed her eyes
Dream a little dream of me tonight Merilee
Sweet Merilee
Merilee please don't go
Merilee please don't go
I need you so
You've got to know
I'll never let you go
Merilee
