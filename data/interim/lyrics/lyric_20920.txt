Hey! I'm on my daily baby!
What! What! I know you love me baby
 Yeah Slim, Yung J-O-C
Just stepped out, fresh out the shower
Gotta stay fresh, take about an hour
Gotta get dressed, your boy so clean
Both of them on, I got the blue jeans
Fresh pair of shades, ice on my wrist
Socks to the draws, your boy stay fit
I'm ready  Can't nobody tell me nothin
I'm so fly  Feels like I'm takin off
I'm so high  Lookin for a shorty to break me off
I'm so fly  Feels like I'm takin off
I'm so high  Lookin for a shorty to break me off
I'm so fly
Stop by Q's, pick my toy
Top drop down let the haters hear the noise
Hit that pad and turn that wheel
Push that rim make it all disappear
Phone is ringin hit the bluetooth
Call me on the phone like hey what it do?
I'm comin  And we gonna take this over
I'm so fly  Feels like I'm takin off
I'm so high  Lookin for a shorty to break me off
I'm so fly  Feels like I'm takin off
I'm so high  Lookin for a shorty to break me off
I'm so fly
As were headin to the club, everybody know what's up
Through the door, V.I.P
All the ladies go with me
Order drinks, come on in, everybody it's on me
Showin love, can't nobody tell me nothin I'm so fly
She ask me how's the air up there you can catch me on the tree top
And this right here's a classic like a pair of Reeboks
Switchin fo' lanes in the old school tee top
Twenty H chop chop choppin up them streets hot
Lit the club on fire with anything that we drop
And make the juicebox wet make the pussy beatbox
 She on the hand stand and I love the way she peep out
You can tell I'mma G, you can tell I'm a G
You can tell I'm a G, she can tell I'm a G
I got the Gmail, let's play the G code
I touch the G spot, we in the G4
Hundred dollar bill, that's a C Note
You got ten of 'em, then that's a G Note
I check the time ice blocks on my G shop
You know who it is Slim and Yung Jizzoc
I'm so fly  Feels like I'm takin off
I'm so high  Lookin for a shorty to break me off
I'm so fly  Feels like I'm takin off
I'm so high  Lookin for a shorty to break me off
I'm so fly, feels like I'm takin off I'm so high
Lookin for a shorty to break me off
