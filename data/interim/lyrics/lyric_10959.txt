The best things in life are free
But you can give them to the birds and bees
I want money
I want money
Money
I want money
Money, money, money
I want money
Money
Money
Money, money , money
Money don't get everything, it's true
What it don't get, I can't use
I want money
I want money
Money
I want money
Money, money, money
Your love gives me such a thrill
But your love won't pay my bills
I want money
That's what I want
I want money
That's what I want
I want money
The best things in life are free
But you can give them to the birds and bees
I want money
I want money
Money
I want money
Money, money, money
I want money
I want money
Money
I want money
Money, money, money, money
Money
