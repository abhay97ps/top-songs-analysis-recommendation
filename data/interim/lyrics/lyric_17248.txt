You got me fired up, fired up
You got me so
You got me fired up, fired up
You got me so
You got me fired up, fired up
You got me so
When i see you, make me lose all control
Like a fire burning deep in my soul, yeah
And when i feel you it feels like i'm in heaven
It goes on forever like a dime on a roll
And when i hear you calling it's like heaven
I'll wait here forever till i'm out of the cold, yeah
And when i hear you calling i'm in heaven
We'll be there together, no i won't be alone
You got me fired up, fired up
You got me so
You got me fired up, fired up
You got me so
You got me fired up, fired up
You got me so
You got me fired up, fired
