Save me...
Save me...
She's not a star
But she'll go far
So she's telling all her friends
She's only young and just begun
To see clearly
In her eyes
Nothing turned out like she thought it would
And I was waiting right there where she stood
She said: save me
From this wicked world I'm livin' in
She said: save me
I don't wanna lose, I wanna win
I can't run and I can't hide
I can't run and I can't hide
She said: save me
She said save me...
Ooh!
All on her own
She's on the phone
So sincerely...
Ooh... makin' a joke
There's no reply
She wonders why
And pays the rent one more time
Everybody's out there on the take
And I was there when she began to brake
She said: save me
From this wicked world I'm livin' in
She said: save me
I don't wanna lose, I wanna win
I can't run and I can't hide
I can't run and I can't hide
She said: save me
She said save me...
Ooh!
Everybody's out there on the take
And I was there when she began to brake
She said: save me
From this wicked world I'm livin' in
She said: save me
I don't wanna lose, I wanna win
I can't run and I can't hide
I can't run and I can't hide
She said: save me
She said save me...
Save me, girl
Save me, girl
Save my soul
Save me, girl
Save my soul
Save me, girl
Save my soul, baby
Save me girl
Ooh...
Save me, girl
Save my soul
You can't run
You can't hide
Come on, baby
Hoo!
Save my soul...
Ooh!
