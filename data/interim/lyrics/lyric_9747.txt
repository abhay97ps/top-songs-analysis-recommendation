Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burning
To my surprise - listen - one hundred stories high
People getting loose y'all, getting down on the roof, do you hear?
The funk was flaming, out of control
It was so entertaining, when the boogie started to explode
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burning
Satisfaction, came in the chain reaction
I couldn't get enough, 'till I had to self-destruct
The heat was on, rising to the top
Everybody's going strong, and that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burning
Up above my head, I hear music in the air
That makes me know there's somebody somewhere
Satisfaction, came in a chain reaction, do you hear?
I couldn't get enough, so I had to self-destruct
The heat was on, rising to the top
Everybody's going strong, that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burning
(Just can't stop
When my spark gets hot)
Burning 
I don't know if you understand what i'm talking about
I'm not talking about burning down a building
It's coming from the soul
Soul funk
Burning in my soul
Just can't stop
Ow
Now, listen
Don't you rescue me
Let my spirit burn free
Don't you rescue me, no
Just can't stop
Let my spirit burn free
Everybody say ow
Ow
Say ow
Ow
You feel the spirit tonight
Ow
Disco funk
Ow
Come here on the floor
Let's rock some more
I'm on fire
Burning, Burning
I'm on fire
Burning, Burning
Let the good times roll
Burning, Burning
Do you feel alright?
Burning
Feel pretty good, y'all
Burning
People getting loose
Burning
Getting down on the groove
Burning
The flame is higher
Burning
Is higher
Burning
Alright
Burning
I can't get enough
Burning
I want some more
Burning
I want some more
Burning
I'm burning
Burning
I'm burning
Burning
Burning in the soul
Burning, burning, burning, burning, burning, burning, burning
(Just can't stop
When my spark gets hot)
(Just can't stop
When my spark gets hot)
Just can't stop
(Just can't stop
When my spark gets hot)
Just can't stop
(Just can't stop
When my spark gets hot)
Just can't stop
(Just can't stop
When my spark gets hot)
Just can't stop
(Just can't stop
When my spark gets hot)
Just can't stop
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
