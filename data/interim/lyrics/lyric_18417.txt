Yo, FLEX, bro, this beat has a melody, bro
I don't think this is allowed
I don't think, I don't think you're allowed to use this one
Ayy
Knock his head off, leave it rollin', Limp Bizkit
They like "Who the nigga who be talkin' 'bout his wrist slit?"
I ain't one to entertain these niggas on that bitch shit
Why the fuck you actin' tough? Pussy, you ain't did shit
Fucked up, you get fucked up, put your ones up
What's up? Pussy, what's up? Shut the fuck up
Stuck up, you get cut up, don't get strung up
Hung up, you get hung up, push your luck up
Back at it
He want smoke then he get fucked up like a crack addict
He hyperventilatin', hah-hah, asthmatic
Tried to be a bitch nigga but I'm bad at it
Make him disappear, black magic
Ayy, we killin' this shit, you can't stop us
Fuckin' with the gang, introduce him to these choppers
Don't fuck with the fakes, you all lames, you imposters
Told that bitch kiss on my dick like my boxers
Chopper or the blade, send you up-up and away, bitch
Won't have shit to say when I rearrange your face, bitch
Pull up with the motherfuckin' letter after J, bitch
He lookin' like a slut, givin' head to the pavement
I don't give a fuck about a cosign or a placement
If he talkin' tough then we send him to the basement
You don't fuckin' bang, give a fuck 'bout what you claimin'
Leave his momma cryin', disappear without a trace, bitch
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', bitch
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', bitch
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', bitch
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Knock his head off, leave it rollin', Limp Bizkit
They like "Who the nigga who be talkin' 'bout his wrist slit?"
I ain't one to entertain these niggas on that bitch shit
Why the fuck you actin' tough? Pussy, you ain't did shit
Fucked up, you get fucked up, put your ones up
What's up? Pussy, what's up? Shut the fuck up
Stuck up, you get cut up, don't get strung up
Hung up, you get hung up, push your luck up
