Yeah, just like that
Ah-ha-ha-ha
Ooh...hoo...hoo...
Yeah, yeah
When I'm with you, I hear a sound
That makes me laugh and smile and sing to you
When I'm with you, I feel so free
I love that love is going to take control of me
When I'm with you
It's for real 
What I feel 
When I'm with you , uh-huh
When I'm with you, I wonder why
People do stop and stare and smile at us
When I'm with you, the sun shines my way
Baby, our love reflects its rays of light on everyone in the world
When I'm with you
It's for real 
What I feel 
When I’m with you , you, hey, hey, hey
Oh
Special touch, a warm embrace
A sweet and tender kiss, your smile, whoa
Body warm my heart, so pure
Chills when I look, look in your eyes
I wonder why
People do stop
And stare 
And smile at us
When I’m with you, the sun shines my way
Baby, our love reflects its rays of light
On everyone in the world
When I’m with you
It’s for real 
What I feel 
When I’m with you , you, hey, hey, hey
Oh, girl
I love you, baby
Ye-ye-ye-yes, I do
Ye-ye-ye-yes, I do
I’d give the world to you, baby
When I’m with you, whoa...baby
It’s for real 
What I feel 
When I’m with you , yeah, yeah, eah, hey
Everything, everything’s alright
When I’m with you
It’s for real 
What I feel 
It’s okay 
Every day 
It’s so nice 
So right now 
When I’m with you 
Nobody but you
Honey, I love you
