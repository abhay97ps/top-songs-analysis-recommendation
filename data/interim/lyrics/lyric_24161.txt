I got money way before the deal
Put my bitches in new pair of heels
I might fuck your ho and pay her bills
Yeah we was taught to get it how we live, yeah

Got a plug, he Vietnamese
We the niggas they wanna be
Cause we got the key to the streets

Young nigga from the Nawf 
Got my eye on the streets like a hawk 
Wrap ‘em, put ‘em on a boat 
Boy you better not choke 
And there ain't no runnin' off 
We got the key to the streets , everybody notice me 
Used to dream about 50 thousand in my jeans
Now 50 thousand cheap to me
Remember the days watching the Hot Boys and Master P
Now I’m down in Miami
One phone call, I pull up on Weezy 
All of my niggas with me, you feel me
Straps on everybody in the building
All of niggas came from dealing
Or either they kicking in doors and stealing
I feel like I’m not having no feelings
Before the fame, seen quarter million
Came from robbing pizza man
At the top of apartment buildings
I got money way before the deal
Put my bitches in new pair of heels
Ho-ho, ho-whoa, I might fuck your ho and pay her bills
Yeah we was taught to get it how we live, yeah

Any problem, we gon’ air ‘em out, what they talking ‘bout?

Takeoff! I got the key to the streets, my nigga
Just like Dr. Dre, he got the beats 
I come straight up out of 1500
That’s the block, my niggas over East
Double-cup, but no iced tea 
Pour me a four before I go to sleep 
Fucked around and landed in the hospital
Geekin’ off the Henn' and the lean, whoa
Takeoff! 
Man, go head, take off, what, what 
24/7, no day off , balling like we in the playoffs 
20 bitches at the playhouse
You quick to freeze up when that K out 
If that bitch ain’t tryna fuck, I kick her out the house
Like Martin, lil bitty bitch stay out 
They like to whoop me ’til them Ks out
Get to looking for some ways out
You niggas ain’t workin’, you're laid off
Choppa decapitate him, blow his face off 
Won’t get it ‘til these niggas laid out
Assassinating, knock him off like I’m Adolf 
Been getting money, 19 with a 650
Nut seen me stunting, B.I.P., Blood
