Just take a minute and catch the vibe
Just take a minute and catch the vibe
Just take a minute and catch the vibe
Just take a minute and catch the vibe
Coolin' in the studio you know how the story goes
Bobbin' our heads to the tune we're about to do
It's a laid back swing thang
The groove we feel is strong
We need peace here to get it on
Having fun as we go, makin' sure the flavor shows
Cause we're feeling alright
Takin' our time to free our minds and have a ball, ya'll
Everything's fine it ain't nothing to it cause
We're gonna do it all, what are we doin'
We're just vibin' dancing the night away
Groovin', vibin', non-stop until the break of day
Ooh yeah yeah, in a dark room with a brew like
In the basement music just right
Nothing goin' down but the mellow sounds
Of Mr. DJ's turntables goin' round
A mad sensation, a crew of women around sparks inspiration
To set something off the right way to hear the people say
That we're feelin' alright
Takin' our time to free our minds and have a ball ya'll
Everything's fine it ain't nothing to it
'Cause we're gonna do it all, don't you know that
We're just vibin' dancing the night away
Groovin', vibin', don't stop until the break of day
We're just vibin' dancing the night away
Groovin', vibin', don't stop until the break of day
Just take a minute and catch the vibe
Put you mind at ease just catch the vibe
Just take a minute and catch the vibe
Don't press yourself just catch the vibe
Just take a minute and catch the vibe
Put you mind at ease just catch the vibe
Just take a minute and catch the vibe
Don't press yourself just catch the vibe
We're just vibin' dancing the night away
Groovin', vibin', don't stop until the break of day
Just take a minute and 
Put your mind at ease and 
Just take a minute and 
Don't Press yourself and 
Just take a minute and 
Put your mind at ease and 
Just take a minute and 
Don't Press yourself and
