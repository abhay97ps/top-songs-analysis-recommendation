A roaring lion, walketh about, seekin' whom he may devour
Take some, rain, nonstop, rain don't want war
Rain come, rain come
Come shine, come rain, come up
Southside, let it bang
Outside, let it rain
Rain down on a pain
Rain down on the slain
Rain down for my mom 
Rain down on the farm 
Shower us with your love 
Wash us in the blood  
Drop this for the thugs 
Know I grew up in the mud 
The top is not enough
Wash us in the blood 
Is there anybody here? Huh
Is there anybody here? Ooh
That can save no matter how much he player-hate? Hahaha
It was the blood that, ooh
It was the blood that, God
It was the blood that cleansed me, ha
It was the, ooh
Shower down on us 
Wash us in the blood 
Wash us in the blood 
Whole life bein' thugs 
No choice, sellin' drugs 
Southside, what it does? 
Rain down on us 
Genocide what it does 
Slavery what it does 
Rain down on us 
Whole life sellin' drugs 
Wash us in the blood 
Wash us in Your blood 
Wash us in the blood 
Wash us in the blood
Wash us in the blood
Holy Spirit, come down 
Holy Spirit, come down 
Holy Spirit, help now 
Holy Spirit, help now 
Holy Spirit, come down 
Holy Spirit, come down 
Holy Spirit, help now 
Holy Spirit, help now 
Wash us in the blood 
Whole life bein' thugs 
No choice, sellin' drugs 
Genocide what it does 
Mass incarc' what it does 
Cost a cause what it does 
'Nother life bein' lost 
Let it off, set it off
Execution, thirty states 
Thirty states still execute 
Thou shall not kill, I shall not spill, Nextels at the rendezvous 
We dodgin' time in the federal 
Squad box you in like a sectional
We walk through the glass and the residue 
Now look what we headed to 
Rain down on us 
Rain down on us 
Wash us in the blood 
Wash us in the blood 
Holy Spirit, come down 
Holy Spirit, come down 
And they tryna control Ye 
They want me to calm down 
They don't want me to Kanye
They don't want Kanye to be Kanye
They wanna sign a fake Kanye
They tryna sign a calm Ye
That's right, I call 'em Calm-Ye
But don't take me the wrong way 
But don't take me the wrong way 
'Cause God took me a long way 
They wanna edit the interviews 
They wanna take it to interludes 
Cut a whole sentence to interlude 
You know that it's fake if it's in the news 
So I let it fly when I'm in the booth 
The devil a liar and I been the truth
Livin' 'cause nobody livin'
And nobody gettin' it, doin' it different 
Rain down on us 
Holy Spirit, come down 
Holy Spirit, come down 
We need You now
Wash us in the blood 
Whole life bein' thugs 
No choice, sellin' drugs 
Genocide what it does
Slavery what it does
