Love is Like a Rock
You can't depend on your teacher
You can't depend on your preacher
You can't depend on politicians
You can't depend on superstitions
Love can rock you
Never stop you
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Love is like a rock
You can't rely on Mother Nature
You can't rely on your paychecks
You can't depend on your doctor
You can't depend on your lawyer
Love can rock you
Never stop you
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Love is like a rock
Love can rock you
Never stop you
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Love is like a rock
