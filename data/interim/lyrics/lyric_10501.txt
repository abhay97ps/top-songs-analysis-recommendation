I could spend my whole life writing love songs
If they'd help bring me closer to you
Trying to find the right words
But they all get so blurred
While expressing my feelings I get so confused
I can analyze and you can analyze
We can both analyze till we're blue
Let emotions take reign let them play their own games
Let the freedom of youth captivate you
Let this song last forever let this song last a day
Let our love last a lifetime let our love fade away
No matter what happens if we go our own way
We'll be both walking wiser if walking away
No I know you've been hurt you've been broken
Life just ain't real without pain
And there's no guarantee that all ends happily
But when you fall you gotta rise up swinging again
And you can run away I can run away
We can both run till our lives are through
Some people hide till their hollow inside
Please don't allow this to happen to you
Let this song last forever let this song last a day
Let our love last a lifetime let our love fade away
No matter what happens if we go our own way
We'll be both walking wiser if walking away
I'm so damn tired of hearing songs about pain
There's so much to learn, life's too short now to spend it afraid
Let this song last forever let this song last a day
Let our love last a lifetime let our love fade away
No matter what happens if we go our own way
We'll be both walking wiser if walking away
