Blame it on the goose, got you feeling loose
Blame it on the 'tron, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Eh, she say she usually don't
But I know that she front
Cause shawty know what she want
But she don't wanna seem like she's easy
I ain't saying what you won't do
But you know we probably gonna do
What you been feelin' deep
Insi-i-ide, don't li-i-ie now
Boy, what you drinking? 
Here for the weekend 
See where we can be if we press fast forward 
Just one more round and you're down, I know it 
Fill another cup up
Feeling on your 
You don't even care now
I was unaware how
Fine you was before my buzz set in 
Blame it on the goose, got you feeling loose
Blame it on the 'tron, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka 
Blame it on the henny 
Blame it on the blue top 
Got you feeling dizzy 
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Ooh see
She spilled some drink on me 
And now I'm knowing she's tipsy 
She put her body on me
And she keep staring me right in my eyes
No telling what I'm gonna do 
Baby I would rather show you 
What you been missing in your
Li-i-i-ife when I get insi-i-i-ide
Boy, what you drinking? 
Here for the weekend 
See where we can be if we press fast forward 
Just one more round and you're down I know it yeah 
Fill another cup up
Feeling on your butt what?
You don't even care now
I was unaware how
Fine you was before my buzz set in 
Blame it on the goose,  got you feeling loose
Blame it on the 'tron, got you in the zone 
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol 
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol 
Blame it on the vodka {Hey}

Blame it on the blue top 
Got you feeling dizzy 
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Now to the ballas poppin' bottles
With their henny in their cup
Screaming money ain't a thing
If you ain't throw it up
In the sky 
And hold your drinks up high 
To my independent mamas
Who can buy their own bottles
If you looking like a model
When them broke fellas holla
Tell them bye 
Hold your drinks up high 
Blame it on the goose, got you feeling loose
Blame it on the 'tron, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol 
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol 
Blame it on the vodka {Hey}
Blame it on the henny {Hey}
Blame it on the blue top 
Got you feeling dizzy 
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
