INTRO
Robert Johnson - Me and The Devil Blues
Early this morning, When you knocked upon my door
Early this morning, oooh, When you knocked upon my door
I said Hello Satan, I believe it's time to go
BRIDGE 1 
I wanna spark a doobie in school
So I can spark the idea that we don't wanna follow rules
But I'm independent and the crowd will squish me beneath
See I'm the only one trying so I'm seen as the least
Now if the whole world came and said fuck education
No one would protest, It'd be the choice of the nation
It's the amount of people who make the movements happen
And for now it's me against the world, captain
VERSE 1: 
Satan be tempting us
But we feel as if we're tempting ourselves because we ain't seen the presence of hell
I guess Satan is imagination
It's self benefit that lead's us into damnation
Tell me who would give a buck to an old fiend
Who can't eat yet owns the money for a Rollie
You selfish fucker now this old man won't eat
But you rap bout ice on your wrist until you go cheap
Kill a man to save yourself, I speak for most humans
I would, given I lived moment then I'd do it
To break a life, rather than take it away
Is a form of murder like the Eye's breaking of J
Since these rich men murder, I must too
If I my soul be unto Satan so I can live and truly party
But I ain't trying to party
I mean, why gain the world and lose your soul if you can't even choose the cost
Watch a conspiracy video on youtube and y'all say
“golly, guess the truth's beyond me”
Your idea of New World Order is based off
Immortal Technique and a youtube vid, stupid kids
This a movement kids, and y'all need proof to stop me
I could prove to Gotti, that J got the wrong theme
Cause worshiping another human ain't great
You can't pray for nothing but your own fate
It's in your brain, these secret spirits don't exist
No one's gone say zip if you don't believe this phony shit
Its paper tigers in your mind, stop your moaning kid
Like homie, you don't know me but the whole world owe me, strip
8
No one listens to you, but they can see you speaking
Hearing and listening are different, do you perceive me
You've got a voice but it ain't that loud
Me too, but I ain't that proud
BRIDGE 2 
I wanna spark a doobie at home
So I can spark the idea that my parents don't own/ me
But I'm independent and the crowd'll squish me beneath
See I'm the only one trying so I'm seen as the least
But if the children said I don't want a mom or dad
The parent's would decide on the children they had
It's the amount of people who make the movements happen
And for now it's me against the world, captain
VERSE 2 
I thought these fucks were a racist group
But now that black men represent them it's like they ate the truth
Back in the day, sadly, a black voice ain't the truth
Now their voice can rap and that's music so they take the news
Over since the media is focused on the music and if music reps
Illuminati then they got their way with you
Who throws up the triangle when they watch the throne
And say they ought to know who J reps if it's not his own
Label, who's he repping, I can't watch it if I'm sitting on it
I ain't even like this chair dog I'm just shitting on it 3:32
Now I'm living life with a promise
Guess my soul is worth a whole fucking lot if Satan's grip is on it
Like dog you if really want us all to go to hell
Just toss money to each of us then your plan be going well
Like damn we overwhelmed, the western world so stressed
I bet most would throw away religion just to own himself
None of y'all are atheists, y'all are pagans
Not the kind that worships witches and dragons
You worship riches and wealth and bitches and health
And all of those who generally just live for themselves
You are your own god, have you not noticed it?
If not, tell me why are you living your life knowing it 3:55
Will one day crumble and be forgotten
If you don't worship something your existence would be rotten
And if you've got no gods then you've got no goals, 4:04
But you have goals, they're sex, money, and benefit, woah
Those are your gods, no it's just what I like to do
You like it cause you seek inner pleasure to enlighten you
You believe in this mental presence of greatness
As humans we know living bored ain't fit for man
You need the sex and broads to make it real life
And the drugs and laughter to make it feel right
BRIDGE 3 
I wanna spark a doobie in jail
So I can spark the idea that I don't like the bail
I'm independent so the crowd will squish me beneath
See I'm the only one trying so I'm seen as the least
See if all the inmates admit they sposed to be there
The bail wouldn't count, either way it don't seem fair
It's the amount of people who make the movements happen
And for now it's me against the world, captain
VERSE 3 
4:45
Last night Robert Johnson came to me in a dream
He said it's time to go Matt, you've been leaving a sweet
Reason for us to take you: see you're scheming up schemes
That make Satan look phony folks believe that he's weak
I said Rob, look folks ain't ever worship Satan
So don't act like they follow him, in fact this world hates him
They love themselves and they love their money
But they don't know that's Satan thinks it himself, ain't it funny
5:11
Look at these arrogant white folk who say that they're Christians
Because they go to church once a week and feel above the system
You're still worshiping money over your god
Luke 16:13 your religion is a fraud
That don't mean there ain't a heaven
That just means if there is one you ain't choosing brethren who's sent in
So who's to blame for making Illuminati a pop fad
Not bad, cause now kids live in fear to talk bad
Rob was like, “ nice speech and shit 5:22
But you know nothing bout the devil you a feeble kid
You are talking like you know shit and even if
You did you're still coming with me deeper kid”
I said Rob, I know you're doing your job
But you were just like me fore you turned that knob
Let the devil the in your house, and revel about
Til he took your soul and laughed and made you tremble and shout
See I ain't letting no one in my brain until they break me
You'd think it was a rape scene, shit I'm not even eight teen
Statutory shit, but for now I'll keep my slate clean
And make cream like a hypocrite with a fake dream
BRIDGE 4 
I wanna spark a doobie at church
I can spark the idea that it ain't getting us hurt
But I'm independent and the crowd will squish me beneath
See I'm the only one trying so I'm seen as the least
So if the whole congregation says that weed is for Jesus
I'd spark a doobie in church, and wouldn't have to make reasons
It's the amount of people who make the movements happen
And for now it's me against the world, captain
VERSE 4 
Guess don't matter how we each wanna make a fortune
Since what we hear is tied lies of fake distortion
They hate overpopulation yet they hate abortion
Bank's are forfeit so we got all these gangstas morphing
6:31
Into pop stars cause the game twisted out proportion
I make the music, but to publish I hafta ask beforehand
No man is favored less his pen works in his sword hand
But in a war I prefer the sword, damn
For six minutes I'm on a roll repeating
The same facts over and over to you fuckers til you know the meaning
It's the government talking - course there's no deceiving
They paid me to make this, you don't know, oh believing
6:51
Lies it what ties into fear, making life demeaning
Cause we're in fear yet you don't even know the key and
The key is that you're living in fear of what you won't believe in
Since you think it's fake, yet fear is real and normal even
Fuck censorship we got wives of soldiers cheating
On their husbands, and they don't even show the freedom
That their husbands fighting for yet the war is more than beating
Foreigners up, its taking them to court to see them
7:11
On trial to make them admit the whole war they breathe and
Our governments do this and still we don't notice even
This ain't a short lecture like a Gary Coleman meeting
This is depressing rap – listen til your soul is fleeting
Good on you if you listened this far
It's just me and Robert Johnson while we sit in a bar
And then the devil walks in and says never again
Will a boy disrespect me with a limitless charge
I said fuck you Satan, and fuck the all seeing Eye
Really I said fuck you to my creativity
Because all this shit is just imagination
Fear of the unknown is what makes us
