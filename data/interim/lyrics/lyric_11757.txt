There's a full moon out tonight
And love is movin' in the shadows
I got no place to run
And it's following me everywhere that I go
There's something in the air
I can feel it everywhere
All the conditions are right
Someone could lose a heart tonight
Someone could lose a heart
With all this kissin' and huggin'
And heavy breathin'
Fallin' under the spell of the
Love you're weavin'
It's gonna get crazy baby if you don't stop
Someone could lose a heart tonight
Someone could lose a heart
Lookin' in your eyes tonight
Don't you know you got me hypnotized
Didn't mean to fall in love
But who could leave this paradise
I can feel it when we touch
Oh, it's too much
All the conditions are right
Someone could lose a heart tonight
Someone could lose a heart
With all this kissin' and huggin'
And heavy breathin'
Fallin' under the spell of the
Love you're weavin'
It's gonna get crazy baby if you don't stop
Someone could lose a heart tonight
Someone could lose a heart
