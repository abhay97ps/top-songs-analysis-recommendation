Oh, Yeah! Yeah, baby!
That's it, that's it!
I'm working with that
Who's the Black Sheep? What's the Black Sheep?
Know not who I am, or when I'm coming, so you sleep
Was it in your room, or was it in your sphere?
Knew not who I was, but listen here
Dres, D-R-E-S, yes I get suckers start
If it's all right with you, I'll rip this here one apart
Back, middle, to the front, don't front
Wanna a good time, gonna give you what you want
Can I hear a hey? 
Now get a yo! 
You got a hey? 
It's for the hoes 
The styling is creative, Black Sheep of the Native
Can't be violated, or even decepticated
I got brothers in the Jungle, cousins on the Quest
Deaf, retarded uncles, in parties where they rest
Guess, which way, what, when, how
Mista Lawnge, Dres, Black Sheep slam now
Know you've heard the others, phonies to the lovers
Then of course, the choice is yours
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at, where it's at
Where's the Black Sheep? Here's the Black Sheep
Even if we wanted to, the flock could not be weak
Watch me swing like this, why should I swing it like that?
Because, in fact, on me, it might not attract
Therefore, I ignore, do as I feel inside
I live with me, I've got my back tonight
Y'know what I'm saying?
Yo, Black, I'm not playing
Need to go with this or go with this with no delaying
See, in actuality, one day can it be
I made it look easy because it is to me
Anytime capacity was filled, try to rock it
Anytime a honey gave us play, tried to knock it
Never was a fool, so we finished school
Never see us sweat and you'll never see us drool
Out to rock the globe while it's still here to rock
Don't punch girls and we don't punch a clock
Gotta go, gotta go, see you later by the cat
And you can't beat that with a bat
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at, where it's at
Now you can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, yes, for this is kind of phat
If you get with that, then you will surely miss
Because that is so wack, I think you'll get with this
For in the day in my life, or rather the life through my days
Never sweat the chaos, for a Balck Sheep has ways
Although, how shall I say it? Take a point, convey it
Styling is quite Dolby, yes, I know those for you play
Not to be all that, thought all that is my goal
Stumble and fell, brother, like Dres would roll
Need a sexy honey for a twilight stroll
Gave up on sushi, give me an egg roll
At A&W, get to the Root, with a boot or sneaker
Get near a speaker, demo to a single
To the kind with fly hoe, damned the scenario
And pass a plate or cross the fader
Black Sheep getting played, like a Sony Innovator
Dres, the creator of a style that is much greater
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at, where it's at
