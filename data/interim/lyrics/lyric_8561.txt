Opens all life's treasures, yeah
And deliverance
From the fruits of evil
So our mission
To bring a melody
Ringin' voices 
Sing sweet harmony

To make your day brighter
One that will last you long
Through troubled days
Giving your heart, ooh

Oh, oh, oh, all of the dark
That falls in your way

In everyone's life
There's a need to be happy, yeah
