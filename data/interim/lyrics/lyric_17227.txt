Always the life of the party
Always the clown of the class
All of my friends see me happy, baby
But happy is only a mask
Nobody knows when I'm alone
Inside my room
I sing another tune
I'm going down
When I hear the sound
The sound of my tears
When you're not around
It's all I can do
When I listen to
The sound of my tears, baby
When I'm missing you
Don't mind the sound of the city, baby
Don't mind the noise of the crowd
Just when I'm lonely
With my thoughts of you
The silence is always too loud
Pay it no mind
You know the truth
Behind the smile
It's only just a lie
Pay it no mind
You know the truth
Behind the smile
It's only just a lie
