In the beginning, God made the land
Then he made the water and creatures, then he made man
He was born with a passion, love and hate
A restless spirit with a need for a mate
But there was something missing, something lost
So he came with the answer, here's what it cost
One part love, one part wild, one part lady, one part child
I give you 
Lots of pretty women
 They can't live without them
 Lots of pretty women
 They can't live without them
And in the garden, lust began
The animal instinct, the wanton man
She fed him with a hunger, an appetite
And filling with emotion he took a bite
It was one part love, one part child
One part lover, one part wild
I give you 
Lots of pretty women
 They can't live without them
 Lots of pretty women
 They can't live without them
Skin on skin
Let the love begin
Women
It was one part love, one part wild
One part lover, one part child
A whole lot of fire, a little bit of ice
A whole lot of something you can't sacrifice
 Hair, eyes, skin on skin
 Legs
 Thighs
What's that spell? 
 What's that spell?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
 Women
 Calling every girl
 All around the world
 Women
 Oh, we can't live without them
 Women
