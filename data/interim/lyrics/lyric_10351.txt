I've never been wrong
But you're the the only one i trust to show me the way
I always hear your voice
And in my dreams i hear you calling my name
What is it about you?
Some kind of light shines from your face
And i can't turn away
I'm like a prisoner
Captured by your eyes
I've been taken
And i've been hypnotized
I'm like a prisoner
Captured by your eyes
I've been taken
And i've been hypnotized
And your eyes say everything
You want to keep me here forever, i can't escape
One minute's so sincere
Then you completely turn against me and i'm afraid
You don't have to say you love me
'cause if you want me, i'll stay
'cause i can't turn away
I'm like a prisoner
Captured by your eyes
I've been taken
Taken by surprise
I'm like a prisoner
Captured by your eyes
I've been taken
And i've been hypnotized
I'm like a prisoner
