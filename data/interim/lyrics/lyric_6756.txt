I walk along an empty street
And night becomes another dawn
It's only heartaches that you meet
And tears that tell me you have gone from me
Is it hard to see that
My heart is breaking
It was yours for the taking
You said we're through
What can I do
When there's no you?
This kind of loneliness I found
Has taken over in my mind
And it will always be around
For love like ours I'll never find, I know
Did you have to go
'Cause my heart is breaking
It was yours for the taking
You said we're through
What can I do
When there's no you?
My heart is breaking
It was yours for the taking
You said we're through
What can I do
When there's no you?
