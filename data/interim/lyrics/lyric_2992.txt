Hello Dolly, well, hello Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly and I can tell, Dolly
You still crowin', you still growin', you still goin' strong
I feel the room swayin', while the band's playin'
One of your old favorite songs from way back when
So take a wrap, fellas, find her an empty lap, fellas
And Dolly never go away again
I said, hello Dolly, well, what do you know, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly and I can tell, Dolly
You're still crowin', you're still growin', you're still goin' strong
Just feel that room swayin' 'cause the band's playin'
One of your old familiar songs from back when
So, golly gee, fellas, find her an empty knee, fellas
And Dolly never go away again
I mean Dolly, what do you know, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
I can tell, Dolly, you're lookin' swell, swell, Dolly
Yeah, you're still crowin', you're still growin', you're still goin' strong
Just feel that room swayin' while the band keeps on playin'
One of your old familiar songs from back when
So, golly gee, fellas, have a little faith in me, fellas
And Dolly never go away again
Just feel that room swayin' while the band is playin'
One of your old familiar songs from back when
So, golly gee, fellas, find her a vacant knee, fellas
Dolly never go away, promise, you'll never go away
Dolly, never go away again
Look out, old Dolly is back
