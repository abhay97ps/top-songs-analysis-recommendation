Every nigga out my city became a boss

Pyrex, cook it up like Kyrie, trade you off 
Green and white like Celtics, don't play with me, play with a fork 
I'm superior, I'm imperial, I ain't feelin' you 
I could eat me some heroin or buy a brick 
I got Barry Bonds on my wrist 
Blowed your college fund , on my bitch 
Out the slums, taking a chance, toting tommy guns 
Left out of school, started selling rocks, bought me a drop 
Cartier frames, Cartier rings, Cartier socks 
Homicide Gang, they gon' put you on Fox 
Putang ran up a whole M sittin' in the box 
My dog rock a Rollie in the feds, nigga, and still move blocks

I'm thinkin' out loud, but these hundreds got a nigga gone 
Far gone, I'm so gone on it
Three hundred racks for a Bentley truck, yeah yeah
Take the factories off and go'n and lift it up, yeah yeah 
Cash all on your bitch, she on the living room floor 
Having a private party, you know how that go 
Music all in my ears , instruments in my ears 
I'm in the backyard feeding deers 
I'm in a penthouse poppin' seals 
I got pom-poms in my rear 
Chanel CoCo in my dear 
I missed a couple shows for my deal
If I could take it back I will 
And don't you take that to the head 
You know I got you in my will 
Told big dawg bring the bricks in
Got a hundred more at the crib 
Make the dope do the windmill 
Nigga swing through at your wheels 
They done quoted two on killed
And I was in Miami countin' a mil' 
I told my bitch, "No more ass shots"
She stopped all the way like a stop sign when it's traffic time
My diamonds dark brown like Budweiser 
Count a half a mil with my bitch, now her feelings sloppy 
Came up out the projects, ain't have shit, yeah 
I wiped a nigga nose for a ticket 
Hit it from the back 
Make her say slime, say slatt 
How you dig that?
Whipped up the fish Parkay and got racks, ayy
We want all the smoke
We want all the smoke 
We want all the smoke 
We want all the smoke 
We want all the smoke
