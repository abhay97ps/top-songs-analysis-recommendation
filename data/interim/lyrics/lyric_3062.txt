Well, you can have him, I don't want him
He didn't love me anyway
He only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was love to stay
Well, if you get that, that wrong fella
There's only one thing that you can do:
Just dig a hole and jump right in it
And pull the ground right, right over you
You can have him, I don't want him
He didn't love me anyway
He only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was a love to stay
The boy I love, he, up and left me
He ran away, yeah, with my best friend
Comes home at night just for one hour
When the daylight comes in, he's gone again
You can have him, I don't want him
He didn't love me anyway
He only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was a love to stay
Life without love is mighty empty
But you know confession's good for the soul
I'd rather have a love that I can cling to, yeah
Than have the world and all of its gold
You can have him, I don't want him
He didn't love me anyway
He only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was a love to stay
You can have him 
I don't want him
He didn't love me anyway 
He only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was a love to stay
