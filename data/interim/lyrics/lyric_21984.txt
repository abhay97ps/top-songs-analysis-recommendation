Oooooooh 
Baby girl, where you at?
Got no strings, got men attached 
Can't stop that feelin' for long, no
Mmmm  you makin' dogs wanna beg
Breaking them off your fancy legs 
But they make you feel right at home, now
See, all these illusions just take us too long
And I want it bad
Because you walk pretty
Because you talk pretty
'Cause you make me sick
And I'm not leavin'
Till you're leavin'
Oh, I swear, there's something when she's pumpin' asking for a raise
Well, does she want me to carry her home, now?
So, does she want me to buy her things?
On my house, on my job
On my loot, shoes, my shirt
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?
When I get you alone
When I get you, you'll know, baby
When I get you alone
When I get you alone 
 Come on 
Oh yeah-yeah 
Baby girl, you the shhh
That makes you my equivalent 
Well, you can keep your toys in the drawer tonight
Alright 
All my dawgs talkin' fast-
Ain't you got some photographs? 
'Cause you shook that room like a star, now
Yes you did
Yes you did
All these intrusions just take us too long
And I want you so bad
Because you walk steady
Because you talk steady
'Cause you make me sick
And I'm not leavin', till you're leavin'
So, I pray to something she ain't bluffin'
Rubbin' up on me
Well, does she want me to make a vow?
Check it
Well, does she want me to make it now?
On my house, on my job
On my loot, shoes, my voice
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?
When I get you alone
When I get you, you'll know baby
I get you alone
When I get you alone 
 Whoah oh
When I get you alone
