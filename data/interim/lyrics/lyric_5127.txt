I got a little song I wanna sing 
Eddie Floyd wrote the song for us
And I believe I could tell the world about it 
He told me to tell 'em about my baby 
Oh baby, and I got to sing the song
This is what Eddie told me to tell 'em
Baby, don't you worry about your man
I be comin' home as soon as I can
I got a love in the palm of my hand
Got to get back to you just as soon as I can
You don't know, oh, what you mean to me
You don't know, no, what you mean to me
You don't know, no, no, no, you don't know
He also tell me to tell all the brothers this here
He said, look...
I've got lovin' you on my mind
I'm startin' right now, so I will be on time
I wanna do all that I can 
Just to prove to you that I'm a livin' soul man
You don't know, no, what you mean to me

'Cause that's the way I planned it, yeah

That's the way I planned it 
I'm gonna hold you 'til you can't stand it
'Cause that's the way I planned it 
Oh, I'm gonna love you , love you 
Love you just as hard as I can
And oh , and oh , and oh
