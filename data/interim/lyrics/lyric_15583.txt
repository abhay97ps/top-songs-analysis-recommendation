Ooh...
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Love you, love you
I love you, love you
Love you, love you
I love you
Ooh...
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Lying awake I turn to you as you are softly sleeping
I think of what I'd like to do while you are somewhere dreaming
I, I feel so happy by your side
Oh why, I wonder, wonder, wonder why
Find it hard to find the words to say what I am feeling
I'm so in love, I'm so alive and I know you're the reason why
Why I'm so happy all the time
Oh why, I wonder, wonder, wonder why
I need nothing else in life than to hold you
I, oh I am in so deep, I don't need no sleep
Just baby you and me
Baby I live for loving you
Ooh...
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Live for loving you
All I wanna do is love you
Love you
It would never cross my mind to find another lover
'Cause after having been with you, there could be no other
I, just touching you I'm satisfied
Oh why, I wonder, wonder, wonder why
I need nothing else in life that to hold you
I, oh I am in so deep, I don't need no sleep
I just baby you and me
Baby I live for loving you
Ooh...
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Live for loving you
All I wanna do is love you
Is love you
I love you
I, I, I love you
Love you
I wonder, wonder, wonder why
I love you, love you
Baby I live for loving you
Ooh...
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Live for loving you
All I wanna do
All I wanna do is love you
Is love you, is love you
