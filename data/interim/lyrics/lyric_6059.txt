My love, the days are colder
So let me take your hand and lead you through a snow white land
My love, the year is older
So, let me hold you tight and while away this winter night
I see the firelight in your eyes
Come kiss me now, before it dies
We'll find a winter world of love
Cause love is warmer in December
My darlin', stay here in my arms
Till summer comes along
And in our winter world of love
You'll see we always will remember
That as the snow lay on the ground
We found our winter world of love
Because the nights are longer
We'll have the time to say such tender things before each day
And then, when love is stronger
Perhaps you'll give your heart and promise me we'll never part, oh no
And at the end of every year
I'll be so glad to have you near
We'll find a winter world of love
For love is warmer in December
My darlin', stay here in my arms
Till summer comes along
And in our winter world of love
You'll see we always will remember
That as the snow lay on the ground
We found our winter world of love
