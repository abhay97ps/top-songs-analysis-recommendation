Feeling, can't stop this feeling, oh no
The perfect lover
That's what you are, baby
I'm in heaven
You take me to heaven
Fly like an angel
Be my lucky star, baby ooh
Transmission's on and up we go
Imagination high, my resistance low, yo
And all you gotta do is say
And don't you worry, it's alright
So exciting and so right
Don't stop what you do to me
Cause girl I'm hot and I'm ready to please
Just say where Billy, when Billy, can we do it all again Billy
I'll be your licence to chill
Ooh what a feeling
I'm rocking and reeling
Seeing is believing
And you got the key
Transmission's on and up we go
Imagination high, my resistance low, yo
And all you gotta do is say
Don't you worry it's alright
So exciting and so right
Don't stop what you do to me
Cause I'm hot and I'm ready to please
Just say where Billy, when Billy, can we do it again Billy
I'll be your license to chill
Transmission's on and up we go
All you gotta do is say
Don't you worry, it's alright
It's so exciting and so right
Don't stop what you do to me cause I'm gonna give you loving
Like it ought to be
Just say where Billy, when Billy
