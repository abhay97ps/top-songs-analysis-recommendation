So I'm basically sent by the man now
I'ma just do what I can now
From my existence, this girl is banned now
Told that girl I won't be in no jam now
Ain't no way you can, um, have my baby 
Told that girl that she acting too crazy 
She want me 'cause I'm driving Mercedes 
Well, it's Maybach, so this is too different 
She like the way that my rims be sitting 
She like the way my bass, it be hitting 
She looked at me, her lips she keep licking
I had to ice out my Rollie 
I drive my whip like it's stolen 
She thought I was gon' say "Get in"
But everything in life is written 
My Balmain jeans barely fitting
She do anything just to fit in
Oh my gosh, she start to lickin'
I like to play with her kitten
My boys just came home

You is too bad for my brain, you is too bad for my memory 
But I love when you give brain, I swear that's my only memory 
Everything that you say I did, but I swear not a sin in me 
Every time that you went out, you always linked up with a frenemy 
Girl, I saw you with the opps, you is not family, no kin to me 
I swear that shit, it need to stop, I am too numb, it ain't killing me 
Matter of fact, you can do what you want 
Okay, shut up, are you done? 
I'm not falling for that, I'm not dumb 
You the one, I'm not the one that's sprung 
You the one, I'm not the one that's up 
Drowning all my sorrows up in rum 
I'ma count this money with my thumb 
I can make that girl cry 'til she cum 
I remember she said I was nothing, yeah
Now she's bussing, yeah 
My life faulty, yeah
