That old black magic
Has me in it's spell
That old black magic
That you weave so well
Those icy fingers
Up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft
When your eyes meet mine
I love them so, yeah
The same old tingle
That I feel inside
And then that elevator
Starts it's ride
And, darling
Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf that's
Caught in a tide
Yeah, I should stay away
But what can I do
I hear your name
And I'm aflame
Whoa, oh, oh
Aflame with such
A burning desire
Hey, that only your kiss, kiss
Can put out the fire
Well, now you're the lover
I have waited for
You're the mate that fate
Had me created for
And every time
Your lips meet mine
Yo, down and down I go
And round and round I go
In a spin, loving the spin that I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
Okay, one more time
Yeah, down and down I go
Round and round I go
I'm in a spin and I'm
Loving the spin that I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
Yeah, under that old
Black magic called love
Yeah, under that old
Black magic called love
Yeah, under that old
Black magic called love
Keep on talking 'bout the black old magic...
