I see her laying by the poolside every day
She ain't got a lot on
She ain't got a lot to say
She wouldn't look my way
But buddy, what do you expect
I'm just the fix-it-up boy at the apartment complex
And she'll go out dancing' 'bout 7:15
Climb into the back of a long limousine
I know where she's going
She's going downtown
I'm going downtown, too, and take a look around
See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't hooked it up yet
But I'm trying hard as I can
It's just a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man
I'm just sitting 'round waiting on a telephone call
After water pipe exploded in the living room wall
If your washer and dryer in need of repair
You know the handyman's waiting
And he'll be right there
Twenty-four hours
Seven days a week
If it's getting clogged up or maybe starting to leak
Just ring up my number, baby, give me a try
You know I got all the tools
And I can satisfy
See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't asked her out yet
'Cause I don't know if I can
You see a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man, man
See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't hooked it up yet
But I'm trying hard as I can
It's just a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man
Ain't no high maintenance woman
Gonna fall for a maintenance man, no
