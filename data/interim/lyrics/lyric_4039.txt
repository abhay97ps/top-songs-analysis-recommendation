I love you, baby
Need you, darling, all right
Now that I found gold
You know I'm gonna stake my claim
It's not the kind of gold
That gives a man fortune and fame
Before I met you, girl
My life was so empty
To others, I'm still poor
But to me, I've got plenty
And, baby, let me tell you, baby
I struck it rich when I found you, baby
And I found you in the nick of time
I struck it rich when I found you, honey
And I'll be rich just as long as you're mine
Cause I love you, baby
I need you, darling, all right
Girls like you are rare, it's true
You can't find them no more
But I was like a miner searching
Hard to find it and got my reward
Many years ago, a wise man said
Good things come to those
Who go out and get it
And, baby, I went out and got you
I struck it rich when I found you, baby
Oh, I found you in the nick of time
I struck it rich when I found your loving
And I'll be rich just as long as you're mine
Cause I love you, baby
I need you, honey, all right
Sing it with me now
I struck it rich when I found you, baby
Oh, I'm wealthy cause I'm healthy
And you're so young
I struck it rich when I found you, baby
Cause my name is on the tip of your tongue
I struck it rich when I found you, baby
You're my girl, don't you know
We got it made in the shade now
