No use pretending
Things can still be right
There's really nothing more to say
I'll get along
Without your kiss goodnight
Just close the door and walk away
Never gonna fall in love again
I don't wanna start with someone new
Cause I couldn't bear to see it end
Just like me and you
No, I never wanna feel the pain
Of remembering how it used to be
Never gonna fall in love again
Just like you and me
At first we thought
That love was here to stay
The summer made it seem so right
But like the sun
We watched it fade away
From morning into lonely night
