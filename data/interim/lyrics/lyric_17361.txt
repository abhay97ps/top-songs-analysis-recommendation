In the middle of the night
I tried to cry myself to sleep but I
Can't even close my eyes
Just thinkin bout you
What would i do without you?
Cause i wanna be there
Always there, and
Chorus
I, can't let go
Deep inside i wanna let it show
Cuz i know i gotta let you go
But i, don't even know
Don't wanna know what i'd do
If i were ever without you
Bending lies
Avoiding it for a while
But i, i can't hide it
The fact we need to be apart
I want so much to be with you
What am i, supposed to do?
When i looOOove you!
Chorus
I, can't let go
Deep inside i wanna let it show
Gotta let you go
But i, don't even know
Don't wanna know what i'd do
If i were ever without you
Chorus:
I can't let go
Wanna let it show 
Gotta let you go 
But i don't even know
Don't wanna know what i'd do
If i were ever without you
Shum dum dum no
Shum dum dum no
Shum dum dum no
Shum dum dum no
Baby won't you help me say
I always thought
This would be a perfect kind of love for me
But now i know it's plain to see
Things will work out just for me
But i need to know
Please let me know
If you're gonna be alright,
Cuz i luhve you!, yea
Chorus:
I can't let go
Wanna let it show 
Gotta let you go 
But i don't even know, 
Don't wanna know what i'd do,
If i were ever without you, 
Chorus:
I can't let go
Wanna let it show 
Gotta let you go 
But i don't even know
Don't wanna know what i'd do
If i were ever without you
