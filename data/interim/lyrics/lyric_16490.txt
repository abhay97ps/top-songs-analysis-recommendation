Ooh, ooh
Oh, no, no
Hey, hey
Ooh, ooh
I'm a 90's girl
Ooh
Yes, I am
Making it on my own
Yeah
Back in the day
When my mama was raising me
I never could understand the statement
Stand behind your man
I'd rather be by his side
Sharing the load
So he can see things from my point of view
And read my thoughts
I'm a 90's girl
Willing and able
Proving that I'm capable
And I'm to go for what I know
And I'm going for the best
So don't put me to the test
Cause you know I'll pass
And love can last
I'm a 90's girl
In an ice cold world
Show me some respect
I'm a 90's girl
In an ice cold world
Independent and strong
I can make it on my own
Criticize my effort is
To get what I want
I use it because you fear an equilibrium
Just because I wear some sexy clothes
That don't mean take advantage
And assume I'll go
How can a man be a man
Have the upper hand and signal
And 
So tell me
Whatever happened to chivalry
R-e-s-p-e-c-t
That's all I ask
From you for me
No, no, no, no
Yeah
Yeah, oh
That's all I want, yes
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
I'm a 90's girl
In an ice cold world
Show me some respect
I'm a 90's girl
In an ice cold world
Independent and strong
I can make it on my own
I'm a 90's girl
In an ice cold world
Show me some respect
I'm a 90's girl
In an ice cold world
Independent and strong
I'm a 90's girl
I'm a 90's girl
In an ice cold world
