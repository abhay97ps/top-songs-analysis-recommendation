Sure you haven't got the wrong number?
You sure it's me you want to talk to tonight?
Everyone in town's got your number
Everybody's got you pegged right
Is that why you got in touch with me?
I guess you must be running out of fools
When you went and left me there crying
Your goodbye was even colder than ice
It didn't bother you I was crying
And now you want to break my heart twice
Is that why you got in touch with me?
I guess you must be running out of fools
Guess you got back 
To my name 
In your little black book
Well, listen
Tell you what 
Bet you forgot 
How I even look
So go ahead with all your sweet talking
Go ahead for all the good it can do
Have yourself a dime's worth of talking
And then I'm going to hang right up on you
Because this time, you're not, you're not getting through to me
I guess you must be running out of fools
Even fools like me
Even fools like me
I said you're running out of fools
Even old fools like me
