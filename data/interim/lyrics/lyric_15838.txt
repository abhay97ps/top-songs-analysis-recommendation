Brainstorming
Once you get your feelings hurt
So you wanna be loved by me?
Love, my name is MC B
Brainstorming
Hoping that you would come back home
Or call me on the telephone 'cause I'm so alone
Walked around the house thinking of you
See me and you hand in hand
That's how it used to be
The happy days
The times we shared
Without you, baby is so damn weird
Please forgive the things that I've done to you
I know I did a few
But baby, I'm human too
I'll take you to the beach where the wind blows
And let the waves and the sand run through your toes
Whatever you want
Whatever you
I'll plant the seed
But do you agree?
I should deal with that you have another man
But I can't understand
You're still wearing my wedding band
I'll just chill and think about the whole thing in the morning
So I guess I'll keep
I'll keep on brainstorming
Once you get your feelings hurt
So you wanna be loved by me?
Love, my name is MC B
Now it's daylight
The sun's bright
My mind is clear
I can't smell the breakfast that you used to cook, my dear
Some cold water on my face
So I can come to reality and realize it's me
My mind is not at ease since you've been gone
Please come back 'cause I'm so alone
P.S., yeah, you know been looking for you for the longest
Every since you left
But now I'm real independent you know
Just laid back chilling
I wanna let you know
You're really thought about every night and day
So I came up with these words
And had Boyz II Men sing 'em to you in the background
You know what I'm saying?
But I really want you back
So come back as soon as possible
Cause I love you
Brainstorming
