Alvin, put that harmonica down
Why?
Because we're gonna sing, that's why!
Not again!
Nevermind
Now look fellas, this is a pretty song
So let's try not to goof it up
Are you ready, Simon?
Sure, let's go!
All set, Theodore?
Hot dog, you bet!
Are you ready, Alvin?
Ready, Alvin?
ALVIN!
Aw, nuts!
We sure like girls
All kind of girls
From Annie to Veronica!
We like 'em small or fat or tall...
I wanna play my harmonica!
Now cut that out!
And if we want to get a kiss
We take them fruit or popcorn
Because they always fall in love...
When I play my harmoni-corn!
Alvin!
Will you put that thing down and sing?
OK!
We sure like girls
All kind of girls
From Annie to Veronica
We like 'em small or fat or tall...
I'm gonna play my harmonica!
All right, Alvin
Make a fool of yourself
Play the harmonica
Cha-cha-cha!
Now wait a minute, you guys!
Alvin, you're goofing it all up!
This was a pretty song
It's not supposed to be a...
Cha-cha-cha!
Now look what you did!
You got them all cha-chaing and singing and wrecking the song!
Theodore... Simon... orchestra, will you cut that out?!
Alvin, put that harmonica down! Alvin! AAAAAALVIN!
