Yo C, You know we need to go out and do somethin' man
Got all these hot cars and hot cribs
Ain't got nobody to share it with, baby
Know what I mean? Let's go
Hey girl, how you doin'
My name is Charlie, last name Wilson
I was wonderin' if I could take you out
Show you a good time, invite you to my house
Here is my number, girl you can call me
And don't forget it baby, the name is Charlie
With all of this fortune, what am I doin' single
Sometimes I tell myself, "Man, get out and mingle"
You don't have to be alone, you need someone to love
But bein famous sometimes it's hard to find someone to trust
But the hell with that this time, I'm gonna treat myself
Being in love is good for your health
It's time to share this fortune and fame with someone else
Now that I'm in this club, I might as well, yea

Now, I ain't got nobody to ride in my new Coupe with
Ain't even got nobody to chill with on the weekend
This is just a house, until someone makes it a home
Love don't count me out, cuz I'm so all alone
But the hell with that this time, I'm gonna treat myself
Bein' in love is good for your health
It's time to share this fortune and fame with someone else
Now that I'm in this club, I might as well
