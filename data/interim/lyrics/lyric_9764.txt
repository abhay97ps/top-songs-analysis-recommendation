You need my love, baby, oh so bad
You're not the only one I've ever had
And if I say I want to set you free
Don't you know you'll be in misery
They call me 
They call me Dr. Love 
I've got the cure you're thinking of 
And even though I'm full of sin
In the end, you'll let me in
You'll let me through, there's nothing you can do
You need my loving, don't you know it's true
So answer, please, get on your knees
There are no bills, there are no fees
Baby, I know what your problem is
The first step of the cure is a kiss
So call me 
They call me Dr. Love 
I am your doctor of love  Ha!
