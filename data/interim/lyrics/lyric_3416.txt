Round every corner
Round every corner
Round every corner
Round every corner
Round every corner
Round every corner
Round every corner
Round every corner
Stop being sad now
Life ain't so bad now
Round every corner!
While you're debating
Some things are waiting
Round every corner!
When Columbus sailed away to other shores
How could he imagine all that waited for him?
Round every corner!
Round every corner!
Leave all the gloom days
Think about the new days
Round every corner!
Everything is yours now
Open all the doors now
Round every corner!
Man will soon be standing on the moon above!
Just imagine all the things that he'll discover!
Round every corner!
Round every corner!
You've gottta stop a-sittin' there on the shelf!
You've gotta start lookin' there for yourself!
Yeah!
Round every corner!
Round every corner!
What's the use in crying?
Happiness is lying
Round every corner!
And if you want a true love
Look for a new love
Round every corner!
Just forget the worries that you leave behind!
There are many things to do
And you can find them
Round every corner!
Round every corner!
Round every corner!
Round every corner!
