Evil runnin' through our brain
We and evil is about the same
Bad blood through our body flows
Where's the love nobody knows?
Beauty in our face you see
Tryin' to hide all our misery
But evil runnin' through our brain
We and evil are about the same, oh yeah
Evil... in our life
Evil... causin' strife, yeah yeah
Lookin' for a place to guide
A little light in our souls and minds, oh yeah
Maybe if we learn to pray
Life would give us sunshiny days
And evil, it's runnin' through our brains
Turn to love and won't be the blame
Evil... in our life
Evil... causin' strife
