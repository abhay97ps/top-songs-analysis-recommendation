You know I ain't come to play, let’s get it 
I'm snappin' off the rip, your ho say I’m her favorite nigga 
You probably don't wan' let your baby mama take a picture 
'Cause I'm the type of Baby that's gon' fuck the babysitter 
I just did a show and pulled off laughin' on a hatin’ nigga 
Them bitches aimin’ at y'all fast, I’m on these rapper niggas' ass
I pulled that .40 out, he better have an angel with him 
You tryna book me for a show, you gotta pay me 'fore I go
We feed the family, I ain't got no time to play with niggas 
I see these niggas think they tough, you play with me, you know it’s up
You think it's sweet then call my bluff and I'ma spank a nigga 
Fuck all them niggas and whoever they got hangin' with 'em, bitch
I'ma die of old age whenever I die 
Walk down on that nigga, fuck a drive-by 
His bitch came in with me but she ain't mine, mine 
Free my cousin 'til he free, he doin' time time 
I'm the motherfuckin' best but I'm not Khaled 
She like how I be dressin', ain't no salad 
Can't fuck with her, she messy, that's a hazard 
Tell the ref to blow the whistle, that bitch traveled 
Fuck all that talkin', we 'bout action 
You got a son, you play with me, your son a bastard 
That nigga trippin', why he laughin'?
Nah, that's fucked up, bro, you ain't have to goddamn bring the kids into it
You know I ain't come to play, let's get it 
I'm snappin' off the rip, your ho say I'm her favorite nigga 
You probably don't wan' let your baby mama take a picture 
'Cause I'm the type of Baby that's gon' fuck the babysitter 
I just did a show and pulled off laughin' on a hatin' nigga 
Them bitches aimin' at y'all fast, I'm on these rapper niggas' ass
I pulled that .40 out, he better have an angel with him 
Fuck all them niggas and whoever they got hangin' with 'em, bitch
Shawty wanna be famous, don't it? 
Say that she want a Patek with her name up on it 
You gotta fuck on an opp and get 'em painted, earn it 
I'm drippin', not slippin', my socks got Gucci Gang up on 'em 
Squeeze the fire, make 'em back, back, back, back 
She got fleas, shoo fly, she's a nat, nat, nat, nat 
I'm on lean, I get high, she on batch, I can't match 
I got fiends in a line, shippin' the packs out the back
I did the impossible 
I read the defense, then I had called an audible 
Look like a sequence, Lambo' keep back to back crawlin' in 
They said I wouldn't be shit, so fuck it, I had to go hard again 
300, Sparta man 
I'm a barbarian , I'ma get my revenge 
Fuck on a thot and not at the spot, don't tell her what car I'm in 
Keepin' my head above the water just like a shark fin 
We got the narcs in , chopper Clark Kent 
Don't get boxed in 
You know I ain't come to play, let's get it 
I'm snappin' off the rip, your ho say I'm her favorite nigga 
You probably don't wan' let your baby mama take a picture 
'Cause I'm the type of Baby that's gon' fuck the babysitter 
I just did a show and pulled off laughin' on a hatin' nigga 
Them bitches aimin' at y'all fast, I'm on these rapper niggas' ass
I pulled that .40 out, he better have an angel with him
Fuck all them niggas and whoever they got hangin' with 'em, bitch
