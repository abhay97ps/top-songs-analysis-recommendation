Baby said, "No, can't take another show
Always one more tomorrow"
Baby said, "I just can't wait another day
You'll never get away again"
Calling every night
Trying to keep it tight
Love, it can't go on forever
Flying to my town
Before I touch the ground
I'm heading on my way again
And there ain't no doubt about it
It's hard every step of the way
But there ain't no love without it
'Cause when you find what you need
One more tomorrow
Ain't gonna take it away
Only got time to sing you one line
You're hitching on down to Memphis
Cruising into town
Love, we're getting down
'Til I gotta leave home again
And there ain't no doubt about it
It's hard every step of the way
But there ain't no love without it
'Cause when you find what you need
One more tomorrow
Ain't gonna take it away
Baby said, "No, can't take another show
Always one more tomorrow"
Baby said, "I just can't wait another day
You'll never get away again"
My baby said, "I just can't wait another day
You'll never get away, never get away, never get away again"
