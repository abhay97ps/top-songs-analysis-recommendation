When I say I'm in love, you best believe I'm love: L-U-V!
Here comes my guy
Walking down the street
Look how he walks
With a dancing beat 
Thick wavy hair 
A little too long
All day long he's a-singing his song
And when I see him in the street
My heart takes a leap and skips a beat
Gonna walk right up to him
Give him a great big kiss! Mwah!
Tell him that I love him
Tell him that I care
Tell him that I'll always be there
Well, what color are his eyes?
I don't know, he's always wearing shades
Is he tall?
Well, I've got to look up
Yeah? Well I hear he's bad
Mm, he's good bad, but he's not evil
Tell me more, tell me more
Big bulky sweaters 
To match his eyes 
Dirty finger nails 
Oh boy, what a prize! 
Tight tapered pants
High button shoes
He's always looking like he's got the blues
And when I see him in the street
My heart takes a leap and skips a beat
Gonna walk right up to him
Give him a great big kiss! Mwah!
Tell him that I love him
Tell him that I care
Tell him that I'll always be there
Is he a good dancer?
What do you mean is he a good dancer?
Well, how does he dance?
Close... very, very close...
