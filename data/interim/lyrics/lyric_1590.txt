Darling hold my hand, let me know that you understand
That till I'm free from the girl who loves me
We must be secretly lovers by night, strangers by day
Till the time you can be in my arms endlessly
Lovers by night, strangers by day
She's been good to me but she gets hurt, oh so easily
So till I tell her it's all over stay with me
Let's still be lovers by night, strangers by day
Till we walk, walk as one, hand to hand in the sun
Lovers by night, strangers by day
Lovers by night, strangers by day
Till we walk, walk as one, hand to hand in the sun
Lovers by night, strangers by day
Lovers by night, strangers by day
Lovers by night, strangers by day
Lovers by night
