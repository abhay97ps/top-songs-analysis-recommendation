Last night was the worst night of my life no doubt
'Cause while I stayed at home someone else took you out
I cried 'cause I love you with all of my might
And I missed me, how I missed me at your house last night
Chorus:
I missed holding hands walking out on your lawn
I missed the sweet kiss that was mine for so long
Were you happy with new arms
Wrapped around you so tight
I missed me, how I missed me at your house last night
--- Instrumental ---
Did the neighbours say they noticed anything strange
Like a different car parked in your drive for a change
Did they watch as he kissed you beneath the porch light
Did they miss me like I missed me at your house last night
Chorus:
I missed holding hands walking out on your lawn
I missed the sweet kiss that was mine for so long
Were you happy with new arms
Wrapped around you so tight
I missed me, how I missed me at your house last night...
