Love is
Love is what you make it
You can make or break it
So don't you run
Run and hide
I said love is
Love is what you make it
And if you make it with me
We'll make it alright
Hey, hey, hey
Lover
Don't you run for cover
Don't run to your mother
No reason to
Every time
I said love is
Love is what you make it
And if you make it with me
We'll make it alright
Now, you've been told
That blood runs cold
So you've been holdin' back
But every word
That you have heard
Tends to push you back
But I remember what my mama told me a long time ago
She said "Son, you'll reap what you sow"
Hey, hey, hey
Love is
Come on, love is what you make it
You can make or break it
So don't you run
Run and hide
I said love is
Yeah, love is what you make it
And if you make it with me
We'll make it alright
We can't meet
On a way street
And hope to work it out
'Cause it takes two
To pull it through
And that's what love's about
And I remember what my said to me a long time ago
She said "Son, you've got to reap just what you sow"
Hey, hey, hey
Love is
Yeah, love is what you make it
You can make or break it
So don't you run
Run and hide because
Love is
Love is what you make it
Lord, and if you make it with me
We'll make it alright
Hey, hey, hey
Love is
Love is what you make it
You can make or break it
So don't you run
Run and hide because
Love is
Love is what you make it
And if you make it with me
We'll make it al right
Hey, hey, hey
Love is
Love is what you make it
You can make or break it
So don't you run
Run and hide
I said love is
Love is what you make it
