Shout out to drizzy
I had to say that to start this off
Ha
Yeah yeah yeah
Uh
I’m from a place where snow turn to ice
Quick as friends turn to mice
Niggas rattin
Getcho life
In order
I spit facts for the culture
I don’t don’t do it for the gram
I’m just tryna get this bred
Chasing cheese for the fam
Uh
And when I’m done
I need a crown
Built my flow up from the ground
Hungry then
I’m starving now
Labels wnna bargain now
Guess I’m just a target now
Put the bullseye on my back
Make my lyrics sharper clown
Hol up
Let me switch the flow up
I been stacking money tall
Guess i watched it grow up
All these spook hoes
Wit filter claimin glo ups
Sometimes i wish the social media shit
Would blow up
I came to do
What i came to do
I’m just tryna touch a mil
Never worry about a bill
On the phone wit my main thang
Yeah she said it’s real
Told her get naked and chill
Tryna make them juices spill
Yeah
Headed home after studio
Cruising thru the city slow
While the wind blow
Maybe i should just make this shit
The intro
Nigga stop all that hating
And focus on the dough
