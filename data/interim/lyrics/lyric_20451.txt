Mr. Wipe Down in this biatch 
Down yy heard me, Foxx-a-million 
This one be the remix 
Badazz, Savage life, Foxx-a-million 
Man you already know what it is ya heard me 
We still on 
We still ridin' on chrome 
We still pullin' up 
I pull up at the club VIP
Gas tank on E
But all drinks on me 
Fresh kicks, fresh white tall tee
Fresh NFL hat, fresh bauds with the crease 
Pussy niggas wanna hit me with they heat
Real recognize real
Real niggas gon' speak 
Jiggalatin' I been rolling bout a week
You can tell I got cake by the diamonds in my teeth 
Black shades so you know a nigga rolling
They ain't check me at the door
So ain't no telling what I'm holding 
Bad bitches they gon' bust it wide open
Niggas flashing they lil' bread
But I'm the nigga they approachin' 
Small niggas, tall figures
Y'all niggas, crowd niggas
We gon' get MAC-11s and dog niggas 
Y'all niggas call niggas but my niggas all killas
Get your issue and whoever fall with ya
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
B-O-O-S-I-E B-A-D-A-Z-Z that's me 
Redbones, caramels, all of 'em stop and stare
All of 'em try and steal my underwear 
I like to floss like Rick Ross
Got a hit called Set It Off
When I sing it everybody set it off 
Black mink
Damn don't play with me
I bust ya dome eight whips on chrome
You can gon' 
Fresh fade fresh J's on the corner playing spades
I'm an ordinary person but I'm paid 
Foxx flipping Webbie smokin' and we choking on a whole pound of purple
Famous like the Ninja Turtles 
Just left New York City
Hooked up with P. Diddy
Finna blow past 50 you gon' have 
We the best I'm a fool
I'm the hemi man
Red light, green light, yellow light
Get it man
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
Hot drop, drop top, top drop
Hoes drop it like it's hot
Yeah nigga, I'm the shit 
You see this ice on my wrist
How it glis' soon as the light hit
You can't lie the ice sick 
Purple got me smelling funky
Red monkey 500 dollars on 'em
You ain't seen these yet 
Beating, you can hear me way around the corner
Paint wet with the 24's on 'em, that's a bet 
Ol' ladies, baby mommas, few fiances
Nigga's wife, savage life
Who I'm gonna fuck next 
And I use the Lifestyle or the Magnum
Or the Trojan or go head and use the barrel of the tech 
Man this chain hit me for a couple grand
Oh no, I ain't complaining
Just watch how you wipe my chest 
A bad bitch wanted me to stay lil' longer
I'd'a put that dick up on her
But I had a flight to catch 
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on 
'Cause I'm on
