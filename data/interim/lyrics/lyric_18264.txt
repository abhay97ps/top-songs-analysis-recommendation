If anybody had told me, that anybody'd have a hold on me
I'd say they were out of their mind
But speakin' of crazy, I'm findin' lately
All I want, all I need, all the time is
More of your sweet love, too much just ain't enough
I never needed a fix like this before
Too strong to resist, I don't know when to quit
Like a kid in a candy store, you keep me comin' back for more
I can't explain it, I'm more than infatuated
You got me good, I got it bad
There's no doubt about it, I can't live without it
What you got I just got to have, so give me
More of your sweet love, too much just ain't enough
I never needed a fix like this before
Too strong to resist, I don't know when to quit
Like a kid in a candy store, you keep me comin' back for more
Too strong to resist, I don't know when to quit
Like a kid in a candy store, you keep me comin' back for more
You keep me comin' back for more
You keep me comin' back for more, more, and more , and more
Comin' back for more, more
Keep me comin', give me some more
I'm comin' back for more
