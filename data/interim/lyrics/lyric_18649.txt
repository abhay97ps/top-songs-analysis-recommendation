This is my song for real, no doubt 
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor 
We begin to dance slow 
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty
Hey pretty mama, how you doing?
Said I'm just in town for the weekend
Looking for a little trouble to get into
Baby, tell me what you're drinking
And I got you, ooh
Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball 
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty 
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow 
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty
Now you're body's got me feeling like spending
With a back room I could come to live in
And your hair weave's looking kind of purty
The way you back it up on me baby
Lord have mercy
Playas wanna play 
Ballers wanna ball 
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow 
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty 
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's  making me feel thugged out 
As I walk you to the dance floor 
We begin to dance slow 
Put your arms around me 
I'm feeling on your booty
If it's your birthday
Then put your hands up
You wanna get drunk
Then put your hands up
And if you got some cash
Then put your hands up
Have your own job
Put your hands up
Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball 
Rollers wanna roll
Feels so good, say it again
Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out 
As I walk you to the dance floor 
We begin to dance slow 
Put your arms around me 
I'm feeling on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out 
As I walk you to the dance floor 
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor 
We begin to dance slow 
Put your arms around me 
I'm feeling on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out 
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me 
I'm feeling on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt 
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty
