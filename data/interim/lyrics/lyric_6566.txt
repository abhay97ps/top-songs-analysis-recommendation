Today's the day
You're telling him
That he's got to set you free
And that being
One man's woman
Brngs you down
But before
You throw away
What you think you don't want today
Don't give it up
Fopr the new life
That you've found
Run woman run, run back to him and fix things up the very best you can
Tell him you missed him while you were gone
Run woman un back to your man
You're a young girl
So understand
It's so hard to find a man
Who comes home every night
For only you
You may not find
True love again
So go home while you still can
And find a way to work it out
With your man
Run woman run, run back to him and fix things up the very best you can
Tell him you missed him while you were gone
Run woman un back to your man
Run woman un back to your man
