Open your heart and let me pour my lovin'
Inside of you, baby... 
You make me feel like livin' and breathin' again
I wanna touch you
Don't say no,  just say yes please 
Your body's what I need 
Don't say no, just say yes
I can hear you callin me
You're my diamond that shines all of the time
Oh mercy me, yeah, yeah
You made me reach my peak
That day you told me that you wanted me
Don't be afraid baby
Don't say no,  just say yes 
Your body's what I need
Don't say no,  just say yes
I can hear you callin me 
You are my season 
And you are the reason
I feel the way I do
As our bodies become as one 
You're my star
That's what you are 
Don't say no,  just say yes 
Your body's what I need 
Don't say no,   just say yes 
I can hear you callin me
Now let me hear you say yes 
Say, say, say yes
Say, say, say yes
Say, say, say yes
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Come here baby, lay down right here
I don't wanna talk no more
I can feel you, your body, all over mine
Ooh open your door for me
