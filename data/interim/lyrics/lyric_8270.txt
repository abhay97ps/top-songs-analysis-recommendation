I should be leavin', should be walkin' out the door
I should be goin' like a thousand times before
But somethin' holds me, and I come back just once more
Just like the ocean wave returnin' to the shore
"This must be love", is what she tells me
This must be love and there's nothin' I can do
I walk the city streets that echo with your name
And off into the night I hear a lonesome train
It's pulling boxcars full of happiness and pain
And at the station it's the same old guessing game
"This must be love", is what she tells me
This must be love and there's nothin' I can do
I should be leavin', should be walkin' out the door
I should be goin' like a thousand times before
"This must be love", is what she tells me
This must be love and there's nothin' I can do
This must be love, it's like a sickness or disease
This must be love and I'm falling to my knees
This must be love, oh yeah
This must be love, oh
"This must be love", is what she tells me
This must be love and there's nothin' I can do
