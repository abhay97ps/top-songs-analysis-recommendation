Ow!
Ho!

Baby, does he do it for you?
When he's finished, does he step back and adore you?
I just gotta know, 'cause your time is money
And I won't let him waste it, oh no-n 
Baby, just go with it
'Cause when you're with me, I can't explain it, it's just different
We can take it slow or act like you're my girl, let's skip the basics
Whoa-whoa, oh no
He's so replaceable
You're worth the chase you're putting on
It's alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine, I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable, a collectible
Just like fine china
Favorite, you're my favorite
It's like all the girls around me don't have faces
And the saying goes
Life is just a game but I'm not playing
Whoa-whoa, oh-oh
He's so replaceable 
You're worth the chase you're putting on
It's alright , I'm not dangerous
When you're mine , I'll be generous
 You're irreplaceable, a collectible 
Just like fine china
It's alright , I'm not dangerous 
When you're mine , I'll be generous
 You're irreplaceable,  A collectible 
 just like fine china
Took me a while  to find your love 
Ain't no amount of time in this world 
Save me a lot of time and just love me 
Feel it, baby, feel it in your soul
Are you ready? 
I know your heart been telling you, you belong to me 
A-na-na, no-whoa
It's alright , I'm not dangerous 
When you're mine , I'll be generous 
You're irreplaceable, a collectible
Just like fine china
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh

Uh
Oh, oh no
Yeah, yeah, yeah
