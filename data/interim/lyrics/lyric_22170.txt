Girl, my body don't lie 
I'm out of my mind
Let it rain over me 
I'm rising so high
Out of my mind 
So let it rain over me 
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Let it rain over me
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Let it rain over me
A billion is a new million
Voli's a new vodka
Forty's the new 30 
Baby, you're a rockstar 
Dale veterana, que tú sabe
Más de la cuenta, no te hagas
Teach me, baby, or better yet
Freak me, baby, yes, yes
I'm freaky, baby
I'ma make sure that your peach feels peachy, baby 
No bullshit broads, I like my women sexy, classy, sassy
Powerful yes , they love to get a little bit nasty, ow
This ain't a game you'll see 
You can put the blame on me 
Dale muñequita, abre ahí and let it rain over me 
Girl, my body don't lie
I'm out of my mind
Let it rain over me
I'm rising so high
Out of my mind
So let it rain over me
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Let it rain over me
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Let it rain over me
A billion is a new million
Voli's a new vodka
Latin is the new majority, ya tú sabe
Next step, la Casa Blanca
No hay carro, no vamo' en balsa 
Mami, you know the drill 
They won't know what I got 'til they read the will 
I ain't tryin', I ain't trying to keep it real 
I'm trying to keep wealthy and that's for real 
Pero mira que tú 'tás buena , y mira que tú 'tás dura 
Baby, no me hables más , y tíramelo mami chula 
No games you'll see 
You can put the blame on me 
Dale muñequita, abre ahí and let it rain over me 
Girl, my body don't lie
I'm out of my mind
Let it rain over me
I'm rising so high
Out of my mind
So let it rain over me
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Let it rain over me
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Let it rain over me
