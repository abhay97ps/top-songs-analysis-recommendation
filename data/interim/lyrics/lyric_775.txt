Well here in my heart there's a story untold
Of a girl I wanted for my own to have and to hold
So won't someone please tell me what I can do
To make a hit with you
Because I was afraid to tell you just how I feel
I promise to give you all my love and believe me it is real
I want you I need you
I'll do anything to please you
My every dream and every scheme
They all include you
When ever I walk and each time I talk
I find out that it's true
Well here in my heart there's a story untold
Of a girl I fell in love with back in days of old
And if having you takes the rest of my life
I won't be free 'til I have you here with me
My every dream and every scheme
They all include you
When ever I walk and each time I talk
I find out that it's true
Well here in my heart there's a story untold
Of a girl I fell in love with back in days of old
And if having you takes the rest of my life
I won't be free 'til I have you here with me
