Well, you can have her, I don't want her
She didn't love me anyway
She only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was love to stay
Well, you get stuck with the wrong woman
There's only one thing that you can do:
Just dig a hole and jump right in it
And pull the ground right over you
Well, you can have her 
I don't want her 
She didn't love me  anyway 
She only wanted  someone to play with 
But all I wanted  was love to stay 
The girl I love, she, up and left me
She ran away with my best friend
Comes home at night just for an hour
When day light comes she's gone again
Life without love is mighty empty
But confession's good for the soul
I'd rather have love that I can cling to
Than have the world and all of its gold
 you can have her
 I don't want her
 She didn't love me,  anyway
 she only wanted  someone to play with
 Ohh!  Ohh!
You can have her 
I don't want her 
She didn't love me  anyway 
She only wanted  someone to play with 
But all I want 
All I want 
All I want 
All I want ...
