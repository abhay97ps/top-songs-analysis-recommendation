Haha, yeah
Hi, I'm John Waters, and this is the Creep
When you’re out at a club and you see a fly girl
Do the Creep 
Do the Creep 
And if you wanna make friends at the ATM
Do the Creep 
And do the Creep 
Well, we got a new dance, so get up on your feet
It’s real easy to do and it’s called the Creep
Let your hands flop around, like a marionette
Pop your knees up and down, sh-sh-shakin’ your neck
Now pull your waistband up like you expecting a flood
And stick your hair down flat like it was covered in mud
Trim up your pencil mustache and pop them peepers
Put this in your speakers, you a certified creeper
When you see a country peach laying out at the beach
Do the Creep 
And do the Creep 
And when a fine PYT walks in front of your tree
Do the Creep 
And do the Creep 
I was six years old when I started creeping
My parents took it to their room and I started peeping
You can imagine their surprise when they lifted their heads
And saw my little ass creeping at the foot of the bed
And they knew I was a creep since the day I was born
Get popping out my momma like some kettle corn
And the doctor caught my head and he starting freaking
Cause I came out clean and I came out creeping
Nicki , Nicki 
Nicki, Nicki, Nicki, Nicki 
When I was a girl, I creeped in the boys' locker room
Hide deep inside, it was my little creep stalker room
As they disrobed, I was oogling and oggling
Little did they know that for me, they were modeling
And I would laugh: ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
And they would dance: la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
So pop your peepers and squeak out your sneakers
Don’t sleep, come on, get your creep on with me
Go on and get you sweating off the bride at her wedding
Do the Creep 
And do the Creep 
But when you sneak into a wake and you see a beefcake
Do the Creep 
And do the creep 
When the judge is a hottie and you can’t control your body
Do the Creep 
And do the Creep 
So get your knees flexin’ and your arms T-Rexin’
And creep, haha 
Do the Creep 
And don’t forget to smile
