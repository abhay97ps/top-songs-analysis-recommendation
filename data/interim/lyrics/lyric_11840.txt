Why you wanna try me, baby?
Why you wanna do me this way? 
Why you wanna try me, baby?
Why you wanna do me this way? 
So many nights, so many days, baby
I've been hurt by your love
I don't know why I still love you like I do, baby
But you're a star in my world
Oh, how you got me down and lonely
Ooh yeah, my heart is in your hands
I don't see why you won't let me
When you know I'll be your number one man, yeah
Why you wanna try me, baby
Why you wanna do me this way
Why you wanna try me, baby
Why you wanna do me this way
Ooh-ooh, oh
Tell me, yeah
Oh, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa
I wanna know just how you feel about me
I can't pretend anymore
My love for you just keeps on gettin' strong
Don't make me walk out the door
This can't go on forever
We've played this love game too long
I've tried my best to understand you
Please love me, girl, and don't do me wrong
Why you wanna try me, baby?
Why you wanna do me this way?
Why you wanna try me, baby?
Why you wanna do me...?
I'm the one you want
Just tell me where I am
Ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Tell me, tell me
Please don't go
Oh
Stop right there, hold on
Why you wanna try me? 
Stop right there, hold on
Why you wanna try me? 
Stop right there, hold on
Why you wanna try me?
Stop right there, hold on
Why you wanna try me? 
Stop right there, hold on
Why you wanna try me?
Stop right there, hold on
Why you wanna try me?
Stop right there, hold on
Why you wanna try me?
Stop right there, hold on
Why you wanna try me?
Stop right there, hold on
Why you wanna try me?
