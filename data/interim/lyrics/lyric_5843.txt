Hey you
You say you got a problem
If you don't mind
I'd like to help you solve them
Why don't you just let yourself go?
Kick off your shoes go walking on a beach now
Let yourself go
Doing little things that will make you feel good now
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
It's not unusual 
Everyone has felt blue at times
Not knowing what to do at times
You got to break away 
Oh, break away
Let yourself go
Drop what you're doing, go out and get to moving
Let yourself go
Doing something new that will make you feel groovy
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Not knowing what to do at times
You gotta break away
Break away
You've got to break away
You've got to
Let yourself go
Drop what you're doing, go out and get to moving
Let yourself go
Doing something new that will make you feel groovy
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
