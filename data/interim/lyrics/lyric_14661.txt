One, two, one, two, three, four
*Whistling*
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you, I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure, but you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now
Said, woman, take it slow and it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said, sugar, make it slow and we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience
Patience, mm yeah...
I sit here on the stairs 'cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense, but I can't speed up the time
But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider
Said, woman, take it slow and things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said, sugar, take the time 'cause the lights are shinin' bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it
We won't fake it, aw, I'll never break it, 'cause I can't take it
I've been walkin' the streets at night 
Just tryin' to get it right 
It's hard to see with so many around 
You know I don't like bein' stuck in the crowd 
An' the streets don't change, but maybe the names 
I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you 
Yeah-yeah, but I need you 
Ooh, I need you 
Oh, I need you 
Ooh, this time
