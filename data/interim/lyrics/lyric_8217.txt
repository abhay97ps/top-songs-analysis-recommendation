Feeling small, makes me want to tell you all about
How I feel for you girl
And how your very name excites me
Feeling strong, makes me want to come on to you
In a very special way
That no words on earth could ever say
But could you ever love me again
If I let you down, disappointed you
Could you ever love me again
If I cease to do little things for you
Could you ever love me again
Somewhere, some how, some when
If I let you down, girl
Could you ever love me again
You & I, never had to try very hard
To understand the other one
And how at times we both were feeling
Ah but, now and then, especially when we're apart
I think about the days to come
And will I alway stay in your heart
But could you ever love me again
If I let you down, disappointed you
Could you ever love me again
If I cease to do little things for you
Could you ever love me again
Somewhere, some how, some when
If I let you down, girl
Could you ever love me again
If I let you down, girl
Could you ever love me again
