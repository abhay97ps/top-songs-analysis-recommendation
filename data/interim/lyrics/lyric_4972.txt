If you ever leave me
Don't worry at all
If you ever leave me
Just smile when I fall
The world will still keep turning
Without you life goes on
And Spring will be returning
Each year though you're gone
If you ever leave me
I won't show the tears
If you ever leave me
I'll hide all my fears
And even though I try
And still pretend that I
Don't need your warmth
Don't need your touch
Don't want your love
So very much
I know, if you ever leave me
I need your warmth
I need your touch
I want your love
So very much
If you ever leave me
I'll die
