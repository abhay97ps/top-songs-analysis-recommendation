That limousine
In which you made the scene
Suits you to a 't'
If all that you want to be
Is somebody that don't never walk nothin'
That big château
Where you wanna go
In the south of France
Going to end our big romance
Don't you do it
Honey, don't leave L.A
That Riviera is so far away
Begging you s'il vous plait
They don't know nothing down in St. Tropez
That I say baby don't you leave L.A
I heard it said
That you had it made
With your movie star
But, oh how right you are
If that's really 'bout the best you can, do bitch, come on
You moved my soul
So I played the role
Of your back door man
Yes and now I can't really complain
'Cause I love you
Honey, don't leave L.A
That Riviera is so far away
Begging you s'il vous plait, begging baby
They don't know nothing down in St. Tropez, très Beauvais
Baby don't leave L.A
No, no, no, no, no
Mama, don't you drop out of sight on me, now, no
That Riviera so far away
Begging you s'il vous plait
C'est vrai, baby
They don't know nothing down in St. Tropez
But I mean
Mama, don't you leave
Baby, don't you leave L.A., no
