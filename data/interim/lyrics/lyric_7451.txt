I didn't mean to make you mad
Tears me up to see you sad
I know it's true
I don't know what to do
Don't see how I can go through life without you
You're always fine and tryna please
Not what you want but what you need
I'm gonna give it to you
My heart and I on bended knees
Cryin': "Baby, baby please come on home to me"
Baby, baby
Bring it home
Give it to me
Hurry up
Lay it on me, lay it on me, yeah 
Runnin' blind throughout the world
'Cause I've lost the sweetest man I've ever seen
Oh, yeah
Bring it home
Give it to me
Hurry up
Lay it on me, lay it on me 
I die inside each time you decide to leave
When you're gone you know it grieves me
Like it's doing now
If you think I'm havin' fun
Playin' around with anyone
I know you're wrong
You just made a big mistake
My hearts about to break
Since you been gone
If you only knew how much I miss you
How I long to hold and kiss you
You'd come on home
You never, never put me down
Stay out on the town
Like you're doing right now
Baby
Bring it home
Give it to me
Hurry up
Lay it on me, ooh, lay it on me 
Runnin' blind throughout the world
I've lost the sweetest man I've ever seen
Oh, baby
Bring it home
Give it to me
Hurry up
Lay it on me, lay it on me 
I die inside each time you leave
When you're gone you know it grieves me, it grieves me
Oh, baby, baby
Bring it home
Give it to me
Hurry up
Oh, why don't you lay it on me
