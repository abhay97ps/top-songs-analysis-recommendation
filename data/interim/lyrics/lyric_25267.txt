Papamitrou Boi
Spanish bitch from uptown
I bought her a bust down
Yeah, oh
Ven aquí, dame chocha to my Spanish loca
In the kitchen, whippin' that dope up, you can smell the odor
Prob gon' pitch it, we gon' hit it like we Sammy Sosa 
Put that Bentley to the limit, you can smell the odor
Ho, Spanish bitches call me "Chulo"
When I'm pullin' up in that two door
Diamonds different color, UNO
All these hunnids on me, mami
Man, my pockets look like sumo
I got money out the ass, I finger pop you in your culo
When I hit you with that, you know 
You know, smoke a little hookah 
Kick it like it's Judo 
Let you hit the OG 
Sip some 42 though 
And when we get in mood, I'ma dog it like I'm Cujo, whoa
Heard they tryna steal the wave, cut it out, cut it out
Spicy mamis on the way, bust it down, bust it down
Saw my watch, she love the way I flood it out, ayy
Talk to me nice, show you what these Bentleys 'bout, whoa
Pipe down, throwin' up shots
First we shut them down, then we open up shop
Realest nigga around just in case y'all forgot
They've been tryna stop the wave, but the wave don't stop
Uptown, nigga
I was down, but they see I'm up now, nigga
Head high 'cause I'm holdin' up my crown, nigga
Never told even through the ups and downs, nigga
And if I D'usse, it's a cup of brown, nigga
Only way I double cross is
I just keep spinning, only way to make 'em nauseous
Dímelo, mami, like salsa, we could dip
I'm just tryna see you dance, salsa on the dick, whoa
It went down, she came up, you know
Y'all take shots, y'all aim up, you know
Hate on low, but we fly high, you know
Talk is cheap, free Wi-Fi, whoa
Heard they tryna steal the wave, cut it out, cut it out
Spicy mamis on the way, bust it down, bust it down
Saw my watch, she love the way I flood it out, ayy
Talk to me nice, show you what these Bentleys 'bout, whoa
Pipe down, throwin' up shots 
First we shut them down, then we open up shop 
Realest nigga around just in case y'all forgot 
They've been tryna stop the wave but the wave don't stop 
Vo' a estar al volante  y al la'o está el cantante 
El que tiene guerra con los narcotraficantes 
Hijo 'e puta, tengo cuatro rutas 
Y lo' vendo a treinta y dos como Karl Malone en Utah 
Louboutin, Dolce y Versace 
Vo' a morirme millonario, los Illuminati 
La Glock y las puta' en el bote 
Y las nalga' como Jennifer López, brrr 
Y ella rebota ese culote
Y yo le mamo ese totito pa' que no me bote 
Yo tengo diez dracotes 
Y tenemos trece R  y mil soldados pa' to' estos bichotes 
Brrr
Heard they tryna steal the wave, cut it out, cut it out
