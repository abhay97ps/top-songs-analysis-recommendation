Life is like a mighty river
Rolling on and on forever
Growing as we go along
Channels deepen, minds become strong
Roll along, muddy river, roll
Your dirty water cannot taint your soul
Roll along, roll along, till you are free
In the peaceful sea
Yeah, yeah, now – all right!
When life has its uncertainty
There’s a place I like to be
Waiting for the sun at dawn
Listening to the river song
Roll along, muddy river, roll
Your dirty water cannot taint your soul
Roll along, roll along, till you are free
In the peaceful sea
Roll along, muddy river, roll
Your dirty water cannot taint your soul
Roll along, roll along, till you are free, free
Roll along, muddy river, roll
Your dirty water cannot taint your soul
Roll along, roll along, till you are free, free
Yeah, now
Roll along, roll along, till you are free
