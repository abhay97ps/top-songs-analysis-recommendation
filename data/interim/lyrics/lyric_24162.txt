Turn away if you could get me a drink
Of water 'cause my lips are chapped and faded
Call my aunt Marie, help her gather all my things
And bury me in all my favorite colors
My sisters and my brothers, still, I will not kiss you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
I will not kiss you  
Lips are chapped and faded, call my  
Lips are chapped and faded 
Kiss you  
Lips are chapped and faded, call my  
Lips are chapped and faded 
Turn away 'cause I'm awful just to see
And all my hairs abandoned all my body
All my agony know that I will never marry
Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo
I'm counting down the days to go, this just ain't livin'
And I just hope you know
I will not kiss you  
Lips are chapped and faded, call my  
Lips are chapped and faded 
Kiss you  
Lips are chapped and faded, call my  
Lips are chapped and faded 
If you say 
Goodbye today 
I'll ask you to be true 
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
Yes, the hardest part of this...
I will not kiss you 
Lips are chapped and faded
Call my 
Lips are chapped and faded 
Kiss you 
Lips are chapped and faded
Call my 
Lips are chapped and faded
