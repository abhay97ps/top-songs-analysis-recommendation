You say that you pimping you lying
You take it a time on the bitch
Niggas is wishing they wasn’t this section
It wasn’t my decision
Or else I would let them in
Boy I got stress like a Letterman
Got devilish ways but I’m having sin

If ever you fuck with my Benjamins
Them is my bitches so let them in
Or I’ll show up late night like Letterman
I’ll be shining and blinding pedestrians
It’s a show like a nigga a thespian
And kick the door on promoters
If you don’t let me in
I’m gonna show up with dope
And two lesbians
Set a car in a sport like ESPN
Hang you sloppy like joe
ON some sandwich bread
If a problem persists
I just handle it
Looking for me I’m on ground
Where my handle is
