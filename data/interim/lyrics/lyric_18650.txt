Well I was rolling wheels and shifting gears
Around that Jersey Turnpike
Barney stopped me with his gun
Ten minutes after midnight
Said, "Sir you broke the limit
In thit rusty old truck"
I don't know about that accent son
Just where did you come from
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from
Trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Well I was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
The sign said finger-lickin'
Well I paid the tab
And the lady asked me
How'd I like my biscuit
I'll be honest with you ma'am
It ain't like mama fixed it
Cause where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from
Trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
I was chasing sun on 101
Somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint
And I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
Said no thanks ma'am
Back home We like the girls
That sing soprano
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Well I was headed home on 65
Somewhere around Kentucky
The CB rang for the bobtail rig
That's rolling on like thunder
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
No, but you might have seen me there
I just dropped a load of salsa
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Where I come from it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of back porch picking
Where I come from trying to make a living
Working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Yeah where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Staring up at heaven
Where I come from
Where I come from
Trying to make a living
Trying to make a living
Oh, where I come from
Where I come from
Yeah where I come from
Get back down there sometimes
Where I come from
