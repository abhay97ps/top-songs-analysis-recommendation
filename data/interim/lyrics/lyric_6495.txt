First time I got tuned on your love, I was six
I felt you on every song, I wrote it a remix
There was something about you that was so sincere
You were so gentle in your ways, I had to keep you 
I remember momma sending me out to go play
On the radio I'd hear something about the O' Jays
Couldn't help but listen to every way that they sang
I wanna stay away to have fun and make my day
Even though I was a child
I understood the feeling that came over me
I understood that you and I were meant to be
Even though I was a child
I understood my purpose and kids accusing me
Get a love affair you'll see
Something that you can't control
You are the only love I got
Get a love affair you'll see
Something that you can't control
You are the only love I got
Girl, and then I turned sixteen
Didn't know another thing that hit you like me
I'd listen to the radio till the clock struck three
Dj please play me Mr. Dollar 
Look at, look at what yo did to me
Look what you did, you put that soul in me
Came to mind I was a soul sister
Felt so good I so glad to meet ya
Jill Scott, my inspiration
Her soul became my motivation
'Cause you are my life
And if I have to choose I'd choose you again
Get a love affair you'll see
Something that you can't control
You are the only love I got
Get a love affair you'll see
Something that you can't control
You are the only love I got

Uh, ey, how so damn interesting
This is the best thing since Smif N Wessun
May 1995, Dah Shinin'
But she didn't get the reference
But that's the lesson towards collide hard and 
I know a verse for every vibe we share, boo
Like John 15 chapter 12, the Bible tells you
Love each other as I have loved you
Got me thinking back to all this fire between us
Tell me that we are mad too
I wanna speak so highly of you
And thank you for your love 'cause it got me through
You pull me together, always and forever
I would not know what to do without you
I'm so grateful for you
Get a love affair you'll see
Something that you can't control
You are the only love I got
Get a love affair you'll see
Something that you can't control
You are the only love I got
Get a love affair you'll see
Something that you can't control
You are the only love I got
