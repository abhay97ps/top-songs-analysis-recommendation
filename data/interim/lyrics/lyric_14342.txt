I must be out of my head
Or just plain crazy for you
'Cause I've been turnin' my back
At all the things you do
I want a feelin' that lasts much longer
Nothin' is bound to change
It's never the same for you
Well, I can't take it no more
'Cause you spell Trouble
Trouble
I try to please you
But I'm wastin' my time
You're nothin' but Trouble
Trouble
Trouble, baby
You're always on the attack
You know, you're too in love with yourself
So now I'm giving it back
Your time is overdue
Don't wanna be just a fascination
I need to feel secure
It's never the same for you
Well, I can't take it no more
'Cause you spell Trouble
Trouble
I try to please you
But I'm wastin' my time
You're nothin' but Trouble
Trouble
Trouble, baby
'Cause you spell Trouble
Trouble
I try to please you
But I'm wastin' my time
You're nothin' but Trouble
Trouble
Trouble, baby
A-ha that's right you're Trouble
So get out
You're nothin' but Trouble
You're nothin' but trouble- Yeah
Oh, Trouble
Oh, baby
Trouble baby
Trouble
Say Yeah, Yeah
Trouble
