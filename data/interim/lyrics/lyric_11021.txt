When somebody
Reaches for your heart
Open up and let them through
'Cause everybody
Needs someone around
Things could tumble down on you
You'll discover
When you look around
You don't have to be alone
Just one lover
Is all you need to know
When you're feeling all alone
You might need somebody
You might need somebody too
You might need somebody
You might need somebody too
If there's fire
Stirring in your heart
And you're sure it's strong and bright
Keep it burning
Through the cold and dark
'cause it can wander along the night
You might need somebody
You might need somebody too
You might need somebody
You might need somebody too
You might need somebody
You might need somebody too
You might need somebody
You might need somebody too
You might need somebody
You might need somebody too
You might need somebody
You might need somebody too
