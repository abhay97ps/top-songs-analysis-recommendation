Way back once upon a time
All our clouds were number nine
Every day was heaven sent
Wonder where the magic went
Angel, angel
What is happening
What in the world's come over us
What in the world's come over us
What have we done
What has come over us
How'd we get so out of touch
How did we fall apart this much
Why does everything seem wrong
Tell me where the thrill has gone
Angel, angel
What is happening
What in the world's come over us
What in the world's come over us
What have we done
What has come over us
Yeah, yeah
