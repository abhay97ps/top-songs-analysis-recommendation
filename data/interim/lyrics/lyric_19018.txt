Girl, I know he ain't takin' care of you
I see it in your face
And I know that's not the man that you really want
You know
So if you're seeming tired of him
Then come see me
I'm a better man anyway
Lies, and decit
I know, you feel this with your man
'Cause when there, all I see
Is crying
I should be your boyfriend 
'Cause you know he's lying 
It might seems like I'm hating 
But girl, I'm just relating
Step one, walk through that door
Step two, tell him
He's not like he was before
You don't love him anymore
Now three, come to me
Step four, I'll love you more
You will see how love should be
But there's four steps to complete
There was a time
When he tried to be the one who would
Give you all you deserved
But now he's not trying
I should be your boyfriend 
'Cause you know he's lying 
It might seems like I'm hating 
Step one, walk through that door
Step two, tell him
He's not like he was before 
You don't love him anymore
Now three, come to me
Step four, I'll love you more
You will see how love should be
But there's four steps to complete
You're what I’m looking for
Our love would mean much more
Than what he’s given you
But you must let him know that you can’t take no more
Replace him with me
To someone who deserves them 
If you can’t figure out
Got it all mapped out
Baby, just take step one
Step one, walk through that door
Step two, tell him
He's not like he was before
You don't love him anymore
Now three, come to me
Step four, I'll love you more
You will see how love should be
But there's four steps to complete
Step one, walk through that door
Step two, tell him
He's not like he was before
You don't love him anymore
Now three, come to me
Step four, I'll love you more
You will see how love should be
But there's four steps to complete
