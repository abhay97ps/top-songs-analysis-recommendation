David was dancin'
With Charley standing in line, in the wings
And yesterday's rain turns to snow
Shake your head now, honey child
Shake your head now, honey child
Jump back while I clean 'em up
Shake your head now, honey child
Spotlights are blinding
Like stars shooting down on the man
Who fell to earth
Spiraling up to the sky
Shake your head now, honey child
Shake your head now, honey child
Jump back while I clean 'em up
Shake your head now, honey child
Shake that head, shake that head
Shake my head, shake my head
Clean up the line, clean up the line
Clean up the line, clean up the line
Funk it up, funk it up
Funk it up, funk it up
Bring out the back
Light up the front
Shake your head now, honey child
Shake your head now, honey child
Jump back while I clean 'em up
Shake your head now, honey child
