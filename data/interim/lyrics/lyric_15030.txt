Take me only for what I am
You've got a right to speak your mind
You've gotta take a stand
No one has the right to say
This is right or that is wrong
It isn't just one way
Find common ground
Go in between
Things aren't always what they seem
Someday it'll be alright
Changes happen overnight
People, let's give each other room
If we're gonna work it out
We better make it soon
Love is, love is such a common word
When it's pride we mistake for love
Isn't that absurd
Why always take the upper hand
It's better to understand
Someday it'll be alright
Changes happen overnight
I believe in love but with no conditions
Oye mi canto
And giving in sometimes doesn't make it submission
Oye mi canto
Hate is so common It's almost tradition
Oye mi canto
Come on let's leave it behind and make that transition
Oye mi canto
Oye mi canto, oye mi canto
Oye mi canto, oye mi canto
Oye, oye, oye mi canto
Oye mi canto
Óyelo, óyelo
Oye mi canto
Que me tiene que oír, oye este canto
Oye mi canto
Óyelo, oye mi canto
Oye mi canto
Oye mi canto
Oye mi canción es del corazón
Oye mi canto
Oye mi canto
Oye, oye mi canto
Oye mi canto
Oye mi canto
