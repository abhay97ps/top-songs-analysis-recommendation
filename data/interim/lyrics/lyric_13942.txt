I'm just a shy girl, shy girl
I'm just a shy girl, shy girl
Don't wanna let you drive me out of my senses
I'm just a little girl, can't you see?
And now you've broken down all my defenses
I'm gonna love you to the tenth degree, hey
I'm just a little girl in the dark
The things you say tear me apart
You know you get your way with my heart
Turn out the light baby, you know why
I told you twice I'm much too shy
Take it slow, what I'm trying to say
Baby, baby, take me all the way
I'm just a little girl in the dark
The things you say tear me apart
You know you get your way with my heart
I'm just a shy girl, shy girl
I'm just a shy girl, shy girl
Tell me over and over
Tell me over and over
I didn't know there were boys like you
Tell me you love me and I'll tell you why
A girl like me is just so shy, hey
I'm just a little girl in the dark
The things you say tear me apart
You know you get your way with my heart
I'm just a little girl in the dark
The things you say tear me apart
You know you get your way with my heart
I'm just a shy girl, shy girl
I'm just a shy girl, shy girl
