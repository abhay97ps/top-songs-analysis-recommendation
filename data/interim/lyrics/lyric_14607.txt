Know you are a friend of mine, babe you been gone
An awful long time. You might remember me, I tried
To set your soul free
Glad that you got it made, when did you finalize your last trade?
You are the only one I've ever seen do what you done
Anything that you done done, you are the only one
Don't put me under your gun
I'm gonna be missing you, even though I understand that you're not through
Go on take it day by day, seems like I lost you anyway
Glad that you got it made, when did you finalize your last trade?
You are the only one I've ever seen do what you done
Done
Anything that you done done, you are the only one
Don't put me under your gun
When you came to save the world I caused your
Dreams to fade
I couldn't do what you did and rained on your parade
Glad that you got it made
Glad that you got it made
Hard set of changes, for anyone that I know
You're gonna make it, make it, make it better for you
And me and anyone else you know
Just don't forget me, I'll be there when you're done
And in the meantime, meantime, you'll get to know
Yourself
So don't judge anyone else, anyone
It doesn't matter I don't mind, I'm sure that you'll
Remember sometime, even if you never do
All you need to worry 'bout now is you
Glad that you got it made, when did you finalize your
Last trade?
You are the only one I've ever seen do what you done
Done
Anything that you done done, you are the only one
Don't put me under your gun
Glad that you got it made
