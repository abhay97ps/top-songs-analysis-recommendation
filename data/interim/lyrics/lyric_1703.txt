Re-mem-mem, re-mem-mem-mem-ber oop-shoop
Re-mem-mem, re-mem-mem-mem-ber oop-shoop
Re-mem-mem, re-mem-mem-mem-ber oop-shoop then
Then , remember then
That night we fell in love
Beneath the stars above
That was a lovely summer night
Pyramid Remember then, then, then, then, then
Summer's over
Our love is over
To lose that love was such a sin
Pyramid Remember then, then, then, then, then
 Remember, re-mem-mem, mem-mem-mem-mem-ber
 Our love is in the past
 patta-past
 Oh, has it gone so fast
 patta-past
 Why couldn't our love last?
 Can't last
 Wop, wop, patta patta pop-pop, shoo-wop-dah bop bop, ooh
I'm broken-hearted now
Since we have parted now
My mind wanders now and then
Pyramid Remember then, then, then, then, then
 Re-mem-mem, re-mem-mem-mem-ber
