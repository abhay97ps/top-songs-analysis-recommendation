Ahem
Yeah
I was staring at the sky
Singin' toxic lullabies
I was starin' at the sky
Screaming words with no remorse
Pitchforks pointed at my heart
I was staring at the sky
We're gonna break
We're gonna break
We're gonna break
We're gonna break
I was staring at the sky
Singin' toxic lullabies
I was starin' at the sky
