I'll take another wedding in stride
Here's another June wedding
I'm sitting on the bride's side again
Why do they always have to play that song?
You know the one
It's funny
But we never get to sing along
Her daddy's got her by one arm
I used to have her by the other
At least until she found another lover
And then another
Why not me?
We had a real love
She just didn't think we could put it all together
Why not me?
We had a real love
But in a flash, shes gone forever
Well, I think were all here
I see Bill and Charlie
No, wait
Eddie got smart
He had a golf game and he just had to go to it
Why do they always have to ask that question?
You know the one
Should I speak now or forever hold my peace of mind?
Why not me?
We had a real love
She just didn't think we could put it all together
Why not me?
We had a real love
But in a flash
She's gone forever, gone forever
And the ceremony is grand
But old lovers never get to make a last stand
And I held some rice in my hand
I let it fall to the floor
I just dont care anymore
I'll just get drunk at the reception
I won't think about her twice
I'll just say congratulations
You both look real nice, real nice
Why not me?
We had a real love
She just didn't think we could put it all together
