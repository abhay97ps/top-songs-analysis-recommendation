This one of the ones you gotta record when like
Ain't like nobody in here, haha
Man, this sappy ass shit, ayy, ayy
We used to laugh and smile and carry on like love could pay the rent or somethin'
Knowin' we was broke, ayy
Used to say that these feelings were unconditional like we knew what it meant or somethin'
Like 16, 17, or somethin', well
Ain't no way you can love me just the way I am, I must gotta get rid of somethin'
Must gotta, must gotta
Ain't no way I could love you just the way you is, you must gotta get rid of somethin'
Huh, psych, you're just right, ayy, uh
In first grade, we would laugh and smile
In second grade, we just smiled and laughed
In third grade, I swore I was a little emotional
And nigga, I got that from my dad
Then in fourth grade, I got my heart broken
Shit, I thought I was Usher from "U Got It Bad"
Then in fifth grade, that's when my folks divorced
And I had to transfer schools and put you in the past
I'm in middle school, act like I'm grown now
I'm in love with, uh, and I'm tryna smash
Now she ain't with it but I'm so persistent
I was immature and so it didn't last
Then in ninth and tenth I really witnessed love
And she wanted forever but I couldn't imagine
Anything past a day so that love passed away
But we were young so we got over it fast
Now the rest of high school was like a blur
And the same for college up 'til you arrived
I was hella stressed 'cause from the minute we met
It felt like I loved you like a thousand times
And I couldn't explain it, I knew it was dangerous
But I couldn't tame it and I wouldn't change shit
Weathered every storm, didn't run when the rain hit
And you was fuckin' with me way before I was famous, for real, but...
You make me feel like I, I belong
I mean you make me feel like I might be on
I mean you make me feel like I should right my wrong
Make me feel like a Ja Rule and Ashanti song
I mean you make me feel like, "Ah," and I love it
My feet off the ground, I'm high all the sudden
And you make me feel like singin' out in public
And girl I can't sing for shit but motherfuck it, for real
What it mean, what it mean, what it mean, what it mean
(With your old Usher Raymond soundin' ass, goddamn
You wakin' up my baby)
What it mean, what it mean, what it mean
Used to say that these feelings were unconditional like we knew what it meant or somethin'
Uh, I learned to let you go
I learned that I gotta let you go
(This for all the niggas that goddamn, broke up with they bitch
Over some shit on Valentine's Day)
I learned to let you go
I learned that I gotta let you go
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I learned to let you go
I learned that I gotta let you go
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
But I love these hoes, man, fuck that bitch
I love these hoes, man, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch
Ooh, baby, it's all for the better
Don't worry 'bout it, I'll be straight, it's whatever
Maybe it's really no such thing as forever
Whoever said lovin' was dead would seem right in my cerebellum
Readin' my mind, tryna keep it together
A part of me is like, "Look, face it," you left your mark but I erased it
Can't waste time thinkin' 'bout all the time wasted
Shawty left a king for a joker, she two-faced it
Know she gettin' ready to trip like suitcases
When I pull up in somethin' spacious
I'm a star, it's a spaceship
I gotta stunt, you know how far I'ma take it
Your nigga muggin', tell him fix the way he look, get Lasik
'Cause if a nigga try and test, I'ma ace it
The other half like, "Boy, that's all ego, we know
You be checkin' on shawty more than the PO"
That pussy C4
And plus that shit I did was foul, she deserve a free throw
I'm still a canine at heart, that's word to Nat Geo
I had to learn to let her G-O and all that
Your cover season comin' back around, but it's cool, I'ma fall back
And focus on makin' waves instead
Even though what we had is dead
Know you still be on my head like a skull cap, ayy
Wait a minute
Hold up, just wait a minute
Guess who hit me tryna pay a visit? On the way and shit
Say she got a lot to say, I'm trippin', actin' crazy
Slippin' on some clothes and hear a ring
I'm sippin', open up the door
Standin' there in lingerie from Vicky, strips, go hit the floor
That pussy fat, that ain't no baby, gettin' by from head to toe
Stabbed twice, you need a Grady visit, goin' brazy
Put it on her fade, lil shawty baby sittin', brought some jeans
They ain't got no story, just a data limit, can't feel them no more
So she just lay back down and stay minute, this feel like before
Back when everything was good but good ain't never stayed too long
New song, new day, time to turn the page for real
I learned to let you go
I learned that I gotta let you go
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
