Hey girl, it's me, I just called to tell you hi
Call me when you get this
Haven't talked lately so hard to find the time
Give the boys a big kiss
Tell them that I miss them
By the way, I miss you too
I was thinking just today
About how we used to play
Barbie dolls and make-up
Tea parties, dress up
I remember how we'd fight
We'd make up and laugh all night
Wish we were kids again
My sister, my friend
Oh yeah, before I forget I met someone
I think I really like him
I was wondering if I'm jumping the gun
By going out on a limb
And invite him home for Christmas
To meet the family
Seems like just yesterday
You brought home - oh, what's his name?
He had been drinking
What were you thinking?
After dinner he passed out
We can laugh about it now
'Cause we've learned a lot since then
My sister, my friend
Do you think you could come and see me sometime soon?
We could just hang out like we used to
It's late and I should go
But I can't hang up the phone
Until I tell you
What I don't tell you enough
Even though at times it seemed
We were more like enemies
I'd do it all again
My sister, my friend
