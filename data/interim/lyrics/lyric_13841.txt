It's morning
And we slept the night away
It happened
Now we can't turn back
The hands of time
Yes, we've stolen this moment
We forgot to face one simple fact
We both belong to someone else
As we slept the night away
It's morning
Sunlight shines across your sleeping face
A new day brings reality that
We must go our separate ways
What a lovely night we had 
As we shared each other's love
We forgot about all the pain we'd cause
As we slept the night away
As we lay
We forgot about tomorrow
As we lay 
As we lay
We didn't think about the price we'd have to pay
It's morning
And now it's time for us to say goodbye
Goodbye, baby
You're leaving me
I know you got to hurry home to face your wife 
I would never want to hurt her, no
She would never understand
You belonged to me for just one night
As we slept the night away
I would never, never want to hurt her, no no
She'd never understand
You belonged to me for just one night
As we slept the night away
As we lay
We forgot about tomorrow
As we lay 
As we lay
We didn't think about the price we'd have to pay
We should have counted up the cost
But instead we got lost
In the second
In the minute
In the hour
Hey hey, hey, as we lay
We forgot about tomorrow
As we lay
It's morning
It's morning
It's morning
It's morning
It's morning
