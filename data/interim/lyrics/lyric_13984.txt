O eh, o eh
O eh, oo, aah
O eh, o, eh
O eh, oo, aah
Yah, yeah, goh
At night
When you turn off all the lights
There's no place that you can hide
Oh no
The rhythm is gonna get'cha
In bed
Throw the covers on your head
You pretend like you are dead
But I know it
The rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get you
The rhythm is gonna get you tonight
No way
You can fight it every day
But no matter what you say
You know it
The rhythm is gonna get'cha
No clue
Of what's happening to you
And before this night is through
Ooh, baby
The rhythm is gonna get'cha
O eh, o eh
O eh, oo aah
O eh, o eh
O eh, oo aah
Yah, yeah, goh
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get you
The rhythm is gonna get you tonight
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get you
The rhythm is gonna get you
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
The rhythm is gonna get you
Rhythm is gonna get'cha 
Rhythm is gonna get'cha 
The rhythm is gonna get you tonight!
