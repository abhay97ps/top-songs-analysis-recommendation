What I want, you've got
And it might be hard to handle
But like a flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame
Yeah, yeah, what I've got, full stock
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
If you pull them all together
And a-how, I can't explain
Oh yeah, well, well you 
You make a-my dreams come true
 You 
Well, well, well you 
Oh yeah, a-you make a-my dreams come true
Well yeah
On a night when bad
Dreams become a screamer
When they're messing with the dreamer
I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cause a-I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same
Oh yeah, well, 'cause you 
Mmm hmm, you make a-my dreams come true
Whoa yeah, well, well, well you 
Woo woo, you make a-my dreams come true
Oh yeah
Well, listen to this
Ow
I'm down on my daydream
Oh, that sleepwalk should be over by now, I know
Ah you
Yeah a-yeah, you make a-my dreams come true
Oh yeah, I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl
Oh yeah, you make a-my dreams come true
Me, you, me, you, me
I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl
Oh my, you make a-my dreams come true
 Oh 
Whoa ooh whoa, I've been waiting for, waiting for, waiting for
Waiting for, waiting for, waiting for, waiting
You make my dreams
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I've been waiting for you, girl
You make my dreams
