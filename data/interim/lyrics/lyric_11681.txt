We went together for so long
Ev'ry second record on the radio seemed like our song
How we hurt each other; oh baby it was so wrong
Something in the bottom of my heart will keep me holding on
'cause you saved my soul
You came along and took me out of the night time
Yeah you saved my soul
Taught me to fly...and I gave my heart
And babe that's something that there's just no returning
'cause if I have you now I'll never have to make it alone
We were lovers for so long
Every second record on the radio seemed like our song
Even though we're older, things we're feeling can't be all wrong
Something in the bottom of my heart will keep me holding on
'cause you....
..............I'll never have to make it alone
Saved my soul; saved my soul
Saved my soul; saved my soul
You saved my soul.......
...............never have to make it alone
Yes if I have you now I'll never have to make it alone
Yes if I have you now I'll never have to make it alone
