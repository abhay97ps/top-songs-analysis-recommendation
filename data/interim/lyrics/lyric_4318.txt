Girl you know just how to please me. 
Don't you do it if you think you got to. 
Don't you do it cause you think you ought to. 
Ooh, do it in the name of love
If you really want me that's reason enough
Do it in the name of love. 
Do it in the name of love
Baby, ain't it good to go together? 
I swear it feels just like forever. 
Hmmm don't be scared and don't you worry, no

Ooh, do it in the name of love
If you really want me that's reason enough
Do it in the name of love. 
Do it in the name of love
Do it in the name of love
If you really want me that's reason enough
Do it in the name of love.
