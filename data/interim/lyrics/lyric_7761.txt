Jesus was a Capricorn, he ate organic foods
He believed in love and peace and never wore no shoes
Long hair, beard and sandles and a funky bunch of friends
Reckon they'd just nail him up, if he come down again
'Cause everybody's gotta have somebody to look down on
Prove they can feel better than at any time they please
Someone doin' somethin' dirty decent folks can frown on
If you can't find nobody else, then help yourself to me
Eggheads cussin', rednecks cussin' hippies for their hair
Others laugh at straights who laugh at freaks who laugh at squares
Some folks hate the Whites who hate the Blacks who hate the Klan
Most of us hate anything we don't understand
'Cause everybody's gotta have somebody to look down on
Prove they can feel better than at any time they please
Someone doin' somethin' dirty decent folks can frown on
If you can't find nobody else, then help yourself to me
Help yourself right on
Help yourself, Jim
Help yourself, Reverend
