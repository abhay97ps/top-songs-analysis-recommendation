Pick out your beret
Your  baby's been out

People dying on the ground
You gotta keep on keeping on
No  matter how hard it is
You  gotta keep on keeping on
No matter how rough it gets

Not matter how hard it is
You gotta keep on keeping on
No matter how rough it gets

When the going gets kinda rough yeah

Don't let it get you down
I say now get on up and smile a while
You gotta keep on keeping on
You gotta keep on keeping on
You gotta keep on keeping on
Keep on baby

Hold your head up high
You gotta keep on keeping on
You gotta keep on keeping on
No matter how hard it is
You gotta keep on keeping on
No matter how rough it is
You gotta keep on keep on keep on
You gotta keep on keep on keep on
