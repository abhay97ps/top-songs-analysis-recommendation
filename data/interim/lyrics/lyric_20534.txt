We don’t have time left to regret 
It will take more than common sense 
So stop your wondering, take a stand 
There's more to life than just to live 
'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
One single smile, a helping hand 
It's not that hard to be a friend 
So don’t give up, stand till the end 
There's more to life than just to live 
'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don’t give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
When it falls apart
And you're feeling lost
All your hope is gone
Don’t forget to hold on, hold on
'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don’t give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don’t give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
