When you love someone, it's natural, not demanding
And that's one thing I'm proud to say I found in you
I'm so glad we reached an understanding
Now I know my heart is safe with you, ooh
So now my love to you, baby, I surrender
Get ready tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready  tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Celebrations in the heart 'cause we're united
And there's nothing in this world to come between me and you
We're together and it keeps me so excited
To think of what the power of love can do, ooh
And I'm filled with a love that's, oh, so tender
Get ready  tonight 
I'm gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready  tonight
I'm gonna make this a night to remember
Make this a night to remember
Get ready tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready  tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready  tonight 
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready  tonight 
Gonna make this a night to remember
This night you won't forget
Gonna make this a night to remember
‘Cause your love I won't regret
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready  tonight 
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready  tonight 
Gonna make this a night to remember
Tonight
Make this a night to remember
Tonight
Make this a night to remember
Let's make a toast to those who helped make this occasion
They turn their back on love
And that's what drove you straight to me
Now to you, I make a lasting dedication
I'll show you all that love and life can be, ooh
And each day that I live I will deliver
Get ready  tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready  tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready  tonight 
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready  tonight 
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready tonight
