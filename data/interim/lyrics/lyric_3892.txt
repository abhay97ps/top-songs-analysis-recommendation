Ooh yeah 
Party like it's 1999
Who is shawty, cause she mighty fine
Her friend is ugly, she is not a dime
Shots fired, Columbine
Ooh, I'm sorry, please forgive me
Keep it under like Sydney
Tryna to shove it in her kidney
She get higher than Whitney
Fastrak, watch her speed through
Like to drink, smoke weed, too?
Hard to kill like T2
Ice cold, I'm a igloo
I got the city on fire
Dope and gon' keep it lit
Ask the streets, I'm no liar
They gon' say, "Dope is the shit!"
I'm from the city of Oakland, I'm from the city of trees 
I'm from the city of gangsters, I'm from the city of thieves 
I'm from the city of pimps, I'm from the city of players 
I'm the man in my city, in my city, I'm the mayor
I'm from the city of game, I'm from the city of paper
I'm from the city of Warriors, I'm from the city of Raiders
I'm from the city of Short, I'm from the city of Hammer
Oakland, California, we the West Coast Atlanta
Where you from, where you from?
Better scream out your city!
Where I'm from, where I'm from we go dumb
Yeah, dumber than Diddy
Havin' fun, hella fun
Come and get busy
But just know that we don't play that
In my city 
We don't play that in my city 
No, we don't play that in my city 
No, we don't play that in my city 
Know that we don't play that
All in the new lane
Brew that butane
Two lane
School game
Sleuth name
New thang
Lookin' all astute
Main clique like glue as if we in the blue gang
Middle name Usain
Slanging this 'Bama
Wonder when the view change
There's been a few lames sippin this Kool-aid
Took a knee and got DOA like he blew
Stay sleep like he roofied
Peel like a toupee
Better get up off me I don't wanna catch a body
Man, I been about the water
Wanna fuck around and make you into martyr
I ain't taking any order
Man I came up out the corner
When I came with something
Came up on the court and now I'm karma
Des garçons, fast like it's Daytona
Debutante on my arm
And s'pose I get my otra
Kick they game, pelota
Hit the strand and comb
I hear my name is Sosa
White in a black hood
Makin' black music so I pass good
Could he win 'em in New York
Hit the backwood
But I'm back in the West
Toke loud 'til I can't stand good
Yet I'm out of banners
Said they know the towners
So I called a foul and pulled 'em of the tiddy
'Cause it's all mamas that we all drama, know that–
We don’t play that 
Ay we don’t play that 
Ay we don’t play that in my 
Ay we don’t play that in my 
Yo, Diggs
You might wanna lace your shoes before we catch you slippin’
Icy motherfuckers out here get up on this pimpin’
It's the binner's slang
It's bangin' where the Blood are Crippin'
Step up like a sucker, someone gonna get they licks in
Ain't no lollipop-in'
We been molly-poppin' for a minute
We just used to call it thizzin'
Rest in peace to the god
Gs in the sky if you ready to mob
With the grill in the mouth
Fire sub in the trunk
Gangin', pull up and jump out
Boy, this isn't one for the town
They used to think we was clowns
'Cause they never been around
Somebody goin' so dummy on the floor
They feet don't even seem to touch the ground
Damn, that shit beautiful
Beautiful screen HD, maybe you get the picture
My city wrote the script
You should prolly stick to it like scripture 
You can show up trippin', drunk, talkin', disrespectin' my niggas
But just know that we don't play that
In my city 
We don't play that in my city  
We don't play that in my city 
No, we don't play that in my city 
Know that we don't play that
