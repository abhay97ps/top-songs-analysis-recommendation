(Love tracks, setbacks
All can come back)
Pick up on the fact 
Love and devotion 
It's the tracks of lost emotion 
It's gonna subside
She stole my heart
But it's just a misdemeanor
When I think I'm in love
And I catch my girl doin' the wrong 
It's just another setback in this life
It's no big deal 
She's not for real 
But to no appeal she stole my heart
But it's just a misdemeanor
(Love tracks, setbacks
All can come back)
Pick up on the fact 
Love and devotion 
In the tracks of lost emotion 
It's gonna subside
Oh she stole my heart
But it's just a misdemeanor
When I get to the goal and my friends all tell me
When I'm playing the fool 
She makes you feel so out of place
(Like when you run a red light
And find yourself pulling over)
 it's no big deal
 she's not for real
But to no appeal she stole my heart
But it's just a misdemeanor
You're what I need
(Love tracks, setbacks
All can come back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's just a misdemeanor
You're what I need
(Love tracks, setbacks
All can come back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's just a misdemeanor, yeah
You're what I need
(Love tracks, setbacks
All can come back)
It's just a misdemeanor, yeah
You got to get over it
(Love tracks, setbacks
All can come back)
It's just a misdemeanor
