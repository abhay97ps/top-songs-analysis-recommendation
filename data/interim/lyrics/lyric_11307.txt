Baby, can you hear me?
Girl, you rock my soul
Give me full control
You made my life so happy, now
When you came through the door
But don't come running back with tears in your eyes
I won't be the one to listen to your story
Don't come running back, oh baby
Don't come running back, oh girl
You are my soul and inspiration
My only consolation
But, babe, you hurt my pride - yes you did, now
When you walked through the door, oh
But don't come running back with tears in your eyes
I won't be the one, I can't listen to your pleading no more, now
So don't come running back, oh baby 
Don't come running back, oh girl 
Don't come running back, oh baby 
Don't come running, don't come running
Don't come running back, oh girl
Hey
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Girl, you rock my - baby, now, you rock my soul
Yeah, you do - give me full control
You made my life so happy, now, oh
When you walked through the door
So don't come running back with tears in your eyes
I won't be the one to listen to your story, now
Don't come running back, oh baby 
Don't come running back, oh girl
Don't come running back, oh baby 
Don't come running, don't come, don't come running back
No, girl
Hey, I'm tired of your crying
Go out on me at night
You're cheating, and you're lying
I can't take it, girl, no-no-no-no-no-no-no
Don't come running back, no baby
