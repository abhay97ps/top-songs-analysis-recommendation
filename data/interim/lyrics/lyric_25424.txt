Crazy
I like that, you like that, so let's be crazy
The contact, impact, I want that daily
Our breath getting deeper, deeper, lately
I like that, baby
'Cause I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough of your love
Give me some more, I love it
I can't get enough, yeah
'Cause I can't get enough
Dice que no le es suficiente 
'Tá mal de la mente 
Cuando está solita que entre 
Música para ponerla en ambiente, yeh-yeah
Ella quiere que lo hagamo' como aquella ve' 
Le busqué otro trago por si tenía sed 
To' lo que se pone bonito se le ve 
Empezamo' a pie y ahora andamo' en el je' 
Vamo' a calentar
Baby, tú va' a subir y a bajar
No se quiere olvidar, lo quiere recordar
Baby, yo quiero entrar
'Cause I can't get enough 
Yeah, I can't get enough 
Yeah, I can't get enough of your love
Give me some more, I love it
I can't get enough, yeah 
'Cause I can't, can't
Crazy
I like that, you like that, so let's be crazy
The contact, impact, I want that daily
Our breath getting deeper, deeper, lately
I like that, baby 
Uuh, and no one's gotta know, we can keep it lowkey
I'll be fine alone, long as you're alone with me 
So incredible, unforgettable on me
Keep your body on me 
'Cause I can't get enough 
Yeah, I can't get enough 
Yeah, I can't get enough of your love
Give me some more, I love it
I can't get enough, yeah
'Cause I can't get enough
