Dance your last dance
Party girl, party girl
Have yourself a time, party girl
'Cause when this party's through
I've got plans for you
So just dance your last dance
Party girl
I realize there's fifty guys
That you've got on a string
But I'm gonna change all that
When I'll show you this diamond ring
You'll forget that singing band
When you hear those choir boys sing
You're gonna trade your dancing shoes
For apron strings and things
So just
Party girl
You laugh like it's just a game
Like they say in storybooks
Log on to kill this message
Tigers can be tamed
Won't you be surprised
You'll take a second look
Instead of the bossa nova
You'll be learning how to cook
So just
