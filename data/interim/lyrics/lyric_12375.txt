We live in the modern age
Where love is fast like a turning page
In a magazine, we've hardly seen
The friends we used to know
They disappear, they come and go
Like the times we've had
It's kind of sad
Whatever happened to old fashioned love
The kind that would see you through
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew
Yeah, whatever happened to old fashioned love
The kind that would last through the years
Through the trials
Through the smiles
Through the tears
Today is all we've planned
We say tomorrow we'll understand
If it all should end
We'd be alone again
Ohh, whatever happened to old fashioned love
The kind that would see you through
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew
Yeah, whatever happened to old fashioned love
The kind that would last through the years
Through the trials
Through the smiles
Through the tears
For now the tenderness
Has been replaced
With something less
And it's hard to find
What we left behind
Ohh, whatever happened to old fashioned love
The kind that would see you through
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew
Yeah, whatever happened to old fashioned love
The kind that would last through the years
Through the trials
Through the smiles
Through the tears
