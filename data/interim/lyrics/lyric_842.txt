I'm going to move, baby
Way out on the outskirts of town
I'm going to move, baby
Way out on the outskirts of town
You see I don't need nobody
Always hanging around
Let me tell you, honey
We are going to move away from here
I don't need no iceman
I'm going to get you a Frigidaire
When we move
Way out on the outskirts of town
Whoa, you see we won't need nobody
Always hanging around
It may seem funny, honey
Funny as can be
If we have a dozen children
You know they all, all better look like me
When we move
Way back 'a town
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, we won't need nobody
Always hanging round
We don't need nobody, baby
All, always hanging around
Hanging around
