It's my thing
I can do what I wanna do
You can't tell me
Who to sock it to
It's my thing
I can do what I wanna do
You can't tell me
Who to sock it to
You don't want me to love you
It ain't no big deal
You don't wanna leave me man
It ain't no big deal
I don't need love
As for as you
Make me no difference
Who you sock it to
It's my thing
I can do what I wanna do
You can't tell me
Who to sock it to
It's my thing
I'm got hurt
For your love
Oh it's pathetic baby
I gotta be on alert
I'll do anything
Anything I choose
I just can't be at the window
Stopped for you
It's your thing, my thing
That I want to do
You can't tell me
Who to sock it to
It's my thing
I can do what I wanna do
You can't tell me, no
Who to sock it to
