I met her in church!
I met her in church, on a Sunday morning
She looked at me with eyes of love, as the choir sang, "Hallelujah!"
Hallelujah!
I met her in church
I met her in church; we fell in love on a Sunday morning
All at once, I heard angels singing, singing "Hallelujah!"
Singing, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
I didn't find her on a Saturday night;
I found her in the Sunday morning light
I found her on a back row seat
In a little church just down the street
I met her in church, and I wed her in church
Preacher Jones said, "Come here, children
Good Lord willing, and the creek don't rise
You're going to be happy for the rest of your life!
Singing, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
I met her in church; I met her in church
I found a love, I found a love!
Hallelujah, I found a loveâ€¦
Right there in church, I found a love
Singing, Hallelujah!
I met her in church; I met her in church
Hallelujah!
