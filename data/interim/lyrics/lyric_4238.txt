If you are wond'rin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin', am I sleepin' too
Well, I'm just sittin' here lovin' you
Close my eyes and lovin' you
I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
I have been wond'rin' just what I would do
If I weren't sleepin', had I not found you
But I'd be outside findin' you
Walkin' on the avenue, findin' you
Well, I'm just sittin' back
Sittin' here lovin' you
Now the reason that you never see me runnin' 'round
Fingers on my forehead couldn't calm me down
She can even get me up on my feet
When I've got to take care of some business
On the street
I have been walkin' all my streets alone
I would keep walkin' to keep from going home
I couldn't quite barely conceive of you
Now I can't conceive of ever leavin' you
'cause I'm just sittin' back
Sittin' here lovin' you
