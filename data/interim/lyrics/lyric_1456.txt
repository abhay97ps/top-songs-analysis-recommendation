Over and over
I tell you that I love you
It's over and over and over
I told you I miss you
Like the good book says
You have to reap just what you sow
I know, I know, I know
You're my lover girl
And I'm your lover boy
Love is no game
Let's not take it for a toy
It's like the good book says
You have to reap just what you sow
Can't you understand the things
The things we have planned
For the years, years to come
It's hard to believe
You, you deceived me
Baby, baby, baby
Please come back home
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Over and over and over
I told you I love you
It's over and over and over
I told you I miss you
It's like, it's like the good book says
You have to reap just what you sow
I know, I know, I know
