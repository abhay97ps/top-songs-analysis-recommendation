Oooohh ooh whooh whooh
Let it be soon, don't hesitate
Make it now  don't wait 
Open your heart and let my love come in
I want the moment to start when I can fill your heart
With more love, and more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy
And my love will be so solid
It would take a hundred lifetimes
To live it down, wear it down, tear it down
This is no fiction
This is no act
This is real  it's a fact 
I'll always belong only to you
Each day I'll be living to
Make sure I'm giving you
More love and more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy, oh honey now
My love will be so solid
It would take about a hundred lifetimes
To live it down, wear it down, tear-air it down
Mmmmmmm whoooh whooh whooh whooh whooh
Mmmm mmmmm
As we grow older no need to fear
When you need me  I'll be here 
I'll be beside you every step of the way
A heart that's truthful and keeping you youthful
With more love, more joy
Than age or time can ever destroy, oh honey now
My love will be so solid
It would take about a hundred lifetimes
To live it down, wear it down, tear it down
Gonna give you more oooh and more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy, oh baby now
My love will be so solid
It would take about a hun.....
