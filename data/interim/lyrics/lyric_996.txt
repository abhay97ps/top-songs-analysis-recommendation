Let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, everybody
Back to the hop
Well, it's Saturday night
I got a dollar in my pocket
I'm going back to the hop
And I'm really gonna rock it
I heard the jockey on the radio
Announce it today
He said he's got a lot of records
He'll be giving away
So, put your twisting dress on
'Cause we gotta be gone
Back to the hop, oh, yeah
We'll do the twist
And then we'll fish
Pony time is so doggone fine
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, everybody
Back to the hop
Well, a lot a famous record stars
Are making the scene
You know, a cat from South Philly
And a guy from New Orleans
They're gonna sing to the records
While the kids all shout
And then they'll autograph their pictures
Then they'll pass them out
You know it's lots of fun
Come on, we better run
Back to the hop, oh, yeah
We'll do the twist
And then we'll fish
Pony time is so doggone fine
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, everybody
Back to the hop
