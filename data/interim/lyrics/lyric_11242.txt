I remember the sound of the passing train
As it rolled through the night in the pouring rain
And the touch of a hand and the way she said 'Goodbye'
And we walked in the sun down the royal mile
Saw the light in her eye and the way she smiled
And she cried in the night and I heard her say 'Don't go'
What can I do, sweet darlin', I don't want to go away
Looking at you sweet darlin', I know I want to stay
What can I do, sweet darlin'?
In the light of the day I was rolling home
I was thinking of you waiting on your own
And I wanted to call but then something said 'Oh no'
Yeah but now it's a dream, it's a memory
But I'll never forget what you gave to me
I was lost and alone but you made me feel ok
What can I do, sweet darlin', I don't want to go away
Looking at you sweet darlin', I know I want to stay
What can I do, sweet darlin'?
I remember the sound of the passing train
As it rolled through the night in the pouring rain
And the touch of a hand and the way she said 'Goodbye'
What can I do, sweet darlin', I don't want to go away
Looking at you sweet darlin', I know I want to stay
What can I do, sweet darlin'?
