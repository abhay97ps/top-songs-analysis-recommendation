I close the door
Like so many times, so many times before
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
I wanna let you walk away tonight
Without a word
I try to sleep, yeah
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
A thousand more regrets unraveling, oh!
If you were here right now
I swear I'd tell you this
Baby, I don't wanna waste another day
Keeping it inside is killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted
Comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby, I would tell you
Every time you leave I'm inconsolable
I climb the walls, yeah
I can see the edge, but I can't take the fall, no
I've memorized the number
So why can't I make the call?
Maybe 'cause I know you will always be with me
In the possibility, oh-oh-oh!
Baby, I don't wanna waste another day
Keeping it inside is killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted
Comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby, I would tell you
Every time you leave I'm inconsolable
I don't wanna be like this
I just wanna let you now
That everything that I hold in
Is everything I can't let go
Oh-oh, oh! I can't let go
Yeah, 'cause baby
I don't wanna waste another day 
Keeping it inside is killing me 
'Cause all I ever wanted 
Comes right down
To you , to you 
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby, I would tell you
Every time you leave I'm inconsolable
Don't you know it baby
I don't wanna waste another day
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby, I would tell you
Every time you leave I'm inconsolable
Yeah-yeah 
Oh, I'm inconsolable
Whoa, yeah, oh-oh
I'm inconsolable
