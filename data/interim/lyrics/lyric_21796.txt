I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say she got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing 
I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say she got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
And she's high in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
She got wings, she got a halo
It seems to me so unnatural
Cause there's one thing, that I just don't know
What seemed to be so incredible
She looked at me, took me by surprise yeah
As if she took me by the hand to some foreign land, and had me up
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Singing my song , from dusk till dawn 
I know you got a lot on your mind but it won't be long 
If all things get better , and I may be wrong 
Cause I'll never get to even cross the line before they make it home 
Singing my song , from dusk till dawn 
I know you got a lot on your mind but it won't be long 
If all things get better , and I may be wrong 
Cause I'll never get to even cross the line before they make it home 
I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when i say she got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing 
I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when i say she got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
And she's high in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh
