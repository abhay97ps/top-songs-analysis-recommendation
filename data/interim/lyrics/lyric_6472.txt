Baby I need your loving
Baby I need your loving
Although you're never near
Your voice I often hear
Another day and another night
I long to hold you tight
'Cause I'm so lonely whoa
Baby I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Mm yes I do
Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means having you to keep yes
'Cause lately I've been losing sleep
Baby I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Whoa
If at night I call your name
Sometimes I wonder
Will I ever be the same
When you see me smiling
Know things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see
Has all been rehearsed
'Cause darling I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside me darling
It makes me feel like I'm half alive
Baby I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby I need your loving
