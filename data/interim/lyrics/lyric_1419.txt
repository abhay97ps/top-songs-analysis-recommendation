Everybody's doin' a brand new dance, now
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
My little baby sister can do it with me
It's easier than learnin' your ABCs
So come on, come on
Do the Loco-Motion with me
You gotta swing your hips, now
Come on, baby
Jump up, jump back
Well, I think you've got the knack
Whoa, whoa
Now that you can do it, let's make a chain, now
A chugga-chugga motion like a railroad train, now
Do it nice and easy, now, don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
Come on, come on
Do the Loco-Motion with me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Move around the floor in a Loco-Motion
Do it holding hands if you get the notion
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feelin' blue
So come on, come on
Do the Loco-Motion with me
 You gotta swing your hips, now  That's right
You're doin' fine 
Come on, baby 
Mm, jump up, jump back 
You're lookin' good
