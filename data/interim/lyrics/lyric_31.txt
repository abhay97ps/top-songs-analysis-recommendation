I wanna be loved with inspiration
I wanna be loved starting tonight
Instead of merely holding conversation
Hold me tight!
I wanna be loved, I crave affection
Those kisses of yours, I'd gladly share
I want your eyes to shine in my direction
Make me care!
I want the kind of romance that should be strong
And equally as tender
I only ask for the chance to knowthe meaning
Of the word "surrender"
I wanna be thrilled by only you, dear
I wanna be thrilled by your caress
I wanna find each dream of mine come true
Dear, I wanna be loved!
I wanna be loved with inspiration
I wanna be loved starting tonight
Instead of merely holding conversation
Hold me tight!
I wanna be kissed until I tingle
I wanna be kissed, starting tonight
Embrace me till our heartbeats intermingle
Wrong or right
I'm in the mood to adore
I'm ready for that well known turtle doving
I'm in no mood to resist
And I insist the world owes me a loving
I wanna be thrilled to desperation
I wanna be thrilled starting tonight
With ev'ry kind of wonderful sensation
I wanna be loved!
