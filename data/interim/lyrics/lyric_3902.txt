Tar and Cement
Verdelle Smith
The town I came from was quiet and small
We played in the meadows where the grass grew so tall
In summer the lilacs would grow everywhere
The laughter of children would float in the air
As I grew older I had to roam
Far from my family, far from my home
Into the city, where lives can be spent
Lost in the shadows of tar and cement
Chorus:
And every night I'd sit alone and learn
What loneliness meant
Up in my rented room above the world
Of tar and cement
Each day I'd wake up and look at the sky
Think of the meadows where I used to lie
Then I'd remember all of that's gone
You're in the city, you better push on
Get what you came for, before it's too late
Get what you came for, the meadows can wait
Repeat Chorus
Many years later, tired at last
I headed for home to look for my past
I looked for the meadows, there wasn't a trace
Six lanes of highway had taken their place
Where were the lilacs and all that they meant
Nothing but acres of tar and cement
Yet I can see it there so clearly now
Where has it gone?
Yes I can see it there so clearly now
Where has it gone?
Where are the meadows? 
Where are the lilacs? 
And where is the tall grass? 
The laughter of children? 
Nothing but acres 
Acres and acres.....
