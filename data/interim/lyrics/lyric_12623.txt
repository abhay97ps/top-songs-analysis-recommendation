You can dance
Every dance with the one who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one that holds your hand
In the pale moonlight
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Oh, I know
That the music's fine like sparklin' wine
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing
But while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Baby, don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never ever let you go
I love you  oh so much
You can dance
Go and carry on 'til the night is gone
'Til it's time to go
If she asks if you're all alone
Can she take you home?
You got to tell her no
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Ooh darlin', save the last dance for me
You can dance
Every dance with the one that gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one that holds your hand
In the pale moonlight
Just don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Ooh darlin', save the last dance for me
Save the last dance for me
Dance, dance, dance, dance
