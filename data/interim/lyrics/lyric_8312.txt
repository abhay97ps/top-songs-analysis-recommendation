I don't remember mama
She died when I was born
We lived in a one room shanty
But daddy tried to make it a home
When I was only six years old
I started singing in the streets
People would throw me pennies
So I could daddy make ends meet
They said
CHORUS:
Keep on singing
Don't stop singing
You're gonna be a star someday
You're gonna make a lot of people happy
When they come to hear you play
They said keep on singin
Keep the bells a ringin
Spread the music from town to town
There's not enough song in this old world
So spread your song around
By the time I was 10 years old
I had a rock n roll band
Daddy's eyes were growing dim
But I didn't understand
He said he would be so proud of me
Each time he'd hear us play
At night he'd pull me to his side
And daddy would always say
CHORUS
He didn't have much money
But things didn't seem so bad
I felt just like the queen of the world
When I was with my dad
Then one rainy April night
Daddy called me to his side
He held me with his tremblin hands
Right before he died
CHORUS
CHORUS
CHORUS
