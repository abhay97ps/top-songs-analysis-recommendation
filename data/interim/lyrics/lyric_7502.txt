Now the hacienda's dark, the town is sleeping
Now the time has come to part, the time for weeping
Now the village mission bells are softly ringing 
Whoa, if you listen with your heart girl, you'll hear them singing
Each night I'll say a prayer, a simple prayer to guide you, 
To hasten ev'ry lonely hour of ev'ry lonely day
Now the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow
Oh, but the memories we share are there to borrow
Oh, 
Oh-Oh, 
May God go with you my love, vaya con dios
May God go with you my love, vaya con dios
I'll say a prayer, I'll a prayer to guide you my love
