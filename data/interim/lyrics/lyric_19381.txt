We had our life, we had our love
But you don't know what you've got 'til you lose it
Well, that was then and this is now
And I want you back, how many times can I say I'm sorry
Oh yes, I'm sorry
How could something so good go so bad
How could something so right go so wrong
I don't know, I don't have all the answers
But I want you back, how many times can I say I'm sorry
Oh yes, I'm sorry
But I'm not leaving 'less you come with me
You're all I need, please, believe in me
But I'm not leaving 'less you come with me
You're all I need, please, believe in me
I only wanted you as someone to love
But something happened on the way to heaven
It got a hold of me and wouldn't let go
And I want you back, how many times can I say I'm sorry
Oh yes, I'm sorry
Oh, you can run, you can hide
But I'm not leaving 'less you come with me
You're all I need, so please, believe in me
I'm not leaving unless you're here with me, baby
You're all I need, please, believe in me
They say you can't take it with you when you go
And I believe it
But taking what I've got or being here with you
You know I'd rather leave it all
Baby, stay with me
Oh, stay with me, baby
You're all I need, so please, believe in me
But I'm not leaving, 'less you come with me
Oh, I'm on your side
I'm on your side
