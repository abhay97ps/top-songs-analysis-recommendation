Bro, I'm just riding
Bro, I'm just riding this wave
Hmm, I'm stuck up in the space
No, I don't want
No, I don't want to escape
Creativity is my phase
Dem talk say e go pass?
Otedola with the balling
Nigga fuck that shits, I'm Robben with the Pace
Look at my face
Want the whole landscape, oya snap my portrait
Two-Zero-One-Eight
You know my face cause I came out the bassment
This year, all my boys dem dey H
Be scared cause I fit to smash your face right there
For the pavement
Know I'm filled with rage
I've been writing these rhymes 5,475 days
In 9,900,099 ways, RIDING!
Bro, I'm just riding this wave
Hmm, I'm stuck up in the space
No, I don't want
No, I don't want to escape
Creativity is my phase
Dem talk say e go pass?
Otedola with the balling
Nigga fuck that shit, I'm Robben with the Pace
Want the whole landscape, something something some some 
Yarning all the yarns, I no dey playing
I just want the paper keep the fame
When it's overflowing keep the change
Your favourite rapper coming of age
Flip-flip, i'm on the front, back, and every page
And e no dey dey the same
Elevating on stage, men
There's power in the name, men
She'll do anything for the pay, men
Especially if she heard I make it rain, man
She want Johnny, but boys dey con dey run the cold train
Including the ones with no game
Even the ones with no shame
The story so old, men
In a world so cold how could you be so open?
Cut!
Me, i'm really reeling in my cut 
What!
Me, i'm really realer than the lot
So i'm fleeing from the flock
Look back and turn to salt
Progressive motion, shey you wan dey front?
Better back up, I go magnify the fonts
Read the writings on the wall
These-a-Hieroglyphic joints
Roll my words up and smoke
Get you high, i'm so blunt
I hate RICH NIGGAS! God damn it!
Cause I no never have a lot, damn it
Maybe comfy, not rich material shits
Educated like a bitch, men you have to Awba Dam it
Woah
Hungry for your ears and i'm famished
Feeling like a genie, fit to make these rappers vanish
Mash-mash anybody, squeeze them like a sandwich
Yarn dust for these Naija rap songs be like Spanish
Right now i'm at a point, draw the line like an artist
Dark-art boys better get up out my parish
Ride the wave like a mami-water marriage
Hmmm, Riding this wave yeah
Ho, i'm riding, yeah i'm riding this wave yeah
Ho, i'm right on time, and 
And i'm riding this waaaave, mmmhmmm
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
Bro, I'm just riding
Bro, I'm just riding this wave
Hmm, I'm stuck up in the space
No, I don't want
No, I don't want to escape
Creativity is my phase
Dem talk say e go pass?
Otedola with the balling
Nigga fuck that shits, I'm Robben with the Pace
Oya look in my face
Want the whole landscape, oya snap a portrait
