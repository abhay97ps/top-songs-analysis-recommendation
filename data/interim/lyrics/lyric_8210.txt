Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?
Is this the lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your eyes
Will you still love me tommorrow?
Tonight with words unspoken
You said that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night the morning sun?
I like to know that your love
Is the love that I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
