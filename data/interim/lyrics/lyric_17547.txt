Am I dreaming, baby?
Are you for real?
Things are kind of hazy
And my head's all cloudy inside 
Now I've heard talk of angels, baby 
But never though I would have one to call mine
See you are just too good to be true
And I hope
There's not some kinda mirage
With you, oh baby
Am I dreaming? 
Am I just imagining you're here in my life
Am I dreaming?
Pinch me to see if it's real
'Cause my mind can't decide
No, oh, oh oh oh
No, oh, oh oh oh
Will this last for one night
Please say that it's forever
And that it's not an illusion to my eye
And I, I hope
That you just don't up and disappear
My love I pray
That it's not a hoax and it's for real, oh
Am I dreaming? 
Am I just imagining you're here in my life
Am I dreaming?
Teach me to see if it's real
'Cause my mind can't decide
Hear me out now
Sometimes, say that sometimes
I need you to show me, girl
Show me that you're not a mirage
I need you
I need you to pinch me, baby
Am I...
Am I dreaming? 
Am I just imagining you're here in my life?
Am I dreaming?
Teach me to see if it's real
'Cause my mind can't decide
I can't decide, no, no
Tell me this is not an illusion
Somebody let me know
This is not a mirage, no
Oh oh baby
