Now you say that you're lonely
Hate to being so untrue
I want you to cry 
Want you cry 
All over me 
I want you to cry 
Yeah, over me 
Hey, yeah, cry 
Yeah I cried a river over you
Now you say that you're sorry
Oh, for bein' so unkind
I want you to cry 
Cry for me 
Oh! 
Over me 
Want you to cry 
Right on me, yeah 
Oh, I cried a river over you
You drove me nearly drove me out of my head
Never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
You were through with me
Oh yeah 
Want you to cry 
Oh yeah 
Oh, cry 
Cry me a river 
Oh, I cried a river over you
Now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
You drove me nearly drove me out of my head
Oooh, never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
You were through with me
Yes 
I want you to cry 
Cry me a river 
Ah 
Cry me 
Oh, I cried a river over you
Yeah, I cried a river over you
Over you 
Over you 
Ah!
Let me 
Cry me a river 
Over the mountain 
Let me 
Let me cry a river over you 
Yeah 
 Cry a river over you
