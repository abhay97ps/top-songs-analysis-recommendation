I'm so hurt
To think that you lied to me
Hurt
Way down deep inside of me
You said
Your love was true
And we'd never part
Now you want someone new
And it breaks my heart
Ooh I'm hurt
Much more much more
Than you'll ever know
Ooh hurt
Because I still love you so
But even
Though you hurt me
Like no one else could do
I would never
Never hurt
You
