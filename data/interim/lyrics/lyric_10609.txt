Can you read my mind?
Do you know what is is that you do to me?
I don't know who you are
Just a friend from another star
Here I am like a kid out of school
Holding hands with a god
I'm a fool
Will you look at me, quivering, like a little girl?
Shivering, you can see right through me
Can you read my mind?
Can you picture the things I'm thinking of?
Wondering why you are
All the wonderful things you are
You can fly
You belong in the sky
You and I, could belong to each other
If you need a friend
I'm the one to fly to
If you need to be loved
Here I am
Read my mind
