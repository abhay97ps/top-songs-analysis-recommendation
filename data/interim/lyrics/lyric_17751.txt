Theres been times ive felt like half a man
Life had me down on my knees
Troulbed times i dont understand
Why they happen to me
I have struggled through the dark ness
And i have found the light of day
But if i lost you
Thered be no sun shine shinin through
I dont know what in the world i would do
If i lost you
Like a ship with no harbor
Like a bird with no wings
Like a fish out of water
A dreamer without a dream
I have learned about losing
I could lose most n e thing
But if i lost you
Thered be no sun shine shinin through
I dont know what in the world i would do
If i lost you
