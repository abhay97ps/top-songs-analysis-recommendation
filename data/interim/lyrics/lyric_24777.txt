Would you, oooh?
Would you, oooh?
Hey, I know this might sound weird to say 
But would you love me if I ran away? 
I know you probably think I'm insane 
Ain't nothin' change but the pocket change 
I know they gotta feel my pain 
I make them birds Lauryn Hill sang 
And everywhere I go they know my name 
'Cause I be reppin' gang gang 
Posted with the gang gang 
Pull up wit' the gang gang 
Suit up wit' the gang gang 
I be reppin' gang gang 
I shoot wit' the gang gang 
Bang wit' the gang gang 
Ride out wit' the gang gang 
Always rep the gang gang
Always rep the gang gang gang gang 
Always rep the gang gang gang gang
Whole lotta gang shit, gang gang gang 
Whole lotta gang shit,  gang gang gang yeah
She froze up when that Ghost came 
Big body Rolls, it be hoggin' up both lanes 
She lift her nose up when she want that cocaine 
I lift my doors up, the Lambo, take propane 
After my show we put hoes in the chokehold 
At the door, we take cell phones, no photos
Money comin' in, too much I can't hold, truckload
I'm hot, I can't be trappin' in the streets, that what the plug fo'
And all I want is nachos 
And all I want is Huncho 
Pulls strings like a banjo 
And the keys, a piano 
Take me back to the back door 
I can see my foot on a doorknob
Make it back to the gang, that's the whole job
Chop it up and talk about just what we got
Whippin' that Draco 
She said she love me but that's somethin' we'll never know 
Honestly, that's all I really wanna know 
Ain't tryna waste my time, it's time to let you go 
And get back to that back end on the road
I can't go out sad about a hoe 
Married to the money, I propose
Always rep the gang gang gang gang
Suit up with the gang gang
Always rep the gang gang gang gang
I be reppin' gang gang
Whole lotta gang shit gang gang gang
Hit her with that gang gang
Whole lotta gang shit gang gang gang
Always reppin' gang gang
