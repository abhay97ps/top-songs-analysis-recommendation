In the world so all alone
You get to feeling that you're on your own
Troubled times seem to be a way of life
And the day it feels so bad
You wonder if you'll have to a place to stay
Somewhere to go to keep out the pain and the cold
Now don't you wonder
How you'll survive until spring
Just hear the thunder
To you it sings oh yeah
To you it sings pretty mama
I'm gonna take care of everything
I'm gonna take care of you
I'm gonna take care of everything
I'm gonna take care of you
So you'll know the feeling
That the thundering soul has for you
I'll be revealing
All the love in my heart that's for you
In the warmth that's in our home
Then you'll realize you're not alone
Troubled times will fade and then pass away
I'm gonna take care of everything
I'm gonna take care of you
I'm gonna take care of everything
I'm gonna take care of you
I'm gonna take care of everything
I'm gonna take care of you
I'm gonna take care of everything
I'm gonna take care of you
I'm gonna take care of everything
I'm gonna take care of you
I'm gonna take care of everything
