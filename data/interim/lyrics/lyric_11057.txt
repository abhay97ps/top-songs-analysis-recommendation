I like to move at the speed of light
Albert says I can't -- but I can
Circle of stone, circle of steel
I want to ride in an iron wheel
I am a child of atomic war
You are the daughter of the overlord
Let's get together on the killin' floor
Give me -- more, more, more, more, more
Violet lightning
Violet lightning
She's the girl with the hungry eyes
The girl with the hungry eyes
She holds up half the sky
The girl with the hungry eyes
I just met the girl with the perfect lips
I just met the girl with the perfect fit
Every atom in my body could inhale her
Speed of light girl, she is a sailor
Violet lightning
Violent lightning
Violet lightning
Now we're movin' at the speed of light
Now we're movin' at the speed of night
And your home gets filled with newer people, people, people
And all your friends are gone so hang on, hang on to the
Girl with the hungry eyes
She hold up half the sky -- she's the
Girl with the hungry eyes -- I love the
Girl with the hungry eyes
