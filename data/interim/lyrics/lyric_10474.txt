I wanna say I love you
I wanna say I care
Even though you
May not feel the same
I'm not afraid to wait
Cause I know you'll change
Love ends
So love begins, my friend
Love me again
Love me again
If love were a road
I'd be walking
If you were still lucky
I'd be home
Obey your heart
And let me walk in
Open up your eyes
And love me again
Love ends
So love begins, my friend
Love me again
Love me again
Obey your heart
And let me walk in
Open up your eyes
And love me again
Love ends
So love begins, my friend
Love me again
Love me again
Love me again
Love me again
