Mai tais and beachwear
Soft skin and warm air
Long nights and clear skies
I'm hers and she's mine
Long days with no cares
All smiles and no tears
I think I'm dreaming
Lost in the feeling
Trips without leaving
I touch her softly
 the door knocks
I say you softly
I need you I do
You need me you say
She's mine, she's mine yeah
I'll find peace next time, I'll find peace next time
She's mine, she's mine yeah
I'll find peace next time
She's mine, she's mine yeah
She's mine, she's mine uh
You left for the summer, I waited for you I hit you up
You ignored my texts, saying you mad but it's cool
Remember the times in the... remember the times in the red coup
Shit  don't let me chill before I get your uncle's uncle's trying to wring my neck too
Uhhh your mamma never liked me, your dad never met me
Probably a good thing
I'm complex, I'm on , I'm on next
Shoot me via text, I'll see you next week
At least that's what I'm hoping
I've been dreaming of you daily while I'm working on the vision look
Everyday the same shit, wake up and go get famous right?
But every time I fall in love it never ends right?
Maybe it's the drugs, or maybe I'm just trip on
Maybe I should just go back to where I was since day one
Back to basics, running game like asics
I've been said that shit, but man that shit was really true
Cuz these girls on my mind like all the time is wasted time
But shit I love her so I gotta keep her
Man I never know if I should
