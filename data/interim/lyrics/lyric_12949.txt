Lonely girl, rainy night
Lookin' for that number
She needs someone to treat her right
There's plenty of men she could call
But she wants him most of all
Oh God, I hope he's home tonight
She needs a love from a real exciter
She needs the allnighter, the allnighter
He's the one, the one she calls
When she gets that feeling
Some nights she just can't stop herself
He's tough and tender, a soul bender
Ain't no service he can't render
He touches her like nobody else
He brings out the love, love
Love deep inside her, he's the allnighter
Now when all the stimulation
Let's you down, down, down
And there ain't no medication
Layin' around, 'round, 'round
You feel your little heart
Begin to pound and pound
He's a satisfier of that one desire
Other guys come and go
They may try but they don't know
Every girl needs special care
Oh, he's so bad, he's so good
He makes it feel just the way it should
Nobody else can take her there
He's the real thing, the pure delighter
He's the allnighter, the allnighter
It's getting lighter
There goes the allnighter
