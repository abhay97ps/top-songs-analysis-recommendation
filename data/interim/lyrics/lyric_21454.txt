Got the news on Friday morning
But a tear I couldn't find
You showed me how I am supposed to live
Now you showed me how to die
I was lost til Sunday morning
I woke up to face my fear
While writing you this good bye song I found a tear
I'm going to miss that smile
I'm going to miss you my friend
Even though it hurts the way it ended up
I'd do it all again
So play it sweet in heaven
'Cause that's right where you want to be
I'm not crying' cause I feel so sorry for you
I am crying' for me
I got up and dialed your number
Your voice came on the line
That old familiar message
I have heard a thousand times
It just said, sorry that I missed you
Leave a message and god bless
I know that you think I am crazy
But I just had to hear your voice I guess
I'm going to miss that smile
I'm going to miss you my friend
Even though it hurts the way it ended up
I'd do it all again
So play it sweet in heaven
'Cause that's right where you want to be
I'm not crying' cause I feel so sorry for you
I am crying' for me
Oh
So play your upside down, left handed
Backward bass guitar
I'll see you on the other side superstar
I'm going to miss that smile
I'm going to miss you my friend
Even though it hurts the way it ended up
I'd do it all again
So play it sweet in heaven
'Cause that's right where you want to be
I'm not crying' cause I feel so sorry for you
I am crying' for me
I'm still crying'
I'm crying' for me
Oh
I'm still crying'
