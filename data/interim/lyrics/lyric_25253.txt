Throw that, twerk that
Shake that, bounce that
Cardi
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Do it, baby, stick it, baby
Move it, baby, lick it, baby 
Suck up on that clit until that pussy got a hickey, baby 
Watch big, coulda bought a Range Rover 
Chain little, but I spent some change on it 
Nigga mad, I'ma put the gang on him 
They'll die 'bout me, they'll bang on him 
And that ass poke out, lil frame on her 
Pussy so good he got my name on it 
Itty-bitty-pretty, I'm the realest in the city
Only fuckin' with the plug, got a nigga worth a billi'
Showin' love, only talk about bands when he hit me
Chose him, he ain't pick me, and we never doin' quickies
Work that
Work that
Please
Make 'em dance, twerk
Twerk, twerk
Twerk, twerk
Twerk, twerk
Twerk
Look, this sound like Cardi took the stage 
This sound like Cardi with the braids 
Jermaine Dupri, baby, money ain't a thing 
This pussy wild, they should throw it in a cage 
See my lifestyle, precise gal 
I be dripped up and wiped down, uh
I see them hoes lookin' cold, lookin' stiff, uh
Thick bitch God's gift to a dick, woo 
Drop low, look back, shit fat, shit fat
I just drop-kicked your bag, six pack, six pack
I just jumps on hit charts, impact, impact
Stop that chit-chat, get smacked, bitch better relax
Work that
Work that
Please
Make 'em dance, twerk
Twerk, twerk
Twerk, twerk
Twerk, twerk
Twerk
Yeah, I see you show that, but is you gon' throw that?
If you don't let me hold that, you know where the door at 
Lil flexin' ass nigga, what is that shit? 
Must have me confused for a rap bitch 
Too rude for a soft nigga, need a boss nigga
Floss nigga who don't give a fuck what it cost, nigga 
I could buy my own, but I'd rather spend y'all's, niggas
Tell them pussy-ass hoes I don't want y'all niggas
Got a penthouse up in the Mandarin 
So when you get this pussy, better handle it 
I'm a top-notch bitch, need some top-notch dick
Smooth like a G5 when you landing it
Work that
Work that
Please
Make 'em dance, twerk
Twerk, twerk
Twerk, twerk
Twerk, twerk
