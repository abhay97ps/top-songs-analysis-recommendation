I thought I knew you, thought that I knew you well
We had a rhythm, but I guess you never can tell
Oh, I learned early never to ignore the signs
You'll be forgiven
It ain't worth that much to my mind
Loving you  so easy, it's hard to say goodbye
But if it's the way it goes it goes
Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You've been seriously misled
Loving somebody ain't your average nine to five
It takes conviction; it takes a will to survive
I'm not somebody who commits the crime
And leaves the scene
But when I've been dissed
I don't spend much time on what might've been
I'm not about self-pity
Your love did me wrong
Now I'm movin', movin' on
Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You've been seriously misled
Get on with my life
And you're not on my mind
Am I too close to time to get over you?
I'm not about self-pity
Your love did me wrong
So I'm moving on 
Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries 
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You're seriously misled
Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think it, think it, think it, think it, baby
Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You've been seriously misled
