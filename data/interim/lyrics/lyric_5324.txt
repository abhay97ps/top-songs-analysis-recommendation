I recall just walking down the street
Trying to escape the city heat
I saw her from the corner of my eye, eye, eye
Yeah, she looked so good I thought I'd die
My heart went bang shang-a-lang, bang shang-a-lang
Bang shang-a-lang, bang, bang
My heart went bang shang-a-lang, bang shang-a-lang
Bang shang-a-lang, bang, bang
Something said I shouldn't waste no time
If I'm ever gonna make her mine
I walked right up and say how do you do, do, do
She said I'll bet I do as good as you
My heart went bang shang-a-lang, bang shang-a-lang
Bang shang-a-lang, bang, bang
My heart went bang shang-a-lang, bang shang-a-lang
Bang shang-a-lang, bang, bang
I remember when I held her tight
Felt like holding dynamite now
What's that ringing in my ear?
Tell me ain't those bells I hear?
Bang, bang, shang-a-lang
Bang, bang, shang-a-lang
Bang, bang, bang
Shang-a-lang-lang
Bang, bang, bang
Shang-a-lang-lang
Now she's gonna spend her life with me
And we'll be as happy as can be
Because I love her more than I can tell, tell, tell
Sunday afternoon we'll hear the bells
And they'll go bang shang-a-lang, bang shang-a-lang
Bang shang-a-lang, bang, bang
And they'll go bang shang-a-lang, bang shang-a-lang
Bang shang-a-lang, bang, bang
