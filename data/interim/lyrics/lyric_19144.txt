Yo, my time wasn't enough
My heart wasn't enough
Money wasn't enough
My house wasn't enough
And now you're gonna leave?
I wish I never told you you should leave
I wish me and you never had my seed
No, I better stop it that's a lie
'Cause you were the apple of my eye
It took a little time for me to see
That, girl, I need you right here next to me
I could let you walk away but I'm not goin out that way, no
Not that way 
Not goin' out that way
Girl, I can't live without you, can't breathe without you
I'm begging you to stay, stay
I love you
Even though I said that you could leave me
I wanted other chances to adore you
I still believe in you and me
I love you
I could take the time, take the time to see
'Cause I don't wanna have to live my life in misery
I wasn't ready for you to set me free
Don't give our love away, hey
Words cannot describe how I feel about you
Only heaven knows how much I do
Girl, I'd put my own life on the line
I'd cherish and protect you with my life
All that shit I said, girl, I didn't mean
I'd die without your love, baby, if you leave
I could let you walk away, but baby im not goin out that way
Not that way
Not goin' that way
'Cause I can't live without you, can't breathe without you
I'm begging you to stay
I love you
Even though I said that you could leave me
I wanted other chances to adore you
'Cause I still believe in you and me
I love you
I could take the time, take the time to see
'Cause I don't wanna have to live my life in misery
I wasn't ready for you to set me free
All my life,  sacrified
What lies inside was enough for me to die
I won't live without you, can't breathe without you
I'm begging you to stay, please stay
I love you
Even though I said that you could leave me
I wanted other chances to adore you
I love you
I could take the time, take the time to see
'Cause I don't wanna have to live my life in misery
I wasn't ready for you to set me free
'Cause I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, baby
And I still believe in you and me, yeah
Oh, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
For you, for you, baby
I love you
