You are the girl that I've been dreaming of
 I was a little girl
You are the girl that I've been dreaming of
 I was a little girl
 I'm biting my tongue
 He's kissing on you
 Oh, why can't you see?
The word's on the streets and it's on the news
He's got two left feet and he bites my moves
The second I do, I know we're gonna be through
He don't suspect a thing, I wish he'd get a clue
You are the girl that I've been dreaming of
You are the girl that I've been dreaming of
 I'm biting my tongue
 He's kissing on you, huh
 Oh, why can't you see?
The word's on the streets and it's on the news
He's got two left feet and he bites my moves
The second I do, I know we're gonna be through
He don't suspect a thing, I wish he'd get a clue
Oh-oh
