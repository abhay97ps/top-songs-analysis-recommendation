I've been living off of Main Street
Where society is the thing
But people that live on Main Street
They don't know how to swing
But the people on the back street
They swing, all night long
Although I live on the main street
The back streets is where I belong
So, show me the back street
Show me the back street
Show me the back streets
Show me the back streets, mmm, yeah
 where people walkin' side by side
Without knowing each other's name
 and soul is the only thing you need
To join right in and swing
Where people stick together
One for all and all for one
Where they don't care how much money you got
As long as you're havin' fun
So, show me the back street
Show me the back streets
Show me the back streets, come on
Show me the back street, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 mmm 
 bein' a stranger in any town
Is a very lonesome thing
 but if I find the back streets of any town
I know I'll find a friend
So, show me the back street
Show me the back streets
Show me the back streets, baby
Show me the back street
 show me  show me the back street
 baby  come on and show me
 show me  the back streets, baby
 Mmm 
 yeah  I know that  that's where it will be
 Mmm
