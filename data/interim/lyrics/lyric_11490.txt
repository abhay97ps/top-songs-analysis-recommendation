Memories
Precious memories
Of a love so true
That's all I have left of you
Fantasies
Crazy fantasies
Girl, of you and me
And the time that we shared as one
Whoa, oh
The world was so simple and wonderful
It was a reflection of our special love and it was beautiful
Oh, oh
But you finally said goodbye
And left me with nothing but pictures on my mind
Memories
Precious memories
Girl, of happy days
And the love that waits for you
Won't you come back, baby
Fantasies
Crazy fantasies
Of a love that we made
I know it'll never fade away
Oh, oh
The world was so simple and wonderful
It was a reflection of our special love and it was beautiful
Oh, oh
But you finally said goodbye
And left me with nothin' but pictures on my mind
Oh, memories
Precious memories
Of a love so true
That's all I have left of you, whoa, whoa
Memories
Precious memories
Whoa, those memories
Precious memories
Memories
Precious memories
Whoa, those memories
Precious memories

Whoa, those memories
