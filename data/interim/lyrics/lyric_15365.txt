I knew that when I saw her
That my life would soon move over from the fast lane
Gone would be the days of all my drinkin' and my carrying on
But when I settled down
The party king uncrowned
This stubborn memory hadn't faded
Too many dumb mistakes
And all the grief it makes
Left nothing else to be debated
And if you say that you understand then you're lyin'
But if you figure that I'm alright now I can't deny it
Baby's comin' back
Baby's comin' back
So I'm on my best behavior
I can't take it anymore
I just woke up on the floor today
I've long run out of my last chances but she's on her way
If I had a dollar
For every single time I fought her
I'd buy a handgun 
But that couldn't shoot away
The bullseye that she made on my heart
And if I sound like a beaten man well I guess so
But on her way is the sweetest prize and I can't let go
Baby's comin' back
Baby's comin' back
So I'm on my best behavior
I can't take it anymore
I just woke up on the floor today 
I've long run out of my last chances but she's on her way
What I told her on the telephone was that I'd been so bad
I wouldn't blame her if she mowed down these wild oats I'd sown
But when she said she'd give me one more chance
I said knock three times when you arrive
Baby's comin' back
Baby's comin' back
So I'm on my best behavior
I can't take it anymore
I just woke up on the floor today 
Baby's comin' back, my darlin'
Baby's comin' back this evenin'
I've long run out of my last chances but she's on her way
