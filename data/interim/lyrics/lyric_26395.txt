Ah, hey, yeah
I know I be on some bullshit
Know I be driving you crazy
But I know you love how I whip it
You can only stay mad for a minute
So come here and give me some kisses
You know I'm very delicious
You know I'm very impatient
Might change my mind, so don't keep me waiting
I just wonder, baby, if you're gonna stay
Even if, one day, I lose it and go crazy
I know this shit kinda heavy
I just wanna tell you directly
So, boy, let me know if you ready
Are you down? What's up?
Are you down? What's up?
Are you down?
Are you down?
Are you down?
Are you down?
Are you down? Mmm
You know you be on some bullshit 
Act so possessive and crazy 
But I know that's just 'causе you love me
And you ain't scared to show mе your ugly
And maybe that's just how it's supposed to be
I'm the release, you the dopamine
And you wonder, baby, if I'm gonna stay
Even if one day, you lose it and go crazy
I know this shit kinda heavy 
Just wanna ask you directly 
Boy, let me know if you ready
Are you down? What's up? 
Are you down? What's up? 
Are you down?
Are you down? 
Are you down? 
Are you down? 
Are you down? 
Six thirty 
Down like six thirty 
Down like sunsets 
Down like my head on your chest 
Down like six thirty 
Down like six thirty 
Down like my foot on the gas, skrrt, skrrt
Down like six thirty, yeah
What you gon' do when I'm bored
And I wanna play video games at 2 AM?
What if I need a friend? Will you ride 'til the end?
Am I enough to keep your love?
When I'm old and stuff, will you still have a crush?
Are you down? What's up?
Are you down? What's up?
Are you down? 
Are you down?
Are you down?
Are you down? 
Are you down? 
Six thirty 
Down like six thirty 
Down like sunsets 
Down like my head on your chest 
Down like six thirty 
Down like six thirty 
Down like my foot on the gas, skrrt, skrrt
Down like six thirty, yeah
