"Bright light n' big city"
Bright light, big city, gone to my baby's head
Whoa, bright light, an big city, gone to my baby's head
I tried to tell the woman
But she don't believe a word I said
It's all right, pretty baby
 need my help someday
Whoa, it's all right, pretty baby
Gonna need my help someday
Ya' gonna wish you had a-listened
To some a-those things I said
Go ahead, pretty baby
A-honey, knock yourself out
Oh go ahead, pretty baby
Honey, knock yourself out
I still love ya baby
Cause you don't know what it's all about
Bright light, a big city
They went to my baby's head
Oh, the bright light, the big city
They went to my baby's head
I hope you remember
A-some of those things I said
