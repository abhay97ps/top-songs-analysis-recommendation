Woo!
Y'all already know who I am? Right?
Mustard on the beat, ho
Let's go
Uh , no Master P 
Ten bad bitches and they after me 
One bad bitch look like a masterpiece 
Lookin' for a dunk, like a athlete 
Big drip, what you call it? 
Ice chain, pure water 
You got the cash, but can't afford it 
You got the bag, but can't afford it 
Give me the beat, I ride it like a jetski 
So many bad bitches they harassin' me 
They like me 'cause I rap and be with the athletes 
Stop askin' me , I know they mad at me 
Hop in the coupe, then I slide like it's Vaseline 
West coast 6-4 jump like a trampoline 
Take a brick out, put it on a triple beam 
I'm not from Canada, but I see a lot of tings 
Dismantle her, I know how to handle her 
Light the candle up, make you put a banner up 
Toss a 50 up, make 'em tear the club up 
Took your bitch out the game, I had to sub her 
Uh , no Master P 
Ten bad bitches and they after me 
One bad bitch look like a masterpiece 
Lookin' for a dunk, like a athlete 
Big drip, what you call it? 
Ice chain, pure water 
You got the cash but can't afford it 
You got the bag but can't afford it 
Offset!
Pimpin' ain't easy, make her open up and eat it 
Stars in the ceilin' and my seats, they Tempur-Pedic 
I see them niggas watchin' and they plottin', tryna sneak me 
I can't hit a thot, can't trust a thot, they tellin' secrets 
Big bank take lil' bank, lil' nigga 
Catch him down bad, that nigga cry a whole river 
Nawf on my back, I'm takin' care of the whole village 
Somebody got shot, what you talkin' 'bout, Willis? 
In the lobby with a brick, I'm Ricky Bobby with your bitch
I go Lawrence with the fit, in the 'Rari with no tint 
I'm from the trench, I got the dirty money rinsed 
He was poppin' so I popped and prayed to God, repent 
Uh , no Master P 
Ten bad bitches and they after me 
One bad bitch look like a masterpiece 
Lookin' for a dunk, like a athlete 
Big drip, what you call it? 
Ice chain, pure water 
You got the cash but can't afford it 
You got the bag but can't afford it
T-Takeoff, no limit to the money 
I picked the gang up, took a flight across the country 
I tipped the waitress, told her, "Keep the ones comin'"
Hit the store to get some Backwoods and left the Wraith runnin', fuck it
Lookin' like they plottin', but we already on it 
In the lab with Celine like that bag that she wanted 
A lot of tings, ass bustin' out them jeans, make you want it 
Make you wanna spend a 50, hit the scene with her, don't it? 
Whole team full of queens, gotta keep their eyes on me 
It's a snake in disguise, prolly wanna slide on me 
I bet they ride on 'em when I put that prize on 'em 
Ten bad bitches, rotate 'em, got five of 'em 
Uh , no Master P 
Ten bad bitches and they after me 
One bad bitch look like a masterpiece 
Lookin' for a dunk, like a athlete 
Big drip, what you call it? 
Ice chain, pure water 
You got the cash but can't afford it 
You got the bag but can't afford it
