Sometimes you've got to take the heat
If you're going to walk down on the mean street
Take the heat and you see it through
Because sometimes it comes down to
Do what you got to
Sometimes it goes right down to the wire
And you might have to walk through the fire
Walk on, boy all the way through
Sometimes it just comes down to
Do what you got to do
Well, there's people that'll tell you
It's just no use
And there's people that'll tell you
That you're going to lose
People that'll tell you
Anything you're going to listen to
Do what you got to do
Someday they're going to call your name
They'll come looking for some one to blame
What's your name, boy
Hey, you just tell them true
Because they can't take the truth from you
So do what you got to do
Well, they'll call you a hero or a traitor
But you'll find out that, sooner or later
Nobody in this world is going to do it for you
Do what you got to do
There is nobody in this world
That's going to do it for you
Do what you got to do
