Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' 
Sippin' on purp, feelin' like the Barre Baby 
Whatever I downed, it got me goin' crazy 
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy 
I was hot as hell out in the heat 
Then a storm came in and saved my life
Head up to the sky, down on my knees 
Out of nowhere, you came here to save the night
In the nighttime 
Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' 
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy 
Niggas femalin', they excellin' 
Are they intellin'? 
We propellin', up top with Ellen, uh 
Kill the jealous with propane repellent
Got me goin' crazy 
On tour, we'll tell 'em, we brought the section 
They keep on callin' up, it's getting hectic 
Like we projected
So we cut the plug, he's interjected 
Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' 
Sippin' on purp, feelin' like the Barre Baby 
Whatever I downed, it got me goin' crazy 
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy 
I was hot as hell out in the heat 
Then the storm came in and saved my life
Head up to the sky, down on my knees 
Out of nowhere, you came here to save the night
In the nighttime 
Got me goin' crazy
Okay, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay
Just to drown out all these thoughts, I tried all kind of things
If I take you to my past, you will be traumatized
Got a thousand kids outside that's tryna come alive
'99, took AstroWorld, it had to relocate
Told the dawgs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before, no car notes, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, that's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the league
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nosebleeds 
And she hit that booger sugar 'til her nose bleed 
Bounce that shit forever, she on both knees
She was talkin' 'bout forever, got a whole week 
Plus she know my baby mama is a trophy
She be throwin' up them B's, feel like we both bleed
She keep my dick jumpin' up, feel like I'm Moby
I'm way too gold for this beef, feel like I'm Kobe, yeah
This right here is astronomical
I see you picked up all my ways, I feel responsible
They tryna say that all my problems is improbable
They keep itchin' at my spirit, I'm diabolical
Ya feel me?
