She may not be the best lookin' woman
I ever did see
Nor have the charms of the ladies
Of high society
But the woman's got soul
Worth all money and gold
And all the love that I have belongs
To the woman with soul
Now I'm just a regular fellow
I don't need much
I don't need a Cadillac car
Or diamonds and such
But the woman that I hold
She's got to have soul
And then I'm richer than the richest gold
If the woman's got soul
Well, I don't need a woman
That's got a whole lotta class
Because class in a woman
Don't mean she's gonna last
I need the kind of woman
That when I hold she fits so tight, yeah
Oh, and when she throws it on me
I give in without a fight
The woman's got soul
Worth all money and gold
And then I'm richer than the richest gold
If the woman's got soul
If the woman's got soul
