Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go
Now ain't that just like me?
Following you around
You know that I love you
I love you
I just can't put you down
Don't tell anybody, honey
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall
All the King's horses and all the King's men
They couldn't put him back again
Now ain't that just like me?
Crackin' up over you
You know that I love you
I love you
Nothin' else I can do
Well, shake it up now
Hey, diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle
Now the cow jumped over the moon
The little dog came out the best of all
And the dish ran away with the spoon
Now ain't that just like me
Tryin' to run away with you
You know that I love you
I love you
Don't you wanna love me too?
Don't you wanna love me too?
Don't you wanna love me too?
Don't you wanna love me too?
Don't you wanna love me too?
Don't you wanna love me too?
Don't you wanna love me too?
Don't you wanna love me too?
Don't you wanna love me too?
Don't you wanna love me too?
Don't you wanna love me too?
Don't you wanna love me too?
Don't you wanna love me too?
Don't you wanna love me too?
Don't you wanna love me too?
Don't you wanna love me too?
Don't you wanna love me too?
