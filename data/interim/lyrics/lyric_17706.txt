Don't wanna make a scene
I really don't care if people stare at us
Sometimes I think I'm dreamin'
I pinch myself just to see if I'm awake or not 
Is it real, what I feel? Could it be
You and me 'til the end of time
Never part, take my heart, hold it tight
It's true love, you know I gotta be
I gotta be the one you touch 
Baby, I gotta be the one you love 
I gotta be the one you feel
And I gotta be the one to fill your life with sunshine
I gotta be the one you know
'Cause I will always love you so 
I gotta be the one you need
I'm just tellin' you that I gotta be
I picture you and me
Startin' a life together, we could be
We'll take this vow to love one another
Make this thing a reality, ooh
Is it real, what I feel? Could it be 
You and me 'til the end of time
Never part, take my heart, hold it tight
It's true love, I just gotta be
I gotta be the one you touch 
Baby, I gotta be the one you love 
I gotta be the one you feel 
And I gotta be the one to fill your life with sunshine 
I gotta be the one you know
'Cause I will always love you so 
I gotta be the one you need
I'm just tellin' you that I gotta be, oh
You make me whole, you make me right 
Don't ever wanna think about you leaving my life 
You make me whole, you make me right 
Don't ever wanna think about you leaving my life
You make me whole, you make me right 
Don't ever wanna think about you leaving my life 
You make me whole, you make me right 
Don't ever wanna think about you leaving my life
