6:30 in the morning
I'm in the middle of the sweetest dream
When I hear that alarm clock calling me
I wrestle with the feeling
That the day is starting way too soon
I hit the button just to buy a little time
To keep you in these arms of mine
For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
For another nine minutes
I love the way the sunlight
Dances on your perfect skin
Girl, I wish this night would never end
But we gotta get moving
You can't eat if you don't get paid
But I got us a better idea
Just pull up the covers and stay right here
For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
For another nine minutes
I hit the button just one more time
To keep you in these arms of mine
For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
Oh yeah, for another nine minutes, let the world wait
Who's gonna care if we're a little bit late
This is my dream and I'm gonna stay in it
Oh, for another nine
Another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
Another nine minutes, let the world wait
Who's gonna care if we're a little bit late
 Let the world stop
 Don't worry about the clock
 Ooooh, yeah
 Who's gonna care if we're a little bit late
