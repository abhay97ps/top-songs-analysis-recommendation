Whoa, Black Betty 
Whoa, Black Betty 
Black Betty had a child 
The damn thing gone wild 
She said "I'm worryin' outta mind" 
The damn thing gone blind 
I said oh, Black Betty 
Whoa, Black Betty 
Whoa, Black Betty 
Whoa, Black Betty 
She really gets me high 
You know that's no lie 
She's so rock steady 
And she's always ready 
Whoa, Black Betty 
Whoa, Black Betty 
Get it!
Whoa, Black Betty 
Whoa, Black Betty 
She's from Birmingham 
Way down in Alabam' 
Well, she's shakin' that thing 
Boy, she makes me sing 
Whoa, Black Betty 
Whoa, Black Betty
Bam-ba-laaam, yeah, yeah
