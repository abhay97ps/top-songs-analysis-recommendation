People say that
Once you come to Rome
Rome will be your
Home forever after
Even though you're away
You may leave but
Rome will never leave you
Rome will always be
Inside your heart
You'll close your eyes
And see the seven hills
In your heart, you'll hear
The songs and laughter
Every dream leads to Rome
You may leave but
Rome will never leave you
Rome will always be
Inside your heart
When they call the last all ashore
And it's time to say farewell
From a Church that
Stands forever more
You will hear Cathedral bells
And the bells will say
A happy voyage home
Hurry back to Rome
It's always waiting
Don't forget when we part
You may leave but
Rome will never leave you
Rome will always be
Inside your heart
Rome will always be
Inside your heart
