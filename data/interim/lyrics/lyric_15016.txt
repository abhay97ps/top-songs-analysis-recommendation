Love begins
And when love ends
Someone wins
When you lose
It's not your choice
You cannot chose
But I've got to let you know
You've got to feel my joy
I can't let you go
'Cause you were my only boy
I've got to have the say
'Cause of what we had before
Can't let you walk away
You can't walk out of that door
You can't get away
No, you can't get away
You can't get away
You can't get away
No, you can't get away
You can't get away
Deep inside
It feels so warm
Don't let it die
Love was good
Never bad
Just like it should
But I've got to let you know
You've got to feel my joy
I can't let you go
'Cause you were my only boy
I've got to have the say
'Cause of what we had before
Can't let you walk away
You can't walk out of that door
You can't get away
No, you can't get away
You can't get away
You can't get away
No, you can't get away
You can't get away
I'll do anything I can
Just to have you back again
You know you're the only boy
I need you more than just a toy
I'll do anything I can
To have you in my arms again
You know you're the only boy that I love
You can't get away
No, you can't get away
You can't get away
You can't get away
No, you can't get away
You can't get away
You can't get away
No, you can't get away
You can't get away
You can't get away
No, you can't get away
You can't get away
You can't get away
No, you can't get away
I need you, baby
You can't get away
No, you can't get away
You can't get away
You can't get away
No, you can't get away
