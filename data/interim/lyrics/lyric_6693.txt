No brakes, running at 'em, full steam coming at 'em
If they hate they gunnin' at 'em
No one can stop us now
No one can stop us now
Got my whole team on it, go 'head, scheme on it
No one can stop us now
No one can stop us now

Uh
I'm on a mission to get rich quicker
We did it all up on our own and now I'm that nigga
Top five in the city, but they ain't get the picture
But fuck it, life's a bitch, my nigga, and I'ma lift her
Over my shoulder, sister, show you I can hold her
All up on my own, homie, check out my composure, but
No one can stop us, man, that's just nonsense
We got it locked, to see us you need binoculars
We in the cloud, smoking loud with your bitch
Got her doing things that'd make you feel sick
And 'cause I'm balling like LeBron I'm the first pick
But we gon' pass it like batons when 
Lyrically extortion, these other  forfeit
Man, I be shitting on you rappers only kicking game
Don't make me trigger happy rapper, 'cause I'm good with aim
So tell them other rappers chill 'fore I say they name

My heart is pure passion, that fire and desire
For this plush lifestyle, Iâ€”I never tire
 wired up, like a 
You can't blow my buzz, no mama, my altitude is too above sky
Way beyond your reach, I'm so fly
I reside with the stars, I belong right where I am
These niggas don't deserve to be where I am
I knock 'em out of space like the Rebel Alliance
Shawty on my Darth Vader helmet
She can't help it, she attracted to my force, I apply it
I am quiet, stormin' on these niggas, thunder and lightning
When them pipes get , it's gon' pour blood for life, man
'Til death do me, I'm gon' hold down the fortress
And I'ma do it like Big Sean and  
 my verse be like 
Know these niggas all starvin' to death so I deliver 
No brakes, running at 'em, full steam coming at 'em
If they hate they gunnin' at 'em
No one can stop us now
No one can stop us now 
Got my whole team on it, go 'head, scheme on it 
No one can stop us now 
No one can stop us now 
I'm from where
Hood niggas and  get treated like The Beatles
My verses should be in churches, or synagogues, or cathedrals
The way I'm reaching the people, it's a war out here
Threw torpedos for mi amigos, headstrong, who want some of Deebo?
Run this shit, I be spitting them verbal hurdles that hurt 'em
I be owning the track, while you niggas going in circles
I serve as the realest when it's a matter of spitting lyrics
They fear us, no penicillin can cure me, spitting this sickness
They listen, turn into sinners, got 'em feeling true conviction
Got 'em saying "Goddamn" like I started a new religion
Quite simple, I'm clowning you, watered down is why you drowning
Astounding the game is to be sold, not told 
Look, I'm positive that the hottest shit is what I'ma spit
Like the kettle when the pot is lit, waitin' on that new Connor shit
Well, here it is, another one, we never miss
Shit, they can't stop us now, word to Prodigy and Gliss, gone
No brakes, running at 'em, full steam coming at 'em
If they hate they gunnin' at 'em
No one can stop us now
No one can stop us now
Got my whole team on it, go 'head, scheme on it
No one can stop us now 
No one can stop us now 
We living life lawless, thinking 'bout life's losses
Hoppin' out them white Porsches, rims is like bright saucers
These bitches making nice offers, but I'm on some other shit
Baby, this the mothership, words can't even muster it, I run these pricks
Stuntin' quick, 'cause you know them two broad 
Got 'em handlin' my stick like a foosball game
I'm on that bullshit, call me call Luol Deng
My homie got a full clip if ever you all playin'
Got me prayin' to the higher power when I light the sour
It's caskets for you MCs, so price the flowers
I might devour all these cowards if they scour
Killin' 'em with my dreams got 'em sour
Bitch, I'm countin' paper by the hour, it's time to lock it down
 young  y'all can't stop us now
So get your money up, quit with the reckless talk
I leave you dummies stuck, this ain't luck, we next to ball
Yeah
No brakes, running at 'em, full steam coming at 'em
If they hate they gunnin' at 'em
No one can stop us now
No one can stop us now
Got my whole team on it, go 'head, scheme on it
No one can stop us now
No one can stop us now
Yeah
Who gon' stop me? Who gon' check me?
Let me load this Taurus, I be at your ass directly
No bullshit, shoot your ass directly
In your ass cheek if you got the nuts to
Repeat what you said last week, ain't you the same nigga
That said I'm lame, nigga? You wish I would, you wish you could
And then I came, nigga, on your damn block
With my top dropped, your bitch a wrestler
My dick  lock, go 'head, honey
Go 'head, honey, that nigga partner
Saw you do it, they scared, honey
I looked his partner eye to eye, told him, "Remember me
'Cause I'ma pop your partner top like he a Kennedy
JFK or Bobby, either way his ass a memory"
G nigga, send flowers to your funeral
Show up late and fuck your old lady in a urinal
Grind game criminal, fuck your subliminals
No brakes, running at 'em, full steam coming at 'em
If they hate they gunnin' at 'em
No one can stop us now
No one can stop us now
Got my whole team on it, go 'head, scheme on it
No one can stop us now
No one can stop us now
