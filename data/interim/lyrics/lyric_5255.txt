This is the house that Jack built, y'all
Remember this house
This was the land that he worked by hand
It was the dream of an upright man
There was the room that was filled with love
It was a love that I was proud of
This was a life of a love that he planned
On the love, the same old love
In the house that Jack built
Remember this house
There was the fence that held our love 
There was the gate that he walked out of
This is the heart that is turned to stone 
This was the house, but it ain't no home
This is the love that I once had
In a dream that I thought was love
In the house that Jack built
I'm gon' remember this house
Oh, what's the use of crying?
You know I brought it on myself
There's no denying
But it seems awful funny
That I didn't understand
Was it a house of an upright man, y'all?
Up on the hill there's a big plan still
In the house that Jack built
I'm gon' remember this house
Listen!
I got the house
I got the car
I got the rug
And I got the rack
But I ain't got Jack
And I want my Jack back!
I turned my back on Jack
He said he wasn't coming back
I turned my back on Jack
He said he wasn't coming back
Oh, Jack
You oughta come on back
Oh, Jack
You oughta come on back
To the one that you built
It's the same one that you built
You oughta come on back, Jack
Oh, come back
I didn't understand
Until I lost my upright man
Come on back, Jack
You oughta come on home now
