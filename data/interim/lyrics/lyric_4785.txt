Everything returns again
Both the laughter and the rain
She is livin' somewhere far away
Still I ask her in my lonely way to stay
 Desiree
Desiree, you know how it hurts me
Living alone through all the years
Nothing can hold the tears in me
Everything remains the same
Yet she answers not her name
Still if I could look beyond these skies
Standing here again before my eyes and see
 Desiree
La-la-la, la, la, la
La-la-la, la
La-la-la, la, la, la
La-la-la, la
Desiree, you know how it hurts me
Where do I run to?  Is it real?
Knowin' the pain I feel, so real
Desiree, you know how it hurts me
Livin' alone through all the years
Nothin' can hold the tears in me
La-la-la, la, la, la
La-la-la, la
La-la-la, la, la, la
La-la-la, la
La-la-la, la, la, la
La-la-la, la
La-la-la, la
