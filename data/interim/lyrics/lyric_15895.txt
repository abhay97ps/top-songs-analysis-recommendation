I thought
True love for me existed in fairy tales
And two hearts could never beat as one
And then one day
You smiled at me so sweetly
And changed my life completely
Now my life has just begun
He makes me say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
The boy makes me say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
My whole world has turned around
Feet planted firmly on the ground
Since he came
Came my way
And I know he’s here to stay
It’s amazing
The way my life is changing
I’m so happy since I found this special boy
I wanna shout it
And tell the world about it

For the he’s the one for me
He makes me say
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Feet planted firmly on the ground
Since he came
Came my way
And I know he’s here to stay
You know I never felt this way before
I’m not playing, really
Sometimes boys plays so many games
You know what I’m talking about
But this boy he’s different
