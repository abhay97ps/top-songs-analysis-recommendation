Uh
Uh
Gettin' high in the skybox, I can see it 
Hot spot and it's plushed out, and it's lit, yeah 
Screwed, chopped, hmm, Gucci socks, got 'em drippy 
Fuck the cops, we can't be stopped, just admit it
Hey , hey , hey 
Put some diamonds in Chrome Hearts lens
Bought a new Benz, lost some more friends
Stretchin' my hands, money all in
Fuckin' her friend, break her in bed
Hundred in tens, count it in yens
Trust in God thin, keep a FN
I gotta go , I gotta spend
I drove a boat, I'll drive again
Ain't got no note, I ain't got no rent
I am a goat, I am a man 
We in the low, we smokin' dope 
We keep it close, you with the folks 
Give him a dose , give me some throat
Lil' bitty ho, you already know 
Bitch, we the topic, the sauce for the toppings, you know that they copyin' you, woah 
They cleanin' and moppin', these bitches, they hoppin', I couldn't fall out with the bro, uh
Hotter than Taki, I like it, I cop it, ain't nobody stoppin' the growth, uh 
Smoke Lodi Dodi, we sit in the lobby, we just rented out the whole floor, uh
Gettin' high in the skybox, I can see it 
Hot spot and it's plushed out, and it's lit, yeah 
Screwed, chopped, hmm, Gucci socks, got 'em drippy 
Fuck the cops , we can't be stopped, just admit it 
Paint the town , and slime committed 
Bloodhound , mmh, cold hard Crippin' 
Best part , we got all the vibes with it 
Head start , you can't catch up, so forget it 
That's no cap, I'm in the 'Ghini 
This really rap, this ain't a gimmick 
I had to trap, now I got plenty
I'm in the castle fuckin' a genie 
I popped a capsule, she wanna wrassle 
I done got tackled, drunk on the Henny 
Turned to a saddle, I had to handle 
I'm 'bout to smack 'em both on the fanny 
I put four twelves in the V12 , my Benz truck startin' to rattle 
She say she smell I'm doin' well, when I wanna fuck, it don't matter 
Bitch, I'm a shark, I'm not a whale, lean in my cup and my bladder 
I got it on lock like I'm in jail, soon as they buck, they gettin' splattered 
I'm 'bout to drop and no, I cannot flop, climbin' straight to the top like a ladder 
Niggas play tough and they talk on the internet, but they ain't ever gon' hit 'em, uh
I took a loss and it made me a boss, like now look, I'm doin' better than ever 
They cause you to flop, Biscotti when I'm coughin', I'm tryna get higher than ever 
Gettin' high in the skybox, I can see it 
Hot spot and it's plushed out, and it's lit, yeah 
Screwed, chopped, hmm, Gucci socks, got 'em drippy 
Fuck the cops , we can't be stopped, just admit it 
Paint the town , and slime committed 
Bloodhound , mmh, cold hard Crippin'
Best part , we got all the vibes with it 
Head start , you can't catch up, so forget it
