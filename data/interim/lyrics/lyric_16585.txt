Somebody was spreading rumors
'Bout better days a-comin'
Why was I hummin'
As if I knew
One and the same
But I just whispered your name
Somebody was sayin' something
'Bout there being an end to tyranny
But when they asked me
What would I do
If that day came
I only whispered your name
Everyone got their own opinion
And protects their own dominion
No doubt for them it's true
But I tell them what I really believe
My only worry is protecting you, yeah
No one should ever be lonely
We'd all find somebody to care
Ask me if I dare
To answer who
Could carry that flame
I'd just whisper your name
Everyone got their own opinion
And protects their own dominion
No doubt for them it's true
But I tell them what I really believe
My only worry is protecting you
Nobody should ever be lonely
We'd all find someone to care, well
Ask me if I dare
To answer who
Could carry that flame
Carry that flame, yeah
Carry that flame
I'd just whisper your name
