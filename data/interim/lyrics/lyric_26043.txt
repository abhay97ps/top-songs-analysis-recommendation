Had to run that bitch back
I swear, once they see where a nigga come from
All of this shit that you had to go through, bruh
They don't understand
Young nigga from the bottom of the map
Came up riding with the strap, iron on his lap
One false move, get whacked
Got the whole hood on his back
And it's just like that
For my niggas trapped in the trap
Pray to God we all make it back, pray we all make it back
Gotta pray we all make it back
And I know it's raw that I rap
But a street nigga first
Tell the crackers free Mac Deezy
Ma, look at your son, I'm on TV
They didn't believe me
Nigga went and got it off the greezy
It's hard, but I make it look easy, a crazy achievement
Won't really fuck with no rappers
All these niggas hustling backwards
Misguiding  the youth
But long as I know the truth
That's another subject for after
And I'm riding in the Rover
12 keep on trying to pull me over
Asking a nigga if I stole it, I bought it, I own it
I remember walking to school
Catching the bus early morning, like, Ma, I ain't going
I was in the hallways roaming
But I still got my diploma, I got my diploma
Went to school all twelve years just to get a job selling donuts, man, that's crazy
I ain't with the minimum waging
I ain't with the modern day slavery
The fuck is you saying?
Told the crackers, "Fuck you, pay me"
Had to tell 'em, "Fuck you, pay me"
It's back to the block
Well, I guess it's back to the block
In the streets running 'round playing hooky 
And I ain't never sold no crack, but I'm so street, I can cook it
And I know it's hard to find a way
But you're bound to see brighter days
A million dollars can't change me, nigga
'Cause hard times made me, nigga
A hard grind saved me, nigga
I got it off the pavement, nigga
I got it off the pavement, my nigga
Young nigga from the bottom of the map
Came up riding with the strap 
Young nigga got the hood on his back
He got the whole hood on his back, yeah
Didn't think you'd be who you are, my nigga
Didn't think you'd take it this far, my nigga 
You like the greatest, you like the greatest to me
You like the greatest, you like the greatest to me
Give a fuck what they saying, you like the greatest to me, yeah
You like the greatest, you like the greatest to me
You like the greatest, you like the greatest to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fuck what they saying, you like the greatest to me, yeah
'Cause a nigga built off this shit, bruh, this shit in me, bruh, for real
Ayy, free C5, man, grrah
We ain't forget about you, my nigga
Grindin', baby
