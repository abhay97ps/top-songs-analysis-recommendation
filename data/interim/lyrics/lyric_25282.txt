Ugh, every bitch I'm fuckin' say they only fuckin' me
I even bought you diamonds, put you in that double C
The way you love the game, you couldn't be in love with me
I work too hard for my name to let a bitch put mud on me
So how can I trust you? 
When all the rich niggas fucked you 
Make you my baby, I'd love to 
You was a dime, but I dubbed you 
When I first bagged you that shit had me excited
Swimming in that pussy, girl, I swear there's nothing like it
I got plans to cut you off, I know that you won't like it
I knew that it would come to this, I seen it like a psychic
Turned you to a savage 
I won't forget you, you a bad bitch 
I set you up so you could level up 
But you was used to being average 
Jumpin' on jets, you was caught up in the life
They gassed you on Instagram, you caught up in the hype
A ho gon' be a ho, so ain't no use for no advice
When you crossed me, you lost me, can't let you cross me twice
I almost fell in love with a thottie 
My dawg said "You got too many bodies" 
Girl, that pussy had me like a zombie 
I gotta pour out my feelings that's inside me, yeah
What happened in the dark is gon' come to the light 
Magic from the start, you was fuckin' me right 
Treat me like a king baby talk to me nice 
You fucking with a ball player and now you acting bougie
Seen you out in traffic you act like you never knew me
I just bust out laughing when I seen with you that goofy 
Savage for that money, you like Ginger from the movie, ooh
I almost fell in love with a ho
I still dream of me fuckin' you slow
Ass so fat all the stuff from the back
I still watch all our old videos
And I still hear that pussy callin' 
It's so wet, it's slippery, it let me fall in
And from the way you treated me, almost went all in 
Had to check your mileage and I started stallin' 
'Cause relationships turn into situationships
I know you don't wanna hear this player shit, but baby I'm made for this
You made your bed, you gotta lay in it
My heart can't play with this 
Gotta save myself before I try to save a bitch 
I ain't been cuffing on no hoes and I ain't gon' start
Had to Patek my wrist, protect my heart 
Had to Patek my wrist, protect my heart
Because this cold game left my heart cold, now I promise it ain't my fault
I almost fell in love with a thottie 
My dawg said "You got too many bodies" 
Girl, that pussy had me like a zombie 
I gotta pour out my feelings that's inside me, yeah
What happened in the dark is gon' come to the light 
Magic from the start, you was fuckin' me right 
Treat me like a king baby talk to me nice 
Ugh, I gotta keep a vest on my heart 
You the reason the good women got it hard 
Shit, we was good until our feelings got involved
That's when I did my homework and then I really got involved, oh
Oh, and I don't know how I'ma go 'bout it
Now a nigga coldhearted, baby, nobody
Get this hard, you suck the soul out me
Found out you a whole thottie
And you got a whole lotta bodies, nobody
No, you let what we had die young 
And that's word to Lil Roddy 
Soon as I thought I got one, I was like
I almost fell in love with a thottie 
My dawg said "You got too many bodies" 
Girl, that pussy had me like a zombie 
I gotta pour out my feelings that's inside me, yeah
What happened in the dark is gon' come to the light 
Magic from the start, you was fuckin' me right 
Treat me like a king baby talk to me nice
