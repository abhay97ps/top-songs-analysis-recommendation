Capaldi
When I said I needed you, did you think it was
Just a way to get to you 'cause I was feeling lost ?
You said something I didn't understand
But I felt something when you held my hand
It's all right, it's all right
Everyday when I wake up, sorrow is my friend
And everywhere I look I see those people who pretend
If you want my loving then it's all right
And if you want my loving you can have it tonight
And it's all right
Everywhere I'm walking in a prison made of wire
Thinking 'bout the way you move sets my heart on fire
There is no one else that turns me on
Thinking about you, lady, makes me so strong
It's all right, it's all right, yeah, it's all right
Don't you know it's all right ?
Baby, don't you know ?
Baby, don't you know ?
It's all right
Baby, itâ€™s all right
