You give your hand to me, and then you say, "Hello"
I can hardly speak, my heart is beating so
And anyone can tell, you think you know me well
But you don't know me
No, you don't know the one who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips, and wants to hold you tight
To you I'm just a friend, that's all I've ever been
But you don't know me
For I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart beat with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me, too
You give your hand to me, and then you say, "Goodbye"
I watch you walk away beside that lucky guy
You'll never, never know the one that loves you so
No, you don't know me
For I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart beat with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me, too
You give your hand to me, and then you say, "Goodbye"
I watch you walk away, beside that lucky guy
You'll never, never know the one that loves you so
No, you don't know me
You'll never, never know the one that loves you so
No, you don't know me
