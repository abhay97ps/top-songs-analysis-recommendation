Two in the mornin', telephone rings
Somehow I knew it who was
Cause baby it's always the same old thing
When you need my love
You say it's over again and again
This time you've had enough
Girl, I know you've been fightin' with him
When you need my love
Oh I wish I could just say no
And get you out of my heart
It must be nice to have someplace to go
When your world falls apart
He'll call tomorrow with the same old lines
And you'll forget about us
And I'll be lonely until the next time
When you need my love
Chorus:
Oh I wish I could just say no
And get you out of my heart
It must be nice to have someplace to go
When your world falls apart
Now someday, someone's gonna love me true
And baby when she does
Then I wonder what you're gonna do
When you need my love
Yeah then I wonder what you're gonna do
When you need my love
When you need my love
When you need my love
What are you gonna do
Ohhhhh
