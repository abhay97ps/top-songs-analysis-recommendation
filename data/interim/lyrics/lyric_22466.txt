Ripping my heart was so easy, so easy
Launch your assault, now, take it easy
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
One word and it's over
Ripping through like a missile, ripping through my heart
Rob me of this love
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
And it's over
Love your ego, you won't feel a thing
Always number one, the pen with a bent wrist, crooked king
Sign away our peace for your war
One word and it's over
Dropping your bombs, now, on all we've built
How does it feel now to watch it burn, burn, burn?
Raise your weapons, raise your weapons
And it's over
Ripping through like a missile, ripping through my heart
Rob me of this love
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
And it's over
How does it feel now
To watch it burn, burn, burn?
Ripping my heart was so easy, so easy
Launch your assault, now, take it easy
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
One word and it's over
Ripping through like a missile, ripping through my heart
Rob me of this love
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
And it's over
Love your ego, you won't feel a thing
Always number one, the pen with a bent wrist, crooked king
Sign away our peace for your war
One word and it's over
Dropping your bombs, now, on all we've built
How does it feel now to watch it burn, burn, burn?
Raise your weapons, raise your weapons
And it's over
