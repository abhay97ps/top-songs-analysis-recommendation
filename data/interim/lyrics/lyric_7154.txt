Quit my job, ain't got no money
Seems I have to leave this town
Packed my bags, run to the station
Board the train thats eastward bound
Tell Mama
And all the folks back home
Sometimes a man just feels
He's got to make it alone
Tell Mama
Why I'm leaving so soon
Because this life I live
Has got me sick through and through
Nothing to do, thats why I had to go
Seemed no use in hanging round
I can't stop now, the tickets in my hand
Board the train thats eastward bound
Tell Mama
And all the folks back home
Sometimes a man just feels
He's got to make it alone
Tell Mama
Why I'm leaving so soon
Because this life I live
Has got me sick through and through
Quit my job, ain't got no money
Seems I have to leave this town
