Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
He's good
He's good to me
And that's all I care about
Don't you tell me my baby's just a playboy
Don't you tell me my baby's just a playboy
I won't listen to a single word you say
Don't you tell me my baby's just a playboy
He's true
He's true to me
So, girl, you better shut your mouth
But not when he's kissin' me
Sure he's crazy
Crazy about me, oh, yeah
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
He's good
He's good to me
And that's all I care about
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
He's true
He's true to me
So, girl, you better shut your mouth
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
