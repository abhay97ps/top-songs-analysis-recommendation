Bitch, I'm smokin' gas in my chambers like it's the *********
We're sorry, your lyric could not be completed because—
Ayy, you Lil Darkie, nigga?
And we want to suppress your opinion fascistically
Take away the first amendment
All hail censorship, all hail our feelings
My God is realer than yours, He says what I do is right
That I should fight if Heaven pours
I am very, very, sorry, my apologies, for comin' off so harshly
Impart me, second chance, so I can dance the way you want me
You Nazi, got me, take a lot more than that to top me
Soft ain't what I'm made of, you're the one actin' like Adolf
Cocky, way that you goose-steppin', way that you loose-lippin'
Talkin' 'bout who trippin', talkin' 'bout who to shove under the bus
And who all of us trust that we shouldn't
This just in, Lil Darkie is racist, spreadin' the message of Satan with faces
Blacker than any of us prolly are, but I'm still offended 'cause I'm a retard
He tryna be hard, we tryna be safe by makin' it hard for you to create
Niggas that heard of me fight and debate
I don't deserve not one word of the hate
Mind control, all my thoughts are mine to hold
All down in my spinal cord, bitch, this ain't my final form
I got no time for you puppets, take yo' opinion and shove it
I keep my spirit above it, I'm takin' criticism if it isn't ignorant
I'm not concerned with fittin' in, I hit it different
I'm a cartoon but niggas doin' more pretendin' than me
Bitches act offended, get banned on IG
You don't gotta be a hater, you don't like me
Why I keep a grin on my face, on my teeth
All these niggas mad they ain't eatin', like concentration camps
Cut yourself escapin' from leavin' over the nation fence
Most these niggas fakin', not workin', I'm puttin' them aside
Smoke until there's nothin' remainin', I call it genocide
Phoney ass niggas plottin', woah 
Fruity niggas actin' rotten, so 
On yo shit nigga, you not been, ho 
I ain't even think of stoppin', though 
Oh?
What's this? 
Hahahaha
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
I'ma fuck around and Timmy Turner to the tippy top 
I wonder if these niggas really grip these Glocks
Trippin' acid, lippin' flaccid dickin' 'til she give me top, 
Skippin' to the store, I got a red hood on
Salvia, we rippin' out a ten-foot bong
There's a bitch inside my house, she keep on sayin' she's in pain
Yeah, she's sittin' on my couch with burnin' needles in her brain
Divinorum in her veins, guess she was on Lexapro?
The combo made her go insane
She feel calmer on cocaine 
Don't rap for fame , bitch what you sayin'?
I'm Super Saiyan, you super plain 
I take my pain, make the music, plant a bomb, can't defuse it
I am calm, I am lucid, they bettin' on that he lose it
Never had it to start with, break you like usin' guitar pick
Constipated, always makin' that hard shit
Contemplated takin' niggas real far, shit
Things happen, niggas switch, you evolve with
Time movin', rhyme smoothin'
Stay focused you will shine through sin
Street tacos get some dimes, who's in?
Know a nigga threw the lime juice in
I know how to live , I know how to die too
You could jump off a buildin', eat mushroom for healin'
Put acid in your eyes too
I'ma fuck around and Timmy Turner to the tippy top 
I wonder if these niggas really grip these Glocks
Trippin' acid, lippin' flaccid dickin' 'til she give me top, 
Whippin' up my visions, humans listen to the shit I drop 
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, huh, yeah, huh
Yeah
Yeah, huh, yeah, huh
What goes around, comes around
Goes around, goes around, goes around, goes around, E
What goes around, goes around, goes around, goes around, uh
Spider gang shit 
Goes around uh, what you what 
Don't be afraid, step right up, step right up
Take your turn at the legendary wheel of karma
But remember that what goes around
Comes back around, goes back around to you 
What goes around, comes around
Goes around, comes around, goes around, come back to you, uh
My momma told me that was true, people remember like elephants do
People forget all the elements too
Livin' and breathin', succeedin' at music
At leadin' the crew with a passion these niggas ain't move
'Cause they crashin' and talent they rationin'
I'll get a bat, I might bash him in
Grippin' a blade and I'm slashin' him, happen to you
I pull up on 'em, no maskin', I'm smokin' that dope up in Lassen
With DRAIN THE SWAMP blastin', I'm cool
I'm on the beach up in Tahoe, packin' that THC inside a raw cone
I'll be happy when it’s all gone, Mary Jane answer whenever she called on
I had to fall down, I'm smokin' too much
Fold up a post-it, I'm chiefin' a blue crutch
I do not do Dutch, I don't do backwoods
Grab a leaf, only tobacco that smack good
I fucked that, I fucked that bitch in the Safeway
7am and I'm havin' a great day, uh
I'm puttin' on weight like I'm Tay-K
Anime rapper, you sound like a Beyblade
Anime rapper, you hard or you not though?
Sip on yo' Wok and the bars that you pop
Oh, you keep a Glock on yo' lap and it cocked
Or you grip yo' cock and you fap while you stalk hoes?
Niggas walk around in dark clothes
Bitch, I'm smokin' at the park, O's
Askin' questions like a narc, no, why you sittin' at the start? Go
Go, go, go, go, go
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Oh my, oh my 
P-P-Pussy boy g-get out my way, uh
I'll run up that check before I run any fades, uh
Killin' shit for fun but I ain't catchin' no case, uh
Chillin' in the sun, a villain catchin' some rays, uh
Le-Le-Legalize the fungi, nigga, I eat it anyway
It could start with one guy, nigga, the world got plenty fakes
It don't need another fire with my brothers in the street
They don't show no love, I sight the others, they look industry
Let 'em sleep, goodness me, tell me, what should this be?
Why you in my live talkin' shit? I ain't sayin' shit to you
Keep my pride on my hip, that's a weapon I can't lose
Peep my vibe or keep, zip your lips
Why won't you choose to-to love everybody
Bitch, how many times are you gonna ignore the signs and people's rhymes?
You niggas are retarded, he slid and left his .9
Yo' momma must have dropped yo' ass upon yo' spine
I feel like Rikki-Tikki-Tavi
We mobbin' through the lobby, that faggot tried to rob me
No ho, like D'Lo, bitch
I feel like Rikki-Tikki-Tavi
I think the copper saw me, but I ain't chain-link-hoppin'
'Cause I ain't see no shit
Niggas will believe whatever you tell 'em, if you tell 'em enough
Helpful when you sellin' some stuff, or startin' a war
They rotten at the heart, at the core
I'm plottin' to pour LSD in the reservoir
All over the floor, I'm bringin' psilocybin on tour
I'm hidin' the cure, for fixin' niggas, I'm very sure
Stop bein' depressed, step outside and puff out your chest
He made you the best, that's ever gonna jump out the nest
I'm a crushin' a pest, you rushin' to get up like you next
You failin' the test, impale yourself through one of your breasts
Somewhere on your chest
Your heart departs and leaves you with less
Now, look at this mess, bitch, pull yourself together, no rest
I feel like Rikki-Tikki-Tavi
I know that copper saw me
But I ain't chain-link-hoppin' 'cause I'm up in his whip
Stop 
Stop resisting , stop resisting 
Stop resisting 
Sometimes all you need to do is hop on the subway and go
Go
Let your brain leak out of your ears, yuh
Go insane, nigga, punch all your peers, ayy
Pick the kid up, nigga, wipe off your tears
We war-ready, I see you very clear
For the tribe, do it for the tribe, nigga, or 'cause you alive
Free what is inside, nigga, I know why you cry
There is somethin' vile, takin' people, ain't no lie
I know, we should smile bigger, because we will die
Momma, why we die? Tell me, momma, why we die?
I know why they hate me, because I will not be shy
I just wanna fly, Daedalus, I have to try
No, do not be a fool, Icarus, you flew too high
Son, move, get out of my way
He was just a boy, wanna play with the day
See him where he lay, now, see him where he lay
Don't succumb to ignorance or you will have to pay with your life
Play with a knife, you could filet what you write with
Stay outta fights, tryna spit or you tryna gang-bang
Pick a type, I don't wanna see no talented rappers dyin' to pipes
I won't front, nigga what you want?
I just wanna see you stunt on these hatin' ass sucker nigga cunts
Kick it punt, I don't fuck with runts, one-one-seven killin' grunts
They in Heaven when I hunt them I hit him then he...
Let his brain leak out of his ears, uh
Go insane, bitch, I'll punch all your peers, ayy
Pick the kid up, nigga, wipe off your tears
We war-ready, I see you very clear
Let your brain leak out of your ears, uh
Go insane, nigga, punch all your peers, ayy
Pick the kid up, nigga, wipe off your tears
We war-ready, if you not, why you here?
Go, go, go
One, two—, one, two, three, nigga
Bitch, I'm killin' everyone, bitch, I'm causin' a genocide
Fuck these rappin' niggas, they cappin', tap in, pretend to slide
Bitch, I'm in the field like a soldier, I'm makin' fuckin' moves
Made of paper, nigga, I'll fold ya, roll ya and tuck it smooth
Niggas wanna talk, I don't have the time
I be on the block, meditatin', makin' rhymes
Uh, you be hella hatin', got no cock, got no spine
There ain't no debatin', do not talk, make a line
Bi-Bi-Bitch, I keep it on me, like commie or an American
I ain't smokin' with you, but money could make me share it then
Sweeter than some honey and funny 'cause I ain't very tan
Still the darkest rapper, you slappin', I'm killin' every man
Huh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bih-bih-bih, bih, yeah, yeah
Bih-bih-bih, bih, yeah, yeah
Are you still offended? 
Let me know 
I care so much about how you feel
