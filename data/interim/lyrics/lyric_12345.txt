One day you're up
Next day you're down
She's got your head
Spinning around
That's love
It's happening all the time
You walk out the door
Head for the train
Then in a while
You're back again
That's love, you'll never change the world
Not in a million years
And I know that I could
Never live without you, girl
You stood by me all through the good times
And through the bad times
One gentle heart easily burned
After a lifetime
You still haven't learned
That's love, it's happening all the time
And I know that I could
Never live without you, girl
You stood by me all through the good times
And through the bad times
Young couple there
Going insane
Fussing and fighting
Then they make up again
That's love, it's happening all the time
You'll never change the world
You'll never change the world
No, no, no, no
You'll never change the world
You'll never change the world
You'll never change the world
You'll never change the world
