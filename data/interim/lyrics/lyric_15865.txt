Even through the darkest phase
Be it thick or thin
Always someone marches brave
Here beneath my skin
And constant 
Craving 
Has always 
Been 
Maybe a great magnet pulls
All souls to what's true
Or maybe it is life itself
That feeds wisdom to its youth
Constant 
Craving 
Has always 
Been 
Craving
Ah, constant craving
Has always been
Has always been
Constant 
Craving 
Has always 
Been 
Constant 
Craving 
Has always 
Been 
Craving
Ah, constant craving
Has always been
Has always been
Has always been
Always been
Always been
