"Look at the bargains over here, ladies..."
If I was your girlfriend
Would you remember
To tell me all the things you forgot when I was your man?
Hey, hey, when I was your man
If I was your best friend
Would you let me take care of you
And do all the things that only a best friend can, oh
Only best friends can
If I was your girlfriend
If I was your girlfriend
If I was your girlfriend
Would you let me dress you?
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
Not that you're helpless
But sometimes, sometimes
Those are the things that bein' in love's about
If I was your one and only friend
Would you run to me if somebody hurt you
Even if that somebody was me?
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
Please
If I was your girlfriend
Uh-ah, oooh-hoo-hoo
If I was your girlfriend
Would you let me wash your hair?
Could I make you breakfast sometime?
Or then, could we just hang out, I mean
Could we go to a movie and cry together?
'Cause to me, baby, that would be so fine
Baby can I dress you?
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
Listen girl, I ain't sayin you're helpless
But sometimes, sometimes
Those are the things that bein' in love's about
Sugar, do you know what I'm saying to you this evening?
Maybe you think I'm being
A little self-centered
But I, I said I want to be
All of the things you are to me
Surely, surely you can see
Is it really necessary for me to go out of the room just because you wanna undress?
I mean, we don't have to make children to make love
And we don't have to make love to have an orgasm
Your body's what I'm all about
Can I see you?
I'll show you
Why not?
You can think it's because I'm your friend I'll do it for you
Of course I'll undress in front of you!
And when I'm naked, what shall I do?
How can I make you see that it's cool?
Can't you just trust me?
If I was your girlfriend you could
Oh, yeah, I think so
Listen, for you naked I would dance a ballet
Would that get you off?
Then tell me what will!
If I was your girlfriend, would you tell me?
Would you let me see you naked then?
Would you let me give you a bath?
Would you let me tickle you so hard you'd laugh and laugh
And would you, would you let me kiss you there
You know down there where it counts
I'll do it so good I swear I'll drink every ounce
And then I'll hold you tight and hold you long
And together we'll stare into silence
And we'll try to imagine what it looks like
Yeah, we'll try to imagine what, what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try to imagine what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try
