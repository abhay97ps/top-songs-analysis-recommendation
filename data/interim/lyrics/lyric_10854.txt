She came down from Cincinnati
It took her three days on a train
Looking for some peace and quiet
Hoped to see the sun again
But now she lives down by the ocean
She's taking care to look for sharks
They hang out in the local bars
And they feed right after dark
Can't you feel them circling, honey?
Can't you feel them swimming around?
You got fins to the left, fins to the right
And you're the only bait in town
Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh-woah
You got fins to the left, fins to the right
And you're the only girl in town
She's saving up all of her money
Wants to hit it south in May
Maybe roll in the sand with a rock 'n roll man
Somewhere down Monserat Way
But the money's good, and the season
Helps to lighten up her load
Boys keep her high as the months go by
She's getting post cards from the road
Can't you feel them closing in, honey?
Can't you feel them schooling around?
You got fins to the left, fins to the right
And you're the only girl in town
Sailed off to Antigua
It took her three days on a boat
Looking for some peace and quiet
Maybe keep her dreams afloat
But now she feels like A remora
With the school still close at hand
Just behind the reef are the big white teeth
Of the sharks that can swim on the land
Can't you feel them circling, honey?
Can't you feel them schoolin' around?
You got fins to the left, fins to the right
And you're the only bait in town
You got fins to the left, fins to the right
And you're the only girl in town
