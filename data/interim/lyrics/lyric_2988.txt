When you feel that you
Can't make it all alone
Remember no one is big enough
To go it alone
Just ask the lonely
They know the hurt and pain
Of losing a love you can never regain
Just ask the lonely
The young and foolish laugh at love
So they run away...
Confident and sure that fate
Will bring another love their way
But ask the lonely
How vainly a heart can yearn
For losing a love that will never return
Just ask the lonely
They'll tell you
They'll tell you a story of sadness
A story too hard to believe
They'll tell you the loneliest one is me
Just ask the lonely
Ask me
I'm the loneliest one you'll see
I'm the loneliest one you'll see
