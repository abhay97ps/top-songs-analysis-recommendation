If the one you think is true
Ever turns his back on you
You've still got a place in my heart
If the years should make you cry
Don't go on and live a lie
You've still got a place in my heart
If I'm a fool to pray
That you come back someday
Then I'll know a million fools that love has made that way
And if every road you take
Proves you made a mistake
Then you've still got a place in my heart
Then I'll know only fools that love has made that way
And if every road you take
Proves you've made a mistake
Oh you've still got a place in my heart
You've still got a place in my heart
