Yeah, oh, oh
Yeah
Why you make it so complicated?
Off the drink, we concentratin'
I know you won't leave me hangin'
Smokin' weed out the container
We spend cash for entertainment
There's more where that came from, that's all I'm sayin'
It's me and you, and we makin' arrangements
It's you and me, and we makin' arrangements
Is it hot in here or is it just me?
I'm so high in here, been smokin' on this weed
Told 'em, "Go on, take a shot on three"
Told 'em, "Drinks is on me"
Yeah, the drinks are on me
I said, "Now go and take a shot on me"
Only drug a bitch is on is the tree
But I lasted ten rounds like a freak
Like a G
Get ready 
Now we're on 
I said I'm ready 
Hold the phone 
Get ready 
I am on one 
Where you be at? 
Later on 
Why you make it so complicated?
Off the drink, we concentratin'
I know you won't leave me hangin'
Smokin' weed out the container
We spend cash for our entertainment
There's more where that came from, that's all I'm sayin'
It's me and you and we makin' arrangements
It's you and me and we makin' arrangements
I'll keep it simple, baby
I'ma keep it simple with you, baby
You know I don't ever play no games
You know I don't ever complicate it
Got me feelin' some type of way
Concentratin', concentratin' on the way
You keep the rhythm

Indica be havin' me stuck 
You know just how to keep me up 
You know it, better believe it
