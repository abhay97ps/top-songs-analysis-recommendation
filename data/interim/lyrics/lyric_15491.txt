Rising high
In the morning and the night
Feeling low
Never knowing where you'll fall
Hypnotized
Nothing can make you feel this way
No way out
'Cause now you're trapped and can't go back
Why couldn't you come to me
Knowing I'll be there for you
Is love so strong, why can't you turn around
And look for me my baby
I love you
Don't do the things you do
My fallen angel
My heartbreak love
Make your body turn away
So give it up baby
So look at yourself now
Can't speak true words
Only deception looks your way
Deception looks your way
And so you're alone now
Turned away from friends
Look in the mirror and can't you see
So now can't you see my baby
Don't do the things you do
My fallen angel
My heartbreak love
Make your body turn away
So give it up baby
Why couldn't you come to me
Knowing I'll be there for you
Is love so strong, why can't you turn around
And look for me my baby
I love you
Don't do the things you do
My fallen angel
My heartbreak love
Make your body turn away
So give it up baby
Don't do the things you do
My fallen angel
My heartbreak love
Make your body turn away
So give it up baby
