There's no guarantee, that we'll see, tomorrow
Heaven only knows, how long we have
So there's no way I'll ever, for one second, let you wonder
Just how long my love for you will last
Till my last breath, till I'm called on high
Till the angels come, and I see the light
To the very end, till I give in
To the last beat of my heart
No, I can't swear, that I'll be here
For the rest of your life
But I swear I'll love you
For the rest of mine
Till my last breath, till I'm called on high
Till the angels come, and I see the light
To the very end, till I give in
To the last beat of my heart
No, I can't swear, that I'll be here
For the rest of your life
But I swear I'll love you
For the rest of mine
No, I can't swear, that I'll be here
For the rest of your life
But I swear I'll love you
For the rest of mine
