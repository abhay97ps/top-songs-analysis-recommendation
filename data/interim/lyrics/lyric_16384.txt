Nowadays you gots to walk the street and watch your back
'Cause brothers with the gats don't be knowing how to act
They always pull a Glock when somebody rocks a knot
And if they get shot they often snitch to the cops
Now tell me this ain’t living foul
She just had a baby child and she’s back to selling cracks vials
On the Ave cause she’s addicted to the fast cash
How long will that last before the cops be up in that ass?
But honey-dip don't wanna listen 'cause she’s in a position
That nobody gives a pot to piss in
Her life is stuck and filled with bad luck
So she fucks and fucks to earn another buck
She don't really care about pride
And she jumps into another ride then committing suicide
Aiyo, this goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang
This goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang
Aiyo, this goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang
This goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang
Times is getting hard, word is bond I swear God
I even got caught tryna steal from the junkyard
A born terror, a Rebel without a Pause
I never had a good Christmas, so who is Santa Claus?
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this little town you see clowns that wanna be down
So they get a Glock and lick shots to get props
And when shit rocks all you can hear is the shells drop
An old man got shot in a parking lot
In front of my building I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigger and tried to slide
And hide, but he got knocked by the homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live another day
Aiyo, this goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang
This goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang
Aiyo, this goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang
This goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang
Aiyo, get a load of this guy, you know the Mr. Hardy?
The one who talks about gats but ain't' busting nobody
He speaks that yang yang so we can just maintain
I'd blow him out the frame at his moms if he gangbang
But his rep is hi-tech in the projects
Foe was knuckle jacked, so he got mad respect
The niggas in hoodies packed up their loaded gats
Met up in the back so they could plan the attack
Wasn't hard to tell that these kids was no joke
They let the pistol smoke and their .9 was doper than coke
I seen it happen everyday where I live
I know a few bums, drug dealers, most of them fugitives
Aiyo, this goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang
This goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang
Aiyo, this goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang
This goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang
