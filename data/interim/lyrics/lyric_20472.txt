There was a time
I packed my dreams away
Living in a shell
Hiding from myself
There was a time
When I was so afraid
I thought I'd reached the end
Baby, that was then
I am made of more than my yesterdays
This is my now
And I am breathing in the moment
As I look around
I can't believe the love I see
My fears behind me
Gone are the shadows and doubt
That was then
This is my now
I had to decide
Was I gonna play it safe?
Well, but somewhere deep inside
I tried to turn the tide
And find the strength o take that step of faith
This is my now
And I am breathing in the moment
As I look around
I can't believe the love I see
My fears behind me
Gone are the shadows and doubt
That was then
This is my now
And I have a courage
Like never before, yeah
I settled for less
But I'm ready for more
Ready for more
This is my now
And I am breathing in the moment
As I look around
I can't believe the love I see
My fears behind me
Gone are the shadows and doubt
That was then
This is my now
And I am breathing in the moment
As I look around
I can't believe the love I see
My fears behind me
Gone are the shadows and doubt
That was then
This is my now
This is my now
