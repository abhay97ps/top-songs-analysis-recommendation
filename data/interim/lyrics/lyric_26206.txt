Them niggas gotta hear what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout 
Feel me, Lil' Z? 
On your set with some real shit, nigga 
I don't want none of that extra loud shit
This ain't none of that rainbow hair shit
Know what I'm sayin'? 
This the real streets shit, yeah, nigga
Fuckin' voice of the streets, man
It's like Jesus walkin' 
More like Christopher Walking, man 
Y'all know what's up 
I be in New York with the gangsters
Know a nigga that'll shoot you for a 'Tander 
If my opps is chillin' in the foreign 
Then my niggas shootin' up the Phantom 
I be in New York with the gangsters 
Know a nigga that'll shoot you for a 'Tander 
If my opps is chillin' in the foreign 
Then my niggas shootin' up the Phantom 
.44 got a kickback 
Click-clack, get back 
Shots at your rib pack 
Or you can get chin checked 
Them twirlin' niggas actin' up 
So niggas packed him up 
Brazy was actin' tough 
'Til niggas slapped him up 
Pop Smoke on top 
Niggas mad as fuck 
Six by six, big Benz on my wrist 
If you don't got your nails done, you are not it 
Automatically on the blocked list 
Niggas talkin' 'bout they guns , but never shot shit 
Might as well put a cap on it, all over with a chopstick 
Run up and I'm brandin' them, take a nigga shoppin' 
Reach and I'm branchin' it 'cause I don't know who watchin' 
It's a Ginger Ale and Henny day, eased up on the crème brûlée 
38's on the block , a nigga won't hesitate 
Had to move these bitches up  'cause they was in the way
I wouldn't want them to get shot by an enemy
I be in New York with the gangsters 
Know a nigga that'll shoot you for a 'Tander 
If my opps is chillin' in the foreign 
Then my niggas shootin' up the Phantom 
I be in New York with the gangsters 
Know a nigga that'll shoot you for a 'Tander 
If my opps is chillin' in the foreign 
Then my niggas shootin' up the Phantom
