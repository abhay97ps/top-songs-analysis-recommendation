Now I want that car, and I want that crib
Gotta reach for that bar gotta get a grip
Reach in that jar, tip toe and never trip
Hang where bad bitches are, kill babies and empty clips
These bitches in heat
Asking me for a treat
This girl grown, take a seat, on me
I wanna bone, if she beat, uhm, then not me
No self-respect, I inspect, myself
So shallow, my minds hollow, my styles borrowed, need help
What'd you expect, I disrespect, myself
And this ho, her deep sorrow, I deep burrow, pussy help
Now my lifes real bad
I never though this would be the life I had
My parents mad, can't talk to my dad,I need mother who is MADD
Why the fuck is getting fucked up a fucking fad, real fucking sad
Probably contracted a diseases
Now I'm shitting out my nose every time I sneeze
Somebody save me please
Please stop me, take my keys
I'm not unbreakable, Alicia Keys
Am I strong like David Dunn
Take a hit, my head feels split
Why's it burn when I cum?
Squeeze her tit, life's gone to shit
Life's over, I'm done
I'm not thinking clear, like a stupid dear. haaaaaanh
