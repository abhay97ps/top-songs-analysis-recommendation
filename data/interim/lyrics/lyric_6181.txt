In a giant lemon tree
Alone my friend and me
We both climb down and cross the sand
Until we reach the sea
And the waves come higher, higher
As we sway and dance
And the way I feel
Makes me want to take a chance
Sing a song of Temma Harbour
Climb a coconut tree
Catch a fish and light a fire
Drink some wine with me
And if you say you like me
And I like you
We can live and dream together
In the world that's new
Sunshine, sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine 
In the tree house here we lay
Above the blue sea spray
Tide rolls in and on the wind
Guitars begin to play
And the waves come higher, higher
As we sway and dance
And the way I feel
Makes me want to take a chance
Sing a song of Temma Harbour
Climb a coconut tree
Catch a fish and light a fire
Drink some wine with me
And if you say you like me
And I like you
We can live and dream together
In the world that's new
Sunshine, sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine 
Sing a song of Temma Harbour
Climb a coconut tree
Catch a fish and light a fire
Drink some wine with me
La-la, la, la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la
La-la, la, la, la, la
La-la-la, la-la
La-la, la, la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la
La-la, la, la, la, la
La-la-la, la-la
