Look, I'm telling you as a friend
Because I think you're so nice
I really think a lot of you
Now you can let her wear your pin
You can let her your friend
But remember, whatever you do
Don't you let her
Be your baby 
Don't you let her
Be your baby 
Don't let her be your baby
Don't you know she's gonna
Kiss you 
Hold you tight 
She's saying she'll miss you
 day and night
She'll tell you that she loves you
Make your temperature rise
She says gonna hug you
Tell you no lies 
When she puts her arms around you
 make you
Feel so fine, yeah
She'll be sugar and spice
Everything nice 
And then, and then, and then
She's gonna break your heart
Like she did mine
Push, push, push, push
She'll put her arms around you
 make you
Feel so fine, yeah
She's sugar and spice now
Everything nice now 
And then, and then, and then
She's gonna break your heart
Like she did mine
Don't let her be your baby
Don't you let her be your baby
Don't you let her be your baby
Send her back to me
Send her back to me
Don't let her be your baby 
Don't let her be your baby 
Don't let her be your baby 
Don't let her be
