And I've run out of pale ale and I feel like I'm in jail
And my music bores me once again
And I've been on the pinball, and I no longer know it all
And they say that you never know when you're insane
Got fleas in my bedroom, got flies in my bathroom
And the cat just finished off the bread
So I walk over Soho and I read about Monroe
And I wonder was she really what they said
Got a call from a good friend, come on down for the weekend
Didn't know if I could spare the time
I knew a woman who was crazy about a boy who was lazy
But it didn't work out 'cos they just couldn't make it rhyme
Hey Jude, you were alright, I could have grooved with you all night
But you turned your back on the party game
Mama if I keep my head clean, will I really have a good dream?
Or will I wake up in confusion just the same?
And I've run out of pale ale and I feel like I'm in jail
Got fleas in the bedroom, got flies in the bathroom
Got a call from a good friend, come on down for the weekend
Hey Jude, you were alright, I could have grooved with you all night
And I've run out of pale ale and I feel like I'm in jail
