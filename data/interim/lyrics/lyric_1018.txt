Fats spoken: 'Ha-ha-ha, Let's go!'
Unks:
'Settle down, alright, alright'
'Settle down there, slow down'
'Can't wait'
'Have to all wait for the party'
'Then I want ya to slow down, ha-ha-ha)
'Just wait'
'Woo-woo!'
Song begins vocal, Fats Domino
Where was Jody, when the lights went out?
Standin' in the corner
Shout-shout sissy, shout
What a party
Lordy, Lordy!
(Big fat piano man
He sho' can  wail away
What a party
Lordy, Lordy!
The girl was dressed
Wit' no shoes on
The big tenor man
Really blew his horn
What a party
Lordy, Lordy!
What a party
Lordy, Lordy!
Somebody called a cop
About half past four
Laughter
He knew he just couldn't get
Through that do'
What a party 
Lordy, Lordy!
What a party
Lordy, Lordy!
'Blow that thing, now! Hard!'
'One more for man Hardesty'
Take out
FADES-
