Oh!
I got these friends
They walk around so considered
Bragging to the end
Like a car and clothes
Is all that's needed
What about the simple part
Give out of the heart?
Without love
It's never gonna be enough
I got the toys, I got the car
I got the friends
But
Hanging with the boys
Is not the kind of time I want to spend
But I know there's something more
Something I've been waiting for
I knew it was true
The moment I saw you
In my heart, in my head
In my life, in my bed
All I'm missing is you
Every day, every night
Of my life would be right
All I'm missing is you
Oh, girl
All I'm missing is you yeah
Doing all I can
But every since I met you, baby
I'm a traveling man
If only else real love can save me
I'm reaching out to you
Baby, what else can I do?
But it's gonna be right
To get you into my life
In this crazy world
I've been searching for the answer
Then I saw you, girl
I found out what my heart's been after
Could have been another day
But if I looked the other way
Then I couldn't have known
What I've been missing all along
With all that
I know
Still this
Fill me with you
Girl, you know
I got it going on
But all I'm missing is you
You, baby
Oh, yeah
All I'm missing is a-you
I need your loving
Give me that love
Gimme that loving
Wish you in my head
Wish you in my bed, babe
Wish you in my head
Wish you in my bed, babe
