Did the best I could
To make you mine
If you ever felt anything for me
Well, you never gave a sign
Thought time would make you change
Make you want me
But baby I never had a chance
Now I know that there's just some things
Just not meant to be
No use
Making you care about me
No way
That I'm going to win
Oh, darling
I might as well be
Chasing the wind
Oh, I'm just
Chasing the wind
Open up my heart
Let you inside
If love was what you we're looking for
Well, I guess it wasn't mine
So I guess I better go
It's over and done
But you know I'm not really sad at all
Because you can't really say it's over
When it never had begun
No use
Making you care about me
No way
That I'm going to win
Oh, darling
I might as well be
Chasing the wind
Oh, I'm just
Chasing the wind
Can't reach the sea
If you can't get past the sand
Can't touch the sky
If you can't reach up your hand
Can't give if you give nothing back
No use
Making you care about me
No way
That I'm going to win
Oh, darling
I might as well be
Chasing the wind
Oh, I'm just
Chasing the wind
