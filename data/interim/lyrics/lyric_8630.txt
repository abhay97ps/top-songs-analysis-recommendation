Now one day, girl, all of our dreams will come true
If you believe in me like I believe in you
Someday, girl, we'll be together
Now I can see it all in visions of white
A long train in a stained glass light
And someday, you can be mine forever
Now sometimes I can see it all in my dreams
Wakin' up next to you
And walkin' around with my head on the ceiling
I'm in love, but ooh, what a feelin'
Ah, honey, ain't that such a good feelin' to know?
That's just such a good feelin' to know
I won't have to leave you again
You know I almost believe it was meant
To be that way 
Someday 
Well, it won't be long and I just can't wait
But we got to be strong and we got to have faith
And someday , girl, we'll be together
So if you need something to hold on to
Hold on to me, girl, and I'll hold on to you
And someday , you can be mine forever
Yes, sometimes I can see it all in my dreams
Just how it's gonna be
You'll be a mother and I'll be one of the children
I'm in love, but ooh, what a feelin'
Oh, honey, ain't that such a good feelin' to know?
Girl, you're gonna be mine forever
I just love you, girl
I'm gonna love, love, love, love you someday
Oh, how I need you, honey
To love, love, love, love me someday
Yes, I'll just love, love
I'm gonna love, love, love, love you someday
Yeah, girl, I'll just love you, love you
I'm gonna love, love, love, love you someday
Oh, how I'll just love you, love you
I'm gonna love, love, love, love you someday
Girl, how I'll just love you, love you
I'm gonna love, love, love, love you someday
Oh, how I just need you, girl
I'm gonna love, love, love, love you someday
