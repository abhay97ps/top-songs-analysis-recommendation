Hello

It's poppin , it's poppin' 
Yeah... okay...
I gotta ask 'em...
'Cause if I don't...
It's poppin , it's poppin! 
I dunno... Let's go!
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is cool, my lip gloss be poppin'
I'm standin' at my locker, and all the boys keep stoppin'
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is poppin', my lip gloss is cool
All the boys keep jockin', they chase me after school
Mac  L'Oreal, yep, 'cause I'm worth it
Love the way I puts it on so perfect
Wipe the corners of my mouth so I work it
When I walk down the hallway, they cain't say nothin'
Oh, oh, oh, my lips so luscious
The way I spice it up with the Mac-Mac brushes
L'Oreal got them wat-ballermelon crushes
That's probably the reason all these boys got crushes
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is cool, my lip gloss be poppin'

Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is poppin', my lip gloss is cool
All the boys keep jockin', they chase me after school
When it's time for lunch, my lips still rock
Lil' Mama melon with da hot pink top
Cherry, vanilla, flavors is a virtue
Dey, lovin lip gloss universal
The boys really like it, the girls don't speak
Rollin' they eyes, they lip gloss cheap
It ain't my fault, but I could upgrade ya
Show you how to use nice things with nice flavas
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is cool, my lip gloss be poppin'
I'm standin' at my locker, and all the boys keep stoppin'
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is poppin', my lip gloss is cool
All the boys keep jockin', they chase me after school
'Cause my lip gloss - is poppin' 
Is poppin! 
'Cause my lip gloss - is poppin'

Sittin' in eighth period, thought I was in trouble
Dean called me on the loudspeaker on the double
I stepped in her office like "Yes, Ms. McClarkson?"
She like, "Gurl, I ran out of my lip gloss
And write down where you get yours from
'Cause I must admit, that bubblegum
Is poppin' 
Is poppin!"
She ain't frontin'
N-uh, I be lovin' it, I be, I be lovin it n-uh
I be usin' it, I be I be usin' it n-uh
I be rubbin it, I be I be rubbin it
On my lips, my lips  my lip gloss
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is cool, my lip gloss be poppin'
I'm standin' at my locker, and all the boys keep stoppin'
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is poppin', my lip gloss is cool
All the boys keep jockin', they chase me after school
