I'm picking up my baby tonight
Though her daddy's making trouble
It will be alright
I'm working hard, I don't know why
I'm like a working class dog
And I just get by
Tonight I'm crawling out from in it
And though we're livin' on the brink
Second by second by minute by minute
Love is alright tonight
We're gonna be alright
Love is alright
Love is alright tonight
Everyone's sayin' the sky's gonna fall
Don't know where it's gonna stop
If it stops at all
I know the world's goin' crazy alright
I hope it holds together for one more night
Tonight I'm crawling out from in it
And tho' we're livin' on the brink
Second by second by minute by minute
Love is alright tonight
We're gonna be alright
Love is alright
Love is alright tonight
Don't worry, Daddy, I'll have her home at a respectable hour
Go to sleep, Daddy, you won't think about tonight
With the night comes a feeling of incredible power
Gonna love her, Daddy, she'll be feeling it tonight
Alright, it's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright
Love is alright tonight
We're gonna be alright
Love is alright
Love is alright tonight
