Yeah
Ouuuu
I'm from the weeeeest
Che Che Che
Igbo kwenu hey
Naija boy they love how I accentuate
Most my partners trynna ball like the NBA
So they out here moving products like it’s Mary Kay
I don't knock 'em I just know the game
They ain’t slaves, they just really love the whips and chains
The more things change, the more things stay the same
When I flow every corner see fire like I'm Kane
So I spit fire, no extinguisher
Might just teach Fat some Igbo to make her a bilingual
Speaker, keep up I'll teach ya to aim right with that thing you pull
Outcho britches when yo' finger itches cause you ain't too keen to wool
Being pulled over got you pressed like a license plate
You a goofy if Lucy could press yo' buyttons and getcha heated like microwaves, 
You, might just need to meditate
Get yo' mind out that vegetative state
It's time to elevate
Cause I came straight from out the slums
So I need a check like them Jordan 1S
I swear this for all of my day ones
Out here making bread but they came from crumbs
Look
Flow hotter than pepper spray
Spit it for my kinky hair kinsmen that have been led astray
More than bullets from those who pull it in hopes to decimate
All they opps, cause on our blocks we learnt to regulate from
Warren G, It’s kinda easy, when ya listen to that G’D up sound I had it on repeat, 
Then I got it out the mud
Walked straight out the puddle
Where I'm from you yapping they start clapping like it’s time to break the huddle
Ouuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Ready break
I remember eating free lunch with them heavy trays
Most my homeboys blew heavy haze after seventh grade
And most my homegirls had oval edges with heavy lace
It's time to elevate
If they hatin' baby let 'em hate, 
You can see me shinin’ in the shade, 
We done came up on some better days
'Cus I came straight from out the slums, 
So I need a check like them Jordan 1S
I swear this for my day ones, 
Out here making bread but they came from crumbs
