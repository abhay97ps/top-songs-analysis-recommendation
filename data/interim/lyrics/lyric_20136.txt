There go the street lights
The night's officially on
I got the green light
To do whatever we want
Gonna stand outside, the box
And put the rules on hold
Tonight
Carte blanche, first class for the evening
Ready, set, go
All the girls stepping out for a public affair
All the cameras come out for a public affair
Hey baby, I see you looking over here, baby
Are you gonna keep looking or get up?
And talk to me
Here's an opportunity that you don't wanna miss tonight
Carte blanche, first class for the evening
Ready, set, go
All the girls stepping out for a public affair
All the cameras come out for a public affair
Do what you wanna do
Tonight the world does not exist
Move how you wanna move
All my girls work it out, like this
Give me room to shake, shake, shake
All the girls stepping out for a public affair
All the cameras come out for a public affair
All the girls stepping out for a public affair
All the cameras come out for a public affair
All night, don't stop
Who cares? Let's rock
Who cares? Let's rock
All night, don't stop 
Who cares, let's rock
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Hey baby
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
All the girls stepping out for a public affair
All the cameras come out for a public affair
