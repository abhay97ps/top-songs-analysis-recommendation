Well, I gave him the world my eyes opened wide
He left me at prom, cheated and lied
The girl was mean and empty and bland
But I still wear his rind on the finger of my hand
These tales that I tell come from days not so swell
When love wet the ground, not looking I fell
My luck shot to shit but I’ve still got my wit
So I quite the drinking, my heart’s opened a bit
Tales that I tell
Tales that I tell
Tales that I tell
Fare thee well
Now silver spoon guy wears a blazer and tie
Women in high heels too many to decide
I threw my bottle straight at his head
Man I wish I would have chose his best friend instead
These tales that I tell come from days not so swell
When love wet the ground, not looking I fell
My luck shot to shit but I’ve still got my wit
So I quite the drinking, my heart’s opened a bit
Tales that I tell
Tales that I tell
Tales that I tell
Fare thee well
Mister pretty of the city never one to have wit
Night came around we just couldn’t quit
A wife, a girlfriend, neither was me
So I packed my bags and moved from the sea
These tales that I tell come from days not so swell
When love wet the ground, not looking I fell
My luck shot to shit but I’ve still got my wit
So I quite the drinking, my heart’s opened a bit
Tales that I tell
Tales that I tell
Tales that I tell
Fare thee well
