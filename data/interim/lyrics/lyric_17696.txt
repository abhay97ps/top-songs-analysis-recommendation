Now she's gone
It's not about romance
She don't love you
She just loves to dance
She don't love you
It's not about romance
Gal just a tease me she don't want to please me
Have big man just cry for her body
Gal just a tease me she don't want to please me
Have big man just cry for her body
She looks so beautiful
She burns with every touch
Don't get too close
She'll break your heart and leave you
Got you wanting her so much

She don't love you
She just loves to dance
She don't love you
It's not about romance

Bodies dancing oh so tight
Emotions running wild

Passions on the rise
Every move excites you
