There's a little girl out lyin'
On her own
She's got a broken heart
She's not the kind to take you
Down for long
She knows and plays it smart
And if she's comin'
She's shown no more
She's heard no whistle blowin'
From the door
She feels like leavin'
And she don't know why
Without no bridges she's trapped
So I sigh
Don't cross the river
If you can't swim the tide
Don't try denyin' livin'
On the other side
All your life
You were on your own
If you want you can ride my train
And soon forget the reason that you're leaving
Lose yourself and then sometime
Maybe even save yourself some grievin'
Don't cross the river
If you can't swim the tide
Don't try denyin' livin'
On the other side
Don't cross the river
If you can't swim the tide
Don't try denyin' livin'
On the other side
Don't cross the river
If you can't swim the tide
Don't cross the river
If you can't swim the tide
Don't cross the river
If you can't swim the tide
