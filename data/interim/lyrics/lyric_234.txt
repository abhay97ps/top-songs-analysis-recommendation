Oh little one 
Oh little one 
I loved her so. Ill never let her go. whoa whoa
Shes true to me 
So true to me 
Where will I go, if she should know
I was untrue. Oh so untrue
Made to share for every little one 
Little one  Oh little one 
Break
Oh little one 
Oh little one 
My tears I now cry, as she walks by his side
Bye little one Goodbye little one
Oh I will die without you, little one. 
Little one 
Fade out
