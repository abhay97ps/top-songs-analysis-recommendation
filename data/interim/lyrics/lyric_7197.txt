Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
Somebody help me now
Somebody help me find my baby
Somebody help me find my baby right now
I'm looking for a love
I'm looking for a love
I'm looking here and there
I'm searching everywhere
I'm looking for a love
To call my own
Well, someone to get up in the morning and rub my head
Someone to fix my breakfast and bring it to my bed
Someone to do a little housework and pamper me again
Like love and kisses and baby up 'til then
I'm looking for a love
I'm looking for a love
I'm looking here and there
I'm searching everywhere
I'm looking for a love
To call my own
Well someone to be in my corner all the way now
Stick with me no matter what they say
I'll give my love to her all the time
I will gladly let her know she's mine all mine
I'm looking for a love
I'm looking for a love
I'm looking here and there
I'm searching everywhere
I'm looking for a love
To call my own
Get up baby
Somebody help me find my baby
I said I've got to find my baby right now
And I'm looking in the morning, and I'm looking at night
Got to find my baby, she's nowhere in sight
I'm looking, I'm looking
I'm looking, I'm looking......
