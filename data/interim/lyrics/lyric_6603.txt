I watch the leaves falling to the ground
I'm walking up and down the streets of my hometown
You're here with me like it used to be
I look around and then I'm on my own again
Can't stop loving you, can't stop wanting you
Can't stop now that you made me part of you
I've heard some people say, I'm dreaming my life away
But what else can I do? Can't stop loving you
Your face I see in my memory
I close my eyes and then I start to live again
You're holding me like it used to be
I open my eyes and then I'm on my own again
Can't stop loving you, can't stop wanting you
Can't stop now that you made me part of you
I've heard some people say, I'm dreaming my life away
But what else can I do? Can't stop loving you
Can't stop loving you, can't stop wanting you
Can't stop feeling blue, can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you, oh I can't, I can't, I can't
