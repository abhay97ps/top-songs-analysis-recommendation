Every day I walk in shadows
I know not what it is
Heading for
And as the evening lies dying
A gentle heart dies near me sighing
It's still the same
You'll never change
You can never understand
We can now be like water
Don't need more to find our way
Just get on where we came
It's a game
What a game
No time to lose
No time to lose
No time to lose
No time to lose
Go with the flow
Never let go
No time to lose
There ain't no way to see forever
It's only day to day
I'm living for
Like a wheel you keep me turning
Put your love inside me burning
Questions plain
When you're lovin' me
You can never understand
We can now be like water
Don't need more to find our way
Just get on where we came
It's a game
What a game
No time to lose
No time to lose
No time to lose
No time to lose
Go with the flow
Never let go
No time to lose
You can never understand
We can now be like water
Don't need more to find our way
Just get on where we came
It's a game
No time to lose
No time to lose
No time to lose
No time to lose
Go with the flow
Never let go
No time to lose
No time to lose
No time to lose
No time to lose
No time to lose
