We came on the sloop "John B"
My grandfather and me
'Round Nassau town we did roam
Stayed awake all night
We got into a fight
Well, I feel so broke up
I want to go home
Hoist up the "John B" sail
See how the mains'l's sets
Tell the captain ashore
I wanna go home
Well, I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Lord, I feel so broke up
I just wanna go home
Well, the first mate he got drunk
And he broke into somebody's trunk
And the Sheriff had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Slone
Please let me alone
Well, I fell so broken up
I just wanna go home
Hoist up the "John B" sail
See how the mains'l's sets
Tell the captain ashore
I wanna go home
Lord, I wanna go home
I just wanna go home
Well, I feel so broken up
I just wanna go home
Hoist up the "John B" sail
See how the mains'l's sets
Tell the captain ashore
I wanna go home
Well, I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Lord, I feel so broken up
I just wanna go home
Well, I feel so broken up
I wanna go home
