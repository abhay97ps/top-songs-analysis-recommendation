The touch of you
Is drivin' me out of my head, oh boy
What a touch from a little hand can do
Especially coming from you
Turn my life all around
I can't seem to settle down
Oh, baby, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
The touch of you
Is drivin' me out of my head, oh boy
The touch of you
Is drivin' me out of my head, oh boy
I'm hooked on you and I can't help myself
There's just no time for anything else
You're all I want and all I need
I will follow if you will lead
Oh, baby, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Is drivin' me out of my head, oh boy
Baby, baby, baby, the touch of you
Is drivin' me out of my head, oh boy
Baby, baby, baby
