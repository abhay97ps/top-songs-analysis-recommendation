Oh, lonely, lonely drifter
Oh, lonely, lonely drifter
As I sit here on the shore
Wondering what happened to me
Drifting away from the world
All alone without your, girl
I'm wondering will I forever be
A lonely drifter
Watching the waves
Lonely drifter
Slowly drifting out to sea
Lonely drifter
Cause I, I, I don't
Want to have to be a
Lonely, lonely drifter
A lonely, lonely drifter
When will it end
When will I not feel so bad
Must I go on this way
Maybe, maybe tomorrow they say
Or will it ever happen that way
A lonely drifter
Watching the waves
Lonely drifter
Slowly drifting out to sea
Lonely drifter
Is it too late for me
Lonely drifter
Help me, somebody
Lonely drifter
