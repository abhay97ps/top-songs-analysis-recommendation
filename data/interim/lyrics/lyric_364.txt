{And I don't believe you love me anymore} 
Lately you've been acting strange to me
Somehow it's not the way it used to be
You're doing things you never dared to do before
{And I don't believe you love me anymore} 
I've felt your love grow colder day by day
When I try to hold you close you turn away
There must be someone else you're running for
{And I don't believe you love me anymore} 
{And I don't believe you love me anymore} 
I've felt your love grow colder day by day
When I try to hold you close you turn away
There must be someone else you're running for
{And I don't believe you love me anymore} 
{I don't believe you love me anymore}
