I walk down the street, people passing me by
They look you up and down but they don't look you in the eye
I'm just another stranger in my own hometown
Looking for a angel but heaven can't be found
I said hey are you lonely tonight
Hey I'm gonna make it
But that don't make it right
Does anybody really fall in love anymore
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody
Does anybody really have opened the door
I know, I know, you gotta love somebody
I know, I know, I've got to find somebody to love
There's a sad face in the mirror and I'm sad to say it's me
Like a ghost up in the attic only love can set you free
I've been running round in circles on this roller coaster ride
There's a lonely world around us, we get sucked in by the tide
I said hey, love ain't a crime
So why is everybody so afraid to cross the line
Does anybody really fall in love anymore
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody
Does anybody really have opened the door
I know, I know, you gotta love somebody
I know, I know, I've got to find somebody to love
I said hey, I'll be alright
Cause I know that someone somewhere's gonna
Say these words tonight
Does anybody really fall in love anymore
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody
Does anybody really have opened the door
I know, I know, you gotta love somebody
I know, I know, I've got to find somebody to love
