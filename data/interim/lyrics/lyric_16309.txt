Ah yeah
Boyz II Men, Brian McKnight
Back at ya, baby
A little something for ya in '98
Y'all ready, fellas
Let's turn it on for them
As a matter of fact, let's make it snow
Ya ready, here we go
Let it snow, let it snow
But the fire's blazin'
Let it snow, let it snow
But the fire's blazin'
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
It's just another Christmas holiday
Just me and you
The weather's stormy, but we're A-OK
And there's nothing that I'd rather do
Than lay you down beside the fireplace
Nowhere to go, oh oh
You run out of breath, I start to shake
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow
Outside it's cold
But the fire's blazin'
Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow
Outside it's cold
But the fire's blazin'
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Hey, come over here
Pretend like I'm the tree, and you are the star, yeah
You're all the present that I'll ever need
Just wanna be everywhere that you are
Hear the carolers, the sleigh bells ring
Where's the mistletoe? Yeah
We feel happiness the season brings
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow
Outside it's cold
But the fire's blazin'
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow
Outside it's cold
But the fire's blazin'
Let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
And oh, you are my everything
Won't ya come, won't ya come
God must have sent you down from heaven
So let it snow, let it snow
Outside it's cold
But the fire's blazin'
Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow
Outside it's cold
But the fire's blazin'
Let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow
Outside it's cold
But the fire's blazin'
Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow
Outside it's cold
But the fire's blazin'
Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow
