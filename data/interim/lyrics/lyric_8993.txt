Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Huh huh hmmmm
Ummmm
Two people—just meeting
Barely touching each other
Two spirits—greeting
Trying to carry it further
You are one, and I am another
We should be one—inside each other
You can see inside me
Will you come inside me?
Do you wanna ride inside, my love?
You can see inside me
Will you come inside me?
Do you wanna ride inside, my love?
Two strangers—not strangers
Only lacking the knowing
So willing—feeling
Infinite growing
While we're here, the whole world is turning
We should be one—fulfilling our yearning
You can see inside me
Will you come inside me?
Do you wanna ride inside, my love?
You can see inside me
Will you come inside me?
Do you wanna ride inside, my love?
You can see inside me
Will you come inside me?
Do you wanna ride inside, my love?
You can see inside me
Will you come inside me?
Do you wanna ride inside, my love?
—See inside me
—You come inside me?
—Inside, my love?
You can come inside me
Will you come inside me, ?
You can come inside me
Will you come inside me, ?
You can come inside me
Will you come inside me, ?
You can come inside me
Will you come inside me, ?
