I love you, I need you
I understand
I love you, I need you
I understand
Don't throw away
All those teardrops
Don't throw away
Loves sweet dreams
I know the feeling
Of a broken romance
I know the yearning
To beg for a chance
So, don't throw away
All those teardrops
Catch them and put them aside
For though it still hurts you
In just a little while
I promise, you'll trade
Your teardrops for smiles
Don't throw away
All those teardrops
Catch them and put them aside
For though it still hurts you
In just a little while
I promise, you'll
Trade your teardrops
You'll trade your
Teardrops for smiles
I love you, I need you
I understand
I love you, I need you
I understand
My love
