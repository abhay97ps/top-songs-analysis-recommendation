You ran away and left me
'Cause you thought you could hurt me
But I got news for you
I'm still strong and you were wrong
To think your leavin' I turned blue
Everything's the same
There ain't nothing changed
The sun still shines
And the rain still rains
And I'm still me
And you're still you too, you see
Everything's the same
There ain't nothing changed
Since you've been gone I still do what I do
No, I haven't changed my habits a bit
I still eat, I still sleep, I still go to work
And when my workday's done I quit
Everything's the same 
There ain't nothing changed 
The sun still shines 
And the rain still rains 
And I'm still me
And you're still you too, you see
Everything's the same
Honey, nothing changed
Go get
Everything's the same 
There ain't nothing changed 
The sun still shines 
And the rain still rains
