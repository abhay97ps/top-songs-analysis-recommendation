On the Southside of Chicago Bobby boogied
As the people watch him dance step on the floor
Ain't no match, if you can catch him some night dancing
And the people in the disco cheer for more
???
And the music's fine
He's the greatest dancer
He'll blow your mind
Well, it's hard to stay on top
When you can't stop, no
When you're number one, yeah
When you're number one, yeah
Numero uno, yeah
When you're number one, yeah
Now Jimmy's dressed in satin laced with diamonds
And he had moves just like the tiger in the night
In every disco up in Frisco they're dancing
His moves are strong to every song and his moves are nice
Am I number one?
He had to know
So he challenged Bobby
On a TV show
Life is rough, the mood is tough
You got to know your stuff, yeah
When you're number one, yeah
When you're number one, yeah
Numero uno, yeah
When you're number one, yeah
People cleared the floor
To let the dance begin
Bobby moved and glided
I thought his moves would never end
Jimmy turned and twisted
As the ladies watched him dance
His feet, they weaved that magic spell
Put the crowd out in a trance
Everybody, everybody was looking
The music, the music, the music
The music was cooking
Those fast feet, hips and hands were moving
And somehow when that smoke got cleared away
Only Jimmy was on the floor dancing
And Bobby had simply faded away
So if you think
That you're number one
You can't claim the title
'til the dance is done
You're always gonna make yourself a target
To every new kid who comes to town
He's waiting to meet you at some disco
When you're number one, they try to shoot you down
Bang! Bang!
When you're number one, yeah
When you're number one, yeah
Numero uno, yeah
When you're number one, yeah
