Shame on me for hurting you what can I say what can I do
Last night I was blind but today I see I did you wrong shame on me
You say you won't be seein' me again you say we're through
I wouldn't want to see the sunrise tomorrow if I knew that to be true
I know that just sayin' sorry doesn't sound out a lot
But the girl you saw me with last night means no more to me
Than the thousand stars to the great clouds that cover the night
The more I look at her the more I realize how much I love you
Shame on me for hurting you...
I'll admit I shouldn't have given into love's wild temptation
With someone I cared nothing for I was blind and I hurt you
Can you ever forgive the fool the fool who really loves you
Last night I was blind but today I see I did you wrong shame on me
