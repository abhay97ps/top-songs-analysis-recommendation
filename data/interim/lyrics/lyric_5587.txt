Does she love me, with all her heart
Should I worry, when we're apart
It's a lover's question, I'd like to know
Does she need me, as she pretends
Is this a game, well I want to win
It's a lover's question, I'd like to know
I'd like to know when she's not with me
If she's still true to me
I'd like to know when we're kissing
Does she feel just what I feel
And how am I to know it's really real
Baby tell me where, oh the answer lies
Is it in your kiss or is it in your eyes
That's a lover's question I would like to know
I'd like to know
And you've got to tell me baby
I want to know yeah
And you gonna tell me baby
I've got to know honey
I'd like to know when you're not with me
Are you still true to me
I'd like to know when you kiss me whoa
Do you feel just what I feel
How am I to know you're really real
You've got to tell me where, ha, oh the answer lies
Is it in your kiss honey, or is it in your eyes
Somebody's got to tell me baby, where my answer lies
I want to know honey now
I, I want to know
