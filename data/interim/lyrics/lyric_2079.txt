Woo ooo,    Woo oo
Did you ever see starlight rushing from the skies
Heading for home in a certain someone's eyes
Uh uh huh, that's my baby, Talking bout my baby and I love him
He's a walking miracle 
He's a walking miracle 
Did you ever see sunshine come pouring out of space
Just to be part of the smile on someone's face
Uh uh huh, that's my baby, Talking bout my baby and I love him
He's a walking miracle 
He's a walking miracle 
And you should see cherries do flips, oh, yeah
When they're picked to be the taste on his lips, oh, yeah
And I know how happy his clothes must be
Cause that's how I feel when he's close to me 
Did you ever see loving that really rings a bell
Kooky and crazy like Romeo himself
Uh uh huh, that's my baby, Talking bout my baby and I love him
He's a walking miracle 
He's a walking miracle 
And you should see cherries do flips, oh, yeah
When they're picked to be the taste on his lips, oh, yeah
And I know how happy his clothes must be
Cause that's how I feel when he's close to me 
Did you ever see loving that really rings a bell
Kooky and crazy like Romeo himself
Uh uh huh, that's my baby, Talking bout my baby and I love him
He's a walking miracle 
He's a walking miracle 
He's a walking miracle      
He's a walking miracle 
He's a walking miracle
