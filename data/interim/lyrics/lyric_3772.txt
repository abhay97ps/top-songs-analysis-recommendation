Elvira, Elvira, my heart's on fire-a for Elvira
Eyes that look like heaven, lips like cherry wine
She can sure 'nuff make my little light shine
I get funny feelings up and down my spine
'Cause I know that my Elvira's mine
Elvira, Elvira, my heart's on fire-a for Elvira
Giddyup, oom pa pa, oom pa pa, mow mow
Giddyup, oom pa pa, oom pa pa, mow mow
Hi yo silver, away
Tonight I'm gonna meet her at hungry house cafe
And I'm gonna give her all the love I can
She's gonna jump and holler 'cause I saved up two dollars
And we gonna search and find that preacher man
Elvira, Elvira, heart's on fire-a for Elvira
Gi di up, oom pa pa, oom pa pa, mow mow
Gi di up, oom pa pa, oom pa pa, mow mow
Hi yo silver, away...
Elvira
