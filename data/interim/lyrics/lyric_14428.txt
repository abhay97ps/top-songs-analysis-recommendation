Ooh, yeah
What you see is what you get
What you get is everything now, honey
What you see is what you get
Nothing more and nothing less
Ooh
I been watching your eyes
Looking for someone
Time after time
They met mine, the chase is on
You think I'm this
You think I'm that
I wonder why you stop and go
Do you think I'm weak
Do you think I'm strong
I think I ought to let you know
What you see is what you get, baby
What you get is everything now, honey
What you see is what you get
You get nothing more and nothing less, no
Ooh, move closer, baby
Come on, keep me company
Say, do anything but
Don't try rearranging me
'Cause I may be this
And I may be that
But I don't know
Why you stop and go
If you decide to make up your mind
I think I ought to let you know
Oh, oh, oh
What you see is what you
What you see is what you
What you see is what you
What you see is what you get, get, get
'Cause I may be this
I may be that
I don't know why you stop and go
If you decide to make up your mind
I think I ought to let you know
What you see is what you get, baby
What you get is everything now, honey
What you see is what you get, sugar
Nothing more and nothing less
Nothing more and nothing less
No, no
