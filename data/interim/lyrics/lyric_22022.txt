Shitted on 'em
Man, I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em
Put your number twos in the air if you did it on 'em
Shitted on 'em
Man, I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em
Put your number twos in the air if you did it on 'em
All these bitches is my sons
And I'ma go and get some bibs for 'em
A couple formulas, little pretty lids on 'em
If I had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on 'em 
Let me shake it off
I just signed a couple deals, I might break you off
And we ain't making up, I don't need a mediator
Just let them bums blow steam, radiator
, shitted on 'em
, man, I just shitted on 'em
, shitted on 'em
Put your number twos in the air if you did it on 'em

Put your number twos in the air if you did it on 'em 
This stone is flawless, F1
I keep shooters up top in the F1
A lot of bad bitches beggin' me to F one
But I'ma eat them rap bitches when the chef come
Throw some fresh ones
More talent in my motherfuckin' left thumb
She ain't a Nicki fan, then the bitch deaf, dumb
You ain't my son, you my motherfuckin' step-son
, shitted on 'em
, man, I just shitted on 'em

Put your number twos in the air if you did it on 'em

All these bitches is my sons
And I ain't talkin' 'bout Phoenix
Bitch, I get money, so I dos what I pleases
I live where the motherfuckin' pools and the trees is
Broke bitches so crusty 
Gave the bitch a ride, got the Continental dusty
Trust me, I keep a couple hundred in the duff'-B
Couple wet wipes case a bum try to touch me, ew
I'm the terminator
Bitch talk slick, I'ma have to terminate her
These little nappy-headed hoes need a perminator
You my seed, I'll spray you with the germinator 
Move back, bugs
Matter fact, you know the queen could use a back rub 
If you could turn back time, Cher
You used to be here, now you're gone, Nair
