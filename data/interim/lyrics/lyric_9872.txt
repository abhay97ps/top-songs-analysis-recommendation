On my way home I met an
Old friend of mine
We walked and we talked an' shared
A bottle of wine
We started to dance
My intentions were good
How could I know I'd be misunderstood
I promised to call before the weekend
Was thru
We'd all get together so she could
Meet you
I was just being friendly, I met her
By chance
You gotta believe me - it's not a romance
Don't turn the light out, I'm starting to see
Don't turn the light out, you're getting to me
Don't turn the light out, we're burning so bright
Don't turn the light out..... Don't turn out the light
You gotta see it from my point
Of view
The same situation could
Happen to you
I said it was over before she left
Town
I can't believe that you're putting me down
Aaahh, It would be easy if you'd lighten up
Do it to please me, enough is enough
All that we've been thru, how can you doubt
The ups an' the downs are what loving's about
Don't turn the light out, I'm starting to see
Don't turn the light out, you're getting to me
Don't turn the light out, we're burning so bright
Don't turn the light out..... Don't turn out the light
Mmm, don't turn the light out
Ooohhh, don't turn the light out
Don't turn the light out, I'm starting to see
Don't turn the light out, you're getting to me
Don't turn the light out, we're burning so bright
Don't turn the light out..... Don't turn out the light
