I'm a robin sitting in a tree
Singing for you, darling, endlessly
Inspiration's got a hold on me
And I don't want to be set free
It's the smile on your face
It's your style and your grace
And that's why, that's why
I love you
You're a party with the lights down low
You're my Friday night movie show
Love me tender on the radio
Just hold me tight and don't let go
It's the smile on your face
It's your style and your grace
And that's why, that's why
I love you
People fall in love and
All too soon it fades away
But, sweet darling, we won't fade
I will travel with you on down the line
It's the smile on your face
It's your style and your grace
And that's why, that's why
I love you
It's the smile on your face
It's your style and your grace
And that's why, that's why
I love you
It's the smile on your face
It's your style and your grace
And that's why, that's why
I love you
