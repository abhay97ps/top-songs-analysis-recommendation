If you've never been in love
One more minute, you're gonna fall in it
If you've never been in love
One more minute, you're gonna fall in it
If you've never been in love before...
If you've never been in love before...
Let each second be a memory
Let each minute join in harmony
I'm gonna open up your life
I'm gonna take you by surprise
Oh, don't you be afraid
Boy, we've got it made
All we got to do is do the things you missed
But you've never been in love
One more minute, you're gonna fall in it
No, you've never been in love
One more minute, you're gonna fall in it
If you've never been in love before...
If you've never felt this way before...
If you think that love's a fantasy
One more step to what you want to be
Love don't come around every day
Don't let this just slip away
Oh, don't you understand?
Let me be the one
I'll show you what you've missed
How can you resist?
If you've never been in love
One more minute, you're gonna fall in it
If you've never been in love
One more minute, you're gonna fall in it
If you've never been in love before...
If you've never been in love before...
Let each second be a memory
Let each minute join in harmony
I'm gonna open up your life
I'm gonna take you by surprise
Oh, don't you be afraid
Boy, we've got it made
All we got to do is do the things you missed
If you've never been in love
One more minute
You're gonna fall in it
If you've never been in love
One more minute
You're gonna fall in it
If you've never been in love
One more minute
You're gonna fall in it
If you've never been in love
One more minute
You're gonna fall in it
If you've never been in love before...
If you've never been in love before...
If you've never been in love before...
If you've never been in love before...
If you've never been in love before...
If you've never been in love before...
