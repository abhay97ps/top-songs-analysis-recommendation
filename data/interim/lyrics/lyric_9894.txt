Somebody said, I was living in the life
Somebody told me, I was living in the life

Somebody said, it was easy in my life
Somebody told me, I had made it in my life
Try to understand my determination when

Check out the difference between the two

Somebody told me, I was living in the life

You can only stand on the outside looking in
Oh, you ain't me, and I ain't you
There's a helluva difference between the two
