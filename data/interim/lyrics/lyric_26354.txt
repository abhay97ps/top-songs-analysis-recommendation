Snitches and rats, snitches and rats
Snitches and rats, they all get whacked 
He told on his brother , his brother told back 
They say that they twins, we call them Siamese rats 
Snitches and rats , snitches and rats 
We snatchin' your jewelry  and takin' your pack 
Snitches and rats , snitches and rats 
We cut off his tail and put slugs in his hat 
You talk on the internet, we talk in the street 
Kel-Tec .223, like D-Wade, I love my heat 
Glock 19 in the booth, it's on the seat 
Black Air Force 1s in the field, thеm my cleats 
Caught a rap nigga down bad
Now his ass in a body bag 
Sound real tough when you makin' thеm songs
Where the fuck is your bodies at? 
Say you want smoke with that Big 4L 
Where the fuck is your 'partments at? 
Been stepped on them, they ain't talkin' 'bout shit 
Them niggas a welcome mat
Shawty was speakin' them facts 
Shawty ain't talkin' to rats 
Niggas know Nudy my twin
Playin' with cuz, a nigga get whacked 
You ain't gon' slide, you a ho, dawg 
Spinned a nigga block, then we rode off 
Young COUPE tryna up the score, dawg
Chevy was busy, so I took 4 God 
Snitches and rats, snitches and rats
Snitches and rats, they all get whacked 
He told on his brother , his brother told back 
They say that they twins, we call them Siamese rats 
Snitches and rats , snitches and rats 
We snatchin' your jewelry  and takin' your pack 
Snitches and rats , snitches and rats 
We cut off his tail and put slugs in his hat 
Black and white gon' tell it, and you snitchin', pussy, I don't smell it
Real convicted felon, strapped up, loaded, shit, this lethal weapon 
Bless you pussy niggas with this weapon, send you straight to heaven
Man, I pray to God you pussy niggas don't test me, I'm gon' bless you 
Hope you niggas retaliate, don't tell them peoples or your mama 
Niggas like to dry snitch when shit get real, wanna go tell they mama
Got to keep this shit twenty-one hundred, don't you fold under pressure
Fuck your honor, you know they try to give you a hundred
Yeah, niggas be scared, they catchin' a hundred
Snitches and rats, we gon' feed him a hundred 
I spent that money, blue cheese 
All these rap niggas gon' follow the cheese 
Trade ones with my brudda, the other shit, you know we bust 'em 
I don't fuckin' trust ya, if you ain't Metro, we gon' bust ya
Snitches and rats, snitches and rats
Snitches and rats, they all get whacked 
He told on his brother , his brother told back 
They say that they twins, we call them Siamese rats 
Snitches and rats , snitches and rats 
We snatchin' your jewelry  and takin' your pack 
Snitches and rats , snitches and rats 
We cut off his tail and put slugs in his hat 
Roll the window down, squeeze
