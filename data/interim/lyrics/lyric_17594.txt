Sometimes it's soft as a misty rain
That gently touches my soul
It cools the fire that burns in me
And I simply lose control
So just
Rain down  on me
Let your love just fall like rain
Just rain on me
Just rain down  on me
Let your love just shower me
Just rain on me
Full as a dam at capacity
My passion's about to explode, yeah
I can't escape, it's surrounding me
I'm caught in a storm
That I don't need no shelter from
Rain down  on me
Let your love just fall like rain
Just rain on me
Just rain down  on me
Let your love just shower me
Just rain on me
Shower me
Sprinkle me
Fall down on me
Fall down, fall down on me
Let it
Fall down, fall on me
Just
Rain down on me
Chill me with your loving touch
Rain on me
I wanna feel your love is real
Just
Rain down on me
Me
Rain on me
Oh baby
Rain down  on me
Let your love just fall like rain
Just rain on me
Just rain down  on me
Let your love just shower me
Just rain on me
Sometimes it's soft as a misty rain
