Baby
No, it's not that I don't care
Maybe
It's a change in atmosphere
And I've seen the signs I know
That it's right for me to go
I'm on my way
So when you think of yesterday
Remember all the things we said
And through the course of history
I hope you'll still remember me
And there can't be no other way
There's nothing left for us to say
I've got to see it through alone
I've got to do this on my own
Baby
You could say that it's unfair
Maybe
I've got nothing left to share
And I've seen the signs I know
That it's right for me to go
I'm on my way
So when you think of yesterday
Remember all the things we said
And through the course of history
I hope you'll still remember me
And there can't be no other way
There's nothing left for us to say
I've got to see this through alone
I've got to do this on my own
On my own
On my own
Own
So when you think of yesterday
Remember all the things we said
And through the course of history
I hope you'll still remember me
And there can't be no other way
There's nothing left for us to say
I've got to see it through alone
I've got to do this on my own
On my own
On my own
On my own
