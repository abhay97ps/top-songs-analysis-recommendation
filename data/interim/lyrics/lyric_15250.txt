Girl, I promise
I'll be gentle
Sometimes at night
I call your name
And I catch myself falling
Where there is love
Sometimes there's pain
Soon my love is falling
So, please be gentle
Please be gentle
When you're loving me
I'll be gentle, yeah
I'm in a daze
I'm so confused
Since you have
Stopped running
I'll take my time
I'll wait for you
Cause I know you'll be coming
I'll be gentle
Baby, I'm gonna be gentle
When I'm loving you
When I'm loving you
When I'm loving you
Wanting to please you
Baby girl
You've got me calling
Calling out your name
Yeah
I'll be gentle
When I'm loving you
When I'm loving you, baby
Holding you
When you're lying next to me
Calling your name, baby, yeah
Hey, baby, baby, baby
Baby, you, you've got me
Yeah, calling
Calling, calling your name
Baby, you've got me calling
Calling, calling your name
Babe, I'm calling, calling
Calling your name, yeah
Calling, calling
Calling your name
Calling, calling
I will be calling your name
I don't ever wanna stop
Loving you, girl
So don't you ever stop
Being in my world
I don't ever wanna quit
Loving you, boy
So don't you ever stop
Giving me joy...
