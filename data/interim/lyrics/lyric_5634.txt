There was a time
We'd sit in the backyard 'cause the house would get so hot
From the summer sun
There was no way of sleeping
And you'd play your old guitar
We'd fight mosquitos and enjoy
You backyard concerts for we had no television
We'd just begun our life
As man and wife and hardships then
Could scarcely scare us into quitting
Things were far from being fine
We often dined upon a dime
But there never was a time we didn't love
And that Christmas brought our saddest days
When your pride gave way when you told the kids
There'd be no gifts cause we were broke
Though their little tears of grief were so hard to see
It didn't hurt me
Like the lump I knew was in your throat
It was then with arms entwined
We both broke down and cried
For it seemed like nothing good would ever come
The doctor bills we couldn't pay
They came and took our car away
But there never was a time we didn't love
Now there's an easy chair for my back
A satin pillow for my head
And the kids are wild about the brand new car
You and I can order steak with all the trimmings and not worry
If we've spent a dollar more than we can spare
No wonder in our prayers
We've thanked the man upstairs who led us through
The years of raising kids and paying bills
And I think he guided us
Not because we were smart but just because
There never was a time we didn't love
No there never was a time never was a time
There never was a time we didn't love
