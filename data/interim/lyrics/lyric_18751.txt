I do not know why I act the way I do
Like I ain't got a single thing to lose
Sometimes I am my own worst enemy
I guess that is just the cowboy in me
I got a life that most would love to have
But sometimes I still wake up fighting mad
At where this road I am heading down might lead
I guess that is just the cowboy in me
The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that is never satisfied
The face that is in the mirror when I do not like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me
The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that is never satisfied
The face that is in the mirror when I do not like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me
Girl I know there's times you must have thought
There ain't a line you've drawn I haven't crossed
But you set your mind to see this love on through
I guess that's just the cowboy in you
We ride and never worry about the fall
I guess that's just the cowboy in us all
