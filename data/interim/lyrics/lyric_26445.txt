Yeah
Hey
Real hot girl shit
Ah
Hey, hey
Baow, baow
Look, why you wanna do the bad bitch wrong? 
'Bout to make this every bad bitch song 
Don't you hate when you hold a nigga down
Then he switch up on you, turn out to be a clown? 
Look , I ain't in my feelings with it 
Turn around, poke it out, bitch, get it, get it 
Turn up on 'em, make 'em kill the noise
We ain't goin' back and forth with the lil' boys
Shh, cut the noise
I ain't goin' back and forth with these lil' boys 
I'm a February baby, I'm a big flirt 
I gotta give a nigga space when his feelings hurt 
Ayy, look, cut the shit
I ain't goin' back and forth with a broke bitch 
Jawbreaker, I ain't fuckin' with thе sucker shit 
If I cut her off, thеn I mean it and it's fuck a bitch
The more I ignore you, the more you adore me 
Crazy-ass niggas need to come with a warnin' 
Is he crazy 'bout me or he just crazy? You been trippin' lately 
Nigga too attached, got him actin' like a titty baby 
Bullet wounds, backstabs, mama died, still sad
At war with myself, in my head, bitch, it's Baghdad 
New nigga tryna come around and play clean 
And my clothes fit tight, but my heart need a seamstress 
Look, why you wanna do the bad bitch wrong? 
'Bout to make this every bad bitch song 
Don't you hate when you hold a nigga down
Then he switch up on you, turn out to be a clown? 
Look, I ain't in my feelings with it 
Turn around, poke it out, bitch, get it, get it 
Turn up on 'em, make 'em kill the noise
We ain't goin' back and forth with the lil' boys
One, never let a nigga see you sweat 
Two, never let these niggas come between a check 
Three, never let a nigga turn you 'gainst me 
'Cause the dick come and go, but I'm ridin' past E 
Keep that shit player, I don't like gettin' personal
Treat 'em like a job, when I get 'em, I'm workin' 'em 
Niggas love usin' Instagram like a journal 
Just like my ass, niggas talkin' in a circle 
Why niggas love to talk down? I don't know 
Like I ain't keepin' all the facts in my phone
Like I ain't got the pictures of you beggin' for forgiveness 
I ain't gotta do the most, I know what the real is 
Ain't the jealous type, please don't believe the hype 
You can't make me mad with some shit that I'ma like 
Don't mean to be intrusive, but you thinkin' you exclusive
When a party ain't a party if my bitches ain't included 
Look, why you wanna do the bad bitch wrong? 
'Bout to make this every bad bitch song 
Don't you hate when you hold a nigga down
Then he switch up on you, turn out to be a clown? 
Look, I ain't in my feelings with it 
Turn around, poke it out, bitch, get it, get it 
Turn up on 'em, make 'em kill the noise
We ain't goin' back and forth with the lil' boys
Why you wanna do the bad bitch wrong?
'Bout to make this every bad bitch song, ayy
Don't you hate when you hold a nigga down
Then he switch up on you, turn out to be a clown? Ayy
Look, I ain't in my feelings with it
Turn around, poke it out, bitch, get it, get it
Turn up on 'em, make 'em kill the noise
We ain't goin' back and forth with the lil' boys
We ain't goin' back and forth with the lil' boys
