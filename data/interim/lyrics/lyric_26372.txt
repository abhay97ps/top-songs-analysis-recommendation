The stars go out on the Sunset Strip
But after last call, ours still stay lit
Make a twenty last like it's 1990
Way out here where we're from
We don't say, "Ooh-la-la, Pérignon"
Don't need no bottle service budget 
Got no money, but we love it 
Raisin' plastic cups to a life of luxury
C'est la vie on a Friday
We get dressed up in a blue jean tux
And we go where we don't hear the highway
Don't need doubles and bubbles
To get in all kinds of trouble out in the country
Don't need a crystal chandelier to have a real good time
We're drinkin' beer on a champagne night
A champagne night
No velvet booths in our hometown bar
Our VIPs are drinkin' PBR
No, we don't need a high-rise skyline view from a window
'Cause way out here 
Where we're from 
We don't have to be fancy to have a whole lotta fun
Raisin' plastic cups to a life of luxury
C'est la vie on a Friday
We get dressed up in a blue jean tux
And we go where we don't hear the highway
Don't need doubles and bubbles
To get in all kinds of trouble out in the country
Don't need a crystal chandelier to have a real good time
We're drinkin' beer on a champagne night
Champagne night
You'll never see us sippin' long-stem glasses
Even if we're in a Hollywood palace
We ain't on our own island
No, we ain't drippin' in diamonds
We're gettin' rhinestoned
Raisin' plastic cups to a life of luxury
C'est la vie on a Friday
We get dressed up in a blue jean tux
And we go where we don't hear the highway
Don't need doubles and bubbles
To get in all kinds of trouble out in the country
Don't need a crystal chandelier to have a real good time
We're drinkin' beer on a champagne night
Drinkin' beer on a champagne night
We're drinkin' beer on a champagne night
I'm drinkin' beer on a champagne night
Drinkin' beer on a champagne night
We're drinkin' beer on a champagne night
We're drinkin' beer on a champagne night
