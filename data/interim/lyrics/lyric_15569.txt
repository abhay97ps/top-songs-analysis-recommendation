I saw you walking down our street well you looked quite neat
Baggy jeans and long blond hair with not a care in the world
What happened to the attitude you used to have at school?
What happened to the attitude where you broke all the rules?
I saw you just the other week well we did not speak
You turned your back and flicked your hair as if you did not care
Well, I don't care where you come from, I don't give a damn
I don't care where you come from it's all a sham
You're so special
Oh, so special
Oh, so special
She sings
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on my groovy train
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on my groovy train
She sings
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on my groovy train
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on my groovy train
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on my groovy train
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on my groovy train
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on, get on, get on
Get it on, get on
Groovy train
Groovy train
You're so special 
Oh, so special
You're so special 
Oh, so special
