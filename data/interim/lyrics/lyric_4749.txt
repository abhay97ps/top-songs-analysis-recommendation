Kentucky woman
She shine with her own kind of light
She'd look at you once
In a day, that's all wrong
Well, it's alright
And I love her
God knows, I love her
Kentucky woman
If she get to know you
She goin' to own you
Kentucky woman
Well, she ain't the kind make heads turn
At the drop of her name
But something inside that she's got
Turns you on just the same
And she loves me
God knows, she loves me
Kentucky woman
If she get to know you
She goin' to own you
Kentucky woman
I don't want much
The good Lord's earth beneath my feet
A gentle touch
From that one girl
And life is
Sweet and good
Ain't no doubt
I'm talkin' about
Kentucky woman
If she get to know you
She goin' to own you
Kentucky woman
I don't want much
The good Lord's earth beneath my feet
A gentle touch
From that one girl
And life is
Sweet and good
There ain't no doubt
I'm talkin' about
Kentucky woman
If she get to know you
She goin' to own you
Kentucky woman
Kentucky Woman
