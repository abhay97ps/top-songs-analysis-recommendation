Dance, do you wanna see me dance
I'm dancing my life away
Baby, you've got take this chance
And love while the music play
You know it's all so easy
You know it's all so right
It's such a deep down feeling
I've got to let it out if it takes all night
My love is Music
My love is Love
My love is Music
My love is Music
My love is Love
My love is Music
Baby, I gonna you put you on
The boogie's in town tonight
And baby you know it can be wrong
So cool it and down the light
It's like a storm inside me
It's like I'm half in sane
I feel the music ride me
Hou! I got to dance, dance to ease my pain
My love is Music
