You were the only one I could see
Now that we're through, if you think of me
Think of the good times, only the good times
Walks in the rain, warm summer nights
Remember the kisses and not just the fights
One foolish moment drove us apart
If there's a spark still left in your heart
Think of the good times, only the good times
You in my arms, two hearts like one
Don't tell me that it is over and done
Once we promised we'd love forever 
Can't we let these wonderful memories bring us together again
If you'll admit you think of me yet
Darlin' come back, forgive and forget
Think of the good times, we'll only have good times
Your lips on mine 
Where they belong
But this time we won't let our good times go wrong
We'll think of the good times, only the good times
Yeah, we'll think of the good times, only the good times
Oh, we'll think of the good times, only the good times
