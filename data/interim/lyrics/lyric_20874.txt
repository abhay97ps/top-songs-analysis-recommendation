I still feel 25 most of the time
I still raise a little Cain with the boys
Honky Tonks and pretty women
But Lord I'm still right there with'em
Singing above the crowd and the noise
Sometimes I feel like Jesse James
Still trying to make a name
Knowing nothing's gonna change what I am
I was a young troubador
When I wrote in on a song
And I'll be an old troubador when I'm gone
Well the truth about a mirror
Is that a damn old mirror
Don't really tell the whole truth
It don't show what's deep inside
Or read between the lines
And it's really no reflection of my youth
Sometimes I feel like Jesse James
Still trying to make a name
Knowing nothing's gonna change what I am
I was a young troubador
When I wrote in on a song
And I'll be an old troubador when I'm gone
I was a young troubador
When I wrote in on a song
And I'll be an old troubador when I'm gone
I'll be an old troubador when I'm gone
