Short days, long nights, tangled up with you
I don't wanna move
Your eyes don't lie
And if I needed proof, that body tell the truth
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Your body is a blessing
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't know if I deserve it
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Before round two, I've got a question for you, babe
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good?
Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good?
Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good?
On the tip of my tongue
The flavor of your skin lingers on my lips
Each time we dine
We do it again, again and again, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Your body is a blessing, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
What'd I do to deserve it? 
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Before round three, I've got a question for you, baby
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good? 
Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good?
Why does it feel so good?
Tell me what it is
If it ain't love
 Oh, babe
Why does it feel so good? 
If it ain't love
 Then what is it?
Why does it feel so good?
 Aw, yeah
You know soon that you walk in, it going up, going up
Slow it down for me, girl, we ain't gotta rush it 
Always a movie, we ain't saying much
Baby, I'm just your type, I know what bad girls like
But I'll confess tonight
Your body is a blessing, oh yeah
What'd I do to deserve it?
Short days and long nights, yeah
If it ain't love
 Why does it feel so good?
 Why does it feel so good?
 Tell me what it is
If it ain't love
 Why does it feel so good?
 Why does it feel so good?
 So good, yeah, yeah
If it ain't love 
  What is it?

Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
  Then what is it?
  What is it?
Why does it feel so good?
