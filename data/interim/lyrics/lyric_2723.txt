Well, he rocks in the treetop all the day long
Rocking and a-bopping and singing a song
All the little birds on Sunset Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet, tweet, tweet
Rocking robin
Come on and go, rocking robin
You really go, rocking robin
'Cause you're really gonna rock tonight
Every little swallow, out across the sea
Back from Capistrano, where we oughta be
Every single bird in Californ-i-a
Gather 'round the robin singin' hey, hey hey
Rocking robin
Come on and go, rocking robin
You really go, rocking robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight
Well, a pretty little raven round 'Frisco Bay
Went flirtin' with the robin all through the day
They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole
He rocks in the treetop all the day long
Hopping and a-bopping and singing a song
All the little birds on Sunset Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet, tweet, tweet
Rocking robin
Come on now, go, rocking robin
Yeah, go, rocking robin
Hey, rock, rock, rock tonight
Oh well, a pretty little raven round 'Frisco Bay
A-flew with the robin all through the day
They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole
Every little swallow, out across the sea
Back from Capistrano, where he oughta be
Every single bird in Californ-i-a
Gather 'round the robin singin' hey, hey hey
Rocking robin
Come on and go, rocking robin
Hey now, go, rockin' robin
'Til I rock, rock, rock tonight
