Sally go 'round the roses 
Sally go 'round the roses 
Roses they won't hurt you 
Roses they can't hurt you 
Sally don't you go, don't you go downtown
Sally don't you go-oh, don't you go downtown
Saddest thing in the whole wide world
Is to see your baby with another girl
Sally go 'round 
'Round and around 
Sally go 'round 
'Round and around 
Saddest thing in the whole wide world
Is to see your baby with another girl
Sally go 'round the roses 
Sally go 'round the roses 
They won't tell your secret 
They won't tell your secret 
Sally baby cry, let your hair hang down
Sally baby cry, let your hair hang down
Sit and cry where the roses grow
You can sit and cry now so we'll know
Sally go 'round 
'Round and around 
Sally go 'round 
'Round and around 
Saddest thing in the whole wide world
Is to see your baby with another girl
Sally go 'round the roses 
Sally go 'round the roses 
Sally go 'round the roses 
Sally go 'round the roses
