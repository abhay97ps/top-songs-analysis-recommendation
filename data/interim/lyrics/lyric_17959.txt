You think I'm always making
Something out of nothing
You're saying everything's okay
You've always got an answer
Before I ask the question
Whatever you say
Now we can change the subject
Pretend I never brought it up
Same old story anyway
Later we can work it out
Right now you're talked out
Yeah, whatever you say
Oh I know you can hear me
But I'm not sure you're listening
I hear what you're saying
But still there's something missing
Whether I go whether I stay
Right now depends on
Whatever you say
You say yes you need me
And no you wouldn't leave me
And this should be enough to make me stay
And even though I want to
I don't hear I love you
In whatever you say
Oh whether I go whether I stay
Right now depends on
Whatever you say
