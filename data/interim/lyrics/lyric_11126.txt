It's a night, oh yeah
For beautiful girls
It's a night, yes it is
For beautiful girls
Something's gonna happen here tonight
I can feel it
Stay with me 'til mornin'
I really need it
It's a night, oh yeah
For beautiful girls
It's a night, woh woh woh
For beautiful girls
Girls girls girls girls girls everywhere
Girls girls girls girls girls, in my hair
Goin' to a nightclub
And I peek under the table
Maybe find some legs down there
That look like Betty Grable
It's a night, oh yeah
For beautiful girls
What is it
It's a night, it's a night
For beautiful girls
Goin' to a nightclub
And I drink some more tequila
Maybe find some legs down there
I can give a little feel-a
It's a night, oh yeah
For beautiful girls
What is it
It's a night, it's a night
For beautiful girls
It's a night
It's a night
It's a night
