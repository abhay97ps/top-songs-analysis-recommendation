Can...
Ohhh...
Each morning I get up, I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet 
Take a look in the mirror and cry 
Lord, what you're doing to me!
I've spent all my years believing you 
But I just can't get no relief 
Lord, somebody, oooh somebody 
 Can anybody find me somebody to love?
I work hard everyday of my life 
I work 'til I ache in my bones!
At the end 
I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own 
I get down on my knees and I start to pray 
'Til the tears run down from my eyes 
Lord, somebody, ohhh somebody 
 Can anybody find me somebody to love?
 Oh, everyday...
I try, and I try, and I try 
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
 They say I got a lot of water in my brain
I got no common sense, I got nobody left to believe
No... 
Oh somebody, oh somebody 
Can anybody find me...
Somebody to love? 
Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat 
I'm ok, I'm alright 
I ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord! 
Ohhh...
Hee, oooh...
Somebody...
Ohhh...
Ohhh...
Oh, find me, find me...
Somebody to love?
Somebody find me
Find me
Somebody find me
Somebody to love
Somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody to love
Love, oooh...
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Find me somebody too...love...
