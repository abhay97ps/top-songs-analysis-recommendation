Let's go
Wait a minute, who are you? 
Pick up, pick up, pick up
Better watch his lil' bitch 'cause I'm up off the liquor
I been turnin' her down, she on go, tryna get up
Crack a smile at your ho, she gon' fall out and shiver
Nigga going out sad 'bout the ho, he a Skittle 
Take the jet to New York like I'm Jigga 
When you poppin', you know that come with paparazzi
I hate going outside, they all know I'm that nigga 
Slide on a nigga, they drive through like Wendy's 
They all pray for the time of the day, I been busy
I turned her down, now that lil' nigga picky
She wasn't gettin' no money, I told her to miss me
Oh, y'all like takin' pictures? Think y'all niggas sissy
My lil' nigga been loyal, I threw him a fifty
I pull up in an Escalade, hop out in Timberlands
My bitch, she got finger wave hair like she Missy 
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
I look better in person, lil' ho, I get jiggy
Spend that lil' money, I ain't tryna save it
We ain't tripping on none of that, bitch, we got plenty 
Bread on your head, bitch, I'm Jiffy
Fuck around, drop a movie on niggas like 50
If Big Worm would've pulled up, I would've start hitting
If Deebo choked me out, bitch, I would've killed him, bitch
Pick up, pick up, pick up
Better watch his lil' bitch 'cause I'm up off the liquor
I been turnin' her down, she on go, tryna get up
Crack a smile at your ho, she gon' fall out and shiver
Nigga going out sad 'bout the ho, he a Skittle 
Take the jet to New York like I'm Jigga 
When you poppin', you know that come with paparazzi 
I hate going outside, they all know I'm that nigga 
Pick up, pick up, don't pick up the phone
I'm trappin', lil' nigga, don't pick up 
We been havin' drip and I'm puttin' that shit on
And I'm lightnin', I'm icin', I'm flooding my wrist up 
Add it up, nigga, just put your lil' 'fit up 
Yes, sir , put that lil' shit up 
Bad bitch, look like she do sit-ups 
I bought the Lamborghini just to get up 
Keep talkin' that talk and I popped him, laughin'
Skrrt , yeah, I'm ducking the traffic 
I'm doing this shit in spectacular fashion 
Straight out the Nawf and that chopper get tactic 
Shoot up the floor , I got him dancing, dancing
Shake that bitch out of your panties
I am the Cho , what did I score? 
Ho, you already know I'm the G.O.A.T. 
Pick up, pick up, pick up
Better watch his lil' bitch 'cause I'm up off the liquor
I been turnin' her down, she on go, tryna get up
Crack a smile at your ho, she gon' fall out and shiver
Nigga going out sad 'bout the ho, he a Skittle 
Take the jet to New York like I'm Jigga 
When you poppin', you know that come with paparazzi
I hate going outside, they all know I'm that nigga
