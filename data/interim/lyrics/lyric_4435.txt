Oh you're the kind of girl who's got theirself wound up in a ball
Oh - you think you live - but how can ya
Locked up in four walls
If you gotta go you better live your life before you pass away
Don't waste a day
All your life's been spent locked in your room
You never had a chance to roam - away from home
So - You're gonna go - Go today - Don't waste any time
For in life a day - Is worth a million - Soon you will find
If you gotta go you better live your life before you pass away
Don't waste a day
All your life's been spent locked in your room
You never had a chance to roam - away from home
Live Live Live Live
Live Live Live Live
Now - Do what you want - Go where you want
It's all up to you
For in life the rule - Is just to do
What you want to do
If you gotta go you better live your life before you pass away
Don't waste a day
All your life's been spent locked in your room
You never had a chance to roam - away from home
If - You don't know now - What life's about
Go on now and live
And if - You don't know how - It's not so hard
Just let go and live
If you gotta go you better live your life before you pass away
Don't waste a day
All your life's been spent locked in your room
You never had a chance to roam - away from home
Live Live Live Live
