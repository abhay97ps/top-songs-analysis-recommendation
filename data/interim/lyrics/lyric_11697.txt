Oooohhh
The stars on 45
Keeps on burning in your mind
But we can work it out
Remember, twist and shout
You still donâ€™t tell me why
You know it why
Voulez-vous 
Take it now or leave it 
Now it's all we get 
Nothing promised, no regrets
Voulez-vous
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me, SOS
The love you gave me, nothing less can save me, SOS
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
Like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
Aha-ahaaa
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
Knowing me, knowing you 
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you 
We just have to face it
This time we're through
Breakin' up is never easy
I know but I have to go
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
I don't wanna talk
About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny
Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
