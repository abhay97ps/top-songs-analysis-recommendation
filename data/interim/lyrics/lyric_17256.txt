I don't want to be without your love
'Cause you're the only one I'm thinking of baby
I'm afraid to live without your love
So baby don't you go away
I don't want to be without your love
'Cause you're the only one I'm thinking of baby
I'm afraid to live without your love
So baby don't you go away
These feelings I have inside my soul
There's no words that can describe
The way that you hold me
The way that you need me
The way that you make me feel when I'm with you
In the heat of the night I call your name
And you set me on fire like a burning flame
From the moment you touched me my heart beats fast
And my passion wants to take control
I don't want to be without your love
'Cause you're the only one I'm thinking of baby
I'm afraid to live without your love
So baby don't you go away
I don't want to be without your love
'Cause you're the only one I'm thinking of baby
I'm afraid to live without your love
So baby don't you go away
As the sun goes down, and I close my eyes
All my dreams they are of you
They're filled with emotions and visions that keep me
Keep me reminded of the life we share
When I'm alone I imagine how it would be
If there were never a you to care for me
No one else could make me feel this way
So I'm never gonna let you go
I don't want to be without your love
'Cause you're the only one I'm thinking of baby
I'm afraid to live without your love
So baby don't you go away
I don't want to be without your love
'Cause you're the only one I'm thinking of baby
I'm afraid to live without your love
So baby don't you go away
Los sentimientos que tengo en mi corazon
No hay manera de describir
Como me sostienes y me necesitas
La manera que me haces sentir
Nadie mas en mi vida me dara
El amor que ofreces sin cesar
Durante tiempos deficil conte en ti
Te amare por enternidad
I don't want to be without your love
'Cause you're the only one I'm thinking of baby
I'm afraid to live without your love
So baby don't you go away
I don't want to be without your love
'Cause you're the only one I'm thinking of baby
I'm afraid to live without your love
So baby don't you go away
