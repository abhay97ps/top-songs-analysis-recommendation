Written by Bo Gentry and Joey Levine 
I know, you know
Everybody knows it's true
I'm in love
But it's only make believe to you
I love your love
All the things that lovers do now, baby
I can tell
That it's only make believe to you
I said-a ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
It's only make believe to you, girl
It's only make believe, you're driving me insane
It's only make believe to you, girl
Baby, baby, baby, baby, I can't stand the pain
I kiss, you kiss
But I ain't getting through
No I don't
'Cause it's only make believe to you
I cry, oh my
But you ain't crying too, baby
No you don't
'Cause it's only make believe to you
I said-a ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
It's only make believe to you, girl
It's only make believe, you're driving me insane
It's only make believe to you, girl
Baby, baby, baby, baby, I can't take the pain
