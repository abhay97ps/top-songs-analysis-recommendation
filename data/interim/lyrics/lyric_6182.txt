Slippin' away, sittin' on a pillow
Waitin' for night to fall
Girl and a dream, sittin' on a pillow
This is the night to go to the celebrity ball
Satin and lace, isn't it a pity?
Didn't find time to call
Ready or not, gonna make it to the city, oh
This is the night to go to the celebrity ball
Dress up tonight
Why be lonely?
You'll stay at home, and you'll be alone
So why be lonely?
Sittin' alone, sittin' on a pillow
Waitin' to climb the walls
Maybe tonight, depending how your dream goes
She'll open her eyes when she goes to the celebrity ball
Dress up tonight
Why be lonely?
You'll stay at home, and you'll be alone
So why be lonely?
