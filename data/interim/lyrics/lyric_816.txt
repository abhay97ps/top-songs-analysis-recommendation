Sacred 
Our love is sacred 
Church bells were ringing
On the Sunday we met 
But our love is like a flame in the night
And like a flame, dear, it burns itself of sight
And I'm still searching 
I'll find you some day 
Sun will be shining 
And I'll give you my ring 
And you'll be looking
Like the Sunday we met
