I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg, plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me
Ain't to proud to beg, sweet darling
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Now I've heard a crying man is half a man
With no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you
I don't mind weeping
If it'll keep you by my side
Ain't to proud to beg, sweet darling
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to beg, sweet darling
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walking away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
'Cause I wanna keep you any way I can
Ain't to proud to beg, sweet darling
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to beg, sweet darling
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Put yourself in my place
I only for a little while
Come on, try it, come on, try it
Come on, try it 
Put yourself in my place
I only for a little while
Come on, try it, come on, try it
Come on, try it 
Ain't to proud to beg, sweet darling
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
