They look at you in a way that's kind of lazy
They look away and they just don't care
They're hard to get
It really drives you crazy
A major challenge for the ones who dare
What you see is what you get
And they're so hard to forget
Don't mess with shy boys
They'll stay out of the way
You never know what you're gonna get
When you date shy boys
Shy boys
Shy boys are dangerous for me
I melt like honey in their hands
When I see shy boys
I don't know why
But I can never resist him
When a boy is shy
He really gets to me
He looks so cute
And almost kind of helpless
That I just want to take him home with me
When you meet that perfect smile
It's a guy who's really wild
Don't mess with shy boys
They'll stay out of the way
You never know what you're gonna get
When you date shy boys
Shy boys
Shy boys are dangerous for me
I melt like honey in their hands
When I see shy boys
He's really not so nonchalant
This boy is everything
You could ever want
Oh, yeah
Shy boys turn my head around
Upside down always happens
In this world of macho guys
Shy boys are my main attraction
Shy boys
They'll stay out of the way
You never know
What you're gonna get
When you date shy boys
Shy boys
Shy boys
Are dangerous for me
I melt like honey in their hands
When I see shy boys
Shy boys
They'll stay out of the way
You never know
What you're gonna get
You never know
Shy boys 
Yeah
Shy boys
I melt like honey
In their hands
Shy boys, shy boys
You never know
What you're gonna get
