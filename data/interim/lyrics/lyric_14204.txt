It's twilight world
It's twilight world
Time out
World in a hurry
There's more love than money changing hands
Lights out
Thinking out loud
Turn your back on the world outside
Night thoughts
No one can share
As darkness breaks through another day
Secrets
Talking out loud
Silence waits just a dream away
Forget lonely crowds, unfriendly faces
They'll soon became familiar places
Before too long, before too long
Don't be fooled by love songs and lonely hearts
You're living in a twilight world
Don't be fooled by love songs and lonely hearts
Don't give in to the twilight world
Time out
World in a hurry
There's more love than money changing hands
Lights out
Thinking out loud
Turn your back on the world outside
Forget lonely crowds, unfriendly faces
They'll soon became familiar places
Before too long, before too long
Don't be fooled by love songs and lonely hearts
You're living in a twilight world
Don't be fooled by love songs and lonely hearts
Don't give in to the twilight world
Don't be fooled by love songs and lonely hearts
You're living in a twilight world
Don't be fooled by love songs and lonely hearts
Don't give in to the twilight world
