A part of me wants to leave you alone
A part of me wants for you to come home
A part of me says I'm living a lie
A part of me says to think it through
A part of me says I'm over you
A part of me wants to say goodbye
A part of me is asking why...
A part of me wants to leave
But a part of me wants to be here with you
And every time I think that we're over and done you do something to get me back loving you
And you got me just torn
Torn in between the two 
Cause I really wanna be with you
But something's telling me I should leave you alone
Leave you alone
Leave you alone
And you got me just torn in between the two
Cause I really wanna be with you
But something's telling me I should leave you alone
Leave you alone
Leave you alone
There were no issues when we started out
It was cool
It was everything that love's about
But something happened
Plus I'm feeling so burnt out
Now oh
A part of me says it's all my fault
A part of me says "he ain't what you want"
A part of me says to get my bags
A part of me says I can't do that
A part of me wants to leave
But a part of me wants to be here with you
And every time I think that it's over and done you make me fall back in love
You got me just torn
Torn in between the two
Cause I really wanna be with you
But something's telling me I should leave you alone
Leave you alone
Leave you alone
And you got me just torn in between the two
Cause I really wanna be with you
But something's telling me I should leave you alone 
Leave you alone 
Leave you alone 
So many times I... 
So many times I... 
So many times I...
Now I'm sitting here and I'm so confused
Cause I keep fighting myself for you
Torn in between the two 
Cause I really wanna be with you 
But something's telling me I should leave you alone
Leave you alone
Leave you alone 
And you got me just torn in between the two 
Cause I really wanna be with you 
But something's telling me I should leave you alone
Leave you alone
Leave you alone. 
And you got me just torn in between the two 
Cause I really wanna be with you 
But something's telling me I should leave you alone 
Leave you alone
Leave you alone
And you got me just torn in between the two
Cause I really wanna be with you
But something's telling me I should leave you alone
Leave you alone
Leave you alone
And you got me just torn in between the two
Cause I really wanna be with you
But something's telling me I should leave you alone
Leave you alone
Leave you alone
And you got me just torn in between the two
Cause I really wanna be with you
But something's telling me I should leave you alone
Leave you alone
