My feelings
For you just can't stop
I'm willing
To prove my love to you
So don't let us part
What you say and what you do
Are two different things
Don't say that you love me
And mess up my brain
Got to tell me something
Something, something
Got to tell me something
Something, something
First you say you love me
And then you say you don't
Tell me something
Tell me something
When you touch me
The fire begins
And when you kiss me
I want to say I love you
Again and again
I may seem confused
But I just can't stop loving you
Tell me something
Tell me something
Tell me something
Tell me something
Maurice, take it to the bridge
Get ready
Got to tell me something
You got to tell me something, boy
Tell me with all your love
