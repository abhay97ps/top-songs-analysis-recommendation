PCD
T.O.P
Top of the world
Give me them bright lights, long nights 
Party till the sun is rising
High rise, over time 
Give me them bright lights, long nights
Party till the sun is rising
High rise, over time
Work until the moon is shining
Hot guys, fly girls
Never thought I'd say
I feel on top of the world
I feel on top of the world, hey
I'm ready for the pressure
The drama and the pleasure
Got my whole life here in front of me
I'm taking over when I hit the streets
Glamour, glitter and gold
Nothing is stopping you, nothing is stopping me
This frenzy, out of control
I must stay in pursue, do what I gotta do
Give me them bright lights, long nights
Party till the sun is rising
High rise, over time
Work until the moon is shining
Hot guys, fly girls
Never thought I'd say
I feel on top of the world
I feel on top of the world, hey
It's like a rollercoaster 
One step away; I'm closer
I can see it there within' my reach
Won't let the city get on top of me
Glamour, glitter and gold
Nothing is stopping you, nothing is stopping me
This frenzy, out of control
I must stay in pursue, do what I gotta do
Give me them bright lights, long nights
Party till the sun is rising
High rise, over time
Work until the moon is shining
Hot guys, fly girls
Never thought I'd say
I feel on top of the world
I feel on top of the world, hey
I can do it all night long 
They can never place my home 
The only thing I know 
And I have it all
Give me them bright lights, long nights 
High rise, over time
Work until the moon is shining
Hot guys, fly girls
Never thought I'd say
I feel on top of the world
I feel on top of the world, hey
Give me them bright lights, long nights
Party till the sun is rising
High rise, over time
Work until the moon is shining
Never thought I'd say
I feel on top of the world
I feel on top of the world, hey
Bright lights, long nights 
High rise, overtime
Hot guys, fly girls
Never thought I'd say
I feel on top of the world, I feel on top of the world
Hey
