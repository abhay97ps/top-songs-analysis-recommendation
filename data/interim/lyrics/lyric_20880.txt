Do you remember
The day I turned to you and said
I didn't like the way he was looking at you
Yeah
How he made you laugh
You just couldn't get what I was saying
It was my imagination
So do you believe me now?
I guess I really wasn't that crazy
And I knew what I was talking about
Every time the sun goes down
He's the one that's holding you baby
Yeah, and me, I'm missing you way across town
So do you believe me now?
I'm kicking myself
For being the one foolish enough
Giving him the chance to step in my shoes
Oooh
He was biding his time
When he saw our love was having a moment of weakness
He was there between us
So do you believe me now?
I guess I really wasn't that crazy
And I knew what I was talking about
Every time the sun goes down
He's the one that's holding you baby
Yeah, and me, I'm missing you way across town
So do you believe me now?
Oh yeah, I bet now you see the light
Oh yeah, what's the use in being right?
We're not the lonely one tonight
So do you believe me now?
I guess I really wasn't that crazy
And I knew what I was talking about
Every time the sun goes down
He's the one that's holding you baby
Yeah, and me, I'm missing you way across town
So do you believe me now?
Yeah
So do you believe me now?
Yeah
Every time the sun goes down
He's the one who's holding you baby
Yeah, and me, I'm missing you way across town
So do you believe me now?
