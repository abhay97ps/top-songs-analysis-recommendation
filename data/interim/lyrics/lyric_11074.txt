Well, there's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time
 I can't tell you 
I can't reveal her name until she's mine
 I can't tell you 
I've tried to make her time and time again
Still we're introduced as nothing but friends
And there's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time
 I can't tell you 
There's a certain chick I've been sweet on since I met her
 I can't tell you 
I can't reveal her name until I get her
 I can't tell you 
Someday I'm gonna wake up and say 
"I'll do anything just to be your slave"
And there's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time
 I can't tell you
