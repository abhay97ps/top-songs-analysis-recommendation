I've loved you for as long as I remember
And I know I'll love you all of my life
I'll try to stay with you
Oh, yes, I'll try
'Cause you got the power to satisfy me
But there's always something new about you, out of reach, ooh
Music, sweet music
You're the queen of my soul, ooh
Music, sweet music
You're the queen of my soul
Aah, you're a lady, you're my world
Come on and speak to me
Aah, you gotta help me now
To find the right key
Major to minor
Keep it in step
Let me hear, you got to teach me
Your sweet harmony, ooh
Music, sweet music
You're the queen of my soul, ooh
Music, sweet music
You're the queen of my soul
All over the world, there are so many you have gifted
And they give me inspiration every day
You're my way of life, yeah, ooh
I know that we will always stay together
And I will love you strong
'Cause you've got me flyin' on the wings of a song, hey
Look on the floor now, take me higher
Give it to me one more time and let me pass it on, ooh
Music, sweet music
You're the queen of my soul, woo
Music, sweet music
You're the queen of my soul, woo
Music , sweet music
You're the queen of my soul
Woo, ooh
Music , sweet music 
You're the queen of my soul
Music , sweet music 
You're the queen of my soul 
Music , sweet music 
You're the queen of my soul 
Music , sweet music
You're the queen of my soul
Music , sweet music 
You're the queen of my soul 
Music, sweet music 
You're the queen of my soul 
Music, sweet music 
You're the queen of my soul
Music , sweet music 
You're the queen of my soul 
Music 
Pass the music on
Gotta pass the music on, pass it on
Don't you keep it locked inside yourself
Music , sweet music
You're the queen of my soul 
Music , sweet music 
You're the queen of my soul 
Music, sweet music 
You're the queen of my soul
