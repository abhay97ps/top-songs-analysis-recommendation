No man is an island
No, no man is alone
Treat each man as your brother
And remember, each man's dream is your own
Now we need one another
And we all need to try to defend
Treat each man as your brother and each man as your friend
You can't live in this world all by yourself
No, no, no. You can't live alone
And just as sure as you try to make it by yourself, you're going to wake up and find you're going to need somebody else
No man is an island. No man is alone
Treat each man as your brother and remember that each man's dream -- is your own
