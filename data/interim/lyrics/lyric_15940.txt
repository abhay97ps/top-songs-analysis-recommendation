Mother, mother, tell your children
That their time has just begun
I have suffered for my anger
There are wars that can't be won
Father, father, please believe me
I am layin' down my guns
I am broken like an arrow
Forgive me, forgive your wayward son
Mother, mother
Please believe me
And it's hard to hold on when there's no one to lean on
Faith, you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord we've gotta keep the faith
Faith, don't you let your love turn to hate
Now we've gotta keep the faith
Keep the faith, keep the faith
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith
Tell me, baby, when I hurt you
Do you keep it all inside?
Do you tell me all's forgiven
And just hide behind your pride? Yeah
Mother, father
Please don't leave me
Well, it's hard to be strong when there's no one to dream on
Faith, you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord we've gotta keep the faith
Faith, don't you know it's never too late
Right now we've gotta keep the faith
Faith, don't you let your love turn to hate
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith
Keep the faith, keep the faith
Oh, we've gotta keep the faith
Keep the faith, keep the faith
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been walking in the footsteps, of society's lies
I don't like what I see no more, sometimes I wish that I was blind
Sometimes I wait forever, to stand out in the rain
So no one sees me crying, trying to wash away this pain
Mother, father 
There's things I've done I can't erase
And every night we fall from grace
It's hard with the world in your face 
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on 
Faith, you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord you gotta keep the faith
Faith, don't you let your love turn to hate
Right now we've gotta keep the faith
Keep the faith, keep the faith
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on, yeah
Keep the faith, keep the faith
Everybody keep the faith
Keep the faith, keep the faith
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Everybody needs somebody to love
Everybody needs somebody to hate
Everybody needs somebody to love
Everybody needs
Everybody, keep the faith
Faith
Faith
