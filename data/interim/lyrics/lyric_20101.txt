It's all the same, only the names will change
Everyday it seems we're wasting away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
I'm wanted dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
Sometimes when you're alone all you do is think
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted  dead or alive
I'm wanted  dead or alive
Yeah
Ooh, I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted  dead or alive
I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back
I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back
I been everywhere , still I'm standing tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all
'Cause I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted  dead or alive
Well, I'm a cowboy
I've got the night on my side
And I'm wanted  dead or alive
Yeah, I ride , dead or alive
I still drive , dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
