Come back to bed
You've been away too long
I need to hold you tight
Can't close my eyes
Til you lay beside me
Warming up the sense through the night
Hold me, love me
Do it once a night
Hold me, show me
Everything's alright
Hold me, love me
Do it once a night
And if we get down to it
We can do it twice is right
Come back to bed
With your sweet lovin
Spoil me oh so bad
When the day is done
My mind just begs to rest
But I've been saving all the best for last
Hold me, love me
Do it once a night
Just hold me, show me
Everything's alright
Hold me, love me
Do it once a night
And if we get down to it
We can do it twice is right
I still find it hard to believe
That you love me, really love me
So touch me tonight
And show me you're not a dream
Aw
Hold me, love me
Do it once a night
Just hold me, show me
Everything's alright
Hold me, love me
Do it once a night
And if we get down to it
We can do it twice is right
Twice is right
Love me, show me
You've got to touch me
Then you can take me
Hold me
You've got to love me
And touch me
Then you can make me
Hold me, love me
Do it once a night
Just hold me, love me
Show me it's alright
Hold me, love me
Do it once a night
Show me, touch me
Tell me it's alright
Show me, you've got to touch me
And you can take me
Love me, you've got to hold me
