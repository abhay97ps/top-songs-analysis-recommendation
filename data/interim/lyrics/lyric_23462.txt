Who's that shadow holding me hostage? I've been here for days
Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never gonna get away?
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But I fear I'm getting used to being held by you
Baby, look what you've done to me 
Baby, look what you've done now 
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 
Baby, look what you've done to me 
Baby, you got me tied down 
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 
Who's this man that's holding your hand and talking 'bout your eyes? 
Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind 
I know they'll be coming to find me soon 
But my Stockholm Syndrome is in your room
Yeah, I fell for you
Baby, look what you've done to me 
Baby, look what you've done now 
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 
Baby, look what you've done to me 
Baby, you got me tied down 
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 
All my life I've been on my own 
I used the light to guide me home 
But now together we're alone 
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go
Baby, look what you've done
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, look what you've done now
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 
Baby, look what you've done to me 
Baby, you got me tied down 
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 
(Look what you've done to me, baby
Look what you've done to me, baby)
Baby, look what you've done
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, look what you've done to me
