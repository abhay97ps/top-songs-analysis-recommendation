Yeah, yeah, oh
Bum bum bum, boy
Why don't I shake it
Don't get mad and get flaky
'Cause this dance you don't know
Let Aretha you how it go
Just spread your feet out
Move your hands all about
Bend over, big rover
We're gonna tear the joint up
And we're gonna jump
We're gonna  shake a little fun
You're doing fine
Hey, baby, you're right on time
There's a bump
And I hope your mama don't call, no no 
We gonna keep it In the groove
Hey, baby, you're all for me
'Cause your movement just sets me free
Love the way you party hard
Now I don't want nothing to tear us apart
You do, I do fine, yeah
Oh, my partner 'bout to shake a leg
And then one thing I need to know
If you love me, baby, tell me so
Hey  we're gonna jump
We're gonna shake a little fun
You're doing fine
Hey, know you're right on time
Jump up
And I hope my daddy don't call, no no
 We gonna keep it in the groove
Yeah do it, baby
Do it, baby
 Whoa
Bum bum bum bum bum bum, boy
Yeah, yeah 
Jump, jump, jump, baby, jump, baby
