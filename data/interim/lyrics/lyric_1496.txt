Papa-papa-papa-papa-oom-mow-mow
Papa-oom-mow-mow
Pa-papa-oom-mow-mow-mow
Papa-oom-mow-mow
Doot-doot-doot
Doot-doot-doot
Funniest sound I ever heard
And I can't understand a single word
Now, if he's serious or is he playin'
Oom-mow-mow is all he say
Papa-hoo
Papa-papa-papa-hoo
Doot-doot-doot
Doot-doot-doot
I said-a hey there, partner, what's your name?
Now, don't you dare tell me the same old thing
The words you sing I can't figure out
But you got a sound make me stomp and shout
Papa-hoo
Papa-papa-papa-hoo
Doot-doot-doot, doot, doot
Doot-doot-doot, doot, doot
Doot-doot-doot
Doot-doot-doot
Doot-doot-doot
A-papa-papa-papa-papa-oom-mow-mow
Papa-oom-mow-mow
Doot-doot-doot, doot, doot
Doot-doot-doot, doot, doot
Doot-doot-doot, doot, doot
Doot-doot-doot, doot, doot
Now, I hear this sound everywhere I go
On records, TV and radio
And now it's spreadin' out over the land
I still can't seem to understand
Papa-hoo
Papa-papa-papa-hoo
Papa-hoo
Doot, doot, doot, papa-hoo
Doot, doot, doot
Doot-doot-doot
Papa-papa-papa-hoo
Doot, doot, doot
Doot-doot-doot
Papa-papa-papa-hoo
Doot, doot, doot
Doot-doot-doot
Papa-papa-papa-hoo
Doot, doot, doot
Doot-doot-doot
Papa-papa-papa-hoo
Doot, doot, doot
Doot-doot-doot
