Lately I've been thinking, that you don't feel the same
I don't know what it is, all I know is that you changed
Cause we used to be so tight, never apart
And know it seems that you only want to break my heart, oh yeah
And I don't know what I've done to make you feel this way
One minute you call, the next you don't have a thing to say
I'm telling you baby
Somethings going on, the love we used to share is strong
I'm falling out of love with you, and I don't know what to do
Something's going on, the love we used to share is strong
I'm falling out of love with you, and I don't know what to do
Where did I go wrong? What mistake did I make?
Is there someone else? Tell me baby, you found to take my place
Cause now you stay out all night and you don't even call
We barely kiss, we barely hug, we barely touch at all, yea baby
And I can't take no more, this is no way to live
Something must happen, something has got to give
I can feel it, I know, I know there's...
Something's going on, the love we used to share is strong
I'm falling out of love with you, and I don't know what to do
Something's going on, the love we used to share is strong
I'm falling out of love with you, and I don't know what to do
Hey yo, Shawn?
What's up Jay?
You know I was thinking, man I haven't seen
You with your girl in so long, I mean what's going on?
Why don't you tell me?
You know Shawn, I know just how you feel
Because  my girl
 What's up Ski?
Tell them how you feel, 
Something's going on, the love we used to share is string
I'm falling out of love with you, and I don't know what to do
Something's going on, the love we used to share is strong
I'm falling out of love with you, and I don't know what to do
