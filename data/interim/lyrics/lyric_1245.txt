Da, sha-da
Sha-da
Sha-da
When I take my baby home at night
I can't wait to kiss and hold her tight
But right then, the time begins to drag
When she starts searchin' through her bag
She says, "Just a moment, please"
"I can't find my keys"
And here's what happens while he's waitin' for her squeeze
She pulls out
Lipstick, powder, bubble gum and bobby pins
But she can't find her keys 
Curlers, tweezers, cold cream and candy bars
But she can't find her keys 
Nail files, school books, an autograph of Fabian
She can find with ease
But I'm standin' here  waitin' for a goodnight kiss 
'Cause she can't find her keys 
Da, sha-da
Sha-da
Sha-da
She can't find her keys
I give up, go home and go to sleep
But next night, my date with her I keep
Walk her home, we start to kiss and then
It all starts happening again
She says, "Just a moment, please"
"I can't find my keys"
And here's what happens while he's waitin' for her squeeze
She pulls out
Gumdrops, glasses, magazines and tangerines
But she can't find her keys 
Presley records, hairspray and jelly beans
But she can't find her keys 
Eyebrow pencils, perfume and potato chips
And portable batteries
But I'm standin' here  waitin' for a goodnight kiss 
'Cause she can't find her keys 
But he's standin' there waiting for his goodnight kiss
'Cause she can't find her keys
She pulls out
Frozen custard, piano bench
Pretzels and a monkey wrench
Tennis racket, army cots
Pumpkin seeds and coffee pots
Watermelons, goal post
A rabbit's foot and French toast
Fire hydrant, ash can
TV set, electric fan
But she can't find her keys
