Oh! There's never been a woman who could treat me like you do
Who could trample on my pride and play around as much as you
Well, you really shake my mind up with your cheating and your lies
Till at last, I make my mind up and I turn to say goodbye
Suddenly you love me and your arms are open wide
Suddenly there's nothing that could tear you from my side
Everytime it happens, as I turn to walk away
Suddenly you love me and I know I've got to stay
Di di di di, di di di di, di di di di, di di di di
When you find your fascination in the arms of other guys
You must know my reputation comes to nothing in their eyes
Still you take off in a hurry anytime it pleases you
And you only start to worry when I say I'm leaving you
Suddenly you love me and your arms are open wide
Suddenly there's nothing that could tear you from my side
Everytime it happens as I turn to walk away
Suddenly you love me and I know I've got to stay
Di di di di, di di di di, di di di di, di di di di
Oh oh, oh oh! Oh oh, oh oh!
Suddenly you love me and your arms are open wide
Suddenly there's nothing that could tear you from my side
Everytime it happens as I turn to walk away
Suddenly you love me and I know I've got to stay
Di di di di, di di di di, di di di di, di di di di
Oh oh, oh oh! Oh oh, oh oh!
