You broke my heart 'cause I couldn't dance
You didn't even want me around
And now I'm back to let you know I can really shake 'em down
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Now do you love me?
Watch me, now
Ah, work it out baby
Well, you're drivin' me crazy
With just a little bit of soul, now
Now I can mash potatoes, I can do the twist
Tell me, baby, do you like it like this?
Tell me
Tell me
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Now do you love me?
Watch me, now
Ah, work it out baby
Well, you're drivin' me crazy
With just a little bit of soul, now
Now I can mash potatoes, I can do the twist
Tell me, baby, do you like it like this?
Tell me
