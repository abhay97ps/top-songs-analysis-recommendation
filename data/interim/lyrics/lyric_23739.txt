Levels
Levels, levels, levels
Get on my elevator
Baby, we're going up
Give me that now and later, I can't get enough
So much to discover, please don't stop me now 
Every time I touch you, lift right off the ground
Let 'em go, all the one's tryna get in the door 
I'ma go where they all couldn't go 
Up a floor, up a floor, up a floor, oh
I know, we can get higher
There's levels to your love
Yeah, there's levels to your love
And I know, we can get higher
There's levels to your love
And I keep on climbing up
Aww yeah
Just walking up on the ceiling, dancing up on the wall
You and that drug you're dealing, should be against the law
All of this heat keep rising, make you stop, drop, and roll
I’m bottling up the lightning, supernatural
Let 'em go, all the one's tryna get in the door 
I'ma go where they all couldn't go 
Up a floor, up a floor, up a floor, oh
I know, we can get higher
There's levels to your love 
Yeah, there's levels to your love 
And I know, we can get higher 
There's levels to your love
And I keep on climbing up
Levels, levels, levels, levels
Levels to your love
Yeah, heaven can’t reach us
Yeah, we’re high-fiving Jesus
Hey, yeah
And I know, we can get higher
There's levels to your love
Yeah, there's levels to your love
And I know , we can get higher 
There's levels to your love
And I keep on climbing up
Ooh, levels
There's levels to your love, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah, get on my level
There's levels to your love, and I keep on climbing up
