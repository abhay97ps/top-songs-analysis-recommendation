I used to spend most of my time just being alone
Yes I did
Nothing to do, no place to go
Just stayed at home
So I put my blues up on the shelf
And I made up my mind to live a little
So I went on down to the disco
Disco
That's where the happy people go.  
And they're just dancing along to a perfect song
Down at the disco

And they're just dancing along to a perfect song
Down at the disco

All my friends, they wondered what's come over me, yeah
They all say I'm not the same old guy I used to be, yeah

I danced my blues away, they're gone forever
