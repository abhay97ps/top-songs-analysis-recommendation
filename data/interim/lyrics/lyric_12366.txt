Baby, maybe I look like a fool
Standing before you tryin' to figure out
What you do to me
Just to see you, just to hear you speak my name
Makes me feel so weak that I can hardly stand
What you do to me
What you do to me
Feels like poetry
If I only knew what you do to me
Baby, I'm used to being in command
Knowing where I stand but that was long before
You got through with me
Now, I'm beggin' 
Don't let me go down in flames
Don't be playin' games 
'Cause I can't live without
What you do to me
What you do to me
Feels like poetry
If I only knew what you do to me
What you do to me
Is so heavenly
Wish I could do to you what you do to me
Ah, won't you
Keep on holding me
Keep on kissing me
Keep on driving me wild
Keep on touching me
And my mercury
Keeps on driving way up to the sky
What you do to me
Feels like poetry
If I only knew what you do to me
What you do to me
Is so heavenly
Wish I could do to you what you do to me
What you do to me
Feels like poetry
If I only knew what you do to me
What you do to me
Is so heavenly
Wish I could do to you what you do to me
What you do to me
Is like poetry
If I only knew what you do to me
