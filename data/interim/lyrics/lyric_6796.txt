Me and My Arrow
Harry Nilsson
Me and my arrow
Straighter than narrow
Wherever we go, every one knows
It's me and my arrow
Me and my arrow
Taking the high road
Wherever we go, everyone knows
It's me and my arrow
And in the morning when I wake up
She may be gone, I don't know
And we make up just to break up
I'll carry on, oh yes I will
{refrain}
Me and my arrow
Straighter than narrow
Wherever we go, every one knows
It's me and my arrow
Me and my arrow 
{Refrain}
