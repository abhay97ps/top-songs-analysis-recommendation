Well, I been watching you crying
When you do
I just feel like dying
Well, I could give you something
That would ease your mind
Let me give it to you
Just a little bit
Would do you?
It's something you been needing
For a long, long time
Here's some love
Take a little bit of it home with you
Keep it close to you
And save it for a rainy day
Hey, hey, hey
Here's some love
Take a little bit of it home with you
It'll grow with you
And someday you can bring it back to stay
Don't you keep me waiting now
What's the use in hesitating?
You know as well as me
It's what you're looking for, yeah
Put your lips on mine now
We can make it feel so fine now
You never have to be without it anymore
Here's some love
Take a little bit of it home with you
Keep it close to you
And save it for a rainy day
Hey, hey, hey
Here's some love
Take a little bit of it home with you, baby
It'll grow with you
And someday you can bring it back to stay
Here's some love
Take a little bit of it home with you
Keep it close to you
And save it for a rainy day
Hey, hey, hey
Here's some love
Take a little bit of it home with you
It'll grow with you
And someday you can bring it back to stay
