Did you read it in the paper
'Bout the danger comin' your way
She'll tear you up at midnite
Killer on the loose get out of her way
Sex machine terrorizin' dream
Lock the door tonite
She's got it all she can walk thru a wall
Better run for your life
And in the light of day
In hidin' she will stay
Watch out at midnite
Feel her shadow on your face
Midnite maniac: she's a killer at large
Midnite maniac: lock your door
Cause she can't be far
Did you hear it on the radio
Crimes of passion makin' the news
It happened after midnite
In your neighborhood could've been you
Sex machine terrorizin' dream
Lock the door tonite
She's got it all she can walk thru a wall
Better run for your life
And in the light of day
In hidin' she will stay
Watch out at midnite
Feel her shadow on your face
Midnite maniac: she's a killer at large
Midnite maniac: lock your door
Cause she can't be far
Midnite maniac: she's a killer at large
Midnite maniac: lock your door
She knows where you are
Midnite maniac: she's a killer at large
Midnite maniac: lock your door
Cause she can't be far
Midnite maniac: she's a killer at large
Midnite maniac: lock your door
She knows where you are
