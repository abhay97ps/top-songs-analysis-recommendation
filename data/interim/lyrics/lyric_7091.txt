You brought the joy
Back into my life
Oh you put a prayer
Into my life
I was drowning in a river of sorrow
With no hope and no tomorrow
Like a ship I was lost at sea
I didn't know my destiny oh oh
But like a strong wind darling you came
And brought me happiness again
I was sinking deeper in doubt
'Til you came and pulled me out oh
Each road I took
Was always wrong
You gave me every chance
To belong
You brought the joy 
Back into my life
Oh you put the hope 
Into my life
My soul was like an empty well
Where a drop of rain never fell
Like a child who's without a home
I'm not baptized and all alone oh oh
I had a one way ticket to nowhere
At every stop I found despair
Like an angel you came to me
And laid heaven at my feet oh
Each road I took
Was always wrong
You gave me every chance
To belong
You brought the joy
Back into my life 
For putting a prayer
Into my life
You brought the joy 
Back into my life
