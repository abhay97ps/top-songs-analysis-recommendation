If you give me one more chance
I'll prove my love is true
And do all the things
That I'm supposed to do
But if I let you down
And you set me free
Oh, I don't know but I think
I'd just live in misery
There is nothing I can do to
Make up for the
Wrong things I've done
Cause when I met you, pretty baby
I knew you were the only one
But I couldn't see
Just how it would be
Oh, I don't know but I think
I'd just live in misery
Now I sit and cry cause
I lost everything that I had
But I have to go on and
Take the good with the bad
And I still love you
Hope you still love me
Oh, and maybe you'll come back
And end this misery
