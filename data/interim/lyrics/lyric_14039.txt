Show me the way now
Moving step by step to love
Show me, yeah, the way now
Touching where I've never been touched
Everybody's looking for a reason
Making time and calling it love
But you give me all I've ever needed
Don't ever stop filling me up
Oh, , yeah, the way now
Moving step by step to love
Oh baby, won't you
 Show me the way now
Touching where I've never been touched
I've been used and I've been good at using
Running from the pain deep inside
But you make me feel the joy of living
And all the tears I've never cried
So
 Show me the way now
Moving step by step to love
Oh, baby, won't you
 Show me the way now
Touching where I've never been touched, no, no
 Show me, yeah, the way now
I've been stumbling in the dark, baby, oh, ooh
 Show me the way now
Let me slip inside your heart, yeah
Baby, this time we're taking
The long road together, oh baby
And I know that the love within
Will lead me to surrender
 Mmm, the way now
 Moving step by step to love
Ooh yeah, yeah
I've been used and I've been good at using, boy
Open up your love inside baby, yeah
Don't let me walk alone no, no
Oh, show me
Yeah
The way now, baby
