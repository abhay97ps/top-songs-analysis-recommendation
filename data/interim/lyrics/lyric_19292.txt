All he could think about was I'm too young for this
Got my whole life ahead
Hell, I'm just a kid myself
How'm I going to raise one
All he could see were his dreams going up in smoke
So much for ditching this town
And hangin' out on the coast
Oh well, those plans are long gone
And he said
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
Might as well kiss it all good-bye
There goes my life
A couple years of up all night
And a few thousand diapers later
That mistake he thought he made covers up the refrigerator
Oh yeah, he loves that little girl
Momma's waiting to tuck her in
As she fumbles up those stairs
She smiles back at him
Dragging that teddy bear
Sleep tight, blue eyes and bouncing curls
He smiles
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
I love you, daddy good-night
There goes my life
She had that Honda loaded down
With Abercrombie clothes and 15 pairs of shoes
And his American Express
He checked the oil and slammed the hood
Said you're good to go
She hugged them both and headed off to the West Coast
And he cried
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
I love you
Baby, good-bye
There goes my life
There goes my life
Baby good-bye
