You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Troubles seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore 
Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay, another home
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore 
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore 
In the windmills of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me 
Why'd ya have to go away? 
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love?
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore 
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore 
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore 
Live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore 
No, no, you don't, you don't live here anymore
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore 
No, you don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore 
You don't live here anymore
