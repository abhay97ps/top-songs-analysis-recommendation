Time, you found time enough to love
I found love enough to hold you
Tonight I'll stir the fire you feel inside
Until the flames of love enfold you
Laying beside you, lost in the feeling
So glad you opened my door
Come with me
Somewhere in the night we will know
Everything lovers shall know
You're my song
Music too magic to end
I'll play you over and over again
Loving so warm, moving so right
Closing our eyes and feeling the light
We'll just go on burning bright
Somewhere in the night
You'll sleep when the morning comes
And I'll lie and watch you sleeping
And you'll smile when you dream about the night
Like it's a secret you've been keeping
Laying beside you, lost in the feeling
So glad you opened my door
Come with me
Somewhere in the night we will know
Everything lovers can know
You're my song
Music too magic to end
I'll play you over and over again
Loving so warm, moving so right
Closing our eyes and feeling the light
We'll just go on burning bright
Somewhere in the night
Loving so warm, moving so right
Closing our eyes and feeling the light
We'll just go on burning bright
Somewhere in the night
We'll just go on burning bright
Somewhere in the night
We'll just go on burning bright
Somewhere in the night
We'll just go on burning bright
Somewhere in the night
