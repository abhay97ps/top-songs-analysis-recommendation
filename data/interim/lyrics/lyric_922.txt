You made me happy, you made me sing
But now without you, I've lost everything
And I know, know it's true that I-I must go throu-ou-gh
All my life  all my life 
Wi-ithout yo-ou-ou 
No one to talk to when I'm alone
No one to call me, call me her own
And I know, know it's true that I-I must go throu-ou-gh
All my life  all my life 
Wi-ithout yo-ou-ou 
SPOKEN: Maybe tomorrow
SPOKEN: Maybe in time
SPOKEN: I'll find an angel
SPOKEN: Who wants to be mine
SPOKEN: Someone who needs me
SPOKEN: Like I'm needing you
SPOKEN: Someone to love me and to always be true
But, oh my darling 
I love you still 
I dream about you 
And I always will 
And I know, know it's true that I-I must go throu-ou-gh
All my life  all my life 
Wi-ithout you
