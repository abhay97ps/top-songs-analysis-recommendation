I need you to get me off
I'm your bomb getting ready to explode
I need you to get me off
Be your slave, do anything I'm told
I'm a sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction
I'm a sex shooter
Come and play with my affections
I need you to pull my trigger, baby
I can't do it alone
I need you to be my main play thing, pillar of stone
Ooh-ooh
I'm a sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction
I'm a sex shooter
Come and play with my affections
Come on, kiss the gun
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Come on, kiss the gun
Whoa-oh
Guaranteed for fun
Sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction
Oh, I'm a sex shooter
Come and play with my affections
Listen, boys
No girls body can compete with mine
No girls rap can top my lines
No girls kiss can ring your chimes
Come on, boys, make some time
I'm a sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction, yeah
I'm a sex shooter
Come and play with my affections
Everybody sing it
Sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction
I can't hear you
Sex shooter
Come and play with my affections
All the nasty people sing it
Sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction
