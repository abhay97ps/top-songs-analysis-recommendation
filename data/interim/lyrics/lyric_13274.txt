You don't know how to ease my pain
You don't know...
You don't know how to ease my pain
You don't know what the sound is, darlin'?
It's the sound of my tears falling
Or is it the rain?
You don't know...
You don't know how to play the game
And you cheat, you lie
You make me want to cry
You make me want to cry
Cry...
You make me want to cry!
You don't know how to ease my pain, you don't know
You don't know how to ease my pain
Don't you hear any voices crying?
That's the sound of our love dying
Here comes the rain
You don't know how to play the game
And you cheat, you lie
You don't even know how to say goodbye
You make me want to cry
You don't know...
You don't even know how to say goodbye
You make me want to cry!
You don't even know how to say goodbye
You make me want to cry!
Cry...
Cry...
Cry...
Cry...!
