Once again, right before your eyes to no surprise
It’s the man upon two pieces of steel
It’s the Kid Capri, doing this one for Mary J. Blige
On the flip tip
So we gon’ take it Uptown with the remix
And y’all get down with me one time, you nam’sayin’
So here we go…
Yo Puff, I don’t think they ready for this one...
Baby, there’s no need to tell you
As far as I can clearly recall
My love has been here for you
So you don't have to worry at all
I’ll sacrifice my time
I’ll make sure you're satisfied
And it's no hard thing to the joy I’ll bring
I wanna give you all my love, yeah
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
I’m loving you
Don’t you look no more, love without a limit
Love without a limit
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
I’m loving you, boy
Don’t you look no more, love without a limit
You know, you know
Ooh baby, I’m in need of your love
And you’ve got that touch that I need so much
And I am about to explode
Freely, completely
Everything you want I’ll be
Good love  down to the last drop
And I'm not gonna stop
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
No no, no no no
Don’t you look no more, love without a limit
Take my hand and follow me
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
I’m loving you, boy
Don’t you look no more, love without a limit
You know, you know
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
I’m loving you
Don’t you look no more, love without a limit
Don’t you look no, don’t you look no more
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
Every day
Don’t you look no more, love without a limit
You don’t have to worry
You know, you know
Said I’m loving you
You don’t have to worry
Loving you every day
’Cause I’m loving you, boy
Don’t you look no more, love without a limit
Said I’m love, said I’m loving
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
