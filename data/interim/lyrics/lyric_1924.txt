There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
So don't let me down
Baby, can I take you
For a long, long ride
Just wanna have you
Right by my side
Well, there goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
So don't let me down
Baby, can I be
Your lover again
Well, let me squeeze you
As hard as I can
Baby, can I take you
To the movie show
Well, let me kiss you
Before you go
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again...
