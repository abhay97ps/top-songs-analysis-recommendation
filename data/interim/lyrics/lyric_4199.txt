Whoa-oh, when I woke up this morning
She was gone
Solid gone
When I woke up this morning
She was gone
Solid gone, yeah
I used to love to watch her dance that grizzly bear
I guess she's gone to Frisco, whoa-oh
To dance it there
'Cause when I woke up this morning
Yeah, she was gone
Solid gone
I used to love to watch her dance that grizzly bear
I guess she's gone to Frisco, whoa-oh
To dance it there
'Cause when I woke up this morning
Yeah, she was gone
Solid gone
She did not even tell me 
The reason why 
She was gone 
She did not 
Did not even 
Did not even tell me 
She did not tell me 
Tell me why she was gone 
I used to love to watch her dance that grizzly bear
I guess she's gone to Frisco, whoa-oh
To dance it there
'Cause when I woke up this morning
Yeah, she was gone
Solid gone
Solid gone
Solid gone
