If you're feeling sad and lonely
There's a service I can render
Tell the one who loves you only
I can be so warm and tender
Call me, don't be afraid, you can call me
Maybe it's late but just call me
Tell me and I'll be around
When it seems your friends desert you
There's somebody thinking of you
I'm the one who never hurt you
Maybe that's because I love you
Now don't forget me 'cause if you let me
I will always stay by you
You've got to trust me, that's how it must be
There's so much that I can do
If you call I'll be right with you
You and I should be together
Take this love I long to give you
I'll be at your side forever
