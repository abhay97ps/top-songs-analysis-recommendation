If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share would always be
There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
To make us realize our night is over
When you walk away from me
There is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes
Against the sun that rises o'er the land
I watch you walk away
Somehow I have to let you go
Now it's over
If you knew just how I really feel
You might return and yet
There are so many times
That people have to love and then forget
Though there might have been a way
I have to force myself to say
It's over
So I turn my back
Turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence
Trying not to think at all
I send my feet before me
Walk the silent street before me
It's over
If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share would always be
There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
To make us realize our night is over
It's over
