He has the head of a camel, The neck of a crocodile
It sounds rather strange
He's both a fish and a mammal and I hope he'll never change
Cause It's not easy
To Find someone who cares
It's not easy to find magic in pairs
I'm glad I found him I love him I won't let him get away
Cause It's not easy
You say the head of a camel the neck of a crocodile
And the ears of a cow
It's clear that friends can be different yes I understand you now
It's not easy
To find someone who cares
It's not easy to find magic in pairs
Now that you have him, hold him, treasure him from day to day
It's so easy
Life is lollipops and rainbows with the one you love
Someone you can always be with, argue and agree with
Climb the highest tree with
It's not easy to share somebodies dreams
It gets easy when you work as a team
Youve got to tend it, fan it
That's what I plan to do
Oh I had one friend by my side
Now I have two
Him and you
Him and me
And it's so easy
