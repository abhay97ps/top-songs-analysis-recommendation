Darkchild forever
A-N-G-E-L
A-N-G-E-L
Just like a shadow
I'll be beside you
I'll be your comfort
I'm there to guide you home
I will provide you a place of shelter
I wanna be your zone
I'll act as if you do 
Tell me what you wanted me to do 
I'll make you great to be a man
With a woman who can stand
With every promise given
Making vows to please her man
Ooh, whoa, oh
If I could be your angel 
Protect you from the pain 
I'll keep you safe from danger 
You'll never hurt again 
I'll be your A-N-G-E-L
Yeah, A-N-G-E-L
Hey, A-N-G-E-L
I'm gonna be your A-N-G-E-L
I'll be your angel
Just like the moon
I'll step beside
And let your sun shine while I follow behind
'Cause baby, what ya got
It deserves all the props
You're everything I'm not
And I’m so glad you’re mine
I'll act as if you do 
Tell me what you wanted me to do 
I'll make it great to be a man
With a woman who can stand
With every promise given
Making vows to please her man
If I could be your angel 
Protect you from the pain 
I'll keep you safe from danger 
You'll never hurt again 
I'll be your A-N-G-E-L
Yeah, A-N-G-E-L
Hey, A-N-G-E-L
I'm gonna be, gonna be your A-N-G-E-L
Tell me why there's so many good men
Left in the world misunderstood
He's a dog, he's no good
I wish somebody would
Disrespect my man
You're gonna have to come see me
I go hard for my baby
He's all that I need
So if you got a good one
Put your hands up
Come on girl and stand up
Go ahead lift your man up
Get up
If you got a good one, put your hands up
Go ahead lift your man up
Get up
If you got a good one, stand up
Come on girl, and stand up
If I could be your angel 
Protect you from the pain 
I'll keep you safe from danger 
You'll never hurt again 
I'll be your A-N-G-E-L
A-N-G-E-L
I'm gonna be your A-N-G-E-L
A-N-G-E-L
I'll be your angel
