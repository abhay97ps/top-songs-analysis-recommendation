I hear some people get married in the park on a Sunday afternoon
And all their friends bring pretty flowers while the band plays a happy tune
Now, do you want me, do you need me
Do you love me like I love you?
What are you doing Sunday, baby?
Would you like to marry me?
Oh, what do you say now
If it's a nice day now
What are you doing Sunday, baby?
Gee, I wanna marry you
Oh, what are you doing Sunday afternoon?
Maybe we should wait till night to join hands 'neath the stars above
And we'll be kissing our first kiss by moonlight as we vow eternal love
Now, do you want me, do you need me
Do you love me like I love you?
What are you doing Sunday, baby?
Would you like to marry me?
Oh, what do you say now
If it's a nice day now
What are you doing Sunday, baby?
Gee, I wanna marry you
Oh, what are you doing Sunday afternoon?
Do you want me, do you need me, baby
Love me like I love you?
What are you doing Sunday, baby?
Would you like to marry me?
What do you say now?
If it's a nice day now
What are you doing Sunday, baby?
Gee, I wanna marry you
Oh, what do you say now
