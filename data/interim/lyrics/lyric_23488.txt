I just wanna
It's in the air
The way you smile when you reciprocate my stare
Just one breath and everyone knows that you're there
With every hit I take, you move that waist and I wanna die
A girl like you, adore
The way you drop that thing could start another war
And my hands are gettin' eager to explore
Cherry lips are singin' "Purple Rain" and I feel alive
I take the wheel and grab the clutch
Your body should be mine to touch
I fit the rhythm your body's givin'
And once I get in there
She got the smoothest ride
Like velvet all inside
Her sex just changed my life
She rides like a dream
And damn that velvet looks good on me
I feel the heat
Every drop of you is rainin' down on me
You're perfection's foggin' up my window seat
I got your body switchin' all positions through the night
 + 
 x4
She rides like a dream
Velvet looks good on me
