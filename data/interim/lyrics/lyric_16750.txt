It's just the way that you love me
It's just the way that you love
I've been waiting for this moment secretly
Counting every minute
Every hour till you're with me
'Cause I know just what's in store
And now I'm in your arms, baby close the door
Why waste another minute
Ooh, let's get right to it
Baby turn the lights down
And we don't have to say a word
Unspoken pleasure
There's no way to measure
How you make me feel
When you're near me and whisper softly
So don't stop
And it seems time flies
Whenever I'm in your arms
I like to savor every second
You thrill me with your charm
Now I'm lost in the passion
 we share
And when I look into your eyes
I know how much you care
Don't wanna rush the feeling
'Cause loving you's so real and
I like the way you set the mood
With a little wine and candlelight
It's more than emotion
Let's keep this fire going
Now we're lost inside our love
Sweet surrender is so tender
Ooh, you know me oh so well
You always take your time
And you always get it right
Ooh, you set my soul on fire
And I know you've got my rhythm
Cause then you take me higher
Don't you stop, stop the love
You know you've got the rhythm
Don't you stop, stop the love
You know you've got the rhythm
