Johnny Angel, you're an angel to me
Johnny Angel, how I love him
He's got something that I can't resist
But he doesn't even know that I exist
Johnny Angel, how I want him
How I tingle when he passes by
Every time he says hello, my heart begins to fly
 I get carried away
I dream of him and me
And how it's gonna be
 Call me up for a date
But I just sit and wait
I'd rather concentrate
On Johnny Angel 
'Cause I love him 
And I pray that someday he'll love me
And together we will see
How lovely Heaven will be
 I get carried away
I dream of him and me
And how it's gonna be
 Call me up for a date
But I just sit and wait
I'd rather concentrate
On Johnny Angel 
'Cause I love him 
And I pray that someday he'll love me
And together we will see
How lovely Heaven will be
Johnny Angel 
You're an angel to me
Johnny Angel 
You're an angel to me
Johnny Angel
