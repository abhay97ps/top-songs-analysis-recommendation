There's many a day I act free
We're oceans apart
Even though my tears have dried
There's an emptiness I feel in my heart
Come forward
Uh, from the first time that I loved you
I told you from the start
Our love would come together
If we could stand to be apart
I never mean to break to you heart, no
The days I cope without you
I feel so all alone
I see you in my dreams at night
I feel your touch so strong 
I feel your pain and tears miles away
I surrender my soul to you, dear
Love you
Love you
Love you
Love
Mishale, what am I supposed to do
Mishale, I'll never get over you
Mishale , loving you is heaven
Missing you is hell and I need for our love to be strong
No matter where I find myself
You're always on my mind 
The photographs stare back at me
Reminds me that your love's deep as mine 
I'm coming home to you, babe, is worth livin' for, yeah, yeah 
Love you
Love you
Love you
Love
Mishale , what am I supposed to do 
Mishale , I'll never get over you 
Mishale, loving you is heaven 
Missing you is hell and I need for our love to be strong, ho'oh'oh'
My swollen eyes reveal my pain
As my tears fall like November rain
My life's fading
I'mma just gonna miss you
Love  you 
Love  you 
Love  you 
Love
Mishale, what am I supposed to do 
Mishale , I'll never get over you 
Mishale , loving you is heaven 
Missing you is hell and I surrender myself to you, dear
Mishale , what am I supposed to do 
Mishale , I'll never get over you
Mishale , loving you is heaven 
Missing you is hell and I need for our love to be strong, oh'oh'
What am I supposed to do
Mishale , I'll never get over you
Mishale, loving you is heaven 
Missing you is hell
