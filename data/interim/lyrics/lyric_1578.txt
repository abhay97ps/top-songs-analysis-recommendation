What kind of fool am I?
Who never fell in love
It seems that I'm the only one
That I've been thinking of
What kind of man is this?
An empty shell
A lonely cell in which
An empty heart must dwell
What kind of lips are these?
That lied with every kiss
That whispered empty words of love
That left me alone like this
Why can't I fall in love?
Like any other man
And maybe then I'll know
What kind of fool I am
What kind of clown am I?
What do I know of life?
Why can't I cast away
This mask of play and live my life?
Why can't I fall in love?
'Til I don't give a damn
And maybe then I'll know
What kind of fool I am
