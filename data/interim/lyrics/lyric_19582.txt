Mudgrips, white-tip, cigar stickin' out of my face
Earnhardt racin' sticker, on the window, banged up fender
4x4, straight-pipe roar, primer and rust all over the door
Scarred up knuckles, Mack belt buckle, white t-shirt, ain't afraid to work
Got a "what-are-you-lookin'-at-asshole?" smirk
Cold beer, hot wings, wranglers, Skoal ring
Get just what you see
Gun rack, ball cap, don't take no crap
Ain't a pretty boy-toy, I'll rock you steady
Rough and ready
Work boots, one blue suit, size too small, won't wear it at all
Unless somebody kicks, gets hitched, that's a bitch, it makes me itch
Up with sun, off on the run, makin' money, money, 'cause I wanna have fun
5 o'clock whistle, off like a missile, got a hot date, girl named Kate
Thinks I'm cool, 'cause I shoot straight, ain't one thing about her fake
She's long and tall, and she goes great with
Cold beer, hot wings, wranglers, Skoal ring
Get just what you see
Gun rack, ball cap, don't take no crap
Ain't a pretty boy-toy, I'll rock you steady
Rough and ready
Rough and ready
Well you are who you are
And that's all right with me
Well I am who I am
And that's all I can be, I like...
Cold beer, hot wings, wranglers, Skoal ring
Get just what you see
Gun rack, ball cap, don't take no crap
Ain't a pretty boy-toy, I'll rock you steady
Rough and ready
Rough and ready
Rough and ready, baby
Aw, that's me and my buddies are all alike
