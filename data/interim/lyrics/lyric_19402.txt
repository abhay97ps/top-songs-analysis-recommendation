Mmm, oh-oh
Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame, oh
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say
"My love, take my breath away
Take my breath away"
Watching, I keep waiting, still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones, oh yeah
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say
"My love, take my breath away
Take my breath away, oh-oh, yeah
Oh yeah"
Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed, I called you
And turned to hear you say
"If only for today, I am unafraid"
Take my breath away, oh-oh, yeah
You take my breath away, oh
You take my breath, you take my breath
You take my breath away 
You take my breath away
You take my breath away
