I was sure I'd lost my chance for forever
I never dreamed we'd ever meet again
Now here we are alone once more together
Doing all the loving things we used to do back then
Its we like never said goodbye love
You're just a little shy love
But you sure remember how to make me smile
A different bed a different ceiling
But still that same old feeling
As I hold you close I almost want to cry
Cause it feels just like we never said goodbye
Its good to hear you talk about the old times
Its good to hear your sweet voice once again
Right now all I want to do is touch you
And feel the love start happening
The way it happened then
Its we like never said goodbye love
We're both a little shy love
But you sure remember how to make me smile
A different bed a different ceiling
But still that same old feeling
As I hold you close I almost want to cry
Cause it feels just like we never said goodbye
