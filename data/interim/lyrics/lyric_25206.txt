Mm-mm
I told you I don't want no company in my house
Mmm
I told you that I don't want none of them lil fast girls in my house
Mm-hmm

There's a one-bull rule in effect
I ain't gon' lie, I got some cuddy last night
Stop lyin'
You ain't got no cuddy
Candy blinds, yeah
Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Raise the prices, raise it two times 
No cap, these girls be the new vibe 
We don't like suicide so the doors fly 
She said I hurt her feelings 52 times 
Call up queen 
The queen can't flex on a young bull 
Made her scream 
Chanel, I bought her two of 'em
You can check IG 
'Cause when she post, it go up 
Is she for keeps? 
Only if she come with two of 'em 
Yeah, I be snipin'

She treat me righteous 
Nigga don't mean to brag 
I be tryin' to keep it cool, but I sniped yo' ass 
No "FEFE," I skeet-skeet  on yo' face ass 
Called up Huncho to come tap that ass 
Pull up on you, autotune when I grip that ass 
Pullin' on yo' weave, 'cross the room when I pipe that ass 
I see a queen on a tree-tree 
She like the ride new boy tree-tree 
I see a queen on the tree-tree 
She like the ride that boy tree-tree 
Nicki , do you love me? 
Why you crying? 
She don't wanna be a queen unless she got me 
She don't wanna be on scene unless we married 
No cap , for real 
Tea in my double cup, it can't spill 
Left the fire on the dresser at the hotel 
Drunk as hell, made her cook some RO-TEL 
If the truth hurt, then I won't tell 
Bounce that ass, Nicki 
Bounce that ass, Nicki 
Shake it like Iggy 
Shake it like Iggy 
If I hurt your feelings 
I am truly sorry 
I'm straight out the jungle , no safari 
Bounce that ass, Nicki 
Bounce that ass, Nicki 
Shake it like Iggy 
Shake it like Iggy 
Woo, if I hurt your feelings, I am truly sorry 
Straight out the jungle, no safari
Ooh, yeah

Woo, woo, woo, woo)
Don't try to play me
Cannot play that Huncho 
Just don't play that Huncho, Huncho
Huncho, that Huncho 
That Huncho, that Huncho
