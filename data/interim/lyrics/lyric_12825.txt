A new kind of rime and rhythm
A new kind of poetry
A road I never traveled
A brand new melody
I know I never met you
But somehow more and more
I get this funny feeling
That I've known you before
A stranger, in a strange world
A world full of mystery
A stranger, in a strange world
Yet you ain't no stranger to me
In your eyes, I see places
Places that I've never seen
Things that I couldn't never known
And somehow I know what they mean
We so very different
We are like night and day
Your words, they sound so strange to me
Yet I understand everything you say
A stranger, in a strange world
A world full of mystery
A stranger, in a strange world
Yet you ain't no stranger to me
Have we met before?
In some other yesterday
Have we met before?
Or does love just make it seem that way
Coming from different directions
Carrying different dreams
A brand new river flowing
From two very different streams
Worlds that come together
Somehow we have found
A bridge across our differences
To a common ground
A stranger, in a strange world
A world full of mystery
A stranger, in a strange world
Yet you ain't no stranger to me
