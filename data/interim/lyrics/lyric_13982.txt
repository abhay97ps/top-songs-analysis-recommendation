Sun goes down
The rhythm hits
Ooh that's just the start of it
Before you know it we're all on the move
Down to the local waterhole
We gotta drink until we lose control
Let the drum beat on
Let the show begin
That's the way it's always been yeah yeah
Primitive Love Rites
This is our love night
Baby just hold tight
Until the ritual's complete
Wild eyes you got the wild hair
You got the wild clothes you make the men stare
When you move it up there
Like a rhythm machine
Turn it up and turn it on
The ceremony has begun
Won't stop until we hear
The final scream
That's the way it's always been yeah yeah
Primitive Love Rites
This is our love night
Baby just hold tight
Until the ritual's complete
All along the asphalt jungle track
Two by two we stagger back
And the full moon shines
On a crazy scene
Another night has bit the dust
And we have done the things we must
Now lay me down
And let me help you dream
That's the way it's always been yeah yeah
Primitive Love Rites
This is our love night
Baby just hold tight
Until the ritual's complete
