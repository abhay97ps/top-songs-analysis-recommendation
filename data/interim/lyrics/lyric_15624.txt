"Honey, let me tell you something
No man in the world!"
Don't wait for me
Cause I won't be there
Not this time
Boy can't you see
That I am leaving you behind
Too blind to see it
Too blind to see what you were doing
Too blind to see it
Too blind to see what you were doing
The only one
I was your baby
That's what I thought
But you had your fun
You tried to play me
And now you're caught
Hide the way I feel
But that's not real
But you did me wrong
So I'm moving, moving on
"Honey, let me tell you something
No man in the world!"
But you did me wrong
So I'm moving, moving on
What you did to me I can't believe
Now I realize baby I was
Too blind, too blind I was
I realize
I can't believe, oh baby I was...
