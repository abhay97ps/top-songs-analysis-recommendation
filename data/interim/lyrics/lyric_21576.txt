Hey
Hey
Ohh, ohh, ohhh
Fell in love
So, presently I'm standing
Here right now, you're so demanding
Tell me what you want from me
Concluding, concentrating on my music, lover, and my babies
Make me wanna ask a lady for a ticket outta town
So can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody, next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around, and a safe touch down
Can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody, next to me
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry, and a long bye
But I, I need you to want, me
I, need you to miss, me
I, need yo' attention, yes
I need you next me, heh
Oh I, I need someone to clap for me
I need your direction
Somebody say come back
Come back, baby come back
Come back, come back, baby come back
Come back, come back, baby come back
Come back, come back, baby come back
So, out my mind I'm tusslin'
Back and forth 'tween here and hustlin'
I don't wanna time travel no mo'
I wanna be here, my thinkin'
Say, on this porch I'm rockin'
Back and forth like Lightnin' Hopkins
So if anybody speak to Scotty
Tell him, "Beam me up!"
So can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody, next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around, and a safe touch down
Can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody, next to me
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry, and a long bye
But I, I need you to miss me
I, need somebody come get me
I, need your attention, yes
And I, need your energy, and I do
Ohh, ohh, I, I need someone to clap for me
And I, need your direction
Somebody say come back
Come back, baby come back
Come back, come back, baby come back
Come back, come back, baby come back
Come back, come back, baby come back
So can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody, next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around, and a safe touch down
Can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody, next to me
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry, and a long bye
They play it safe, are quick to assassinate what they do not understand. They move in packs ingesting more and more fear with every act of hate on one another. They feel most comfortable in groups, less guilt to swallow. They are us. This is what we have become. Afraid to respect the individual. A single person within a circumstance can move one to change. To love herself. To evolve
