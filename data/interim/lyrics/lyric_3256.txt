I'm getting tired of doing nothing
Wasting time
I know there's got to be a new place
I can find, yeah
Somewhere I'll be free and satisfied
But, baby, I will need you by my side
Oh, can't you hear me calling you
Calling you, Calling you
Follow me, yeah 
I've two arms as strong
As iron holding you 
And with these arms, I wanna
Do things, yes, I do
I wanna be a someone in this town
But someone's always
Trying to put me down
Oh, can't you hear me calling you
Calling you, calling you
Follow me 
I've got somewhere to go
 we'll be
Happy there, I know
We'll dance and sing, everything
We'll have a good time together
Just you wait and see
We gotta pack our bags and
Leave here right away 
If we don't catch the next bus, baby
We might stay, yeah
And that would be the
End of me, I know 
So, come on, baby
Grab your things, let's go
Oh, can't you hear me calling you
Calling you, calling you
Follow me, yeah 
Follow me 
Oh, can't you hear me calling you
Calling you, calling you
Follow me 
Oh, you got to follow me...
