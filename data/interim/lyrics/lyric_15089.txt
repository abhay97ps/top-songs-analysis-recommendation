Yeah, if you don't mind
Won't you pull that bass up a little bit more
Yeah, and um, pull up Tim's drums, a hi-hat
I wanna hear them drums kickin'
Kickin' so hard they can feel it way back in Mississippi
Yeah, like that; aw, yeah, like that
C'mon fellas, let's do it...
Spendin' all my time trying to show you how I feel
There's so much I can do , yeah
You say you care for me, but you don't act that way
C'mon, girl, who you trying to fool?
Tell 'em, Wayne
Just when I try to prove what I can do for you
I feel like I'm wasting my time 
I can't see myself without you
That's why I hang around
All you ever give me is the blues
Spending all my time pleasing you
All you ever give me is the blues
Spending all my time pleasing you
All you ever give me is the blues
Every time I see you, girl
All I want to know is how I can get next to you
There's got to be a way
I'm thinking every day
C'mon, girl, please give me a clue
Tell 'em, Wayne...
Just because he drives a Porsche , and girl, I drive a Nova
What about the man inside? 
Oh, if that is what you're into
Why don't you let me know
Instead of always giving me the blues
Spending all my time pleasing you
All you ever give me is the blues 
Spending all my time pleasing you
All you ever give me is the blues
C'mon, y'all
Clap your hands
Everybody clap your hands
Boys, help me out
Blues. Blues. Blues. Blues
Blues. Blues. Blues. Blues
Spending all my time pleasing you
After all we've been through
Why you wanna give me the blues?
Spending all my time pleasing you
All you ever give me is the blues
You're always on my mind all the time
Spending all my time pleasing you
Every day, every night
All you ever give me is the blues
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Spending all my time pleasing you
All you ever give me is the blues
I tried 20 times
Spending all my time pleasing you
And you never dropped by
All you ever give me is the blues
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Spending all my time pleasing you
All you ever give me is the blues
