I, I've got a low down dirty feeling
That I've been cheated on, and lied to
If it's old then it's wrong, we've held on for so long
Why don't we have that magic anymore
I've got a strange sneaking suspicion
That it's been going on for some time now
Something shines in your eyes, something stirs deep inside
I won't stand in your way anymore
You said that I'm just a little boy
Who's easily led astray
Well aren't you the same little girl
Who always gets her way
