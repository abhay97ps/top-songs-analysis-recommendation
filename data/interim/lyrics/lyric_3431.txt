Pizza pies, a carousel
The fountains and the wishing well
Remember when we rode in Italy?
Switzerland, we loved it too
Although we left there black and blue
Remember when we tried to learn to ski?
Those two days in London town
We Yankee Doodled all around
Rubbed elbows with all the royalty
We still get a million laughs
Lookin' at these photographs
Remember when we made these memories
Wasn't that some honeymoon
And Lord, I won't forget it soon
Not if I live to be a hundred years
Here's the one we snapped in Spain
I can't remember was it rain
Or were your eyes just filled with happy tears?
All good things must end, it's true
So back to usa we flew
But who was happier than you and me?
To relive each wonderland we open up this album and
Remember when we made these memories
Remember when we made these memories
