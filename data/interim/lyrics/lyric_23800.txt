And hey, would you like to look outside sometimes? 
I'm just with my friends online
And there's things we'd like to change
Next thing you'll find you're reading 'bout yourself on a plane, fame, what a shame 
Well, just keep looking, looking, looking, looking!
And love me 
If that's what you wanna do, oh 
And love me 
If that's what you wanna do, oh 
You've been reading 'bout yourself on a plane, fame for a change
Caught up in fashion, Karcrashian panache
And a bag of bash for passion
You got a beautiful face, but got nothing to say 
"You look famous, let's be friends
And portray we possess something important
And do the things we'd like"
"We've just come to represent
A decline in the standards of what we accept!"
Yeah, yeah, yeah? No
And love me 
If that's what you wanna do, oh 
And love me 
If that's what you wanna do, oh 
Oh, so sack off your calendar, give it to the people
Be the man that gets them up on their feet
Say "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
And love me 
Oh 
And love me 
If that's what you wanna do
