These days
Well, they're looking up
We got so much to say
We got someone to love
We got good friends
They're so good to us
And haters can hate
And fakers can front
So we try to live
Like it's all we've got
Cause for all we know
This could be the last night of our lives
Gonna chase down our every desire
We blaze the night
With all we've been waiting for
All this time
Reaches such great heights
Gives us just one perfect night
To say "oh, what a beautiful life"
"Oh, what a beautiful life"
Comes out of the dark
We got nothing to fear
We got nothing but heart
Can't just wait here to see what it brings
We got too many hopes
We got too many dreams
So we try to live
Like it's all we've got
Cause for all we know
This could be the last night of our lives
Gonna chase down our every desire
We blaze the night
With all we've been waiting for
All this time
Reaches such great heights
Gives us just one perfect night
To say "oh, what a beautiful life"
"Oh, what a beautiful"
Last night of our lives
Gonna chase down our every desire
We blaze the night
With all we've been waiting for
All this time
Reaches such great heights
Gives us just one perfect night
To say "oh, what a beautiful life"
Last night of our lives
Gonna chase down our every desire
We blaze the night
With all we've been waiting for
All this time
Reaches such great heights
Gives us just one perfect night
To say "oh, what a beautiful life"
"Oh, what a beautiful life"
Beautiful life
"Oh, what a beautiful life"
"Oh, what a beautiful life"
