Nice and...
You know I can never do
Things that, you want me to
The way I appear to you
May not be true to you
So don't get your hopes too high
And don't be like other guys 
Assuming that every girl is just like that type
Mennn...
Runnin' the same ol' sayin'
*talking* No more questions, no more games
Some people think I'm nice
Some people think I'm nasty
But if you really want to know
Just ask meeeeeee...
And I'll say I'm nicety
Hooooo-hoooo-hoooo, say I'm nicety
Nice and... 
You said you would treat me right
And I'd never be alone
*talking* But men'll say anything
Just to try to take you home 
But don't get your hopes too high
Cause I've got to keep it tight
And that's the way it will stay
Until I feel it's right 
Mennn...
Runnin the same ol' sayin
*talking* No more questions, no more games
Nicetyyyyyy...
It's got to be nicety
Hooooo-hoooo-hoooo, say I'm nicety
Nicety-eeeeee...
You can call me nicety
...
Some people think I'm nice
Some people think I'm nasty
But if you really want to know
Just ask MEEEEEEEE...
And I'll say I'm -
Nicety, or whatever you wanna call it
Ask my opinion and I think that all it is
Is just an excuse to givin the boots
For dollar and cents, and remain innocent
Dre with the Ruthless Attack, check it
Cause all that you talkin about ain't Jack!
Step off of that, try a new approach
You get smoked because I ain't no joke
Yeah, yeah...
Nice and... 
You can call me nicety
Just say I'm nicety
You can call me nicety
Nicetyyyyy....
Just call me nicety
Hoooooo-hooooooo-hoooo, just call me nicety
Nicetyyyyyy....
