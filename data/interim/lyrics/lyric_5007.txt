Yeh
Yeh
Yeh
You can pick me up baby and put me back
Back on my feet again
And make this life of mine sweet again
Yes you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches
Pick me up baby and put me back
Back on my feet again
And make this life of mine sweet again
Yes you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches
In my life there has been nobody
Who ever cared a bit about me
I was the one guy deserving love
But every time it seemed to be found
I was the one guy really hurt in love
Who ended up flat on the ground 
You can pick me up baby and put me back
Back on my feet again
And make this life of mine sweet again
Yes you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches
Pick me up baby and put me back
Back on my feet again
And make this life of mine sweet again
Yes you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches
Tried so hard to take it cool and easy
But everything seems to go wrong
I was the one guy, believed in love
Who seemed to have some kind of knack
To be the one guy, deceived in love
Who ended up flat on his back 
You can pick me up baby and put me back
Back on my feet again
And make this life of mine sweet again
Yes you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches
Pick me up baby and put me back
Back on my feet again
And make this life of mine sweet again
Cause you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches
