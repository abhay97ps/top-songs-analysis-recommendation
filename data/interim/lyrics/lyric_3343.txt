It may never be my pleasure
To have you for my own
The day may never come when
I can make my heart your own
So just remember what I say
And every breathe I breathe today
I wanna tell you someone, someone
Is watching over you
When I'm alone at night
My pillows whispers your name
Water dripping in the sink
Makes me stop and think
If I could have a little of your love
I tell you two drops, one drop will do
I wanna tell you someone, someone
Is watching over you
Someone, someone
Is watching over you
If I could hold you in my arms
Lord, I'd love to kiss you
Maybe I could prove to you
What you really been missing
Now you can make it if you want to
But I know you're gonna
Do just what you want to
You see, someone, someone
Is watching over you
Way in the midnight hour
Someone, someone is watching
Oh, yes, they are 
No matter where you go, darling
Someone, someone...
