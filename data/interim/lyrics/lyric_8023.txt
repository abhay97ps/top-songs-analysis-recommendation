Sunshine, you may find my window
But you won't find me
Sunshine, I've got my friend the darkness
Here tonight to hide me
Sunshine as far as I'm concerned
I'm where I want to be
Sunshine as far as you're concerned
Don't be concerned for me
She doesn't want me anymore
She doesn't need me anymore
She's grown tired
Of chasing rainbows
Oh, I loved her so
God you know I tried
But I guess she was right
'Cause I'm at the end
I've found a pot but
There's no gold inside
So sunshine can't you see I'm not alone
Don't bother me
Sunshine pick up your dawn
And move on down the street
Sunshine as far as I'm concerned
I'm where I've got to be
Sunshine as far as you're concerned
Don't be concerned for me
