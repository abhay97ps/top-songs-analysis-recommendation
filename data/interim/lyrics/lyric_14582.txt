When I think about how much I'm loving you
No limitations, no set of regimented rules
I'm amazed how much this love has touched my life
And the commitment that we share is a welcome sacrifice
This must be sweet fatal attraction
My life-long date with destiny
Love this strong, it just brings out the passion
I never knew was here in me
And I love you just because,  just because
Just because I do - my darlin', you
Emotions more than words can help me say
I love you,  baby
Just because you're you
Just because you're you
You're a diamond in my mind, a treasure found
A precious gem to me, you're so nice to have around
I'm so glad I took the path that led to this
And it's amazin' loving you
I'm doin' things I never thought I'd do
I don't know, there ain't no explanation
Of why I'm sharin' love at last this way
I won't try to work out all my reasons
I'II use these words to simply say
I love you just because,  just because
Just because I do - my darlin', you
Emotions more than words can help me say
I love you, , my baby
I love you just because,  just because
Just because I do - darlin', you
Emotions more than words can help me say
I love you 
You know I do, baby
Could it be that there's more to this that meets the eye?
Maybe that's the reason why
All I know is when I'm in your arms, it feels all right
I hold on tight, and I come alive
 just because, 
Surely do - my darlin'
Emotions more than words can help me say
I love you 
Hey, a-hey-hey, a-hey, hey...
 Just because, 
Just because I do - oh, yeah 
I, I couldn't take it back if I wanted to
I just love you... 
Hey, hey, I just love you, baby
 just because, 
Ain't nothin' I can do... 
Nothin' I can do about it, nothin' I can do about it
I just love you... 
I just love you, I just love you
 just because, 
Couldn't take it back if I wanted to 
That's just the way it is, baby
That's just the way it is, baby
Oh, hey, don't I love you
 just because,
