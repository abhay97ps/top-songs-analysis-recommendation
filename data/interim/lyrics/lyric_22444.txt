Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear his voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say
Why? Why?
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why? Why?
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why?  Why?
Does he do me that way, yeah
Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere 
See, that girl?
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare
If they say
Why? Why?
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why? Oh, why?
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why?  Why?
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why?  Oh, why?
Does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Oh, why, oh, why
Oh, why, oh, why
Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch his shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
And they say
Why?  Why? 
Tell 'em hat it's human nature
Why? Why?
Does he do me that way?
Why?  Why? 
Tell 'em that 
Why?
Why?
Does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Oh, why, oh, why
Oh, why, oh, why
Why? Why?
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why?
