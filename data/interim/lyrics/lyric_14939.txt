Welcome to Perception Volume 1: The Dream
This is Abstract, and I hope you enjoy
Alright, thank you, peace
Yeah, yeah
She left my heart outside
Thought that she was love
But I was told that she lied
That she laughed and I cried
That'll be the last time I let shit like that ride
I can't decide
Should I hate her, feel bad for what I came up and made her
Or was it her doing, her own choosing?
Please forgive us, Lord, for we know not what we doin'
We just some kids living adult lives
Who work seven-to-twos instead of nine-to-fives
So when we make mistakes, is it really a surprise?
Thinking at the age of eighteen the dark clouds will rise
But the real outcome is not ours to decide
Then I found rap, I'm now about that
Your kids, you wanna be around forever
You wanna be remembered
Keep it real in your music, don't let the hoes change you ever
I kept it real no matter the X's and O's
I told you, I deliver
Whether it was bars, flows, or clothes, all true though
No time for the filler
Ask anybody who knows
If they know about this mothafuckin' killer, yeah
Yeah, we all got a dream
We all got a dream
Yeah, we all got a dream
Everybody's tryna turn it into somethin'
Somethin'
We've been tryna turn it
Yeah, we all got a dream
Yeah, we all got a dream
Everybody wanna be a king
Yeah, we all got a dream
Everybody wanna be a king
Yeah, we all got a dream
Be a king, yeah
Everybody's tryna turn it into somethin'
Everybody wanna be a king, yeah
Yeah, yeah 
'Cause we all got a dream
We all got dreams but some work harder than others
I do this without a team but still, I got my brothers
Yeah, I grew up more blessed than many unfortunate others
I had them warm-ass winters and cold-ass summers
Protected from the thunder under them warm-ass covers
Fucked with and got fucked by a couple fake lovers
Was told to concentrate by all my fuckin' brothers
They said, "Son, you got a dream, don't listen to the others
They said, "Son, you got a team; you make tracks, we'll be your runners"
So I got somethin' to live to as I'm up-and-coming
When I got my drive, to most it would seem stunnin'
'Cause I learned destruction in the heart makes construction in the mind
So I took the pain and started workin' overtime
Workin' over rhymes but lettin' my heart decide
If I wasn't happy with it, then it wasn't worth it, right?
Nah, it wasn't worth it, right?
Yeah, 'cause we all got a dream
Yeah, we all got a dream
And everybody's tryna turn it into something
Yeah, alright
Yeah, we all got a dream
This is the part where we ride out
And everybody wanna be a king
I hope everyone enjoys the rest of the mixtape
Yeah, we all got a dream
So, yeah, alright; peace
And everybody's tryna turn it into something
Yeah, everybody's got a dream
