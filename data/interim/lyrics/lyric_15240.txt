I'm so sad - feeling blue
Since you left - I've been missing you
Need your love - oh so bad
Realize - everything we had
All day - all night
You can have it anyway you want it
One love - so right
Don't you know that I live my life for you
I was wrong - my mistake
I regret - look at the price I paid
Take these words - understand
Try forgiving - I'm a broken man
I'm so sad - feeling blue
Since you left - I've been missing you
Take these words - understand
Try forgiving - I'm a broken man
For you - for you
You can have it anyway you want it
For you - for you
Doesn't matter if the sun don't shine
