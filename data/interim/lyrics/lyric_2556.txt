Told me that you loved me
Said that your love was true
How in the world can love you me, baby
While loving my best friend, too?
It ain't no good, it ain't no good
Oh, it ain't no good
No good, no good, no good
You ain't got no best friend
That is plain to see
I ain't never try to make love to him
He tried to make love to me
Now, that ain't no good, that ain't no good
Yeah, it ain't no good
Yeah, it ain't no good
Look-a hear, baby
Early in the morning I think about you
Late at night, I think about you, too
We were meant for each other
I'm in love with you 
Ah, that's some good 
That's really some good 
Oh, that's really some good 
Really, really some good 
Really, really some good 
You know that's good! 
You know that's good! 
Oh! 
Oh! 
Oh! 
Oh, baby! 
Really, really some good 
You know that's good! 
You know that's good!
