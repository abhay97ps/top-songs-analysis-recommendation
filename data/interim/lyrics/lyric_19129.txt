All hope was gone
Hard to hang on
Hard to be strong
Was blind, could not see
Nothing but walls in front of me
And inside no peace
And the mountains seemed impossible to climb
Until you stood on the front line
You led the way
Out of the darkness
We didn't go astray
You were ready to die for our sake
And that, that takes a soldier's heart
Oceans so deep
Uphill, so steep
But still we believe
And when the road was too far to travel
Heroes, you cared, you came and carried us there
And the mountains seemed impossible to climb
Until you stood on the front line
You led the way
Out of the darkness
We didn't go astray
You were ready to die for our sake
And that takes a soldier's heart
And so our flag was still there
All because you decided to care
Our burden to bear
You stood on the front line
You led the way
Right out of the darkness
Didn't go astray
You were ready to die for our sake
And that takes
You stood on the front line
You led the way
Right out of the darkness, hey
You could have let us go astray
You were ready to die for our sake
And that takes a soldier's heart
Whoa, that takes a soldier's heart, hey
It takes a soldier's heart
