The single girl all alone in a great big town
The single girl gets so tired of love lettin' her down
The life's unreal, and the people are phony
And the nights can get so lonely
The single girl needs a sweet lovin' man to lean on
I'm a single girl wond'rin' if love could be passin' me by
I'm a single girl, and I know all about men and their lies
Nobody loves me 'cause nobody knows me
Nobody takes the time to go slowly
The single girl needs a sweet lovin' man to lean on
I gotta make my own way
There's rent I gotta pay
I need a nighttime love
To get me through the day
I'm a single girl all alone in a great big town
I'm a single girl, and I get so tired of love lettin' me down
But there's a man I've yet to know
Waitin' somewhere I've yet to go
Someday I'll have a sweet lovin' man to lean on
The single girl needs a sweet lovin' man to lean on
The single girl needs a sweet lovin' man to lean on
The single girl
