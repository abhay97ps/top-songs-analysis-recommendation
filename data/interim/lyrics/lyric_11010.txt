When he held me in his arms
When he held me in his arms and said
"Baby, baby, baby, you are the only one for me"
When a man loves a woman can't keep his mind on nothing else
He'll trade the world for the good thing he found
Yeah, if she's bad, he can't see it, she can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down
When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'll give up all his comforts, go out and sleep out in the rain
If she says, "Baby, that is how it's gonna be"
When a man loves a woman
Gives her everything that he has
Tryin' to hold on to her precious love
Cryin, "Baby, baby, please don't treat me bad"
When a man loves a woman, down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
Yeah, she's bad, but, ooh, he's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes don't ever see
So, this man says he loves me, he loves me
He gives me everything, everything, everything that he has
Tryin' to hold on to my precious love
Cryin', "Baby, baby, baby, don't you, don't you treat me, treat me bad"
Oh yeah
Oh I'm leavin' him
Oh, when a man loves a woman, he can do her no wrong
He could never hold another girl
Oh, you tell me you love me, baby
And gonna ho-ho-hold me tight baby, baby, this is a man's world
No, no, oh baby
A change is gonna come down
In this man's world
