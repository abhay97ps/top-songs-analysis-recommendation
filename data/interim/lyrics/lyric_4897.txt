Some velvet morning when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gate
And maybe tell you 'bout Phaedra
And how she gave me life
And how she made it end
Some velvet morning when I'm straight
Flowers growing on a hill
Dragonflies and daffodils
Learn from us very much
Look at us, but do not touch
Phaedra is my name
Some velvet morning when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gate
And maybe tell you 'bout Phaedra
And how she gave me life
And how she made it end
Some velvet morning when I'm straight
Flowers are the things we know
Secrets are the things we grow
Learn from us very much
Look at us, but do not touch
Phaedra is my name
Some velvet morning when I'm straight
Flowers growing on a hill
I'm gonna open up your gate
Dragonflies and daffodils
And maybe tell you 'bout Phaedra
Learn from us very much
And how she gave me life
Look at us, but do not touch
Fade
