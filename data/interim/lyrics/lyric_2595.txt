Woke up this morning feeling fine
'Cause there was something special on my mind
Last night I met a new boy in the neighborhood
Whoa yeah
Something tells me I'm into something good
He's kind of quiet, not too shy
And I can tell he's my kind of guy
He danced every slow dance with me like I hoped he would
Something tells me I'm into something good
We only talked for a minute or two
And it felt like I knew him the whole night through
I don't know if people fall in love
But he's everything I've been dreaming of
He's everything I've been dreaming of
When he walked me home and he held my hand
Knew it wouldn't be just a one-night stand
'Cause he asked to see me next week and I told him he could
 Whoa yeah
Something tells me I'm into something good
When he walked me home and he held my hand
Knew it wouldn't be just a one-night stand
'Cause he asked to see me next week and I told him he could
Something tells me I'm into something good
Something goooood, oh yeah
Something good
Something tells me I'm into something good
Something good, something good
Something good
