Well, I think I finally found me a sure-fire way to forget
It's so simple, I'm surprised I hadn't done thought of it before yet
It's foolproof - well, it's foolhardy, maybe, but who knows
Anyway, here I am walking toward where the cold dark water flows
Cos all it takes is:
One dying and a buryin'
One dying and a buryin'
Some crying
Six carrying me
I wanna be free
Oh...I wanna be free
Free from all this heartache and regret
And free from pining for the love I can't forget
The love that once was warm and then just somehow turned to hate
Made my life a prison from which there's only one escape
And that's:
One dying and a buryin'
One dying and a buryin'
Some cryin'
Six carryin' me
I wanna be free
One dying and a buryin'
One dying and a buryin'
Some cryin'
Six carryin' me
I wanna be free
