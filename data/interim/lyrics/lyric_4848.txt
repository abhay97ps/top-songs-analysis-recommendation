Come with me my love and seize the day and live it
Live it fully live it fast
Never thinking once about tomorrow
Till tomorrow's been and gone and past
We'll pour the wine and fill the cup of joy and drink it
Drink as if it were the last
Live, just live for life
In Paree today, in Amsterdam tomorrow
Sixty minutres through the skies
Fly with me to see the setting summer sun
And stay with me to see it rise
And say to those who say to live this way is mad
That mad we'd rather be, than wise
Live, just live for life
If you let me I will lead you
Through the mystery and wonder
Of a world you've never known before
Share the splendors to be shared
Magic places to explore
Dare the dangers to be dared
Life is all of this and more
This and more
Yesterday's a mem'ry, 
And tomorrow is a guess
What is real is what is here
And now, the "here and now" is all that we possess
So take my hand and we will take the moment
If for just the moment's happiness
Live, just live for life
Come with me to where the hills are green
And still and filled with flowers to adore
Come with me to where the laughter rings
And drowns the pounding sounds of guns of war
Yes, come with me my love and live for life
And life will live for you forevermore
Live, just live for life
Live, just live for life
Just live for life
