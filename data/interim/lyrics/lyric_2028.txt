I wake up crying
My pillow's wet
I keep remembering
How could I forget
I need him so
He's just got to know
So tell him, oh, tell him
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
Oh, yes, I have
I want him to know
How much I miss him
Would he forgive
If I return
I need him so
He's just got to know
So tell him, oh, tell him
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
