Oh, how happy
You have made me
Oh, how happy
You have made me
I have kissed your lips a thousand times
And more times than I can count I have called you mine
You have stood by me in my darkest hour, and
Oh, how happy
You have made me
Oh, how happy
You have made me
Oh, how happy
You have made me
Oh, how happy
You have made me
Now through our years together
We have had stormy weather
But our love has been so strong
That somehow we've carried on
And oh, how happy
Oh, how happy
You have made me
Listen, you brought joy to my delight
And all that was wrong, you have made it right
And I love you, I love, I love, love
Oh, how happy
You have made me
Oh, how happy
You have made me
Oh, how happy
Oh, how happy
Oh, how happy
You have made me
You have made me
You have made me
You have made me
You have made me
You have made me
You have made me
