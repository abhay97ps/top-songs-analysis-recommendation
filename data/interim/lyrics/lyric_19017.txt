Funny how it's hard to find the words sometimes, you know
Wishin' we could read minds
Don't wanna let our feelings show
So even if you say you don't understand
I'm willing to give as much time as I can
'Cause every time our eyes meet
Every time our eyes meet
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me 
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', to me
Just ain't no need for words to speak 
'Cause every time be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me 
You're always actin' so composed and cool
Never got too many words for me 
You always turn your head and make sure I see 
Baby, ain't nothin' wrong with the love
That you and I dream of; so sweet
Your actions say more than your lips can speak
My friends say that they just can't see 
How a love unspoken can be so deep 
And every time that you look my way
I see what your heart wants to say to me
Every time our eyes meet 
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me 
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', to me
Just ain't no need for words to speak 
Cause every time
Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me 
Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
Every time our eyes meet 
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', to me 
Just ain't no need for words to speak, 'cause every time
Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me 
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', to me
Oh yeah, yeah, oh
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', to me
Oh, whoa, yeah
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
Every time our eyes meet 
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me 
Just ain't no need for words to speak
'Cause every time 
Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
No need for words
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
