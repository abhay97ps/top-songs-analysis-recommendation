Fussin' and fightin', we back at it again 
I know that it's my fault you don't understand 
I got memories , this is crazy 
You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
Good with ma, good with pa, cool with all my niggas 
I should try, truth is I wanna let you in, but 
Damn these memories , and it's crazy 
You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know 
Girl, I really wanna work this out 'cause I'm tired of fighting 
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you 
I said I really wanna work this out, damn, girl, I'm trying 
It's no excuse, no excuse 
I got this icebox where my heart used to be 
Got this icebox where my heart used to be 
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold 
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold 
I got this icebox where my heart used to be 
Got this icebox where my heart used to be 
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold 
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
Why can't I get it right? Just can't let it go 
I opened up, she let me down, I won't feel that no more 
I got memories , this is crazy 
She ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
I don't mean to take it out on you, baby, but I can't help it
'Cause my heart is in the same ol' condition that baby left it 
I apologize 
Look me in my eyes and promise you won't do me the same, yeah, yeah
Girl, I really wanna work this out, 'cause I'm tired of fighting 
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you

I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I got this icebox where my heart used to be 
Got this icebox where my heart used to be
