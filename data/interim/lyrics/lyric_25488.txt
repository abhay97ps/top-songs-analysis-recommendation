I was born of the ice and snow
With the winter wolves, in the dark, alone
The wildest night, I became the one
And you'll know you're mine when the silence comes
Heavy is the crown only for the weak
A knife in my heart couldn't slow me down
'Cause power is power, my fire never goes out
I rise from my scars, nothing hurts me now
'Cause power is power
Now watch me burn it down
I been down with the coldest war
And I know where I been 'cause I bled before, yeah
How do I know if I let you stay?
How do I know if we did it your way?
You wouldn't take my place
Put me away, I'd die lookin' up at your face
How do I ever know? Who can I trust?
Feelings of emptiness
Only love could kill me, God bless
A knife in my heart
Couldn't slow me down 
'Cause power is power 
My fire never goes out
I rise from my scars
Nothing hurts me now 
'Cause power is power 
Now watch me burn it down
Breathe, feel the air that I breathe 
Air that I, air that I breathe
Who's hotter? Been a monster with a crown
So swamped by high water, keep your head up, you might drown
In this world, it's way colder, by the day, we count it down
Been around, just been waitin' up, she gon' come around
I took a drag, bust it out the gate, my lil baby, slay
I wore a flag, put that on my face, ain't nobody safe
Lift the mask, they gon' have to see what they can't erase
I took a lot, so I took it back 
Danger's on my mind
Ain't no knife, dagger, bullet that can do it
'Fore you, yeah, you know, I go right straight through it, yeah
Heavy is the crown, but never for a queen 
A knife in my heart
It couldn't slow me down 
'Cause power is power 
My fire never goes out 
I rise from my scars 
Nothing hurts me now 
'Cause power is power 
Now watch me burn it down 
Now watch me burn it down
