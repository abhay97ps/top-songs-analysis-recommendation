Now, I don't need to travel far
And I don't need to be a star
I don't need no one, to tell me if I'm right
You're the only one that matters in my life
I was made to love you
Love you, love you alone
Yes, I was made to love you
Love you, love you alone
I don't think I can pretend, no
'Cause baby, you're more than just a friend
We grew up together, living separate lives
Now, we need each other, what a big surprise
I was made to love you
Love you, love you alone
Yes, I was made to love you
Love you, love you alone
Love you, love you
Love you, love you alone
I was made to love
Behind my dreams are thoughts and feelings
They're tellin' me life lines never change
I believe in karma and I believe in you
And I feel somehow you believe in me too
I was made to love you
Love you, love you alone
I was made to love you
Love you, love you alone
I was made to love you
Love you, love you alone
I was made to love you
Yes, I was made to love
