Its all about you 
The way your making me feel inside feels just so right
Girl I've tried to front before I can't even lie
The way I stayed cool, tried to ignore you
But I knew there was nobody but you
The way you hold me it really shows me
You got a hold on me; you drive me crazy
Girl its what you do, I'm so into you
Your the reason why its all about
You make me feel so good I said
You give good loving that I can't deny
Said it makes me want to go and tell the whole wide world
About your loving girl you got me going
The way that you look at me brightens up my day
You bring out the best in me girl I have to say
Its all about the way you talk to me
Girl you know what I mean
Said I want you there's nobody who can love me like you do
Nobody
Girl its what you do I'm so into you
Your the reason why its all about you
You- You're the reason why I stay true
You're the reason why I love you
You're the reason why its all about you
