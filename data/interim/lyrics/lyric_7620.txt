Well, Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was twenty-five
Speed jive, don't want to stay alive
When you're twenty-five
And Wendy's stealing clothes from Marks & Sparks
And Freddy's got spots from ripping off the stars from his face
Funky little boat race
Television man is crazy saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
Oh, Man, I need TV when I've got T.Rex
Oh brother, you guessed
I'm a dude, dad
All the young dudes 
Carry the news 
Boogaloo dudes 
Carry the news
All the young dudes

Boogaloo dudes

Now Lucy looks sweet cause he dresses like a queen
But he can kick like a mule, it's a real mean team
But we can love
Oh yes, we can love
And my brother's back at home with his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
What a drag, too many snags
Now I've drunk a lot of wine and I'm feeling fine
Got to race some cat to bed
Oh is that concrete all around
Or is it in my head?
Yeah
I'm a dude, dad
All the young dudes 
Carry the news 
Boogaloo dudes 
Carry the news 
All the young dudes 
Carry the news 
Boogaloo dudes
