Lover's prayer
Heavenly father, up above
Please protect the one that I love
Guide & keep her and let her know
That I'll always love her so
No matter what my love may be
My heart is locked, and she holds the key
Of the girls we need to choose
She's the one that I hate to lose
Oh, she's only gone a while
But half a block seems like a mile
And when she's gone, I'll be so blue
I'll say goodbye my dearest I love you
Ooo-OOO-ooo
Lover's prayer
Ooo-OOO-ooo
