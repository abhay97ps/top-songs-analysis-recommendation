Uh, huh, uh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Uh, huh, uh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh
So you want, you want, you want to be mine
I can see it in your eyes, you giving me the sign
So you want, you want, you want to be mine
You can talk to the preacher, girl, and that'll be fine
Uh, huh, uh, huh
That's the way a woman is
Uh, huh, uh, huh
That's the way it is
Uh, huh
That's the way a woman is
Uh, huh
That's the way it is
So you want, you want, you want to do that
Sleep in the leaves and roll in the grass
So you want, you want, you want to do that
We can stop in the meadow once we're half the way back
Uh, huh, uh, huh
That's the way a woman is
Uh, huh, uh, huh
That's the way it is
Uh, huh
That's the way a woman is
Uh, huh
That's the way it is
So you want, you want, you want to be free now
Running like a winner, girl, doing what you please
So you want, you want, you want to be free
Turn yourself around; you will be released
Uh, huh, uh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Uh, huh, uh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh
So you want, you want, you want to step out
Well, I believe I understand what you're talking about
'Cause you got, you got, you got to be his
Didn't I say that's the way woman is
That's the way a woman is
Uh, huh
That's the way it is
Uh, huh
That's the way a woman is
Uh, huh
That's the way it is
