Don't walk away
Ripping out the root of love
Don't walk away
Ripping out the root of love
Tell me now what is in my heart
The kind of lies that have torn us apart
You lay down in the road
Baring your bloody soul
Don't need no satisfaction
Guaranteed my main attraction
Ripping love out by the roots
Though my ghost is still with you
It hurts to watch you turn away
So I'm tearing out the truth
Don't walk away
Ripping out the root of love
Don't walk away
Ripping out the root of love
Don't walk away
Ripping out the root of love
Don't walk away
Ripping out the root of love
Time passes slowly, time passes on
Waiting for my man to call
When there's no man at all
Do I stand here waiting
For the earth to turn to dust
Give up my passion
Rendering my lust
Or do I walk away
Don't walk away
Ripping out the root of love
Don't walk away
Ripping out the root of love
Ripping out the root of love
Ripping out the root of love
