Never believed in love at first sight
But I believe what i'm feeling tonight
Cause when I saw you across the room
I felt my heart going boom boom boom
I looked, I fell so hard
Girl I know you can tell that
I'm hooked on you, oh girl
You know i'm falling for you because
I looked, I fell so hard
Girl I know you can tell that
I'm hooked on you, oh girl
You know I'm falling for you because
One look in your eyes
I knew we two would always be together
And there are 3 little words that say it all
I love you
Girl I realize that I wanna be with you forever
So SAY those 3 little words I wanna hear
I love you
I was waiting for a sign from you
Hoping you'd feel the same way too
When you looked at me and smiled
My heart was going a thousand miles
I stopped, turned around
I tried to keep my feet of the ground
As I stepped to you we touched
I knew you were feeling it too because
One look in your eyes
I knew we two would always be together
And there are 3 little words that say it all
I love you
Girl I realize that I wanna be with you forever
So SAY those 3 little words I wanna hear
I love you
I know it's written all over my face
And girl you can believe it's true
That time could never erase these feelings I have for you
One look in your eyes
I knew we two would always be together
And there are 3 little words that say it all
I love you
Girl I realize that I wanna be with you forever
So SAY those 3 little words I wanna hear
I love you
