It was about five until five on Friday
We were all getting ready to go
And the boss man started screaming
And his veins began to show
He said you and you come with me
Cause you're going to have to stay
My heart was thumping I was jumping
I had to get away
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance
Well I was talking with my baby
Over a small glass of tea
He asked the loaded question
It seems unreal to me that
He said how do you feel about me
My mind was racing I was pacing
But the words just wouldn't come
And there was only one thing
Left to do I feel it coming on
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance
You got to loosen up those chains and dance
Come on and loosen up those chains and dance
