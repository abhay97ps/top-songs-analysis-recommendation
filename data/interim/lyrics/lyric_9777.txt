Now he's free not like you and me
They treat him like a star
You see
Now he's got the key
He's fancy free
He doesn't hide from extasy
Do you hear me
Do you hear me
He's with the angels and the sun in the sky
He's a rock and roll star
He's got it made
Plays it straighter than straight
He's a rock and roll star
Yes
He's a rock and roll star
A super star - he feels fine
Yes
He's a rock and roll star
A super star - he feels fine
Would you believe
Oh
He lives without grieve
They let him go on new years eve
Fortune and fame
Oh
What a shame
There ain't nobody left to blame
Do you hear me
Do you hear me
He's with the angels and the sun in the sky
