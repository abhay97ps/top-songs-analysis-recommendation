Uh, with your bad self
Say it louder 
Say it louder 
Looka here
Some people say we got a lot of malice
Some say it's a lotta nerve
But I say we won't quit moving
Until we get what we deserve
We've been 'buked and we've been scorned
We've been treated bad, talked about
As sure as you're born
But just as sure as it take two eyes to make a pair, huh
Brother, we can't quit until we get our share
Say it loud 
Say it loud 
One more time, say it loud 
I've worked on jobs with my feet and my hands
But all the work I did was for the other man
And now we demands a chance
To do things for ourselves
We're tired of beating our heads against the wall
And working for someone else
Say it loud 
Say it loud 
Say it loud 
Say it loud 
OW! Ooh-wee, you're killing me
Alright, you're out of sight
Alright, so tough, you're tough enough
Ooh-wee uh, you're killing me, ow
Say it loud 
Say it louder 
Now we demand a chance to do things for ourselves
We're tired of beating our heads against the wall
And working for someone else
Look here, there's one thing more I got to say right here
Now, we're people like the birds and the bees
We rather die on our feet, than keep living on our knees
Say it loud 
Say it loud 
Say it loud 
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, say it loud
