Oh, I got a man, sho'nuff a real man, uh-huh
Good ol' man, that's what I got
Good ol' man, said helps a lot
A real man, strong but tender
Baby that's the kind of man I need
To his love I will surrender
'cause he'll keep his mind on pleasing me
'Cause he's the right kind a lover
I'll never need another
Sho'nuff he's got the stuff
He's the right kinda lover for me
An interesting conversation
Every once in a while
Always prompt and attentive
'cause my darlin' knows that that is my style
'Cause he's the right kind a lover
I'll never need another
Sho'nuff he's got the stuff
He's the right kinda lover for me
He's the right kind a lover
I'll never need another
Sho'nuff he's got the stuff
He's the right kinda lover for me
Every night when I get down on my knees to pray
I thank the Lord for sending Mister Right my way
This kind of love had to come from Heaven down
I ain't never gonna let him go
Because I need this kind of man around
'Cause he's the right kind a lover
I'll never need another
Sho'nuff he's got the stuff
He's the right kinda lover for me
He's the right kind a lover
I'll never need another
Sho'nuff he's got the stuff
He's the right kinda lover for me
Yes he is, strong and attentive
Said that he's the right height
And the right build
Goes to work every day and the man pays all our bills
Come home in the evening, moving slow
But doesn't hear that, tell you the man can go, go, go
He just loves me, ooh, the right way
That's how he keeps this permanent smile on my face
He's the right man
Sho'nuff he's got the stuff
He's the right kinda lover
Oh baby, that's my baby
He's the right kind a lover
I'll never need another
Sho'nuff he's got the stuff
He's the right kinda lover for me
He's the right kinda lover for me
He's the right kind a lover
I'll never need another
Sho'nuff he's got the stuff
He's the right kinda lover for me
That's my baby 
That's my baby
Said he's Mister Good Stuff, good stuff
 Said he's Mister Good Stuff, good stuff
He's the right kind a lover
I'll never need another
Sho'nuff he's got the stuff
He's the right kinda lover for me
Gives me what I need
What I need...
