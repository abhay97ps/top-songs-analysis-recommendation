I'm gonna be here for you baby
I'll be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard
I want to sleep with you forever
And I want to die in your arms
In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm
And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
Making memories of us
I wanna honor your mother
And I wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention like a bad outlaw
And I wanna stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men
I wanna make your world better than it's ever been
And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
Making memories of us
We'll follow the rainbow
Wherever the four winds blow
And there'll be a new day
Coming your way
I'm gonna be here for you from now on
This you know somehow
You've been stretched to the limits
But it's alright now
And I'm gonna make you a promise
If there's life after this
I'm gonna be there to meet you
With a warm, wet kiss
Yes, I am
And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
Making memories of us
And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll win your trust
Making memories of us
Oh baby
