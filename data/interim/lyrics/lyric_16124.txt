Baby, there's no need to tell you
As far as I can clearly recall
My love has been here for you
So you don't have to worry at all
I'll sacrifice my time
I'll make sure you're satisfied
And it's no hard thing to the joy I bring
I wanna give you all my love
Loving you 
Every day 
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit 
Loving you 
Every day 
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit 
Baby, I'm in need of your love
And you got that touch that I need so much
And I am about to explode
Freely, completely
Everything you want, I'll be
Good love down to the last drop
And I'm not gonna stop
Loving you 
Every day 
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit 
Loving you 
Every day 
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit
Loving you is all I wanna do
Loving you is all I wanna do
Loving you, said loving you
Is all that I, all that I wanna do
Baby, baby, baby, hey
Loving you 
Every day 
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit
Loving you 
Every day 
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit
