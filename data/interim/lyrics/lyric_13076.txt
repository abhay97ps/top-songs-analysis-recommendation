Ah dreamy lips, set in motion, flashing
Ah breathless hush, poundin' soft, lasting
Oh glossy mouth, a taste untamed, moving
Carousel, up and down
Just like you
Oh baby
Just one more time to touch you
Just one more time to tell you
You're on my mind
Baby, why can't I have you?
You're breakin' my heart in two
You know what I'm goin' through
Oh baby, why can't I have you?
Oh candy smile, all the while, glinting
Your eyes like mica, a lethal pout, hinting
Ooh and I felt the pressure, tight and warm, softly striking
Ooh I tripped and stumbled
I cling forever
I go all night
Oh baby
Just one more time to touch you
Just one more time to tell you
I'm not so blind
Baby, why can't I have you?
Always breakin' my heart in two
You know what I'm goin' through
Uh oh baby, why can't I have you?
 oh baby  why can't I have you?
You know what I'm goin' through
You're breakin' my heart, breakin' my heart
 breakin' my heart
 oh baby  I need you
You're breakin' my heart 
Oh baby, I need you so much, I need you, touch
 oh baby
