Like children
Rarely seen and never heard
Emotion
Bare your soul you'll never learn
But don't ask why
And you won't get lied to
Speak to them softly
It's something you get used to
You think you know her
But you never really
Lived a life without her
You couldn't tell me
The things she said, the books she read
The way she looked when the morning came
The time of night that you held her tight
But you'll never forget the day she ran away
I found her
All alone lost in a crowd
When she saw me
I felt so much I cried aloud
She turned away
I couldn't speak to stop her
The only sound I heard
Was the echo of her laughter
You think you know her
But you never really
Lived a life without her
You couldn't tell me
The things she said, the books she read
The way she looked when the morning came
The time of night that you held her tight
But you'll never forget the day she ran away
You think you know her
But you never really
Lived a life without her
You couldn't tell me
The things she said, the books she read
The way she looked when the morning came
The time of night that you held her tight
But you'll never forget the day she ran away
The things she said, the books she read
The way she looked when the morning came
The time of night that you held her tight
But you'll never forget the day she ran away
The things she said, the books she read
The way she looked when the morning came
The time of night that you held her tight
But you'll never forget the day she ran away
The things she said, the books she read
The way she looked when the morning came
The time of night that you held her tight
But you'll never forget the day she ran away
