Today's teardrops are tomorrow's rainbows and
Tomorrow's rainbows I will share, share with you
So dry your eyes little girl dry your eyes
And we're gonna see skies of blue
Had a tough time gettin' started
Maybe just a little down hearted
All you got to do is count to ten
Maybe you'd be smiling when
Today's teardrops are tomorrow's rainbows and
Tomorrow's rainbows I will share, share with you
So dry your eyes little girl dry your eyes
And we're gonna see skies of blue
Gonna be just love and gladness
Don't wanna hear nothing bout sadness
Come a little closer come to me
With each kiss you're gonna see
