Wherever I go, whoever I see
How is Julie?
My friends ask of me
How is Julie?
Friends wants to know
Give her our love and that we said hello
You're such a lucky guy
All my friends would say
For an angel like Julie to love you that way
Everyone knows Julie is mine
So when they ask me
I say that she's fine
But if they'd look closer
They'd know it's a lie
For my darlin' Julie left me last night
Yes my darlin' Julie, my wonderful Julie
My sweet angel, Julie, left me last night
