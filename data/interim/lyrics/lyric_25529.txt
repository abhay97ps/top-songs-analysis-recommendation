Cook that shit up, Quay
Oh my gosh, back at it again 
In the kitchen whippin', I'm wrappin' again 
Keep on playin', bitch, then I'm stabbin' your friend 
I'm in the hood, they think I'm back trappin' again 
Woo, oh my gosh, back at it again 
On my grizzy, nigga stack, stackin' again 
Big old .40 on me, back packin' again 
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz 
Uh, back at it, back at it, uh
Count up a hundred, throw racks at it, uh
Yeah, my wrist a Titanic, uh
Ice hit the glacier, it do damage 
Uh, yeah, your nigga gon' panic
I see through her panties like a panoramic 
Yeah, then get back to whippin'
Then get back to trappin', young nigga back at it 
Uh, if it's too crowded, might shoot out the roof
And say let 'em come through 
Keep it one thousand when I'm in the booth
I spent two thousand to step in the shoes 
Gang on gang, how you think we gon' lose? 
Back to back motorcade, that's how we move 
On mama porch, I was sittin' on the stoop 
When I hopped up, I took off to the moon 
Oh my gosh, back at it again 
In the kitchen whippin', I'm wrappin' again 
Keep on playin', bitch, then I'm stabbin' your friend 
I'm in the hood, they think I'm back trappin' again 
Woo, oh my gosh, back at it again 
On my grizzy, nigga stack, stackin' again 
Big old .40 on me, back packin' again 
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz 
My diamonds like Fiji, bitch, I'm Yella Beezy
Iced out in this freezer, just copped a Luigi
Oh, take it easy, you trippin', I'm leavin'
My drank in the freezer, this shit don't come easy 
I'm trappin', I mean it, my belt double G me 
That cooler, the heater, TEC-9, se√±orita
I'll send some shots through a nigga wifebeater
Chopper knock a nigga out of his Fila 
Don't call me, lil' baby, I'm sorry, don't need ya 
Last month I got shot, I been went up on features 
Body for body, my niggas some demons
We tit for tat, leave you busted and bleedin' 
Stopped in Atlanta, in the booth with my nina
Back in the day, used to trap in the Bimmer
I'm a true hustler, my bitch is a schemer
Skeet in her eyes and that lil' bitch a creamer 
Oh my gosh, back at it again 
In the kitchen whippin', I'm wrappin' again 
Keep on playin', bitch, then I'm stabbin' your friend 
I'm in the hood, they think I'm back trappin' again 
Woo, oh my gosh, back at it again 
On my grizzy, nigga stack, stackin' again 
Big old .40 on me, back packin' again 
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz 
Wrist so froze, I can't shake hands, I gotta give you a pound 
Way my bank account quadrupled, think I'm still slangin' pounds 
Told 'em castin' my vote for who tryna get this dope 'cross the border 
Guwop, I'm from East Atlanta, but stand my ground like it's Florida 
Fuck the judge, fuck the bailiff, fuck the local reporter 
Tell the whole truth to my lawyer, Guwop slicker than oil 
Park the Dawn, rode the Wraith, took the trip with the art
Look like a Rolls dealership every time I bring out my cars
Fuckin' stars, buy the bar, neighborhood superstar 
24K, Bruno Mars down to the drawers 
I'm thinking' large, talkin' old money, Chico DeBarge 
Blue 720, futuristic, move when it's parked, it's Gucci
Oh my gosh, back at it again 
In the kitchen whippin', I'm wrappin' again 
Keep on playin', bitch, then I'm stabbin' your friend 
I'm in the hood, they think I'm back trappin' again 
Woo, oh my gosh, back at it again 
On my grizzy, nigga stack, stackin' again 
Big old .40 on me, back packin' again 
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz
