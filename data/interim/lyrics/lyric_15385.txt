Babyyy 
Hi it's me once again
My name is Daisy Dee
I wanna show you how to party me and MC B
The bass is pumpin' into your body
Don't think about it
C'mon get started
It doesn't matter if you're infirm
Dance to the rhythm is your concern
We get up, get crazy, healling
....... and jack you're chilling
Dance to the rhythm for me to make you crazy
Don't think that I can make you leavin'
Dance to the rhythm for me to make you crazy
Don't think that I can make you leavin'
Dance to the rhythm, shake your body
Gimme your attention if you wanna party
Yeah, c'mon let's do it
Now it's the time to get into it
Black, the color of the skin, no deny
Rap is the way to express all the rimes
Wherever you're in trouble or ever you're down
I'll keep your body pumpin' to the movin' sound
Dance to the rhythm for me to make you crazy
Don't think that I can make you leavin'
Dance to the rhythm for me to make you crazy
Don't think that I can make you leavin'
Stop moving the mic I'm doing my case
I'm comin' on strong ........
So free your mind and go into it
Take your time, and let's hell do it
Don't forget the name is Daisy
Operation's in the house to make you crazy
Direction? I won't tell you
Actually the way to tell you what to do
Dance to the rhythm for me to make you crazy
Don't think that I can make you leavin'
Dance to the rhythm for me to make you crazy
Don't think that I can make you leavin'
Dance to the rhythm for me to make you crazy
Don't think that I can make you leavin'
Dance to the rhythm for me to make you crazy
Don't think that I can make you leavin'
