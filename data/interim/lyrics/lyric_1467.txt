I was swervin' in a lane, took a trip through the rain
With my bae, she the main, had to switch, never feign tho
Keep that thang closed, need a raincoat
She contains notes, entertains, jokes
We had noticed, been drivin’ all day 'cuz it's night time we just
Focus, keep on lookin’ at white lines as the
Moment, passes throughout the bright sign, might climb
We just right now, hit up lights out
Speed through right out, right out
'Cuz we was vibin' and we took a bad turn for the worst
Dispersin' these feelings and killin' it, killin' it worse 
Searchin' solutions but servin' the problems
Fightin’ the promise, keepin’ it honest
I'm a just stop it, this is so common
More feelings have been inflicting my pain
Broke meaning I have to change up the game
Slow healing from all the fake that you gave
The switch up, the switch up 
More feelings have been inflicting my pain
Broke meaning I have to change up the game
Slow healing from all the fake that you gave
The switch up, the switch up, the switch up 
There’s one thang, one way, I miss you, so come play
No games, need to say, ya lovin' sense, relieve the stress
Come on baby, this tunnel feels like a mosh pit
Some day we can channel our inner conscience
And young fables can fail to mention the noxious
What's true is if we can really be honest
What's honest, the part that were takin’ it over
Caused problems, the part that we needed more closure
Need to be closer, I'm stoppin' the sad and the sorrow
The ending is never so holllow
I'm takin' the damage and building a follow
The light that will hit us tomorrow
More feelings have been inflicting my pain
Broke meaning I have to change up the game 
Slow healing from all the fake that you gave
The switch up, the switch up 
More feelings have been inflicting my pain
Broke meaning I have to change up the game
Slow healing from all the fake that you gave
The switch up, the switch up, the switch up 
The switch up, woah, the switch up, woah
The switch up, yeah, the switch up, woah
*Beat Switch*
I never wanted to begin another endin'
But it's my time and I'm gonna rhyme every mention
About the position I dealt within the lenses
My senses are tingling, 'cuz I here the ring
Take a step in, start confessin'
Jugglin' much and I know that's a lie
Takin' my time and I kill every rhyme
Keep on denyin it knowin' I try
I wanna see you do more than just cry
Why you be buggin' me, look in your eyes
You got em red but you don't fit the size 
Manic inside
More feelings 
Broke meaning 
Slow healing 
The switch up 
More feelings 
Broke meaning 
Slow healing 
The switch up (woah
More feelings have been inflicting my pain 
Broke meaning I have to change up the game 
Slow healing from all the fake that you gave
The switch up, the switch up, the switch up 
Tiptoein' through the back, gonna open up the hatch
Gonna grapple up an axe, fix a problem where its at
And we knowin' how you act, take a road, take a path
This ain't cold, just a scrap of what you hold, unmask
And we knowin' the story of what's true see
Let's meet lucy, I'm not Bruce Lee, I'm bruised beat and raw
I'm goin' in dethawed, I slaughter up, chop beats and jaw
You can't stop me, I'm on the top leaf, top tier don't copy
Do not stear on foxy, welcome to our house where people be cocky
And that is how I be 'round people to not be
Can't fathom that top seat
More feelings have been inflicting my pain 
Broke meaning I have to change up the game 
Slow healing from all the fake that you gave
The switch up, the switch up, the switch up 
Talkin' all that, all that, nothin' will happen
I'm trynna make it from rappin'
You don't want to see me happy
'Cuz I got plenty of pens like you, that could be my addict
And I don't want no more damage
Think I'm a need one more aspirin, imagine
The abuser gets looser because you all are just sheep
Stuck in a shed of defeat, got both ya hands and ya feet
Stuck in the mud, you achieve, you're not a goat your a sheep
Just a follower heaping to the end of a streak
Win, win, lose some, overcome some 
In the hut, waiting for another lug nut 
To the one, you're a tool, better unplug
None of above, getting screwed 'till the nut comes
More feelings have been inflicting my pain 
Broke meaning I have to change up the game 
Slow healing from all the fake that you gave
The switch up, the switch up, the switch up 
More feelings have been inflicting my pain 
Broke meaning I have to change up the game 
Slow healing from all the fake that you gave
The switch up, the switch up, the switch up 
The switch up, woah, the switch up, woah
