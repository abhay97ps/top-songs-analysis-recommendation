When you're on top of the world, when it's got you down
When you're flying through the air or when you're crashing to the ground
When you're searching for the light and it's nowhere to be found
Just phone me, baby
I don't wanna be the strings that ever tie you down
I won't ever be the broken wings that keep you on the ground
But when you start to sing I'll be the sound
Just let me, baby!
I only wanna be the one you love
I only wanna be the one you want
Come and get me, baby, let me loose inside your soul
I only wanna be your every need
I wanna be the girl in all your dreams
I'll do anything to be the one you love
Baby you can tell me anything, all the secrets of your heart
If you could look inside of me you'd see how beautiful you are
I wanna show everything, each and every part of me is yours
Just take it, ba-baby!
I only wanna be the one you love
I only wanna be the one you want
Come and get me, baby, let me loose inside your soul
I only wanna be your every need
I wanna be the girl in all your dreams
I'll do anything to be the one you love
Let me be the lover
You want to uncover
Let me be the one you love
Yeah, baby!
I only wanna be the one you love
I only wanna be the one you want
Come and get me, baby, let me loose inside your soul
I only wanna be your every need
I wanna be the girl in all your dreams
I'll do anything to be the one you  love!
I only wanna be the one you love 
I only wanna be the one you want 
Come and get me, baby, let me loose inside your soul 
I only wanna be your every need 
I wanna be the girl in all your dreams 
I'll do anything to be the one you love 
I only wanna be the one you love  
I only wanna be the one you want 
Come and get me, baby, let me loose inside your soul 
I only wanna be your every need 
I wanna be the girl in all your dreams 
I'll do anything to be the one you 
I only wanna bethe one you love
I only wanna be the one you want 
Come and get me, baby, let me loose inside your soul 
I only wanna be your every need
I wanna be the girl in all your dreams...
