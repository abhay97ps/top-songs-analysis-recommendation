Danger eyes are no surprise
In staying wise to you
Shady walks
And midnight stalks
Have showed me what to do
Kept my cool
This ain't no fool
You think you're messing with
I know how to keep you 'round
Cause I know where you been
You think that
They really want just you
I'm the only one knows what to do
'Cause you've been bad
Baby, oh, so bad
Baby
And there's only one thing can be done
You need a little bit of this medicine
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
You need a little bit of this medicine
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
Every time I think you're mine
You're up to somethin' new
I've done almost everything
To try to get to you
All my friends are just dead ends
In helpin' me alone
I just keep on wondering
What am I doing wrong?
There is only one thing left to try
On this cure
I'm sure I can rely
Cause you've been bad
Baby, oh, so bad
And there's only one thing can be done
You need a little bit of this medicine
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
You need a little bit of this medicine
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
Cause you've been bad, baby
Oh, you've been so bad
And there's only one thing can be done
Take your medicine
Take your medicine
Take your medicine
Take your medicine
Take your medicine
Take your medicine
Take your medicine
Take your medicine
You gotta take it
If you wanna shake it
You gotta take it
If you wanna shake it
You gotta take
It if you wanna shake it
You gotta take it
If you wanna shake it
You need a little bit of this medicine
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
You need a little bit of this medicine
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
You need a little bit of this medicine
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
You need a little bit of this medicine
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
