His name was Steve
Her name was Gina
They met at a bar called Cabo Wabo Cantina
He was a minstered salesman from South Dakota
She was a first grade school teacher Phoenix Arizona
They started dancing and it got real hot
Then it spilled over to the parking lot
One more tequila they were falling in love
One more is never enough
Don't bite off more than you can chew
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do
Just remember when you let it all go
What happens down in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
He woke up in the morning and he made a little telephone call
To check on his wife and his kids back at home in Sioux Falls
She hopped right in the shower with a heavy heavy mind
He knew it was the first time Gina had ever crossed that line
They walked down to the beach and started drinking again
Jumped into the ocean for a dirty swim
One more margarita then we're falling in love
One more's never enough
Don't bite off more than you can chew
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do
Just remember when you let it all go
What happens down in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Oh Mexico
Waiting at the bar at the terminal gate
She says "Steve I gotta go, I'm going to miss my plane"
He said "one more tequila for you climb on up"
She said "one more's never enough"
Don't bite off more than you can chew
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do
Just remember when you let it all go
What happens down in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Oh Mexico
