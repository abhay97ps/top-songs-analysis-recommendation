The lights are out and I barely know you
We're going up and the place is slowing down 
I knew you'd come around
You captivate me, something about you has got me
I was lonely, now you make me feel alive 
Will you be mine tonight?
Take me on the floor 
I can't take it anymore 
I want you, I want you, I want you to show me love
Just take me on the floor 
I can give you more 
You kill me, you kill me, you kill me with your touch
My heart is racing as you're moving closer
You take me higher with every breath I take 
Would it be wrong to stay?
One look at you and I know what you're thinking
Time's a bitch and my heart is sinking down 
You turn me inside out
Take me on the floor 
I can't take it anymore 
I want you, I want you, I want you to show me love
Just take me on the floor 
I can give you more 
You kill me, you kill me, you kill me with your touch
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna kiss a boy
I wanna
I wanna kiss a girl 
I wanna kiss a girl 
I wanna kiss a boy 
I wanna kiss a 
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da 
Take me on the floor 
I can't take it anymore 
I want you, I want you, I want you to show me love
Just take me on the floor 
I can give you more 
You kill me, you kill me, you kill me with your touch
Take me on the floor 
I can't take it anymore 
I want you, I want you, I want you to show me love
Just take me on the floor 
I can give you more 
You kill me, you kill me, you kill me
Please don't stop
