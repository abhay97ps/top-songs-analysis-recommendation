5 7 0 5..but there's no reply
5 7 0 5
Got myself just one more dime
But will the operator hold the line
When my ears keeps telling me there's no reply 
Pick up the telephone
I go crazy when there's no one home
I feel cheated and small when my number's on the wall of your room
Call me soon 
Chorus:
5 7 0 5
But theres no reply
I keep calling
5 7 0 5
Why do you keep me hanging on the line
I can't believe that there's no one there
Is this a private number love affair
With your phonebook lover still waiting on wire 
I see the light shine behind your door
I head the party on the second floor
But you only pretend that you've been visiting friends from abroud
Tell me more 
Chorus
Mysterious feeling
I can't believe what she done to me
But it's too late now
It's all over town
5 7 0 5
But there's no reply
5 7 0 5
Can you hold the line x2
