Look, I ain't got nothin' to say to you
I can't even believe you
You know what? I'm too fly for this shit
You playin' yourself
Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me that she is just a friend
Then why she's callin' you at three o'clock in the mornin'?
I can't take this no more, no 
Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me that she is just a friend
Then why she's callin' you at three o'clock in the mornin'?
I ain't tryna hear it 
Look, nigga, what you think this is?
You treat me like a random chick 
You done forgot who introduced you to rocks
And poppin' all that Cris' an shit
Who let you hit it from the back any way that you like?
And any debts I can pay the price
I thought I was a chick you would make your wife 
And now a bitch can't even stay the night 
I can't even look in ya face without wantin' to slap you
Damn, I thank God I ain't get that tattoo
You better thank God I ain't have the strap, boo
You ain't even worth nann trick get at you
Matter fact, Trick, get at dude
I'm convinced I ain't got shit to ask you
And tell the triflin' bitch she can have you
I ain't lookin' at you no more, I'm lookin' past you
Here we go , here we go again
Now you're tellin' me that she is just a friend
Then why she's callin' you at three o'clock in the mornin'?
I can't take this no more, no 
Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me that she is just a friend
Then why she's callin' you at three o'clock in the mornin'?
I ain't tryna hear it 
When my girl came through with the news
All I did was think about me and you like, damn 
What a chick gotta do to get with a real nigga
That know how to stay true? Like, man 
No more quarter to eights , you better hop on a bus or a cab 
I shed so many tears, can't believe how many years
The baddest bitch put up witch yo' dusty ass 
Now you know that I'm the queen of Miami 
All that loud talkin', lyin', save that shit for ya mami 
Sounds like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah 
I'm like, uh-huh , okay , wassup?  Shut up 
Here we go , here we go again
Now you're tellin' me that she is just a friend 
Then why she's callin' you at three o'clock in the mornin'?
I can't take this no more, no 
Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me that she is just a friend
Then why she's callin' you at three o'clock in the mornin'?
I ain't tryna hear it 
Now all my ladies say 
And if you feel me, say 
If you can't take no more, say
No, no, no , no, no, no
Here we go , here we go again 
Now you're tellin' me , that she is just a friend 
Then why she's callin' you at three o'clock in the mornin'?
I can't take this no more
That's why I'm packin' up my jewels, grabbin' up my furs
I'll be back for all my shoes and purses 
Watch me bounce in my seven-forty-five while I'm ridin' out 
'Cause I ain't tryna hear it , not this time
