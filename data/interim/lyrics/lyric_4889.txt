I'm comin' home
To your loving heart
To the one that I once
Threw away and broke apart
I want you 
I need you 
A chance is all I'm askin' now
I must get back to you somehow
So I am comin' home to you
'Cause I am nothing without you
Maybe you found somebody new
But I'm still comin' home to you
Please let me stay
And forget your pride
Now, my world is falling 'round me
I got nowhere to hide
I want you 
I need you 
I know it's true I made you cry
Then like a fool I said goodbye
Now, I am comin' home to you
Yes, life is nothing without you
Maybe you found somebody new
But I'm still comin' home to you
