She falls somewhere in between
Levi's and Vogue Magazine
She doesn't paint on her face
But what she does she does with taste
And you can call her Plain Jane
But she's drivin' me insane

 Well, let me love you baby, yeah
She kisses with her lips so tight
Ooh, it hits me just like dynamite
Her sweet, simple innocence
