Lately I find myself driving past your house
Past the bar we used to go, whoa
Anywhere that you might be
Oh, that's where my body leads me
Ooh, it's the only place I know
Gonna follow where it leads me
Even if I don't wanna go
Here I am, back to the bullet
Shoot me down again, I want you to
Here I am, back to the bullet
This time I won't run from you
Heard it all before and I know I'll hear it again
"He's no good, better stay away"
But every night when I picture us alone
Oh, the words just fade away
Holding on to yesterday
Here I am, back to the bullet
Shoot me down again, I want you to, oh
Here I am, back to the bullet
This time I won't run from you
Run from you
Whoa, c'mon, baby
This is where I belong
Been running from the truth too long
This is where I belong
Been running from the truth too long
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...
Here I am, back to the bullet
This time I won't, this time I won't
This time I won't run from you
Ooh, I won't run from you
No, no, no, no, no, no
I won't run from you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I won't run from you
I won't run from you
Hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey
I won't run
