I’ve been thinkin’ ‘bout
I’ve been thinkin’ ‘bout
H-i-p h-o-p
When I was born I put a mirror to my music, the reflection was my life
Put some speakers up in heaven, spit my prayers into the mic
Went in like he’s an A&R, he said he is god
Better live your lyrics ‘cause the spittin’ ain’t a paying job
True dat, but you already knew that
‘cause you be thinking free whenever hearing ‘bout some new raps
Or wear my MC hat, like I put my shoes on
Rising to reclining every night is like a new song, who on?
Not me, you dawg? You lying like Snoop Dogg
Never find another one like me like Lou Rawls
My only diss records by myself man, screw y’all
Transition in albums like I’m moving with a U-Haul
Different home, different man, let me introduce y’all
My music ain’t as much for those who do ball, still fall
Pick themselves up and overlook the interception
Wake up a new song, thank god for the blessing, nah mean?
Ain’t just talk man, we live it
The lyrics and the way that we walk man, we live it
AltAir bring the beat with the soul, that’s the spirit
You hear it in the way we compose man, we live it
SkyBlew…
And we gon’ rock that
Submit it to the globe, let ‘em know can’t stop that
Committed oh lord, pictures we paint beyond vivid
It’s more than just music, understand we live it, word?
Look
Lacing up my shoes, gotta move right
Death is a choice but decided I’d choose life
Decipher the matrix, showing you the basics
Black and white affair to the mind of the racist
But me, I’m a colorful dreamer
Redeemer of the light, bring sight through dark days, no Beemer in the lot
But still got a drive undeniable
It’s all about survival, my stripes beyond tribal
Look, it’s the revival, the real has returned
I’m relaxed in the mind, no lie, thinking  perm
But I’m natural, every verse all factual
Tryna see the world but they handed my sabbatical
But luckily I’m tactical, I got another plan
Granny tired of all the pomp, you never get the upper hand
Ah man, it’s like my style remastered
Nobody seeing me and Swiss, you just missed the rapture
Oh no fam, it ain’t just talk man, we live it
The lyrics and the way that we walk man, we live it
AltAir bring the beat with the soul, that’s the spirit
You hear it in the way we compose man, we live it
Talk to ‘em y’all
And we gon’ rock that
Submit it to the globe, let ‘em know can’t stop that
Committed oh lord, pictures we paint beyond vivid
It’s more than just music, understand we live it, word?
