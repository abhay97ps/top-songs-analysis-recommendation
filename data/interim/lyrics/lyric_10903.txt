Midnight, I watch you as you're sleeping
You don't know that I'm leaving my bag is packed to go
Oh, no, no, no, it hurts me, hurts me so to leave you
Leaving for someone who I hardly even know
But time is come to say goodbye
To spread my wings and fly
To feel the need I feel inside
But I keep feeling these love pains
Hurting me through and through, caught between a lover or two
Oh, will I ever be free from these love pains?
Tearing me all apart 'cause I don't wanna break your heart
Oh, will I ever be free from these love pains?
Can't help, can't help but remember the love we had so tender
A world so safe and sound
Oh no, no, no, what is this? Temptation so inviting
A feeling so exciting has turned it upside down
Oh and though, I know I could be wrong
This feeling's much too strong
I got to be where I belong
But I keep feeling these love pains
Hurting me through and through, caught between a lover or two
Oh, will I ever be free from these love pains?
Tearing me all apart 'cause I don't wanna break your heart
Oh, will I ever be free from these love pains? Oh no
Love pains
Hurting me through and through, caught between a lover or two
Oh, will I ever be free from these love pains?
Tearing me all apart 'cause I don't wanna break your heart
Oh, will I ever be free from these love pains?
Hurting me through and through, caught between a lover or two
Oh, will I ever be free from these love pains?
Tearing me all apart 'cause I don't wanna break your heart
