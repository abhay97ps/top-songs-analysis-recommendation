Oh
Once again it's on
And we gonna ride out once again 'till dawn
Cut the lights out once again 'till morn
Keep the lights out 'till the end of the song
You're feelin' me
And it's got you all fired up
Tryna walk away
'Cause you don't want your heart tied up
(But I can feel the proof when your holdin' me
Like to let you think your controlin' me)
Even though that ain't the deal
When I want, I take the wheel, and I know
'Cause you know I keep it real
Giving you what you can feel
 Hey
Whatever you need, that's me
Feelin' the flow, don't stop it
Whatever you need, I'll be
Whatever you want, I got it
 That's me
 Yeah, yeah
You're frontin' like 
You don't want no-one to know
But it's in your eyes
That you don't want me to go
(But I can feel the proof when your holdin' me
Like to let you think your controlin' me)
Even though that ain't the deal
When I want, I take the wheel, and I know
'Cause you know I keep it real
Giving you what you can feel
 Hey
Whatever you need, that's me
Feelin' the flow, don't stop it
Whatever you need, I'll be
Whatever you want, I got it
 That's me
 Yeah, yeah
Now who get the party jumpin' like me
Who crunk it like me?
Lotta of guys here, but none is like me
Though some could try to be
With two or three chains up under the white tee
And I got two or three dames that's comin' tonight
See em, done tonight leave
Like one, aight peace
Only Mike puts up numbers like these
And he's no longer playin', but neither am I
So what I'm sayin' is hop in the deuce seater with I
'Cause you know with them boots and that beater you fly
Other dudes act to cheap with the pie
Won't drop a few pennies
Or cop you a guinea
But I'll cop you as many
Toast 'till the bottles all empty
Like pardon the Bravado in me
Us two, that's a plan somehow
Get to know each other later
Let's dance for now, c'mon
Whatever you want  I got it
 Ooh
 Oh
 Take me, that's me
(Whatever you want, I got it
Whatever you need, that's me) Ohoho
 Don't stop it
Whatever you want 
Whatever you need 
Feelin' the flow 
 Whatever you want
 I got it, I got it
 Whatever you need
 Baby
 I'll be
Whatever you want, I got it
Whatever you need, that's me
Yeah
Whatever you want, I got it
Whatever you need that, that's me
Yeah
