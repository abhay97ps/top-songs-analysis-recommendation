When I look deep into your eyes
That's when I know I'm living
For every moment of our lives
We should be forgiven, oh
We'll hold each other when we cry
Even if we fall
Somehow, we'll be lovers after all
In time we'll learn to understand
The meaning of together, my love
If we keep walking hand in hand
Then nothing else will matter
There will be no need to hide
Feelings that we keep inside
We'll hold each other when we cry
Even if we fall
Somehow, we'll be lovers after all
Oooooh, ooh
We'll hold each other when we cry
Even if we fall
Somehow we'll be lovers after all, ooooh
Lovers, lovers after all
We're still lovers
Lovers, lovers after all
