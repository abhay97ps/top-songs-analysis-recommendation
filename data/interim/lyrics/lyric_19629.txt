Somewhere there's a stolen halo
I use to watch her wear it well
Everything would shine
Wherever she would go
But looking at her now you'd never tell
Someone ran away with her innocence
A memory she can't get out of her head
And I can only imagine
What she's feelin' when she's prayin'
Kneeling at the edge of her bed
And she says take me away
Then take me farther
Surround me now
And hold, hold, hold me
Like holy water
Holy water
She wants someone to call her angel
Someone to put the light back in her eyes
She's lookin' through the faces
And unfamiliar places
She needs someone to hear her when she cries
And she says take me away
Then take me farther
Surround me now
And hold, hold, hold me
Like holy water
Holy water
She just needs a little help
To wash away the pain she's felt
She wants to feel the healin' hands
Of someone who understands
And she says take me away
Then take me farther
Surround me now
And hold, hold, hold me
And she says take me away
Then take me farther
Surround me now
And hold, hold, hold me
Like holy water
Like holy water
Like holy water
Like holy water
