Crazy car
To lead me nowhere, lead me nowhere
Actually
It's made for that, made for that
I have never seen you cry
But right now, baby, why-oh-why?
Take my hand and be my woman
Just for a day
Crazy car
To lead me nowhere, lead me nowhere
Actually
It's made for that, made for that
Crazy car
Crazy car
Crazy car
Crazy car
Breaks my heart to see you sad
I have never felt this bad
Take my hand and be my woman
Just for a day
Crazy car
To lead me nowhere, lead me nowhere
Actually
It's made for that, made for that
Crazy car
Crazy car
Crazy car
Crazy car
Crazy car 
Crazy car
