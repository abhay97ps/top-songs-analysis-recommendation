Alone and far away from home
A boy stands in a foreign land
Lonely is he and in the dark
He wipes away a tear
As he thinks to himself
Does anybody know I'm here
He's got a girl
Far on a distant shore
And he wonders
If she loves him anymore
Cold, so cold is the wind
And in the dark
He wipes away a tear
As he thinks to himself
Does anybody know I'm here
And then a voice says
Don't worry bout it, baby
I'll be right here
Don't worry bout it, baby
I'll be right here
Don't worry bout it, baby
I'll be right here 
Don't worry bout it, baby
I'll be right here
Cold, oh, so cold is the wind
And in the dark
He wipes away a tear
Oh, as he thinks to himself
Does anybody know I'm here
Don't worry bout it, baby
I'll be right here 
Don't worry bout it, baby
I'll be right here
