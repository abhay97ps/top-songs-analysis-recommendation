She walks barefoot through the meadow early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin' ev'ry day
And she wakes up the sleepin' flowers early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin' on the way
And she lets her hair down when the sun comes up
Yes, she lets her hair down
And the morning glows bright with a newborn light
Yes, the morning glows bright
She goes walkin' past my window early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin' on the way
Some day I'll reach out and touch her early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin' one fine day
And I'll give her my love till the day I die
Yes, I'll give her my love
And the morning glows bright with a newborn light
Yes, the morning glows bright
She walks barefoot through the meadow early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin' ev'ry day
And the morning glows bright with a newborn light
Yes, the morning glows bright
And I'll give her my love till the day I die
Yes, I'll give her my love
And she lets her hair down when the sun comes up
Yes, she lets her hair down
And she lets her hair down when the sun comes up
Yes, she lets her hair down
