Oh well, oh well
I feel so good today
We just touched ground on an international runway
Jet-propelled back home from overseas to the U.S.A
New York, Los Angeles
Oh, how I yearn for you
Detroit, Chicago, Chattanooga, Baton Rouge
God, I long just to be at my home back in old St. Lou
Did I miss the skyscrapers?
Did I miss the long freeway?
From the coast of California
To the shores of the Delaware Bay
You can bet your life I did 'til I got back to the U.S.A
Looking hard for a drive-in
Searching for a corner café
Where hamburgers sizzle on an open grill night and day
Yeah, and the jukebox jumping with records back in the U.S.A
I'm so glad I'm living in the U.S.A
Yes, I'm so glad I'm living in the U.S.A
Anything you want
We got it right here in the U.S.A
Ah, we're so glad we're living in the U.S.A
Yes, we're so glad we're living in the U.S.A
Anything you want
We got it right here in the U.S.A
Ah, we're so glad
We're so glad
Ah, we're so glad
We're so glad
