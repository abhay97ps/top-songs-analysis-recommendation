Ah, now that I love a girl and Ruby is her name
This girl don't love me, but I love her just the same
Oh-ooh, Ruby-Ruby, how I want ya
Like a ghost I'm a-gonna haunt ya
Ruby-Ruby-Ruby will you be mine... sometime
Each time I see you waving my heart cries
I'll tell ya, I'm gonna steal you away from all those guys
Oh-ooh, from the happy day I met you
I made a bet that I was going to get you
Ruby-Ruby-Ruby will you be mine
I'll tell ya...
I love this girl, I said Ruby is her name
When this girl looks at me, she just sets my soul a-flame
Don't you know, I got all kind of kisses too, yeah
And I'm gonna give them all to you
Now listen up, Ruby-Ruby when will you be mine
Gonna get you sometime!
Ruby-Ruby, Ruby baby
Ruby-Ruby, Ruby baby
Ruby-Ruby, Ruby baby
Ruby-Ruby, Ruby baby
