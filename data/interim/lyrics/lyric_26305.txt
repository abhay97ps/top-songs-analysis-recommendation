Bitch, I'm back and it's up, PSA 
I'm too fleek to take off all my shit at TSA 
I know we met today, but I'ma need that shit today 
Might go extra, extra, just so I could see they face 
Keep X's and O's and interchange, yeah 
Hit three in a row, that's just a game
Big rings in a row, all down my fingers 
I can't even hold my baggage claim
Tryna snatch you home, my Lithuania 
Pass, do you mind?  One of a kind
Get you to sign , I took the fine 
Mulholland Drive , I hesitate and weave
And hit that line, I hit more, say the least 
Got stacks aside, keep that for bro and peeps
With all the rhymes 
Wrist eight and a nigga tell you, risqué, lil' hoes keep tryin'
By the end of the day, my M's gettin' wired
My own rounds for every time we tried
I'm sensei and senseless, same time 
Two drank, two cups poured up
I'm insanely down, slowed up
She built round, butt bubbled up
Don't inflame me now, go nuts
I keep flame right by my guts
It was out, but now, it's tucked
Know back home, they proud of us right now
Bitch, I'm back and it's up, PSA 
I'm too fleek to take off all my shit at TSA 
I know we met today, but I'ma need that shit today 
Might go extra, extra just so I could see they face 
Keep X's and O's and interchange, yeah 
Hit three in a row, that's just a game
Big rings in a row, all down my fingers 
I can't even hold my baggage claim
Tryna snatch you home , my Lithuania 
Lil' bitch, don't talk to me like I'm not me 
Graveyard, up late, shit, I'm with the zombies 
Goin' insane, hard to contain 
Can't miss a beat, my heart is the same
You know it's flame if I'm in this ho with Scotty 
Long list of problems, long list of blessings 
Makin' sure the first one never outweigh the second, yeah
Military with the tactics, multi-millions, multi-facet
She like Prince and Michael Jackson 
Purple Rain and mirrors dancin' 
Savage Fenty matchin' with the lingerie socks 
Didn't know they made them 'til I took 'em off and I popped
Her mama sixty, but look twenty-nine and that's a great sign 
Could take over any tri-state without even tryin' 
And I'm prayin' for my exes and my enemies 
'Cause they gon' need all the help they can get if it isn't me 
Success is a chain reaction, I'm the fuckin' missin' link 
In the world where niggas would do anything for everything, damn 
Keep X's and O's and interchange, yeah 
Hit three in a row, that's just a game 
Big rings in a row, all down my fingers 
I can't even hold my baggage claim 
Tryna snatch you home , my Lithuania 
Yeah, I had to reset it, my credit on venery and go 'head and vet it 
I'm pullin' her hair, talkin' shit in her ear, yeah, I got a lil' fetish
