Ivy's birthday's in a week
I want to get her something mad
How about a pair of faker boobs?
An STD she hasn't had?
You should throw her a surprise
We'll help you make it uppercrust
Yeah, something classy, something small. You'll help?
Matthew! Where's the trust?
Trust for what?
That you've done smut
Oh, we were talking about the rave
I made the snacks
I've got the guide
I guess we're set
We need a ride
The church's van
You have the keys
So I should steal it?
Borrow
Please?
Why not?
Well, where do I begin?
It's all we got
One little sin
Come to wonderland where never never finds you
For one enchanted night of dreams disguised in swirling light
Ten thousand friends to make an ecstasy of motion
You're floating, rolling, free, and life is as it ought to be
How far away is this rave?
Just make sure the tank is full
Just come
This map is kinda vague
When we're close we'll feel the pull
I have some clothes that you can wear
And what is that supposed to mean?
You look like a million bucks
Wear something cheaper to the scene
There's no way to cross this road
I think the map is upside down
Our parents had it easier
The disco didn't move around
Yeah, but who can groove to that?
And what's with spelling with your hands?
Did you ever see them rolling?
God, they'd never understand
Off to wonderland where never never finds you
For one enchanted night of dreams disguised in swirling light
Ten thousand friends to make an ecstasy of motion
You're floating, rolling, free, and life is as it ought to be
Now there's more than one way to feel alive
That's why the party never ends
Though X is still the treat of choice
I brought along some friends
Boys and girls, our show today
Is brought to you by the letters 'G' and 'K'
What?
G and K, they are both intense
And enhance your X experience
Professor
Exhibit A:
'K'! Sit back, listen and learn
A couple of sniffs with a two-second burn
The return is worth every bit
Trust me kids, this is powerful, powder-ful shit, sit
Watch what I come with! Watch-wa-wa-watch what I come with
On it! The way that I'm on
You suckers and fuckers gonna love how you gone! You're golden
Secret scenes unfoldin', you're feelin' emboldend
You tuckin' and rollin'
You're part of the action, but standing apart
You're fast as a fraction; the fact is attraction
Is on 'til dawn, but don't overtake it
High are the stakes when you find that you wake in a 'K' hole
Like a roll gone bad
Worse than the worst shit that you've ever had
You're taken Jake, shaken and stirred
Your life is a prison and your vision is blurred
You're beggin' and buggin' 'cause your soul is so lonely
Your only defense is the fact that you know me
I got your back, but I won't babysit
I don't need that shit
Exhibit B:
'G'! Comes clear, but I color it blue
So you won't use the 'thought it was water' excuse
Liquid X is in effect, but that's her formal name
Take her out once and you're never the same
All my ladies!
Huh?
All my ladies?
Yeah
To my fellas!
Yeah?
To my fellas!
...Yeah
Pay attention my friends, 'cause class is in session
A lesson won't lessen, so take the point that I'm stressin'
This is stronger than 'K', overdose ain't a joke
Too much is a coma, breathin' slow 'til you choke
So show me you care, and party hardy aware
I ain't draggin' your ass home if you fail to beware
It's fun for all y'all, and it's all for fun
But in the back of your mind, remember rule number one:
I know you know X, but this shit has limits
Play the game playa, but play to stay in it...UGH
Don't do that when I take you home...
So, are you in or not?
What time?
We would have to leave by nine...
Come on, it'll be fun
Well I don't know, maybe...
Maybe?
Alright I'll go
