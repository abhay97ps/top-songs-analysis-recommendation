For five long years, yeah
I thought I was your man
But I found out now
I'm just a link in your chain
Girl, you got me where you want me
Yeah, I ain't nothing but your fool, yeah
You treated me mean, ow!
Oh, you treated me cruel
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain

Chain of fools
Every chain
Well, it's got a weak link, yeah
I might be weak, child
But I'll give you strength
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain
Chain of fools
You told me to leave you alone
My father said, come on home
My doctor said, take it easy
But your loving
Well, it's much too strong
I'm added to your
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain
Chain of fools
Whoa!
Take 'em home!
Well, one of these mornings
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The chain is gonna break, oh, yeah
But up until then, child
I'm gonna take all that I can take
I'm added to your
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain
Chain of fools, whoa...

You're never gonna break
This chain of fools, ow!
