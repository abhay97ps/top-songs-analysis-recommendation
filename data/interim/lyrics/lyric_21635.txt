For you, I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin, it's time to sink or swim
Watch 'em play for you
For you I'd be , running a thousand miles
Just to get to where you are, step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot but for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby, listen
I just need somebody to love
I, I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love, I don't need nothing else
I promise, girl, I swear, I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
Every day I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds, smile for me, smile for me
I would take every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime, step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot, but for you, I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or you can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
So baby, listen
I just need somebody to love 
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love, I don't need nothing else
I promise, girl, I swear, I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
I need somebody, I, I need somebody, somebody to love
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
I just need somebody to love
And you can have it all, anything you want
I can bring, give you the finer things, yeah
But what I really want, I can't find 'cause money can't find me Somebody to love
Oh, find me somebody to love, oh
