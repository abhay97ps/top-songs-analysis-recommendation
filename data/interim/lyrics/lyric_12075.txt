Girl, I got to go

Yeah, I'm kinda in a hurry
Uh-huh, here's the reason why
Jump, jump, jump to it
Jump, jump, jump to it
Jump, jump, jump to it
Jump, jump, jump to it
My baby loves me
He told me that
And I never question
That point or fact
There is no fighting
Scandal or shame
Uh, he really moves me
Drives me insane
I can't talk to you now, girl, I got love to get
When my baby calls, I gotta jump to it
I'm in a hurry, there's love to get
When my baby calls, I jump, jump, jump to it
Jump, jump, jump to it
Jump, jump, jump to it
I just can't wait 'til
Today at four
That's when my sweet thing
Said he would call
Hey, don't keep me waiting
It's 3:59
Ring-ding, hello, baby
Oh, come please be mine
Girl, I can't talk to you now, I got love to get
When my baby calls, I gotta jump to it
I'm in a hurry, there's love to get
When my baby calls, I jump, jump, jump to it
Jump, jump, jump to it
Now Kelly 
You know when we talk, we have a lot of fun, don't we, girl?
Dishing out the dirt on everybody
And giving each other the 4-1-1 on who drop kicked who this week
You know what I'm talking about
When my baby call, sha-dee-dee-dee-dee 
Ooh, oh-ho
When my baby calls, sha, wee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee
