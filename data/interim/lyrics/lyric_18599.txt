I've loaded up a good thing
To see the way she feels
Faster than a Sosa home run
She's gonna get a little huh huh
Look at her now
She wants to take the wheel
She says, 'you dirty dog'
You want to rock the bop and take it home'
Why oh why am i gonna play
So many times it goes this way
My heart gets blown away
These eyes are blown away
Do you remember how were were
Do you remember summer days
Sometimes i feel like going down down
Walk like a loaded man 
Get the bump to the bump de bump de bump soul 
Move like a thing, swing line a thong
And do your jiggy mama til the break of dawn
Load the rocket, shock it and rock it til you drop
Do the bump to the bump and don't stop
Loaded up from dusk til dawn
I wonder how she feels
Dancing around with my love
While i'm sitting waiting for the huh huh
Fired up that smoke screen
Red lipstick and high heels
Look at her now
She wants to rock the bop and take it home
Why oh why am i gonna play
So many times it goes this way
My heart gets blown away
These eyes are born again
Walk like a loaded man 
Get the bump to the bump de bump de bump soul
Move like a thing, swing line a thong
And do your jiggy mama til the break of dawn
Load the rocket, shock it and rock it til you drop
Do the bump to the bump and don't stop
