I tried to let it go
I'm not, not over you
Over you, over you
I ain't over you
I can't believe it's over
It's hard to let you go
'Cause I can't sleep at night
And there's one thing that I know
I'm not, not over you, oooh
I don't know why it's over
I don't know where to turn
I tried to let it go
But there's one thing that I know
I'm not, not over you, oooh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tell me what can I do when I know we are through
Can't get you off my mind
Think about you all the time.  
I can't get over you no matter what I do
I'm not, not over you, oooh
I know inside I gave it
I gave it all I had
I did all I could do and still it hurts me so bad
I'm not, not over you, oooh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tell me what can I do when I know we are through
Can't get you off my mind
Think about you all the time.  
I can't get over you no matter what I do
Oh
Oh
I'm not, not over you, oooh .  
Over you, over you
I'm not, not over you, oooh, baby

Tell me what can I do  when I know we are through
Can't get you off my mind

I'm not, not over you, oooh
I can't get you off of my mind
Oh, baby, I ain't over you
'Cause the only thing I know, I know I'm not over you, baby
