Lately I’ve been feelin kinda caught up in my ways
Memories bring me back to a time with
Far better days
Being lonely
Feeling useless
Have a tendency to dissuade
Men that could’ve
Easily been
Entrepreneurs
Self made
Left feelin played
Afraid of what would happen
If they try to climb the ladder
Chance they fall
Then the splatter
Life ain’t all silver platters
You gotta do some soul searchin
Ask yourself what really matters
What’s the dream
Deeply lodged
In them brains scattered
Cuff some hoe
You don’t know
Just like
Any other rapper
Fuck around
You got her heart
Run like gump after
Life a box of chocolates
But is Filled with oxycontins
Body pure
A rose blossom
Choose to fill it up with toxins
Become clear who's funeral
Your name on the coffin
At first you liked the deal
Now the deals gone rotten
Take a look in the mirror
The Reflection is shockin
Lately I’ve been feelin kinda caught up in my ways
Memories bring me back to a time with
Far better days
My mother barely had time
But still made time to play
Only question I got for god
Why you take her away
What the fuck with the hearse
I was taught from my birth
You were supposed to have a great plan
What the fuck am I worth
I’m not feelin great man
I’m sorry
Feelin berserk
Got no super
Strength man
I’m no motherfuckin herc
The weight just too much
Got the world on my shoulder
Not sure if I can hold ‘er
Heavier than boulder
Bolder than before cuz
I’m tellin you this now
Used to be a time I was afraid
To even speak out
But my brand Jordan now
Confident cash cow
Coppin copulation constantly
You can’t claim my crown
Carcinogenic character critic
Always tryna bring you down
Fakes they jokes
Wear makeup
When exposed
Look like clowns
This the part put you down
Father dyin on the ground
Sweatin
At the age of seven
Watch the ambulance revin
Momma said it’s off to heaven
You the man of the house
Stand straight
Don’t slouch
Keep your head up
Be better
Than your father
Lazy
Sat on the couch
Drinking
Watching tv
Talking too much
Out his mouth
A lotta doubt
That's in my genes
Gotta get it out
GPS reroute
I'm on the road to success now
Lately I’ve been feelin kinda caught up in my ways
Memories bring me back to a time with
Far better days
But as the days go by
Those times get further away
I get scared
I contemplate
Will I have the same fate
No wait I ain’t second rate
Sharpest needles can’t deflate
Don't push me I’m irate
Too late
Needa medic
In time imma get it
On my grind don't sweat it
In time you’ll have
A listen to me rap fetish
Lately I’ve been feelin kinda caught up in my ways
Memories bring me back to a time with
Far better days
The ones I barely remember now
Whole Life was a haze
I thought it’d get better
Now it feels like a maze
All my birthdays when I waited
Felt hated
Frustrated
Cuz the friends i’d invite
Don't know what happend
They never made it
Who guessed the life a child
Could be so complicated
Especially a little white boy
Who was never hated
You hate me then state it
Sick n tired of being patient
All you snakes in the grass
Took too long to claim it
I been spittin knowledge
Bet you can't retain it
Always solo
When I roll
Still somehow I maintain it
What will it take to convince you
Bitch I am amazin
Listen to lyrics
Like I’m bashin your brain in
You too late
You a motherfuckin has-been
Do the garbage man's job
Dump you straight in the trash bin
