Give me light, give me action
At the touch of a button
Flying through hyper-space
In a computer interface
Stop! Living on video
Stop! Integrated circuits
Stop! Sur un faisceau de lumière
Stop! Is this reality?
Travelling in a light beam
Laser rays and purple skies
In a computer fairyland
It is a dream you bring to life
Stop! Living on video
Stop! Integrated circuits
Stop! Sur un faisceau de lumière
Stop! Is this reality?
I see your glittering blue eyes
You look at me with a smile
It's a computer fantasy
It is waiting for you and me
Living, living on video
Living, living on video
Living, living on video
Stop!
Living on video
