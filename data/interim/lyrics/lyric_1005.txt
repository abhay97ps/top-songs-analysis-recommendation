He's my dreamboat, asleep in English class
He's my dreamboat, mowin' his folk's grass
He's my dreamboat with the dreamy, dreamy eyes
He's my dreamboat, workin' on his car
He's my dreamboat, strummin' his guitar
He's my dreamboat with the dreamy, dreamy eyes
Well now, I dream of dreamboat in everything I do
And I know that darlin' dreamboat dreams of me too
He's my dreamboat, coffee in a Dixie cup
Darlin' dreamboat, that crazy, silly nut
He's my dreamboat with the dreamy, dreamy eyes
Yes, he's my dreamboat, coffee in a Dixie cup
Whoa, darlin' dreamboat, that crazy, silly nut
He's my dreamboat with the dreamy, dreamy eyes
