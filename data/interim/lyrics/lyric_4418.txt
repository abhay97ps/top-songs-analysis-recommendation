My babe, I got my babe
And I won't lie babe
Without your love
I'm just one of a million other guys
Well it's a hard time world
With part time girls to spend your time with
And life ain't always fair but I don't care
As long as I'm with
My babe
I got my babe
And I won't lie babe
Without your love
I'm just one of a million other guys
You take one look around
You'll hear the sounds of young hearts breakin'
The game's galled runnin' free
It ain't for me
'Cause my hearts taken with
My babe
I got my babe
And I won't lie babe
Without your love
I'm just one of a million other guys
My babe, I got my babe
And I won't lie babe
Without your love
I'm just one of a million other guys
