Quit playing the games that you play
Quit saying the shit that you say
Cause ain't no body got time for that shit now
Cause all I want is love
And I want to give you my love
Put my pride aside and show you my love
Oh please, stop fighting me love
I’m not your enemy love
I’m the one that will fight for you love
And truly baby, I’m the one that will die for your love
I will kneel down on the ground, and
Give up my freedom for your love
Take a bullet in my heart
I will stop breathing for your love
Hook:
For your love, for you love, for your lo-lo-lo-love
I will do everything for your love, love
For your love, for you love, for your lo-lo-lo-love
I will do everything for your love, love
Shoot a bitch in the head for your love, love
Dig a grave nine-feet for your love, love
Burry niggah that deep for your love, love
They speak love, not knowing what they speak of
They seek love, only to reach for cheap love
But see love, you and I are different
On a different mission
Fuck a soul-mate darling, we got a deeper connection
You are my twin flame, but ya got us busy playing weird games
Ya hang up the phone only to call me back
Tell me goodbye only to come right back
I push to the wall, and ya pick me when I fall
Tell me, I’m sorry, then ya take all the faults
We are made to be one, darling
I’ll do everything for your love
I will kneel down on the ground, and
Give up my freedom for your love
Take a bullet in my heart
I will stop breathing for your love
Hook:
For your love, for you love, for your lo-lo-lo-love
I will do everything for your love, love
For your love, for you love, for your lo-lo-lo-love
I will do everything for your love, love
Shoot a bitch in the head for your love, love
Dig a grave nine-feet for your love, love
Burry niggah that deep for your love, love
