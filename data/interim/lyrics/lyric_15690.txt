Yeah hey
It?s been a long day
I?m gonna take it kind of easy and relax awhile
I wanna hear some mellow music nice and slow
You fill me up with love, you make me overflow
When I was down you would always lift me up
Thank God that you were there
I know that miracles and dreams come true
My every wish came true when I found you and your
Everlasting love
Everlasting love
Love
Temporary love don?t mean a thing, no, no
It can?t be real, no
Will never fade away
They last forever
You bring me joy
And when I was down you would always lift me up
Thank God that you were there
I know that miracles and dreams come true
My every wish came true when I found you and your
Everlasting love
Everlasting love
Love
Things I used to do, I don?t do no more
Places I used to go, I don?t go no more
Ever since you came along, you gave my heart a brand new song
And, ooh, a sweet love song and I wanna thank you for
Everlasting love
Everlasting love
Love
Oh, seek and ye? shall find
Everlasting peace of mine
The kind of love that won?t ever die
If you knock on the door, it shall be yours
Everlasting love
Everlasting love
Everlasting love
Everlasting love
