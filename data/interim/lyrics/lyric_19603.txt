I'll give a little bit
Give a little bit of your love to me
I'll give a little bit
I'll give a little bit of my love to you
See the man with the lonely eyes
Oh, take his hand, you'll be surprised
So give a little bit
I'll give a little bit of my life for you
So give a little bit
Give a little bit of your time to me
Now's the time that we need to share
So send a smile, we're on our way back home
Ooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah
You gotta feel it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't you need to feel at home?
Uh, you gotta feel it
Yeah, you gotta want to
Ooh, you gotta sing
We've come along way tonight
So give a little bit
Give a little bit of your love to me
So give a little bit
I'll give a little bit of my life for you
Now's the time that we need to share
So send a smile, we're on our way back home
Yeah, come along too
Yeah, we gotta feel it
'Cause I need to feel at home
Ooh, come along too
Such a long ride
Come a long way
Ooh, sing it tonight
