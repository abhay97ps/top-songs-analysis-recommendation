Whenever I'm down
I call on you, my friend
A helpin' hand you lend
In my time of need, so I
I'm calling you now
Just to make it through
What else can I do?
Don't you hear my plea?
Friends may come and friends may go
But you should know that
That I've got your back, it's automatic
So never hesitate to call
'Cause I'm your sister, and always for ya
And I
Don't know what I'd ever do without you
From the beginning till the end 
You've always been here right beside me 
So I'll call you my best friend 
Through the good times and the bad ones
Whether I lose or if I win
I know one thing that never changes
And that's you as my best friend 
Whenever I'm done
And all that's goin' on, it's really goin' wrong
Just one of those days, and ya
You say the right things, to keep me movin' on
To keep me goin' strong
What else can I say?
Friends are there through thick and thin
Well, I've been told that
And I believe that it's automatic
Call me when you need a friend
'Cause I'm your sister, and always for ya
And I don't know
Don't know what I'd ever do without you 
From the beginning to the end
You've always been here right beside me 
So I'll call you my best friend 
Through the good times and the bad ones
Whether I lose or if I win 
I know one thing that never changes
And that's you as my best friend 
Don't know what I'd ever do without you
From the beginning to the end 
You've always been here right beside me
So I'll call you my best friend
Through the good times and the bad ones 
Whether I lose or if I win
I know one thing that never changes 
And that's you as my best friend 
Don't know what I'd ever do
So I call on my best friend
Don't know what I'd ever do
So I call on my best friend
I'll be there for you 
When you're going through 
Times that you may think that you need a friend 
You can count on me 
Call me when you need 
Thank you, carry on
