Something in the way you love me won't let me be
I don't want to be your prisoner, so baby, won't you set me free?
Stop playin' with my heart
Finish what you start
When you make my love come down
If you want me, let me know
Baby, let it show
Honey, don't you fool around
Don't try to resist me
Open your heart to me, baby
I'll hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key
Something in your eyes is makin' such a fool of me
I see you on the street and you walk on by
When you hold me in your arms, you love me 'til I just can't see
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say
Open your heart to me, baby
I'll hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key
Open your heart, I'll make you love me
I'll hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Open your heart with the key!
