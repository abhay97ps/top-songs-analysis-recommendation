Gone, gone, gone, she been gone so long
She been gone, gone, gone so long
Gone, gone, gone, she been gone so long
She been gone, gone, gone so long
Gone, gone, gone, she been gone so long
She been gone, gone, gone so long
Gone, gone, gone, she been gone so long
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone so long
Ever since she left me
I sure feel all alone
A little misunderstanding
I can't get her on the telephone
Hanging out down on Main Street
Living in a different world
Standing around with the gang on the corner
Talking about my girl
My girl, she was the world to me
She's gone all the way across the sea
My girl is just a memory
She been so long away
Gone, gone, gone, she been gone so long
She been gone, gone, gone so long
Gone, gone, gone, she been gone so long
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone so long
Gone, gone, gone, she been gone so long
She been gone, gone, gone so long
She didn't have to leave me
She didn't have to run
She didn't have to go
Without a word to anyone
I hope she's doing all right
Got no way to know
Unless she gets to hear this song
Hear it on the radio
My girl, she was the world to me
She's gone and that's a tragedy
My girl is just a memory
She been so long away
Gone, gone, gone, she been gone so long
She been gone, gone, gone so long
Gone, gone, gone, she been gone so long
She been gone, gone, gone so long
Gone, gone, gone, she been gone so long
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, she been gone so long
Gone, gone, gone, she been gone so long
Well, I wonder if I ever gonna see my girl
Gone, gone, gone, she been gone so long
Well, I wonder if I ever gonna see my girl
I hope she gets the message
Gotta get her back, you know
Gonna track her down, I'll find that girl
Gonna tell her that I love her so
Put the word on the grapevine
Spread it all around the world
Sooner or later, I know I'm gonna get her
Talkin' about my girl
My girl
My girl
My girl
My girl
My girl
My girl 
My girl 
My girl 
My girl 
My girl 
My girl 
My girl 
My girl 
My girl
