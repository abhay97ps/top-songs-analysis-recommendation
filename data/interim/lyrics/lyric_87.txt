What in the world's come over you?
Seems we never get along
Every night
I reminisce dreaming of your tender kisses
What in the world's come over you?
Could you ever change your mind?
If you do, I'll still be here, dear
Waiting, longing for you
All my life, I've loved you so
Never dreamed, I'd miss you so
Now, alone in my room each night
My heart it cries, "It's just not right"
Oh, oh, oh
What in the world's come over you?
Could you ever change your mind?
If you do, I'll still be here, dear
Waiting, longing for you
All my life, I've loved you so
Never dreamed, I'd miss you so
Now, alone in my room each night
My heart, it cries, "It's just not right"
Oh, oh, oh
What in the world's come over you?
You're still my angel from above
Guess, you'll always be my one
And only, only real love
