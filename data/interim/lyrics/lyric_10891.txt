Out on the town, digging around feeling bluesy
It's getting late, I can't afford to be choosy
Should be home and dry by now
I've tried every trick in the book
But another night, Saturday night and I'm losing
Another night, Saturday night and I'm losing
The DJ plays a song from the past I remember
I hold her close, in my arms she surrenders
Its the same old record playing
But just another girl that's swaying
Another night, Saturday night and I'm losing
Another night, Saturday night and I'm losing
As we move around the room whispering things with my eyes closed
And when music stops I open my eyes my fantasy ends, we're not even friends
Catch my ride, pay my fare on my way home
The same thing every week on my own
Next time around she might be there
I love might change but until then
Another night, Saturday night and I'm losing
Another night, Saturday night and I'm losing
