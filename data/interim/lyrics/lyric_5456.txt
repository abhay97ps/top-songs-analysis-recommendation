Yesterday's rain
Brings tomorrow's pain
Falling round my head
Those feelings I dread
Love has lost
You'll pay the cost
With a broken dream
And still it seems
I can't get out
From under my cloud
And see the light of day
Yesterday's rain falls again
And again
And makes me feel
The world's not real
Ah
Yesterday came
Just to bring
Me misery
Till I can't see
Over my head
The darkness spreads
To morning light
That fades in the night
And all around the tears are falling
Like the birth of rain
Yesterday's rain falls again
And again
And makes me feel
The world's not real
Ah
Spinning to the ground
Hearing not a sound
Thoughts inside my head
Are going round and round
I got my mind on love
That I can never own
Friends all around me
And I'm still all alone
Running through the trees
My hands above my head
Trying to escape the rain
Yesterday's rain
Falls again and again
And makes me feel the world's not real
Over my head the darkness spreads
Oh! Yesterday's rain
Brings tomorrow's pain
Falling round my head
Those feelings I dread
Love has lost
You'll pay the cost
Yesterday's Rain
Let me tell you
Tell you, you
Yesterday's rain
You know it falls again and again and again
