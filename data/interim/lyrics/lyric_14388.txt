When will I, will I be famous?
Yes, you're suitably at one with your body and the sun
Yes, you are
You've read Karl Marx and you've taught yourself to dance
You're the best by far
But you keep asking the question
One you're not supposed to mention
Hey, yeah, oooh!
When will I, will I be famous?
I can't answer, I can't answer that
When will I see my picture in the paper?
I can't answer, I can't answer that
When will I, will I be famous?
You keep asking me, babe
You're a slave to fashion and your life is full of passion
It's the way you are
You've suffered for your art with the jogging in the park
You know you should go far
But you keep asking the question 
One you're not supposed to mention
 Yeah, oooh!
When will I, will I be famous?
I can't answer, I can't answer that
When will I see my picture in the paper?
I can't answer , I can't answer that
But I can't tell you when
You'll see your name up in lights
When will I, will I be famous?
You keep asking me, babe 
You won't suffer in silence 
You're a talent, you know that I've noticed 
You'd like to be a legend 
A big star overnight
 I can't answer your question
 It's driving me insane 
And your impossible impatience 
Tearing at my brain 
Oho, I can't take it, take it much more
Got too much to hope for
When, when, when, when, whe-whe-whe-whe-when will I
Will I, will I
When, when, when, when, whe-whe-whe-whe-when will I
Will I, will, will, will I
When will I, will I be famous?
I can't answer, I can't answer that
When will I, will I be famous?
I can't answer, I can't answer that
When will I, will I be famous?
I can't answer, I can't answer that 
When will I see my picture in the paper?
I can't answer, I can't answer that 
When will I 
I can't answer , I can't answer that
When will I 
I can't answer, I can't answer that
When will I 
I can't answer, I can't answer that
When will I 
I can't answer, I can't answer that
When will I see my picture in the paper?
I can't answer, I can't answer that
When will I 
I can't answer, I can't answer that
When will I, will I be famous?
