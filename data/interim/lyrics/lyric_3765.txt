Well, come on, come on, let's go, little darlin'
Tell me that you'll never leave me
Come on, come on, let's go again
And again and again 
Well, now, swing me, swing me, all the way down there
Come on, let's go, little darlin'
Come on, come on, let's go again
And again and again
I love you so
And I'll never let you go
Come on, baby, so
Hey, pretty baby 
Well, come on, come on, let's go, little sweetheart
Then we can always be together
Come on, come on, let's go again
And again and again 
Well, ahhh
Well, come on, come on, let's go, little darlin'
We're dancin', and we belong here
Come on, come on, let's go again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
Come on, let's go, little darlin'
Come on and show me that you love me
Come on, let's go, little darlin'
Come on and show me that you love me
Come on, let's go, little darlin'
Come on and show me that you love me
Come on, let's go, little darlin'
