You know, Martha, I'm just so disgusted
Because Mother Nature didn't intend for the things that are happening
To happen to us like it's happening
I don't believe that God intended for us to destroy so many beautiful things
And take away the beauty that he bestowed upon us
You're right, James
But it's a shame the way poverty is on a run, pollution
All the destructions that's happening
And the war of the world
That's right
When the world began, it wasn't supposed to be this way
I'm so sure it wasn't
And I feel that we can find a way together
You're my beautiful sister and I love you, and this is my sister
And Martha
I've been with you for a long time, you've seen me grow up
I'm a woman
God bless you
And I just wanna say, summertime
And the living is easy, yeah
Ah, the fish are jumpin', yeah
Not like they used to, yeah yeah
I don't see the cotton grow very high
Oh, oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah
My old daddy ain't rich
Thank God, my my my my mammy is still good lookin', yeah yeah yeah
Hidden from her roots
So I wanna tell you out there
Hush you and you and you, and especially that little baby, yeah yeah yeah
Don't you cry
I don't care whether you're white, black, blue or green, yellow, red, purple or orange
Don't you cry, God is gonna make it better, yeah yeah yeah yeah
So much better, yeah yeah yeah, in the summertime
One of these mornings, you're gonna wind up singin'
You're gonna spread your wings and take to the skies
Back to the morning, there ain't nothing can harm you, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
'Cause your mama and your daddy is standing, standing by
Help me sing, God bless you, God bless you
That's for you, James
That's for the people, I love you, sister
I love you, too
That's what we all need to do, express the love for your sister and your brother
That's all what it is
'Cause one of these mornings, yeah, you're gonna rise up singin', yeah yeah yeah
You're gonna spread your little wings, and take to the sky
I don't care whether you're white, black, blue or green, yeah yeah yeah yeah
