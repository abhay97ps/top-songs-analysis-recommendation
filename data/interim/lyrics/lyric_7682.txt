Oh I'll never let you under my skin
Baby, I just could not stand, um, hum
To be hurt again
Um, hum, ooh wee, baby, ooh, hoo
Listen lady:
Hey, I'll wine and dine you
Take you anywhere you wanna go
Oh, but when the night is over
Hey, you just may not see me no more
All I want is...
A one-night affair 
That won't hurt nobody
A one night affair 
Hey, I'll hit and run
I'll be a son of a gun
But I'll hit and run, but it could be promising
I don't wanna love nobody
Don't wanna take me a wife
Girl, you just may not be ready
To go steady for the rest of your life
So, for that reason...
A one-night affair 
It'll be alright
A one night affair 
Let's start tonight
Hit and run
Uh, huh, son of a gun
I'm gonna hit and run
Yes, I will, yes, I will
'Cause you see I've been a lonely man
And I want you to understand
That I'll never let you under my skin
'Cause I don't want to be hurt again
Oh no, baby
Um, hum
I couldn't stand it, baby
No, no, no, no, now
A one night affair 
Sounds in a hurry
A one night affair 
But you don't have to worry
I'll hit and run, I'll be a son of a gun
And I know you have been lonely too
That's why you will understand
Why a broken heart is so hard on a man
But one of these days
I'll be alright
If you would just let me
Love you tonight
And though it may sound
A little temporary
Sometimes, baby
It's so necessary
A one night affair 
I declare
One night affair 
Hey, it's hit and run
I'll be a son of a gun
Said I'll hit and run
Yes I will, yes I will, baby
One night affair 
Won't hurt nobody
A one night affair 
Baby
Won't you be mine
For just a little while
Hey, won't you be mine
Won't you hold me
One night affair
Oh, baby
