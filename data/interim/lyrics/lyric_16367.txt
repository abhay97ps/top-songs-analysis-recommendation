God sometimes you just don’t come through
God sometimes you just don’t come through
Do you need a woman to look after you?
God sometimes you just don’t come through
You make pretty daisies, pretty daisies love
I’ve gotta find, find, find what you’re doing about things here
A few witches burning, gets a little toasty here
I gotta find, find, find why you always go when the wind blows
God sometimes you just don’t come through
God sometimes you just don’t come through, babe
Do you need a woman to look after you?
God sometimes you just don’t come through
Well, tell me you’re crazy maybe then I’ll understand
You got your 9, 9 iron in the back seat just in case
Heard you’ve gone south, well, babe you love your new 4-wheel
I gotta find, find, find why you always go when the wind blows
“Give not thy strength unto women nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings”
Will you even tell her if you decide to make the sky fall?
Will you even tell her if you decide to make the sky..?
God sometimes you just don’t come through
God sometimes you just don’t come through, babe
Do you need a woman to look after you?
God sometimes you just don’t come through
Do you need a woman to look after you?
God sometimes you just don’t come through
