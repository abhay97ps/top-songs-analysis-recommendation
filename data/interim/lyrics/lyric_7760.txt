You came here from the country
You left your Pa and your Ma
And do you remember what you told them?
You wouldn't come to no harm, yeah
But they kept on kidding you
You had to show them didn't you?
Big city Miss Ruth Ann
Didn't you say that anybody can
Be exactly what you want a man
Big city Miss Ruth Ann
Did you go back home girl?
What did the people say?
Seeing you in all those fine clothes
Since you went away, yeah
City lights been fitting you
You had to show them didn't you?
Big city Miss Ruth Ann
Didn't you say that anybody can
Be exactly what you want a man?
Big city Miss Ruth Ann
But I bet you're getting lonely
Only you can cry
'Cause you're a big city girl now
So kiss the country good-bye, yeah
City lights been fitting you
You really showed them, hey didn't you?
Big city Miss Ruth Ann
Didn't you say that anybody can
Be exactly what you want a man?
