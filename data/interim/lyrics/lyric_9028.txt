Hollywood hot, Hollywood hot
And they like it a lot
Foxy fever got you hot to trot
Glam and glitter get you hot
Action, Hollywood and Vine
Making out anytime
Pick up, pick up chicken
Get your boat of chicken
What you want 
Wanna go 
So tough, sweet stuff 
Said love
For sale, what you wanna love
Would be, would be starlet
Making out in car lots
Get it on, gimme green
What you like 
You buy, you get, let's swing
Big shot cruising in a Jag
Chasing in drag
Bail bond, buy bails
Call Mr. Pickle of Beverly Hills
Red light, stop sign
Ain't nobody gonna pay your fine
Hollywood hot, Hollywood hot
Hollywood hot, Hollywood hot
Hollywood hot, Hollywood hot...
Hot, Hollywood. hot, Hollywood
Hot, Hollywood. hot, Hollywood
