It's an evil wind
That blows no good air
It's a sad heart
That won't love like I know it should
Oh how lonesome 
You must be
It's a shame 
You don't share your love with me
It's a heartache yeah
When love is gone
But it's bad
 and even sad 
All day long
And it's no wonder
When you won't see me
It's a shame
If you won't share
Some of your love with me
I can't help it oh no
If he's gone
I must try to forget
Because I got to live on
Ooooh
Have me some good thing
It's a sweet thing
But you love someone eles
But It's bad 
And even sadder 
When it's not the time
And Ooooooooooh
How lonesome... how lonesome
How lonesome baby
You must be
I tell ya it would be a sad 
Shame 
If you don't share
Your love with me
It would really be a mistake baby
If you don't share
Your love with me
It would sure be a shame
If you don't share
Share your love with me
FADES -
Share your love with me
Come on bab - ay
