There's a fire beneath my skin
There's a fever that makes me ill
Got a love, a love that kills
I've got twenty four hours to live
Comeback, I'm begging you please
Comeback, I'm down on my knees
Comeback, I'm begging you please
I don't know why and I don't understand
How you sold me down the river
I don't know why
I don't understand
How you sold me down the river
SOLD ME DOWN THE RIVER
There's a rose across my chest
Got your name written on it
Love's the drug that I live by
Give me a shot before I die
Comeback, I'm begging you please
Comeback, I'm down on my knees
Comeback, I'm begging you please
I don't know why
I don't understand
How you sold me down the river
I don't know why
I don't understand
How you sold me down the river
SOLD ME DOWN THE RIVER
Sold me down the river tonight
Whoo whoo
I've got twenty four hours
I don't know why
I don't understand
How you sold me down the river
I don't know why
I don't understand
How you sold me down the river
SOLD ME DOWN THE RIVER
All right
Sold me
Sold me
Sold me down the river
Sold me
Sold me
Sold me down the river
I don't know why
I don't understand
How you sold me down the river
I don't know why
I don't understand
How you sold me down the river
SOLD ME DOWN THE RIVER
SOLD ME DOWN THE RIVER
SOLD ME DOWN THE RIVER
