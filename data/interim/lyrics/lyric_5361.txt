Don't need to music to feel the soul
Don't need no dance steps to make a noise
Don't need the word to sing it sweet
Don't need to know a beat
To get on the floor and shake your feet
Soul dripping's gotta pick you up
Soul dripping's till it fills your cup
Soul dripping shake your love and mine
Soul dripping's got you on the line
You'll kick the dancers that you used to know
Cause everything now has got to go
When a part gets to you it turns you all around
You can taste the drippings of the soul some day
Soul dripping's gotta pick you up
Soul dripping's till it fills your cup
Soul dripping shake your love and mine
Soul dripping's got you on the line
Just grab a girl to shake your feet
Now don't matter just a throbbing beat
Oh baby you just want to sing it out
Words don't matter just sing some day
Soul dripping's gotta pick you up
Soul dripping's till it fills your cup
Soul dripping shake your love and mine
Soul dripping's got you on the line
Soul dripping
Soul dripping
Soul dripping
Soul dripping
