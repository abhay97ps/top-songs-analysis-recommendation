Way too many girls in the summer
Once more something’s wrong
Probably ‘cause I’m drunk
One sec I’ll be back
I feel like I’m being trapped
Way too many girls in the summer summer
And once more it’s on
Slow motion on the dance floor
I’m probably drunk but I love her love her yeah
She’s sweet as Georgia peaches
Petite with gorgeous features
I’ll sweep you off your feet just need to know how to reach ya
Oh yeah I could be your teacher
Yeah yeah I swear I need ya
I’ll take you deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Computer music heartthrob
Don’t let your heart get robbed
Look girl we’re not involved
Oh nah you got it wrong
I get in their hearts and iPods
We get too far then I’m gone
I know I promised I’d stop
But it’s so hard when I got
All these girls around me
I’ll let you drown me
If you let me swim in your soul
Oh no no
I’ll stop when I feel like I’m locked in
Then I gotta let you go
And I’ll say
One sec I’ll be back
I feel like I’m being trapped
Way too many girls in the summer summer
And once more it’s on
Slow motion on the dance floor
I’m probably drunk but I love her love her yeah
That smile those lips
The way you switch those hips
Got style got chips
Can’t wait to escape lets dip
Now they coming up and running up they always wanna hug or wanna runaway I got them in a huddle now I’m gonna hut
Throw that know that games I close that and I got a hotel arranged lets go back
I kiss the girls make them cry
Oh why oh why must I
Chase that kitty ‘cause they look so pretty
Hot damn summer in the city
I never wanna be the one to tell them that I need to run but another one will get me needing them to be the one
They try to tell me that pimpin’ ain’t easy
But it’s not so hard when I got
All these girls around me
I’ll let you drown me
If you let me swim in your soul
Oh no no
I’ll stop when I feel like I’m locked in
Then I gotta let you go
And I’ll say
One sec I’ll be back
I feel like I’m being trapped
Way too many girls in the summer summer
And once more it’s on
Slow motion on the dance floor
I’m probably drunk but I love her love her yeah
And she says summer days fade away
Oh how I wish you’d stay
Look babe I gotta run
This summer’s just begun
Wedding bells say “I do”s
Planning for the day you’re due

But I need just I need like
One sec I’ll be back
I feel like I’m being trapped
Way too many girls in the summer summer
And once more it’s on
Slow motion on the dance floor

One sec I’ll be back
I feel like I’m being trapped
Way too many girls in the summer summer
And once more it’s on
Slow motion on the dance floor
I’m probably drunk but I love her love her yeah
