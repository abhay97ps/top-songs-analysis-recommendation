Outside my window, I can hear the radio
And I know that motor wagon is ready to fly
'Cause it's almost Saturday night
Bye bye, tomorrow, Jody's gone to the rodeo
And you know some good ol' boys are ready to ride
'Cause it's almost Saturday night
Gonna push the clouds away, let the music have its way
Let it steal my heart away, and you know I'm a-goin'
Outside, they're ringing, the night train is bringin' me home
When you hear that locomotion, get ready to ride
'Cause it's almost Saturday night
Gonna push the clouds away, let the music have it's way
Let it steal my heart away, and you know I'm a-goin'
Outside, they're ringing, the night train is bringin' me home
When you hear that locomotion, get ready to ride
'Cause it's almost Saturday night
Oh yeah
