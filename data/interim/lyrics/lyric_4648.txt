Yeah, yeah, it's got to be mellow
Got to be mellow
'Cause my baby loves me and I'm her only fellow
Crazy about my baby, crazy about my baby
And it's plain to see she's crazy about me
Crazy 'bout me, yeah
She's got class and she's got style
A personality that drives me wild
She's not a put-on and she's not make believe
She don't mind sharing love so that she may receive
She's mellow
Yes, my baby's mellow
And oh yeah
And I'm her only fellow
Ooh, yeah, yeah
It's got to be mellow
Got to be mellow
'Cause my baby loves me
And I'm her only fellow
Crazy about my baby, crazy about my baby
And it's plain to see she's crazy about me
Crazy bout me, yeah, she's alright
Love is uptight
