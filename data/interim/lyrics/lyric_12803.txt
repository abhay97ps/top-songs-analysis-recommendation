We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
The crowd called out for more, mmm
The room was humming harder
And the ceiling flew away
When I called out for another drink
Well, the waiter brought a tray
And so it was later
When the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale
He said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
I just could not let her be, no
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Was leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well've been closed
And so it was later
When the miller told his tale
He said her face at first just ghostly
And turned a whiter shade of pale
And so it was later
When the miller told his tale
He said our faces, our faces first just ghostly
They turned a whiter shade of pale
Oh, just a whiter shade of pale
They turned a whiter shade of pale
