A sleepy lagoon, a tropical moon, and two on an island
A sleepy lagoon, and two hearts in tune, in some lullaby
The firefly's gleam reflects in the stream
They sparkle and shimmer
A star from on high
Falls out of the sky
And slowly grows dimmer
The leaves from the trees, all dance in the breeze, and float on the ripple
We're deep in the spell, as nightingales tell of roses and dew
The memory of this moment of love
Will haunt me forever
A tropical moon, a sleepy lagoon, and you
The memory of this moment of love
Will haunt me forever
A tropical moon, a sleepy lagoon, and you
