I'm not Lisa
My name is Julie
Lisa left you years ago
My eyes are not blue
But mine won't leave you
'Til the sunlight has touched your face
She was your morning light
Her smile told of no night
Your love for her grew
With each rising sun
And then one winter day
His hand led hers away
She left you here
Drowning in your tears
Here, where you've stayed for years
Crying Lisa, Lisa
I'm not Lisa
My name is Julie
Lisa left you years ago
My eyes are not blue
But mine won't leave you
'Til the sunlight shines through your face
I'm not Lisa
