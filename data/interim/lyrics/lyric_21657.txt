Uh, uh, uh
From my nigga Diddy view, I think I see his vision too
Purple Rain over Central Park, chillin' with my goons
Big Pop's & Sade's, Cirocs & Chardonnay's
My Cassie's sassy so my penthouse my balloon
We doin' it big, it's goin' down, 9/11
I'm doin' it big, pullin' up in a 911
I been tryna fuck for months, baby girl it's now or never
Got the condo on the beach, hope through our storms we shall weather
Uhh, we shinin' when it's pitch dark
Yeah this bitch a movie, but this time I play a big part 
Fuck the marketin', look at what I'm accomplishin'
I'm beatin' niggas by margins bigger than Fran Tarkenton
All these cars, all these stars, all around me 
Put your eye to the sky, that's where you'll find me 
Cause we are, we are super high
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah, bring your sexy ass over here, baby
I wanna buy my bitch every bag
And she ain't ever, ever, ever gotta take 'em back 
I wanna take my bitch around the globe
Hawaii hang-gliding in the mountains, shittin' on these hoes 
Red Bottoms by the barrel
Pop them Giuseppe tags like it's American Apparel
Twenty thousand up in Barneys, haters'll never harm me
Rick Owens on me, bombers for my whole army
Andele, andele, baby move fast 
She drop it down and bring it back, I like that 
I wanna buy my bitch every bag
So she ain't ever, ever, ever gotta take 'em back
All these cars, all these stars, all around me 
Put your eye to the sky, that's where you'll find me 
Cause we are, we are super high
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
If you're lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with The Boss, take a look
I'm super fly, I'm super high
You gettin' yours, I'm gettin' mine
Ooh, woman of a caliber
Only seen in magazines and calendars 
And I'm sittin' with Ms. October
Cause my birthday's in October 
Strawberry and her Ros√© 
I can see it in her eye as she wink and she toast me 
And later on we gonna mosey
To a place less populated and get cozy
If you're lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss, take a look
Put your eye to the sky, that's where you'll find me 
Rosay, Rosay
Cause we are, we are, super high 
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
If you lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss, take a look
I'm super fly, I'm super high
You gettin' yours, I'm gettin' mine
