Three window coupe, you're the toughest machine in town
Got a three window coupe that's short on looks
But she looks real good in the record books
I hold the track record in the quarter mile
With a low E.T. down the asphalt aisle
Eat 'em up, eat 'em up, shut 'em down
Three window coupe, you're the toughest in town
Eat 'em up, eat 'em up, shut 'em down, now
Three window coupe, make a trophy run
Three window coupe, you're the toughest machine in town
Now, I know my coupe's not the sharpest around
But everybody knows she's the hottest in town
My hydro pressure heads make it twelve to one
And Sunday at the drag stop there's a trophy run
Eat 'em up, eat 'em up, shut 'em down
Three window coupe, you're the toughest in town
Eat 'em up, eat 'em up, shut 'em down, now
Three window coupe, make a trophy run
Three window coupe, you're the toughest machine in town
Now, my little three window don't look like much
Till the flag goes down and I pop the clutch
Then I put my foot in it and I really go
And take off on tubes of a three window
Eat 'em up, eat 'em up, shut 'em down
Three window coupe, you're the toughest in town
Eat 'em up, eat 'em up, shut 'em down, now
Three window coupe, make a trophy run
Three window coupe, you're the toughest machine in town
Toughest machine in town
Toughest machine in town
Toughest machine in town
Toughest machine in town
Toughest machine in town
