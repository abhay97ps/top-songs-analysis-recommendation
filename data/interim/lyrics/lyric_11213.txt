When I saw you standing there on the street
I found myself by your side
I started wanting you again
There's just no way to hide
From that old loving you feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
It only seems to stop to start all over again with you
I remember how you'd always been
That certain look in your eyes
Your not easy to resist
But I just walked on by
With that loving old feeling again 
It's really got me reeling again 
Only seems to stop to start all over again with you 
Loving you feeling with you
We were so close we were too far apart
I gave you my love I wanted your heart
Without yesterday haunting the way
Maybe we'd still be together
Sharing that loving you feeling again 
It's really got me reeling again 
Will it ever stop and not start over again
That loving you feeling again
No matter how much I try 
This loving you feeling 
It's taken such a long long time to say goodbye
And getting over you is so hard to do
With this feeling loving you
That loving you feeling again
Loving you feeling again
That loving you feeling again
Loving you feeling again
That loving you feeling again
Loving you feeling again
That loving you feeling again
