I'm so far out of sight
Sounds about right
Mike WiLL Made-It
Hey, hey 
I'm so far out of sight
Yeah that sounds about right 
K-Kill this cup, not my vibe 
Be the highlight of my night
Look alive, look alive
We can start with something light 
I can get you so right
I just need an invite
Hey, I'm a smooth criminal, Michael Jackson moonwalkin'
Like I'm on a pill or somethin', five bitches 'round me, mane
It's 'bout to be a royal rumble, hands up if you want the lumber
Hands up if your head the dumbest, promise I'ma keep you cummin'
I get throwed, out my mind 
Grab a cup, catch a vibe 
You look at me and you see big diamonds
I pressed the button on the coupe, the ceilin' go behind me
I'm so far out of sight
Yeah that sounds about right 
K-Kill this cup, not my vibe 
Be the highlight of my night
Look alive, look alive
We can start with something light 
I can get you so right
I just need an invite
You my target, no doubt 
Yeah, somethin' 'bout you really stood out 
Come here, baby, cause you got three strikes
Come here, baby, cause you got what I like 
Lit from head to toe  we can pour a cointreau
Kick back, we can roll, I'ma stay rollin' indo
Shoppin' spree before breakfast, yeah we stay in the latest
I'ma see to it, that you go crazy
Don't think I'm here to judge
I'ma rock you like a baby
Turn you out, yeah I'm that one 
I'ma get you where I want you
I'm so far out of sight
Yeah that sounds about right 
K-Kill this cup, not my vibe 
Be the highlight of my night
Look alive, look alive
We can start with something light 
I can get you so right
I just need an invite
