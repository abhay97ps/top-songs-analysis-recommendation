Baby, when December comes
When it's gettin' cold outside
And your bags are backed
I don't wanna say goodbye
When I see the trees light up
When they hang the mistletoe
And I'm by the fire, I don't wanna be alone
Baby, won't you take me home for Christmas
Show me 'round your town
Take me where you used to watch the snow come down
Honor your traditions, I wanna know 'em all
You'll check every box off of my list
If you take me home for Christmas
Take me home, yeah
Take me home
Take me home
I wanna spend the night before
Drinkin' with your high school friends
'Round the neighborhood
We could do a little caroling
Watchin' Santa fly 'cross a Christmas moon
Don't need gifts this year if I got you
Baby, won't you take me home for Christmas
Show me 'round your town
Take me where you used to watch the snow come down
Honor your traditions, I wanna know 'em all
You'll check every box off of my list
If you take me home for Christmas
Wanna be by your side
When you open your eyes and say, "Baby, it's Christmas"
Yes, I do
Baby, won't you take me home for Christmas
Show me 'round your town
Take me where you used to watch the snow come down 
Honor your traditions 
I wanna know 'em all 
You'll check every box off of my list
If you take me home for Christmas 
Take me home 
Take me home 
Take me home 
Dum-dum, dum-dum, dum-dum, dum-dum, da-dum-da
Da-dum
Oh, oh, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-yeah
Yeah, you know it, baby
Ooh
Oh, won't you take me home for Christmas?
