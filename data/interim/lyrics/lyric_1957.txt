Spring in Manhattan
Starts after dark
After a lazy afternoon
In Central Park
Washington Square may be where
You'll feel her first warm touch
Down in the village, you'll find
She may be much, too much
Spring in Manhattan
Never stays long
Still if you fall in love
She'll bless you with a song
And if you'll listen to every word
The song she'll sing will bring
Spring in Manhattan
To stay all winter long
