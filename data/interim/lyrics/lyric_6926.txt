I need someone
Someone to love me
All the time
I need someone
Someone who'll love
That isn't blind
Someone to share
My warm embrace
Someone to love me
Night and day, yeah
I need someone
Someone to love me
All the time
One more thing I wanna tell you
Right here, little darling
If I met someone
To reach out and hold me
To lend a hand
I need someone
To hold my trembling hand
Someone to hold
My trembling hand
Oh, and be here
At my command
I need someone
Someone to keep on loving me
And keep on loving me
All the time
Whoa, tell you 'bout it, baby, now
 yeah, someone to hold of me
I need someone to love me
 yeah, I need my baby loving arms
 I wonder if you know
What I'm talking about
 in the midnight hour, baby
 I need my baby to love me
 Whoa, I need someone to love me
Just keep on, keep on loving me, baby
Yeah, I wonder do you know what
I'm talking about, darling
If I only had someone to
Keep on loving me all the time
