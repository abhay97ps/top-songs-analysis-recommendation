The kisses that you used to give
Are the sweet, sweet kisses I re-live
You don't love me anymore and I can tell
I can tell
Another boy has made you change
When I'm around you're acting strange
You don't love me anymore and I can tell
I can tell
Maybe you can't bring yourself to tell me of him
After thinking about the love we used to share
When you're holing me I know, you're thinking of him
No you don't love me anymore and I can tell
