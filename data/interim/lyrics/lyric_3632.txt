Somewhere there's a someone for everyone
Somewhere there's a someone for me
Though I may be lonely now
I'll see it through somehow
To someone's heart I know I hold the key
Somewhere there's a someone for everyone
Somewhere there's a someone for me
And I'll search my whole life through
Until I find a love that's true
For I know somewhere there's a someone for me
And I'll search my whole life through
Until I find a love that's true
For I know somewhere there's a someone for me
For I know somewhere there's a someone for me
