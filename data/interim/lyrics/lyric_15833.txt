You're just a young boy
Caught up in your dreams
You think there's no place
That you've never been
Tell me have you ever seen
The faces of love
Been through the desert
I've been through the rain
I've crossed the border
Where pleasure meets pain
Once you have seen through me eyes
You won't be the same
Oh, no no
I could show your heart
Another side
All the colors
That make up your light
So many secrets
That you're gonna realize
Look into the mirror of my eyes
I know a pilot
If you'll take my hand
We'll sail to waters
To uncharted land
Where we can both understand
The faces of love
So many places
Where true hearts can go
So many flowers
In my garden grow
Oh boy I want you to know
The faces of love
Sing it: la la la
Baby can you tell me
Oh boy have you ever seen
The faces of love
I'll be there to show you things you never knew
If you would look into my eyes
I'm sure you'd realize
Everything you've been missin' boy
In your heart, and in your mind
I wanna make you understand
