They say that blood
Blood's thicker than water
But I say they're wrong
And what they're thinking of
What they don't know
And I think they oughta
And that is that
Blood may be thicker than water
But not when you're caught in love's flood
Blood may be thicker than water
But nothing's thicker than love
Nothing's thicker than love
People draw lines
That you don't dare step over
This world's so full
Full of does and don'ts
But we'll fight with feeling, baby
Deep love and feeling
And so I'm saying
People close doors
They lock up and shutter
Find all kind of ways
To keep us all out
But we'll fight with feeling, baby
Deep love and feeling
And so I'm saying
Blood may be thicker than water
But nothing's thicker than love
Blood may be thicker than water
But nothing's thicker than love
Yeah, baby
Blood may be thicker than water
But nothing's thicker than love...
