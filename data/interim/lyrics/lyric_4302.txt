Now that you're here
But you can't find another love
That's true and fine, oh yeah
But you come runnin' back to me
And you get down on your knees
Hey, you said, "Baby, I am here now
Help me darlin'", oh yeah
Baby, each and every day
I keep on askin' myself, oh self, now
Why would it end this way?
And you come runnin' back to me
And you get down on your knees
Hey, you said, "Baby, I am here now
Help me baby", alright
I tried to give you everythin'
Everythin', my new love
The day you walked away
Was the day I had to say
It's gonna be right
You think you've got the world on a string
But baby, when you walk out that door
That day I lost everything
Baby
Oh, you come runnin' back to me
And you get down on your knees
Hey, you said, "Baby, I am here now
Help me baby", alright
Alright, alright
Baby, help me baby, alright
Baby, help me baby, alright
