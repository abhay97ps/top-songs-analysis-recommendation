I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget what you did last December
You left my heart a mess
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah 
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Thought we belong together
At least that's what you said
I should have known better
You broke my heart again
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
How could you leave Christmas morning?
You broke my heart with no warning
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
This is our last, last Christmas
You broke my heart
Last, last Christmas
You broke my heart
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget what you did last December
You left my heart a mess
You blew it
You do it, do it?
