Smokin' down the boulevard
Flashin' at the red lights
Baby's lookin' pretty hot
Well, you're goin' with me tonight
Blue, power blue, blue Mercedes queen
Not like the Devil, she's a human bein'
Back to the alley, over to the side
Go ahead, you know I love to ride
Do it like a lady
Do it like a lady
Headin' down the highway
Movin' in the open night
Hope she's comin' my way
Like to take her on a ride
Blue, power blue, blue Mercedes queen
Not like the Devil, she's a human bein'
Back to the alley, over to the side
Go ahead, you know I love to ride
Do it like a lady
Do it like a lady
Movin' on the highway
Flashin' at the red lights
Hope she's comin' my way
We'll you're goin' with me tonight
Blue, power blue, blue Mercedes queen
Not like the Devil, she's a human bein'
Back to the alley, over to the side
Go ahead, you know I love to ride
Do it like a lady
Do it like a lady
