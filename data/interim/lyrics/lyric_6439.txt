Listen to the emptiness
Of the raindrops on the ground
Beating out a rhythm
To a tune that can't be found
Listen to my heart
A-pounding, longing for the time
When the melody of you returns
And once again, you're mine
But I'm waiting for a song that never comes
Lost without a melody
That I can never hear
Since you're gone
Look how sad the carousel
That turns with no one on
And all the dappled ponies
Long for children who are gone
Look into my mind
It spins, and then it goes nowhere
When first I think you're coming
Then I find that you're not there
But I'm waiting for a song that never comes
Lost without a melody
That I can never hear
Since you're gone
I'm waiting for a summer day
In the middle of the fall
Hoping that you're coming back
When I know you're never coming back at all
I'm waiting for a song that never comes
Yes, I'm waiting for a song that never comes
Well, I'm waiting for a song that never comes
