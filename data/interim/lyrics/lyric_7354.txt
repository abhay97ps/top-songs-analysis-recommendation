Y'all probably think I made it, but I didn't 
I'm still tryna stack that paper to the ceiling 
Put my mama on some acres with a Bentley 
Might fly my bitch out to Jamaica just to kick it 
I want a penthouse with them drapes to cover my windows 
Top floor shit, I don't want no neighbors, just give me my space 'cause I be chillin'
Thinkin' 'bout my jit, goin' through my phone, lookin' at her pictures 
She know I can't be home, but she know I miss her 
But when I do, I'm coming through like it was Christmas
Go make it all year round, this shit ain't only in December
Toast in the air, I finally made it out the trenches 
When real niggas prevail, they make a difference 
This shit I spit make you sit back and have to listen 
Can't skip through half of my tracks and get the vision 
Try to make it vivid just so you can see it clearly
That's why I can't even write this shit, just press record and let me spill it
Gotta thank God for this blessing, 'cause I'm gifted 
Ain't doin' no more stressin', bitch, I'm livin' 
I had to run a check up, and boss my life up 
I know why y'all niggas mad and y'all don't like us 
Y'all probably think I made it, but I didn't 
I'm still tryna stack that paper to the ceiling 
Put my mama on some acres with a Bentley 
Might fly my bitch out to Jamaica just to kick it

Stuck in them bricks, I was on my dick , I had to shake somethin' 
I keep the fire 'cause I'm gon' shoot before you take somethin'
He tellin' lies, bitch, I'm the truth, I can't relate to homie
I catch the vibe, these niggas fake, under them smiles he really hatin' on me
One thing they know 'bout Ra, I keep that banger on me 
Bad bitch, she so damn fine, I put that thing up on her 
She say I'm too damn high 'cause I be takin' long 
I said, "I'm just tryna take my time, baby girl, be patient for me"
She soakin' wet and ready, got it waitin' for me 
When she fuss, I drop that dick and make her hate to love me
Diggin' deep, she feel it in her stomach
PG gon' keep her cummin', make her wanna vomit 
Had to get that girl some water, got her feelin' nauseous
When I go harder, call me daddy, but I ain't her father
Bitch, I'm an artist, but she look at me like I'm a star
She ask me am I gon' forget her when I get too far?
Just play your part
Y'all probably think I made it, but I didn't 
I'm still tryna stack that paper to the ceiling 
Put my mama on some acres with a Bentley 
Might fly my bitch out to Jamaica just to kick it
