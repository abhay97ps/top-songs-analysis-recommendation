Lookin' from my window
At the freshly fallen snow
That sparkles as it tumbles
Upon the street below
And the crackle of the fire
Is laughing in my ear
And the room is warm and sleepy
I wish you could be here
Sundays in this town
There's not a lot for me to do
I've been listenin' to some records
But my thoughts have, turned to you
I try to read the paper
But the words aren't very clear
And I know there's something missing
I wish you could be here
I wish you could be here
I keep listening for your footsteps
Or your key turning in the door
I sure could use your company
But we've been through that before
The winter's gonna last
A long time this year
I've got lots of empty time to kill
I wish you could be here
I wish you could be here
I wish you could be here......
Here
Here
Here
Here
