She thinks I walk on water
She thinks I hung the moon
She tells me every morning
"They just don't make men like you"
She thinks I've got it together
She swears I'm as tough as nails
But I don't have the heart to tell her
She don't know me that well
She don't know how much I need her
She don't know I'd fall apart
Without her kiss, without her touch
Without her faithful, loving arms
She don't know that it's all about her
She don't know I can't live without her
She's my world, she's my everything
And she thinks she needs me
Sometimes she cries on my shoulder
When she's lying next to me
But she don't know that when I hold her
That she's really holding me, holding me
She don't know how much I need her
She don't know I'd fall apart
Without her kiss, without her touch
Without her faithful, loving arms
She don't know that it's all about her
She don't know I can't live without her
She's my world, she's my everything
And she thinks she needs me
Yeah, and the funny thing is
She thinks she's the lucky one
She don't know how much I need her
She don't know I'd fall apart
Without her kiss, without her touch
Without her faithful, loving arms
She don't know that it's all about her
She don't know I can't live without her
She's my world, she's my everything
And she thinks she needs me
She thinks I walk on water
She thinks I hung the moon
