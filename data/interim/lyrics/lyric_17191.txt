I fell in love, gave you my heart
You turned your back and walked out on me
I once was blind, but now I see
And I'm so glad you set me free
I fell in love, gave you my heart
You turned your back and walked out on me
I once was blind, but now I see
And I'm so glad you set me free
It used to be mine
But now it's gone away, gone away
A love so divine
And I used to think that I could not stand on my own
Something about the way
You touch me, baby, made me crazy
But now that you're on your way
Don't think for a second I want you to stay, go
Maybe I'm fawnin' 'cause I don't want it
Boy, let me show you how it's goin' down
Just keep on walkin', don't bother talkin'
I don't have no time to play around
I fell in love, gave you my heart
You turned your back and walked out on me
I once was blind, but now I see
And I'm so glad you set me free
I used to be loved
But now I'm all alone, so all alone
And don't tell me how much you care
'Cause when I needed you, you weren't there, no
Maybe I'm fawnin' 'cause I don't want it
Boy, let me show you how it's goin' down
Just keep on walkin', don't bother talkin'
I don't have no time to play around
I fell in love, gave you my heart
You turned your back and walked out on me
I once was blind, but now I see
And I'm so glad you set me free
I fell in love, gave you my heart
You turned your back and walked out on me
I once was blind, but now I see
And I'm so glad you set me free
I fell in love
I fell in love
I fell in love
I fell in love
I fell in love, gave you my heart
You turned your back and walked out on me
I once was blind, but now I see
And I'm so glad you set me free
I fell in love, gave you my heart
You turned your back and walked out on me
I once was blind, but now I see
And I'm so glad you set me free
I fell in love, gave you my heart
You turned your back and walked out on me
I once was blind, but now I see
And I'm so glad you set me free
I fell in love, gave you my heart
You turned your back and walked out on me
I once was blind, but now I see
And I'm so glad you set me free
I fell in love, I fell in love
I fell in love, I fell in love
I fell in love, I fell in love
I fell in love, I fell in love
