 Day in
 Day out
 Stay in
 Fade out
 Hoo hoo
 Oh hoo hoo
She was born in a handbag
Love left
On a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
Nothing seems to make a dent
Going to find her some money, honey
Try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about
 Day in
 Day out
 Stay in
 Fade out
 Hoo hoo
 Oh hoo hoo
First thing she learns is
She's a citizen
Some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
Someone rings a bell
And it's all over
She's going out of her way
Stealing for that one good rush
 Day in
 Day out
 Stay in
 Fade out
 Hoo hoo
 Oh hoo hoo
She could use a little money
She's hanging on his arms
Like a cheap suit
She's got no money, honey
She's on the other side
Oh come on little baby
Late night, big town
Police, shake down
Day in
Day out
Stay in
Fade out
Hoo hoo
 She's got a ticket to nowhere
 She's going to take a train ride
 Nobody knows her, or knows her name
 She's in the pocket of a home boy
 Oh she's going to take her a shotgun, pow
 Spin the grail spin the drug
 She's going to make them well aware
 She's an angry girl
 Day in
 Day out
 Stay in
  Fade out
 And there's angels everywhere
 Suddenly shooting her down
 Shooting her with video, drugs, bullets, and promises
 Angels in a ton of sound... And it'sâ€”
 Day in
 Day out
 You stay in, or ya...
 Ya fade out, fade out
 Fade out
 Ha, and ya...
 Fade out
 Fade out, fade out
 Hoo hoo
 Oh hoo hoo
 Hoo hoo
