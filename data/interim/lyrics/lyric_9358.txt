It makes me giggle
It makes me giggle
Just havin' my baby around me
It makes me giggle
Sometimes I wiggle
‘Cause I'm so glad she found me
Sometimes I wake up feelin' crabby
She gives me love as sweet as candy
It makes me giggle
It makes me giggle
Everytime I see my little boy child
It makes me giggle
Sometimes I wiggle
Sometimes I even jump for joy, child
He knows just how to make me happy
He gives me love and calls me Daddy
If I ever felt better I can't seem to recall
It just blows me away to be part of it all
It makes me giggle
It makes me giggle
Just singin' these love songs for you
It makes me giggle
Sometimes I wiggle
There ain't nothin' that I'd rather do
I'd like to give one to the whole human race
If I ever felt better I can't seem to recall
It just blows me away to be part of it all
