I don't want to be the one to say I'm gonna miss you
But I will
I don't want to say I'm gonna cry my eyes out baby
But I will
I'm not ashamed for you to know
How much I really love you so
'Cause it was such a thrill
And just remember when you're gone
There'll be that someone sad who loves you still
You will look at him and see me smiling back at you
I know you will
And you will find yourself repeating things we used to do
I know you will
Don't wonder if you want to come back
Just come running home to me
And let me feel that thrill
'Cause I'm the one who told you
I would love you dear forever and I will
Oh, I will...
Yes, I will...
Don't wonder if you want to come back
Just come running home to me
And let me feel that thrill
'Cause I'm the one who told you
I would love you dear forever and I will
'Cause I'm the one who told you
I would love you dear forever and I will
