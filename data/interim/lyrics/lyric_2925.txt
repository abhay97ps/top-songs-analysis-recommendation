I met her in the morning she was lovely, lovely
Standing on the corner with my books in my hand
I said, "I'll see ya later"
She said, "Lovely, lovely"
I got to get this girl
I gotta get me a plan
 So fine
 Oh yeah
 Uh huh
 You're mine
I met her in the evening she was lovely, lovely
I took her out dancing and I held her real tight
I walked her in the garden it was lovely, lovely
I held her and I kissed her in the silver moonlight
 Oh yeah
 Uh huh
 Oh yeah
 So fine
Saw her standing there
Her love is fine
Hey stop, don't go
Oh you're gonna be mine
You're just so lovely, lovely, so fine
 Oh yeah
 Uh huh
 You're mine
I met her in the morning she was lovely, lovely
Laughin' and a talkin' and a lookin' so sweet
I put my arms around her it was lovely, lovely
Now were goin' steady and my plans are complete
 Oh yeah

 Uh huh
