Don't mean to get a little forward with you
Don't mean to get ahead of where we are
Don't mean to act a little nervous around you
Just a little nervous about my heart
Because it's been awhile since I felt this feeling
That everything that you do gives me
It's been too long since somebody whispered
Shut up and kiss me
Didn't expect to be in this position
Didn't expect to have to rise above
My reputation for cynicism
Been a jaded lady when it comes to love
But oh baby, just to feel this feeling
That everything that you do gives me
It's been too long since somebody whispered
Shut up and kiss me
There's something 'bout the silent type
Attracting me to you
All business, baby, none of the hype
That no talker can live up to
Come closer baby, I can't hear you
Just another whisper if you please
Don't worry 'bout the details darling
You've got the kind of mind I love to read
Talk is cheap and baby, time's expensive
So why waste another minute more
And life's too short to be so apprehensive
Love's as much the symptom, darling, as the cure
Oh baby, when I feel this feeling
It's like genuine voodoo hits me
It's been too long since somebody whispered...
Oh baby, I can feel this feeling
That everything that you do gives me
It's been too long since somebody whispered
Shut up and kiss me
Shut up and kiss me
