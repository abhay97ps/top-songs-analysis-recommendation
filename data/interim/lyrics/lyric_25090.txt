Mhm
I might need me some ventilation
A little vacation, Houstonfornication
Mind redefine new renovations
Space coupe back out of the space station
Float around town, do that on the daily
How I'm supposed to feel safe? 12 live adjacent 
Yeah, crib built like a prison where that bitch is gated 
Yeah, spendin' all my time up there gettin' faded 
Yeah, handin' out the E! to the Entertainment 
Yeah, you know on this side it's poppin' and it's dangerous 
Ridin' through the clouds we goin' through the vapors 
I'm just tryna get the paper, stayin' out the papers 
It ain't easily done, it ain't easy 
Pop a seal like it's Chris, make it look Breezy 
Wedding bands on my fist, shit is freezing 
Throw the bands get a kiss, then she leave me 
I just want the peace, it's still Lambo' over Mercedes, yuh 
Just built the Astroworld playground to play with my baby, yuh 
Had a few pop singers, anyone could be yo' mama 
Had some real conversations with my nigga Bill about Congress, yeah 
We at the fest, come and link, per-request, yeah 
Send the pin, drop it in, GPS, yah 
Seein' flashes, oh, no-no, that's my neck, yah 
I've been livin' paranoid, watch yo' step, uh 
Ain't never freein' up and never let y'all, man
We always forgive but don't forget easily 
Cut my phone off so they can never reach me
Life is just a maze, goin' through my phases 
I might need me some ventilation
A little vacation, Houstonfornication
Mind redefine new renovations
Space coupe back out of the space station
If it rise on the East, land on the West
We gon' make that shit pop, bust it for a check
Call the plays, link the squad, we gon' make it cash
Yeah, nobody can press me but the press, uh
Nobody can check me when it's chess, uh 
They comin' at my neck like Gillette, uh 
I'm hard to catch, that's the butterfly effect, yeah
I've been locked in for so long, I done got dreads, uh
Took the girl off the network then up the net, uh
Iced out watches for the gang, Patek the set
Had to move up off my block, it took finesse, yeah
Just keep droppin' them bombs, you should probably save your breath, yeah
We ain't gone play the steel, why you tryna funk the flex, yeah
All my dogs in my will, they gon' ride through to the death, yeah
Elevator up the hill we ain't never take the steps, uh 
Ain't never freein' up and never let y'all, man
We always forgive, but don't forget easily 
Cut my phone off so they can never reach me
Life is just a maze, goin' through my phases 
I might need me some ventilation
A little vacation, Houstonfornication

Space coupe back out of the space station
If it rise on the East, land on the West
We gon' make that shit pop, bust it for a check
