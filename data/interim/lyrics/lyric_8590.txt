Oh-ho-ho-ho
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Everybody was kung fu fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing
There were funky China men from funky Chinatown
They were chopping them up, they were chopping them down
It's an ancient Chinese art and everybody knew their part
From a feint into a slip and a kicking from the hip
Everybody was kung fu fighting, huh
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening, hey, yeah
But they fought with expert timing
There was funky Billy Chin and little Sammy Chung
He said, "Here comes the big boss, let's get it on"
We took a bow and made a stand, started swaying with the hand
A sudden motion made me skip, now we're into a brand new trip
Everybody was kung fu fighting 
Those cats were fast as lightning 
In fact, it was a little bit frightening 
But they did it with expert timing 
Oh yeah
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Sure enough
Everybody was kung fu fighting 
Those cats were fast as lightning 
In fact, it was a little bit frightening 
Make sure you have expert timing 
 Kung fu fighting
 Hands and feet fast as lightning
 Huh, ha
 Huh, ha
 Huh, ha
Keep on, keep on, keep on
 Huh, ha
Yeah, yeah
 Huh, ha
Everybody was kung fu fighting
Hands and feet fast as lightning
 Huh, ha
