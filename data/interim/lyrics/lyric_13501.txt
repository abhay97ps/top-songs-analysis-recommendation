Yeah
Woo...ooh...ooh...ooh...
You say you want to be the one I need
You say you want to be the one for me
You say you want to be the one I need
But then you go and act so crazy
You say you never want to let me go
You say you want to be the one I hold
You say you never want to let me go
But then you go and leave me lonely
If you want to make things right
Love can make a way
If you want to take the time
Act like what you say, yeah
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love goes a long, long way
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love goes a long, long way
A little bit of love is all it takes
You want to be the one who makes me shine
The one who makes me laugh and makes me cry
You want to be the one to change my life
Then maybe you should treat me kindly
You want to make believe you never left
You want to make believe I never wept
You said you'd never ever leave again
Oh, baby, won¡¯t you quit pretending
If you want to make things right
And if you want to take the time
, yeah
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love goes a long, long way
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love goes a long, long way
A little bit of love is all it takes
, oh
Oh, oh, if you want to make things right
And if you want to take the time
, yeah
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love goes a long, long way
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love goes a long, long way
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love goes a long, long way
A little bit of love is all it takes
A little bit of love is all it takes...
