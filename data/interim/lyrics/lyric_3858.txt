I see my tear-stained face when I look in my mirror
I stare in space as night grows nearer, cryin'
I need you, baby, I need you
I need you, baby, I need you
I just sit and wonder, did you fall for someone else?
'Cause if I hurt you, baby, I really hurt myself
I need you, yes I really need you
I need you, you know I need you
What am I gonna do without your love?
What am I gonna do without you, baby?
I'm slowly slowly goin' crazy
I need you, I really really need you
I just sit and mope by myself
Like part of my household fixtures
These arms of mine are holdin'
Clingin' to your picture, cryin'
I need you, yes I need you
I need you, baby, I need you
Come on, come on right now, baby
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I need you, yes I really need you
What am I gonna do without your love?
What can I do without you, baby?
I'm slowly slowly goin' crazy
I can't stand it, I just can't stand it
Here's a broken heart and
A love that's slowly dyin'
A room full of tears and a heart
A heart that's cryin'
I need you, yes I really need you
I need you, you know that I need you
Come on, come on right now, baby
If you love me, come back, baby
Oooo yeah, baby, oh tell me right now
What am I gonna do without your love?
What can I do without you?
Come on, come on back to me, baby
