 Shoo doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
 Shoo doo, shoo doo, shoo doo, doo
 Oh, shoo doo, doo, doo
 Oh, oh, oh
Many say that I'm too young
To let you know just where I'm coming from
Oh
But you will see that it's just a matter of time
My love will surely make you mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Living in a world of ghetto life
Everybody around seems so uptight
Nothing's wrong, it's alright with my man, my man
I like the kind of ways we have our fun
His loving ways send me on and on
Yeah, hey, with my man
People out there can understand
I'm giving him something he can feel, ah, ah, ah
To let him know  my love is real
Yeah, hey, hey, hey, I'm giving him, him something he can feel
Yes I am, baby

So much hope for material things
 Are they only in my dreams
Well.  So I write this song for you
To prove that real things do come true
 Tell me, tell me what it means

Living in a world of ghetto life
