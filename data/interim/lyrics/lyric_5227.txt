I knew a man
"Bojangles" and
He'd dance for you
In worn out shoes
Silver hair
A ragged shirt
And baggy pants
The old Soft Shoe
He jumped so high
He jumped so high
He'd lightly touch down
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Dance
I met him in
A cell in New Orleans
I was
Down and out
He looked to me
To be
The eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life
He talked of life
He laugh-slapped his leg in step
He said the name
"Bojangles" and
He danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants
A better stance
Whoa, he jumped so high
Clicked his heels
He let go a laugh
Let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Dance
He's danced for those
At minstrel shows
And county fairs
Throughout the South
He spoke with tears
Of fifteen years
How his dog and him
They traveled about
His dog up and died
He up and died
After twenty years he still grieves
He said "I dance
"Now at every chance
"In honky-tonks
"For drinks and tips
"But most of the time
"I spend behind
"These county bars
"'Cause I drink a bit"
He shook his head
And as he shook his head
I heard someone ask, "Please?
"Mr. Bojangles
"Mr. Bojangles
"Mr. Bojangles
"Dance"
I knew a man
"Bojangles" and
He'd dance for you
In worn out shoes
Silver hair
Baggy pants
And ragged shirt
The old Soft Shoe
He jumped so high
He jumped so high
And then he'd lightly touch down
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Dance
That is a beautiful song. You wrote that?
Yeah
Wow
