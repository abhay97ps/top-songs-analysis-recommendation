Oh my darling
Oh my darling
Oh my darling Clementine
In a cavern in a canyon
Excavating for a mine
Lived a miner forty-niner
And his offspring Clementine
Light she was and like a fairy
And her shoes were number nine
Herring boxes without topses
That's my chick dear Clementine
Oh my darling
Oh my darling
Oh my darling Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry Clementine
Drove the ducklings to the water
Every morning just about nine
Hit her foot on a splinter
And toppled into the foaming brine Clementine
{solo}
Her ruby lips above the water
Blowing bubbles soft and fine
But alas I was no swimmer
So I lost dear Clementine
Oh my darling
Oh my darling
Oh my darling Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry Clementine
In my dreams she still does haunt me
Robed in garments soaked in brine
Though in life I used to squeeze her
Now she's dead poor Clementine
