Came into my life a stranger
You captured my heart
Now I've got to face the danger
I'm ready to start
Thought that I could make it on my own
All alone
I tried too hard to fake it
Now the truth must be known
Two hearts are always better
Together forever
Two hearts are always better
True romance we'll treasure
You've given me so much of yourself
'Til I don't need nobody else
And with each passing day
My love for you grows strong in every way
You are my life
Never thought that love could touch me
Move me this way
Don't you ever leave me, baby
Promise you'll stay
I'm so glad I got you, girl
Turnin' my world all around
We won't let nobody change
This love that we, we found
Two hearts are always better
Together forever
Two hearts are always better
True romance we'll treasure
You've given me so much of yourself
'Til I don't need nobody else
And with each passing day
My love for grows stronger every day
You are my life
Two hearts are always better 
Two hearts  are always better 
Two hearts  are always better 
Two hearts  are always better
Two hearts are always better 
Two hearts  are always better 
Two hearts are always better
Two hearts are always better 
Two hearts  are always better
Two hearts  are always better 
Two hearts are always better
