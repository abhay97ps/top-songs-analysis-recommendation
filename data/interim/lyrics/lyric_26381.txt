It's a junked out joint off a backroad
A blinkin' window sign with an arrow
A gravel Iot chock full o' toolbox trucks
Makin' their happy hour way home
When guys like me lose girls like you
That's where we run to
They got "Whiskey River" on the jukebox
A honky tonk sawdust dance floor
A neon, five o'clock, pro clock
And plenty damn many when you want one more
This broke-heart fool on an old bar stool
Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you
Bunch of good time numbers on the stall door
A picture o' you on the dart board
Them cinder block walls ain't ever been cleaned
Still ain't as dirty as you done me
"Whiskey River" on the jukebox
A honky tonk sawdust dance floor
A neon, five o'clock, pro clock
And plenty damn many when you want one more
This broke-heart fool on an old bar stool
Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you
1:39 - 1:52
