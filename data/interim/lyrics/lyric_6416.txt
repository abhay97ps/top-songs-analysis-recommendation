 Lonely nights
 Lonely nights
 Lonely nights
Lonely nights!
Long, long and lonely nights
I cry my eyes out over you
Wondering if I did right
And why you left me with a broken heart
Oh, long, long and lonely nights
Oh, how I miss you, my dear
Please, please, please, come back to me
How I wish you were here
As I go along my lonely way
I visualize your face
When I pass through my doorway
What's left for me to face?
Oh, long, long and lonely nights
Oh, well I guess you're never coming home
Long, long and lonely nights
Ever since you've been gone
Ever since you know you've been gone
 Lonely nights
 Lonely nights
 Lonely nights
Lonely nights!
