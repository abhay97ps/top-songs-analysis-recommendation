Right on, baby
Let me ask you a question, darling
Last night, I had thirty-five
Dollars in my pocket
Did you go through my pockets
Right on, right on
That's what I thought happened
I'm gonna ask you another question, baby
My car, you borrowed my car, didn't you
Did you bash the side in, baby
With the light hanging out
And the wheel falling off
Right on, right on, right on
You didn't tell me about it
Did you, baby
Just left it in the garage
With trash piled up
All over the top of it
Right on, right on, baby
It's wonderful being
Married to you, darling
Thirty-five dollars
Missing out of my pocket
Car hanging all on the side
But I love you
One other question, baby
Your checking account
Is it overdrawn, baby 
Is it overdrawn, baby 
Right on, right on
Is it overdrawn
There's no money left
To do anything with except
Just keep writing, writing checks
Right on
It's overdrawn, ain't it, baby
Right on, right on for overdrawn
But I still love you
One other question, baby
This man who's standing
In the closet here
With my pajamas on
Don't say that, baby
Don't say that, darling
Cause if it is, darling
I got to leave
Baby, I got to leave
Right on, right on for leaving
But I still love you, darling
And if you ever make your mind
That you wanna get the
People out the closet and
Put the money back in the account
And get the car fixed...
