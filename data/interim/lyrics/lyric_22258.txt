I apologize, I don’t recollect your name
But lemme tell you that them heels, really complement your frame
Girl lemme get them "ooh-ahhs"
Then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl, how could we get that way?
Girl, how could we get that way?
Look, another day, another dollar
She hate me when I leave cause when I leave I never call her
That's life, shit, aight, shit, I could call you right quick
But if I call, you gon' be like, "Boo, why we haven't skyped yet?"
And on Skype, bet you say, "'Le, where my flight at?"
If I decline then you inquire on where I spend my nights at
Shit this life gets overwhelming and more then hectic
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort
Just look closer, my life is quite deceptive
Women'll sell they soul, just to buy some attention
I need something to hold, fuck that passive aggression
And when I'm back from off that road, don't ask me no questions
Please, fear what you don't know, haha
I apologize, I don’t recollect your name
But lemme tell you that them heels, really complement your frame
Girl lemme get them "ooh-ahhs"
Then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl, how could we get that way?
Girl, how could we get that way?
Don't remember how I met her, but I know I won't forget her
And If loving her is wrong then I just know I won't see Heaven
She say she from Seattle, she 20 and some change
Before I get to T.I.A, I'm sure to make her rain
Then I'm back up on my plane, Chi-town O'Hare
We spend some time and get some wine, have some milds from Harold's
I told her this here's overrated, but I love your city baby
Gotta get back to the D, you know we finally famous
Driver drop me off at Dulles, I'm headed to some money
TSA be laughing, all them rubbers in your luggage
I know I'ma always leave 'em, but I swear I'll always love 'em
Tell her you'll probably find someone but you'll never find another
Wale, oww!
I apologize, I don’t recollect your name
But lemme tell you that them heels, really complement your frame
Girl lemme get them "ooh-ahhs"
Then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl, how could we get that way?
Girl, how could we get that way?
Got on my suede shoes, I'm in a great mood
Air baggage claim, awaiting miss thang out of St. Louis
Know she shining bright, got on my Cartier
She my Billie Jean, we menage with Mary Jane
See we city hop, Vegas to LA
Brings a lot of joy, Bugatti boy, that's lane to lane
Our faucets used to drip, I used to ride the bench
But it was written in cursive for this king to exist
Packed her bags now she live amongst entrepreneurs
Marc Jacob the makeup, she Givenchy consumer
Gianni Versaci connoisseur, a carnivore
Accountable for a half a million uncounted for, boy
Hahahah 
I apologize, I don’t recollect your name

Girl lemme get them "ooh-ahhs"
Then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl, how could we get that way?
Girl, how could we get that way?
