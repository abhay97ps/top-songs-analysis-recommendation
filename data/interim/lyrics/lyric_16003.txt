The summer is gone
I can't believe
It went so fast
Why do only the cold and lonely times
Seem to last?
Now it's late at night, I watch you sleeping
I wanna wake you up
And tell you that I'm sorry
Though I know
I can't make it up
I made my mistakes now baby
But I did the best I could
It takes what it takes and sometimes
It takes longer then it should
To just live the kind of life that
We both have been dreaming of
There are no mistakes in love
I walk through a fire in my dreams
Just to pull you through
But when I'm awake somehow it seems
I'm just so hard on you
Baby a change has got to come
And I can't see
After another winter's gone
Well, who's gonna rescue me?
There are no mistakes now baby
We did the best we could
It takes what it takes and sometimes
It takes much more then it should
To just make the choices that we both
Have been dreaming of
There are no mistakes in love
The nights are much colder now
I feel the need to have you near
Maybe we could start all over
I feel a change in the air
There are no mistakes now baby
We do the best we can
It just takes what it takes
And sometimes it's so hard to understand
And just take the chances that we all
Have been dreaming of
There are no mistakes in love
There are no mistakes in love
Oh there are no mistakes in love
