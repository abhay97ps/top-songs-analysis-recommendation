Just keep on movin’ it, keep working it//
Got a lot of soul, put church in it//
No twerkin’ in it, keep it conservative//
Give it all you got like you working it//
It's pertinent, and certainly//
They gon’ judge the way we worship Him//
Like Riddick we “On Fire”, we gon turn up to the 1st degree//
Go kill it, just reveal it, don’t conceal it - OJ’s murder day//
If you know you’re facing’ that trial - don’t worry, cuz the Lord’s taking care of’ it//
He most certainly did with mine - so forgive me for my pleasantry//
Don’t pay it no mind, just celebratin’ like it's yo’ birthday// 
That case had no choice other than to settle//
Now I will never settle, soaring’ dem higher levels//
Ain’t no surprise your father is Gupetto//
Lying like you embezzled, a child of da devil// 
Now I gotta snip and cut off all them foolish ties//
Gotta prepare for the Lord’s come in ain't got time for no foolish bride…s//
…made me to realize life’s all about Christ - crucified// (
Everything else just — blubbblbllblblblblbllblblb what??? 
That’s right, yeah… That case had no choice other than to settle//
Now I will never settle, soaring’ dem higher levels//
Ain’t no surprise your father is Gupetto//
Lying like you embezzled, a child of the devil// 
Now I gotta snip and cut off all them foolish ties//
Gotta prepare for the Lord’s come in ain't got time for no foolish bride…s//
Dey Ludacris to wanna judge me talking nonsense & gibberish stuff//
Like… blubbblbllblblblblbllblblb what???
Do ya church clap, do your church dance..
Do ya church clap… Don’t hurt that…
Do ya church dance, do your church clap..
Do ya church dance, just work that…
Everything that I’ve undergone, I beat as long as I’m holding on//
Ey dude, have you heard the news, He came through and paid my dues?//
So I put on a big a smile, so hot I don’t be mild//
Matter of fact, i’m rocking #Polo in a #Tropical//
Island, I’m wild in’ while the devil’s tryna #pin-a-donkey style//
Me but you can’t #POKE-me-MON//
#Flamin like #Ponyta//
So you oppressing my wife to #pin her against me//
And you’ve taken my family and #pinned them against her..//
So as soon as we try to reconcile our difference//
Forgiveness is outta the question, like Winter//
Olympics in July, your bold-lies I censor//
Temper’s rocket-high, kick you out where you entered//
Centered in the Word of God cuz He’s my mentor//
Relentor, is not in my blood, I stay #high like #fixtures//
Do ya church clap, do your church dance..
Do ya church clap… Don’t hurt that…
Do ya church dance, do your church clap..
Do ya church dance, just work that…
