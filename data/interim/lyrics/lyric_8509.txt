Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love and it's sure nuff a pity
Ain't no love cause you ain't around
When you were mine
Oh, I was feeling so good
Cause your love lit up
This whole neighborhood
But now that you're gone
You know the sun don't shine
From the city hall to the county line
And that's why I said
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love and it sure is a pity
Ain't no love cause you ain't around
Every place that I go
Oh, it seems so strange
Without you there
Things have changed
The nighttime calls
There's a blanket of gloom
Another teardrop falls
In my lonely room
I said ain't no love
In the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, ain't any pity
Ain't no love cause you ain't around
And now that you're gone
Oh, the sun don't shine
From the city hall to
The county line, I said
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, it sure is a pity
Ain't no love cause you ain't around
Cause you ain't around
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in this great big old town
Ain't no love and ain't it a pity
Ain't no love cause you ain't around
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of this town
