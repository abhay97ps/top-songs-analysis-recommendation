You told me I was the one
The only one who got your head undone
And for a while I believed the line that you spun
But I've been lookin' at you
Lookin' closely at the things you do
I didn't see you the way you wanted me to
How, How, Howzat?
You messed about I caught you out
Howzat?
Now that I've found where you're at
It's good-bye
Well Howzat?
It's good-bye
You only came for a smile
Even though you're really not my style
I didn't think that you'd run me round like you do
How, How, Howzat?
You messed about I caught you out
Howzat?
Now that I've found where you're at
It's good-bye
Well Howzat?
It's good-bye
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Well I've been lookin' at you 
Lookin' closely at the things you do 
I didn't see you the way you wanted me to
How, How, Howzat?
You messed about I caught you out
Howzat?
Now that I've found where you're at
It's good-bye
Howzat?
You messed about I caught you out
Howzat?
Now that I've found where you're at
It's good-bye
Well Howzat?
Good-bye
