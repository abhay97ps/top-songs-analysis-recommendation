Don't do it to me
Don't do it to me 
Don't do it to me 
Don't do it to me 
Don't do it to me 
Focused, I'm focused
She got a body like that
I ain't never seen nothin' like that, uh-uh
Like a fantasy in front of me, yeah
I think that something special is going down
That's right, I think she foreign 
I think she foreign , got passports
Mi amor  started slow , got faster
She gon' work some more , work some more 
No stopping her now 
No stopping her now 
Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, and I'm down with it
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
She said it's her first time 
I think she might have lied
Feels so good, damn 
And I don't know why
I'm addicted 
Something like an addict
Got me twisted 
But still I gotta have it
Explosive, explosive
I could still smell her perfume
It's not hard to notice, that I'm open
Hypnotized by the way she moves
Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, and I'm down with it
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
She said it's her first time 
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn 
And I don't know why 
I'm addicted 
Something like an addict 
Got me twisted 
But still I gotta have it
Chance? The Rapper? IGH!
Tattoos, piercings and she just learned to twerk 
She ain't got a heart or an ass, just her brains
Gotta ask 'cause her ass on a learning curve 
And she love to hurn the berb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctor's note 
Real deep pockets like a doctor's coat 
Stay faded like Diddy, hair back tryna rock the boat
She the first mate when I rock the boat 
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
It goes her, blank, blank, and rock and roll 
She say "I know, honey bunny, that's the funny thing" 
Thots twerk for the Goodfellas
She money dance with the money team, IGH!
She's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, and I'm down with it
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
She said it's her first time 
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn 
And I don't know why
I'm addicted 
Something like an addict
Got me twisted 
But still I gotta have it
Still I gotta have it 
Still I gotta have it 
Still I gotta have it 
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no 
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no 
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no 
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
But still I gotta have it
