CB on the beat, ho
Butterfly doors 
Jetski, Jetski
Yeah
Butterfly doors 
Space coupe look like a UFO 
Smokin' on dope 
They call me Yao **** 'cause my eyes real low 
Pourin' up fours 
Baby mama whip a pot on the stove 
Ain't no joke 
You the type of nigga go cry to a ho 
Butterfly doors 
Space coupe look like a UFO 
Smokin' on dope 
They call me Yao **** 'cause my eyes real low 
Pourin' up fours 
Baby mama whip a pot on the stove 
Ain't no joke 
You the type of nigga go cry to a ho 
If I go broke, I'ma kick doors 
I'ma go back to sellin' nicks at the Citgo 
I can't go 
Hop on a flight if I ain't got my pole 
Smellin' like gas through the border patrol 
I ran outta drank so I canceled my show, whoa
I piss on these racks on the floor , oh
I got a Glock in my trenchcoat 
Canceled the show, lost a 100K 
Made that shit back in like half a day 
Just got outta jail, got another case 
Jack a nigga car and his license plate 
Two Lamborghinis with the butterfly doors 
I feel like the old Gucci, bitch, I'm burnt and I'm froze 
Butterfly doors 
Space coupe look like a UFO 
Smokin' on dope 
They call me Yao **** 'cause my eyes real low 
Pourin' up fours 
Baby mama whip a pot on the stove 
Ain't no joke 
You the type of nigga go cry to a ho 
Butterfly doors 
Space coupe look like a UFO 
Smokin' on dope 
They call me Yao **** 'cause my eyes real low 
Pourin' up fours 
Baby mama whip a pot on the stove 
Ain't no joke 
You the type of nigga go cry to a ho
