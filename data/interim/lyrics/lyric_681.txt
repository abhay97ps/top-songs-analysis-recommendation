Oh darling, just for old times sake
Turn back the hands of time
Pretend that you're still mine
Just for old times sake
Although I know you said goodbye to me
I can't help thinking how it used to be
I guess I'll always be in love with you
I can't forget the things we used to do
Oh darling, just for old times sake
Turn back the hands of time
Pretend that you're still mine
Just for old times sake
Well I know that if once more we share a kiss
You'll realize that it's a thrill you miss
That old time feeling deep within your heart
Would make you give our love a brand new start
Oh darling, just for old times sake
Turn back the hands of time
Pretend that you're still mine
Just for old times sake
Just for old times sake
Just for old times sake
