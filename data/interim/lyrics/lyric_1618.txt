Anna
You come and ask me, girl
To set you free, girl
You say he loves you more than me
Well I will set you free
Go with him 
Go with him 
But Anna
Girl, before you go now
I want you to know now
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more
Go with him
All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
Oh, now
But every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do
Oh
Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back my ring to me
And darling you'll be free
To go with him
All of my life
I've been searching for a girl now
To love me like I love you
Oh but let me tell you now
Every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do
Oh
Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back my ring to me
And darling you'll be free
To go with him 
Go with him 
Go with him 
You can go with him, girl
