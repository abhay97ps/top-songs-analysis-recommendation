When this old world starts a-getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I'll climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space
On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below don't bother me, no, no
So when I come home feeling tired and beat
I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I'll get far away from the hustling crowd
And all that rat-race noise down in the street
On the roof, that's the only place I know
Look at the city, baby
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Let's go up on the roof
And at night the stars, they put on a show for free
And, darling, you can share it all with me
That's what I said, keep on telling you
That right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble-proof
And if this old world starts a-getting you down
There's room enough for two
Up on the roof, up on the roof, up on the roof oh now
Everything is all right, every thing is all right, come on
Put down what you're doing tonight
And climb up the stairs with me and see me
You got the stars above and the city lights below oh whoa
Come on up the roof now
