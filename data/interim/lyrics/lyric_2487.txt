Janco hey janco, tea-na-na tea-na-na
Janco hey janco, tea-na-na tea-na-na
Picture you upon my knee
Tea for two, and two for tea
Me for you, and you for me
Alone
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us
No friends or relations
A weekend vacations
We won't have it known dear, that we own a telephone, dear
Day will break
And you will awake
Start to bake a sugar cake
For me to take for all the world to see
We will raise a family
A boy for you, a girl for me
Can't you see
How happy we would be
Janco hey janco, tea-na-na tea-na-na
Janco hey janco, tea-na-na tea-na-na
Janco hey janco, tea-na-na tea-na-na
We will raise a family
A boy for you, a girl for me
Can't you see
How happy we would be
