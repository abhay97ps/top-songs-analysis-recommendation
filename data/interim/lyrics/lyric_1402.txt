Dum-da-da-da-da, da-dum-da-da-da
Dum-da-da-da-da, da-dum-da-da-da
Dum-da-da-da-da, da-dum-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
Never in a million years
Could there be another you
I would shed a million tears
If ever we were through
Da-da-da-da, da-dum, da-da-da
Never in a million years
Could you ever be surpassed
Darling, for a million years
This love of ours will last
There would be no world for me if ever we would part
Where I go, your name will be forever in my heart
Only once in every life
Someone just like you appears
Is there any greater thrill
No never in a million years
Da-da-da-da, dah-dum, da-da-da
Dum-da-da-da-da, dah-dum, da-da-da
There would be no world for me if ever we would part
Where I go, your name will be forever in my heart
Only once in every life
Someone just like you appears
Is there any greater thrill
No, never in a million, never in a million
Never in a million years
Da-da-da-da, da-dum, da-da-da
Dum-da-da-da-da, da-dum-da-da-da
Dum-da-da-da-da
