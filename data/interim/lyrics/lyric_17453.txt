I can feel your touch
Everytime you move back with your push
And it feels so wet
Then I get my slow motion right there
Everytime I count a punch
And the rules go
Always slow, toe to toe
If you don't know
They don't like that right attack
Damn right
Come, don't rush
Ones that do, they're certain to get none
And it don't justify
Don't try to move too fast take your time
It's a bad thing to come and drive straight by
Trying to be the one to win your trust
Cause they don't know 
How you feel for sure
So take it slow
It's alright
I did dodge it
Let's break it down oh no 
Baby let me take it slow with you
Slow it down take time right
Go fast girl  makes me pull from 
Won't you take your time
