When you said goodbye
I didn't need to cry
Cause I was not in love with you
Oh but now that we have parted
I just can't get started
I'm just a fool in love with you
I'm a fool in love with you, with youo
Darlin, darlin when a fool has got it
That's when he don't want it
That's a game I played with you
Now that I ain't got it
Girl you know I want it
I'm just a fool in love with you
Fool in love with you
Girls I know that phone me
They all want to own me
What am I supposed to do
Cause when my heart's on fire
Burnin with desire
All I think about is you
I'm a fool in love with you, with youo
Darlin, darlin when a fool has got it
That's when he don't want it
That's a game I played with you
Now that I ain't got it
Girl you know I want it
I'm just a fool in love with you
Fool in love with you
