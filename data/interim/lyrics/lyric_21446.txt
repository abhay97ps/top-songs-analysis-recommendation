Last Christmas, I gave you my heart {Gave you my heart}
But the very next day you gave it away 
This year {This year}
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special 
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me? 
Well, it's been a year
It doesn't surprise me 
 I wrapped it up and sent it {Last Christmas}
With a note saying 
Now I know what a fool I've been
 kissed me now
 you'd fool me again
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart {Gave you my heart}
And the very next day you gave it away 
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone
Special 
Special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day {You gave it away}
Gave it away 
I'll give it to someone special 
Bum, bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum-bum, bum-bum 
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum bum  {Oah, oh-oh}
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum 
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on 
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart 
 A man under cover but you tore me apart  {Ooh, ooh}
 found a real love you'll never fool me again {Oh-oh oh woah!}
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart 
And the very next day 
You gave it away {Gave it away}
This year, to save me from tears 
I'll give it to someone special {Oh, oh, oh}
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart 
But the very next day, you gave it away 
This year to save me from tears  {Save me from tears}
I'll give it to someone special  
Bum, bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum bum, bum 
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum {Ooh}
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
