How it all started
I hardly remember
A casual walk through the park in the winter
All that I wanted was someone I could talk to
It had to be you
The wind was cold we huddled together
Looking back
I should have known better
Wasn't it me who said I'll never fall for anyone
And look what I've done
Gone too far
I don't know how I did it
Gone too far
And I hate to admit it
But I spend all my time thinking of you
Gone too far
There's nothing I can do now
Gone too far
It'll work out somehow
But I spend all my time thinking of you
Seems before
I didn't know what was missing
Maybe I did
But I just wouldn't listen
Wasn't it me who said I'll never fall for anyone
And look what I've done
Gone too far
I don't know how I did it
Gone too far
And I hate to admit it
But I spend all my time thinking of you
Maybe somewhere along the line
I knew it would happen to me
Now I look in those smiling eyes
And for days now that's all I can see
Gone too far
I don't know how I did it
Gone too far
And I hate to admit it
But I spend all my time thinking of you
Gone too far
There's nothing I can do now
Gone too far
It'll work out somehow
But I spend all my time thinking of you
