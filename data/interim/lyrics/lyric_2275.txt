And I'll come running
On bended knees
Snap your fingers
I will come running
I'll be true
Take a chance on me
Let your light turn green
Baby, I got to know
Give me some kind of clue
Should I stay or go?
Let me love you like a lover
That you used to know
Turn the key and let me in
To the same old door
I had it, but lost it
Now, I got a broken heart to mend
I don't care what the cost is
Got to find a way back in
So, snap your fingers
Baby, I'll come running
I'll do anything
To get back again
I don't care what the cost is
Got to find a way back in
So, snap your fingers
Baby, I'll come running
I'll do anything
To get back again
To come back again
