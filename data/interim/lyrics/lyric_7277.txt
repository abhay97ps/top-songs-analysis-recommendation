Oh Lord, won't you
Buy me a Mercedes Benz
My friends all drive Porsches
I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime
No help from my friends
So Lord, won't you
Buy me a Mercedes Benz
Oh Lord, won't you
Buy me a color TV
Dialing For Dollars
Is trying to find me
I wait for delivery
Each day until three
So, oh, Lord, won't you
Buy me a color TV
Oh, Lord, won't you
Buy me a night on the town
I'm counting on you, Lord
Please don't let me down
Prove that you love me
And buy the next round
Oh, Lord, won't you
Buy me a night on the town
Everybody, oh, Lord, won't you
Buy me a Mercedes Benz
My friends all drive Porsches
I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime
No help from my friends
So, oh, Lord, won't you
Buy me a Mercedes Benz
