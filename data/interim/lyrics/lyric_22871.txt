He don't even drive, no 
That's why you're calling my phone 
And won't leave me alone 
He ain't even fly though 
You ain't gotta lie, no 
That's why you're calling my phone
And you're wanting me to get, get, get it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wanting me to beat, beat, beat it

Uh, you say you want a fly nigga
Roll something and get high, nigga
I'm spending all the moss
And if he ain't coming close, it's time that you tell him bye
I'll take you up in the sky, we'll be floating
Get you wet, like the ocean
I'm-I'm-I'ma speed up on it
If your pussy was a book, I would read up on it
Girl, I'm just trying to get you back to my crib
Seen all them Instagram pictures you post
So I already know what it is

Cause he ain't fly enough 
He don't even drive, no  
That's why you're calling my phone 
And won't leave me alone 
He ain't even fly though 
You ain't gotta lie, no 
That's why you're calling my phone
And you're wanting me to get, get, get it
