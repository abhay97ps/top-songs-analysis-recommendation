I got broads down in VZ
Y'all know I’m Curry with the pump, every shot is a three-bie
I got gorillas in Atlanta, Havana come kill your ass with bananas
GOAT, me, those opinions ain’t common tho
I be down in the traps selling that Carmen, ho
In each and every hood, nigga, I’m poppin', yo
Fresh like Mannie, savage like Randy
Valedictorian at Hard Knock Life Academy
I’m at the plug, niggas trying to charge me for battery
I got broads and shit
I got thoughts on mills
I got broads down in Atlanta
Fuck with me, your ass get ran up
Designer shits for doing Desiigner’s shit
I’m pimping slick, riding down the 96
Your bitch bounce to my hits, bitch
Brrat sounds like the background, no time to back out now
Too much pride to back down
Only reason fake niggas talking dope again is
Because they ain’t wanna go broke again…again
Fuck this shit, I’m stealing lines now
See this is my town, a Panda remix, so I ain’t gotta be nice now
I keep it 300 like the Romans
From youngest to oldest, I’m coldest
I’m doing 34 bars just for the hell of it
In the room, I’m the elephant, hella lit
I got my J’s on even when I sleep; Jay Z
What a nigga got to do to make metaphors, life be crazy
Trynna get the dead presidents with that panda paint
Trynna get the Lamborghini with that panda paint
Trynna get the homies rich so they stop whippin' that crack today
Tryna get all y'all fuckboys to get off that crack today
The more y'all bite, the less y'all got to eat
I hope you niggas heard I bought new heat
I got broads here in Texas
Fuck a Panda, I got Lexus
Just like the gold on my necklace
Trying not to act too reckless
Feel like I'm jacking rhymes from Ye
Feeling some type of way
Pretty much any time of day
I just be feeling a way
I get broads, yeah, I get it
I love RG too much to quit it
This be my first verse I wrote
Tryn' to find something to fit it
Got a girl in LA
That pussy was good as fillet
Just after the foreplay
That pussy was mine for the day
Calling myself a WOAT
And them other boys GOAT
If you flip those two around
You'll get the original quote
BOP BOP goes the Glock
BRAP BRAP goes the chopper
BRRRRR goes the automatic
Just don't get attention from coppers
Fuck a Future clone, we the best
Rap Genius, fuck all the rest
Well I guess that's how it goes
If you get famous off Kanye West
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
Bet she'll let me keep her panties
Hope you killas understand me
Damn, I'll keep this short and simple
Yeah, I'm back at it
Like an addict
Got them talking and disscussing
Having discussions like Socratic
My flow is disgusting and automatic
You can dream about but you'll never have it, yeah
Desiingner killed the track first
So in his name I'll kill the lames and drop an insane verse
I'm dark I look like a monkey but on Panda
I go bananas
Ain't a rapper with tattoos and bandannas just like Drake
We do our own propaganda
I'm snapping like cameras
I got grip like handles
I got heat like candles
In the house like a mantle
Won't dissapear like Randall
Get it it was was a Monster's Inc Reference
This song is now classic just because of my presence
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda
Heat like candles
Grip like handles
Licks in the bando
Young and fly like Peter Pan though
I can be an itty bitty killa
Wanna kill like that gorilla
I come back looking like thriller
All great bars
But they'll still hate hard
WHo's better than Shooter Starz
Yeah
Jordan numbers, 23
My numbers, couple G's
I only date her for the honesty
Just be honest you know my geometry
I just wanted an apology
You couldn't even acknowledge me
I'm sorry, you not in my policy
Hold up, your lies are calling me
Like ring-ring out the pocket
Phone calls coming, stop it
Cell phone teriyaki
My cell phone case Versace
Like ring-ring out the pocket
I'm about to catch a body
Cell phone goin' Nazi
I'm about to catch a body!
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust 
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust 
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said "Fuck Mother Earth," that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Who knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix
I got dough stashed in Detroit
You know I got cash on this joint
Comin' to bash all of them boys
Dropping my name, actin' a ploy
My destiny, is incredibly
Potent, and I know what's best for me
Keep competition leanin' like promethazine
Keep my enemies chest breathing ceasing with ease
You know that I got this
I got no jewels in the pockets
But I spit jewels for your noggin
So my albums you'll keep coppin'
And y'all know I won't ever stop, bitch
I'm coming with bars that won't ever stop droppin'
The competition try to strike back but their bars are sloppy
I drop a sixteen, and I'll have all of your heads bobbin'
Always catch me in that fresh argyle
In and out like Hov on Pop Style
Only talk special cloth, black and white; panda
Kodak camera flash white, hot thot pop for the candy
You finesse with the two step, I pride myself on the tango
Gitgitgit for my tempo, prozac, xans and that fanny
Got a blonde bish, named Tammy, pussy good cum prematurely
Secure the bag, securely, secure the bag alert!
Teacher named Cassie, she got me coming in early
I got the ruler, da ruger and I might go make me some earl tea
I got charts in America
We really need Erykah
To save us from this pile
Of mediocrity into a file
"Me Too": hit song
And it makes me want to hit a gong
As hard as I can
Because I'm almost a man
I'm sure we've all had plenty
Of "Controlla" and #20
Which is also by Drake
"Too Good", it sounds fake
"Needed Me" is diving
But Twenty One Pilots are thriving
With their song called "Ride"
At least their last song died
"Cold Water" hit #2
And Jacob Sartorius debuted
"Cheap Thrills" is boring
"One Dance" has me snoring
"Send My Love"'s really bland
Florida Georgia Line are bad band
They made a song called "H.O.L.Y."
It sticks out very boldly
They aren't even religious
Spit so many verses sometimes my jaw twitches
I don't want to hear any more
Of "This Is What You Came For"
I feel like stealing
Because of "Can't Stop the Feeling!"
I'm always wearing a frown
All thanks to "Don't Let Me Down"
I "Don't Mind" "For Free"
But it's worse than Kendrick's, you see
"Heathens" is okay
But the pitch shifted vocal annoys me every day
"Work from Home" needs to go
Just like "Just like Fire", no?
Finally, "Treat You Better"
Shawn Mendes is not a trendsetter
Just because he's from Vine
Doesn't mean he gets to whine
... "Panda", panda, panda, panda, panda...
