I don't wanna go there
We should never go there
Damn, why you wanna go there?
I guess I gotta go there
You're hearing rumors about me and you can't stomach the thought
Of someone touching my body when you're so close to my heart
I won't deny what they saying because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you, so please, babe
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful
Let it be beautifu-u-ul 
Let it be beautiful 
Let it be beautifu-u-ul 
Let it be beautiful
Everything I say right now is gonna be used in another fight
And I've been through this so many times
Can we change the subject?
You gonna start asking me questions like
"Was she attractive? Was she an actress?"
Baby, the fact is
You're hearing rumors about me and saw some pictures online
Saying they got you so angry, making you wish you were blind
Before we start talking crazy, saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset? 
You're beautiful, so baby
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful
Just let the past, just be the past
And focused on things that are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am  and not who I was 
I'll promise I'll be the one that you can trust, so please
So please don't judge me 
And I won't judge you 
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you 
And if you love me , then let it be beautiful, babe
Let it be beautifu-u-ul 
Let it be beautiful 
Let it be, oh
Let it be beautiful, ayy
Let it be beautiful
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna go there, baby 
We should never go there
