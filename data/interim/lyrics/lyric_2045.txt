Whenever I'm with him
Something inside
Starts to burnin'
And I'm filled with desire
Could it be a devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?
It's like a heat wave
Burnin' in my heart 
I can't keep from cryin' 
It's tearin' me apart
Whenever he calls my name
Soft, low, sweet and plain
Right then, right then
I feel that burning flame
Has high blood pressure got a hold on me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?
It's like a heat wave
Burnin' in my heart 
I can't keep from cryin' 
It's tearin' me apart
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, heat wave
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, heat wave
Sometimes I stare in space
Tears all over my face
I can't explain it, don't understand it
I ain't never felt like this before
Now, that funny feeling has me amazed
Don't know what to do, my head's in a haze
It's like a heat wave
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah 
Oh 
Yeah, yeah 
Oh 
I feel it burnin' 
Right here in my heart 
Don't you know it's like a heat wave?
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah 
Oh 
Yeah, don't you know it's like a heat wave?
Burnin' right here 
In my heart 
Yeah- yeah, yeah-yeah 
Oh
