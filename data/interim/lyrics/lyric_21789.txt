Turn the quiet up, turn the noise down
Let this ol' world just spin around
I wanna feel it swing, wanna feel it sway
And put some feel good in my soul
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Want a little more right, and a little less left
Little more right now, a little less what's next
Act like tomorrow's ten years away
And just kick back and let the feelin' flow
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
I set my sails for a new direction
But the wind got in my way
I changed my course
But my definition of change
Just ain't the same
I'm gonna sit right here
Stay away from there
I'm gonna make pretend
I just don't care
And I could get up
Go get her back
Or maybe I'll just let her go
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Go get her back 
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Drink a little drink smoke a little, smoke
Kick back, gives the blues a spin
Break out the wine, forget again
Dig down deep, find my stash
Light it up, take me back
Kick back, gives the blues a spin
Break out the wine, forget again
Dig down deep, find my stash
Light it up, memory crash
Oh no, I don’t know
Baby, it might take, all night
Then I’ll maybe break out that old rock and roll
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
