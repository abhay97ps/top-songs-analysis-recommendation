Say wonderful things to me
I think you're wonderful too
Say wonderful things to me
Especially I love you
They say I was living before we met
All of my yesterdays I forget
Now you are the one that I'm living for
And each day I love you more
So you must say wonderful things to me
I think you're wonderful too
Say wonderful things to me
Especially I love you
I'll never hurt you or make you cry
Love will grow stronger as years go by
Forever you'll be the one boy for me
I'll love you until I die
So you must say wonderful things to me
I think you're wonderful too
Say wonderful things to me
Especially I love you
