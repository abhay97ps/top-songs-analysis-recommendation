Oh I'm 
The hurt on your heart
Through your eyes it shows
The past can't relive
What we both know
Still I remember
Things I never meant
Memories surround me
Won't let me forget
I was so wrong
The secret's not worth keeping
I had no faith
That you would still believe
No, now
My heart's in your keeping
Here I am
Fear in the dark
Stares from the wall
Your eyes in your picture
Won't let me go
If I could remember
How you felt the pain
The king of pretenders
Alone in shame
I was so wrong
The secret's not worth keeping
I had no faith
That you would still believe
No, now
My heart's in your keeping
Here, I am, oh I here I am
Missing you
Oh I'm 
You were there, now I'm here
You gave much more than I did
I gave what I had to give
If I could, you know I would
I'd make it up to you
Instead I'm 
In the place you used to be
You were lying next to me
Oh I'm missing you
Oh I'm missing you
