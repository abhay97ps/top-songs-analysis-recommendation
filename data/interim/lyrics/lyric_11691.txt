There is a house in New Orleans
Down in the Vieux Carr√©
A house they call the Rising Sun
Where love and money are made
My father, he was a gambler
Mother died when I was young
And I've worked since then to pleasure the men
At the House of the Rising Sun
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many a good girl
And oh God, you know I'm one
So mothers, you go telling all your daughters
Not to do what I have done
To live a life of sin, shame and strife
In the House of the Rising Sun
There is a house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many a good girl
And oh God, you know I'm one
Oh God, you know I'm one
