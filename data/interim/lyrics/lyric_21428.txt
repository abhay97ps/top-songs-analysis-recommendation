The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger, big
Gotta believe in me 
Believe me like a fairy tale
Your tooth under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't, ever, ever let you down 
Like a seesaw let you down 
You know why?
'Cause we ain't on the playground no more, baby
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger  I'm bigger 
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, woah
Remember when my heart was young?
It was still bigger than me 
Is that the reason that you stayed?
Most would've got rid of me 
Now the bullies in the schoolyard can't take our hugs and our kisses from us 
Because we ain't pushovers, no more, baby
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, hey
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger  I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, woah
Remember those stone washed jeans 
Don't knock your earrings 
They shined on me 
In class daydreaming of you 
 You, wow wow
Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger
It's gone out of control
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger 
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small  from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger 
I'm bigger  and you're bigger , hey hey, hey
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger,  I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger  and you're bigger, woah
