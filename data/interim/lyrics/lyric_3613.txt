Baby, I know you've got to go
And I have no right
To tell you not to go
The road just isn't there for us
There never was a prayer for us
You know how much I want you now
But I can't stay here
And give you fear to haunt you now
And so 
I set you free to choose again
It's your life to win or lose again
But, hey
Don't forget about me now, baby
Please, don't forget about me now
Today, I cannot borrow
One minute of your tomorrow
But don't let it cause you sorrow
Oh, please, just don't
Forget about me now, baby
Don't forget about me
Someday our paths may cross again
And maybe we'll find
The kind of love we lost again
But now I've got to let you go
It's ourselves we've got to know
But, hey
Don't forget about me now, baby
Don't forget about me now, baby
Don't forget about me now, baby
Don't forget about me now, baby...
