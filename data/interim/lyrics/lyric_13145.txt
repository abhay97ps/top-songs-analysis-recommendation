I won't bother asking what youve done
Though the rumors all point to something going on
See the past is the past, Im not gonna dwell
But I better never catch you with someone else
So Ill put it to you once, but never again 
If you wanna be a lover, if you wanna be a friend 
Then take five fingers, and put it to your heart 
S.W.E.A.R
Hand over heart and swear that you love me, swear that you need me
Get a judge and jury, bible in your hand
Gotta tell the whole truth, nothing less than that, boy
 That you love me!  That you need me
 That you want me!  Tell the truth!
Hand over heart and swear that you love me, swear that you need me
Swear!
 That you love me!  That you need me
 That you want me!  Tell the truth!
Hand over heart and swear that you love me, swear that you want me
I won't bother asking what youve done
Though the rumors all point to something going on
See the past is the past, Im not gonna dwell
But I better never catch you with someone else
So Ill put it to you once, but never again
If you wanna be a lover, if you wanna be a friend
Then take five fingers, and put it to your heart
S.W.E.A.R. 
 Do I need a judge and jury,  with a Bible in your hand
 To make you tell the whole truth,  nothing less than that
 Should I strap a lie detector
 To your heart, to your heart, to your heart
 Can I make you tell the whole truth
 Cross your heart, cross your heart, cross your heart
 That you want me,  that you need me,  that you love me
 Tell the truth, tell the truth, dont lie!
