Sally used to carry my books to school
Helped me with my homework 'cause I was a fool
If you wanted a kiss or a little bit of squeeze
She was always willing and do her best to please
The girl's made for love and not made to tease
Sally was a good old girl
Sally was a good old girl
No matter what the request, she gave it her best
Sally was a good old girl
Now her folk was poor and she helped all she could
The hardest workin' girl in the neighborhood
Now she walked up and down the street all day
Selling neckties to the ones who'd pay
If you couldn't afford them, then she'd give 'em away
Sally was a good old girl
Sally was a good old girl
No matter what the request, she gave it her best
Sally was a good old girl
She was the favorite of all the men
And all the women despised her then
All the girls talked 'bout Sally, but Sally didn't care
She kept on workin' and doin' her share
She wound up married to a millionaire
Sally was a good old girl
Sally was a good old girl
No matter what the request, she gave it her best
Sally was a good old girl
Sally was a good old girl
Sally was a good old girl
No matter what the request, she gave it her best
Sally was a good old girl
Sally was a good old girl
Sally was a good old girl
No matter what the request, she gave it her best
Sally was a good old girl
