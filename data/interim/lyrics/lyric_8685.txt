Just wait a minute, honey
I've got some rap for you
You know you been running
All over town with my man
Telling my friends about
You gonna take my man away from me
But you see
If I can't hold him
Ha, I don't need him
Let me tell you something
I don't care where he goes
Or if he's been with you
Or what he does while he's gone
Or who he's doing it to
I don't mind him having
A little fun with you, honey
Because I know I'm the girl
That's spending his money
I don't feel like, ooh
My man doing me wrong now
Just as long as he takes care of home
He's doing all right
I don't mind him getting
A little loving from you
No, I don't 
If I were a man, ooh
I'd get some too
I know my man has been giving
Some love away 
But how much love do you think
I can lose in one day
I don't feel like, ooh
My man been doing me wrong, no
Just as long as he takes care of home
Sure enough know how
I know my man is fooling around
With other girls, yes, I do
But understanding is the best thing
In the world  yeah
You might think that you're pulling
A fast one on me 
But you're just getting the bone
While I'm getting the meat
I don't feel like my man
Is doing me wrong, no
Just as long as he takes care of home
He's doing all right
He's taking care of business
He's doing his homework
 yeah
He knows how to move me
 yeah
He knows how to groove me
Oh, baby 
He knows how to take care of home
