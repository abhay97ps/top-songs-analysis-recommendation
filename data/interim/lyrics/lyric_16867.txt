I'm Downtown Venus
And I'm trying to be by myself 
Habitual dreamers
And no one dreams enough to get me home
I'm Downtown Venus
And they're trying to divine my self 
And they keep saying
You could be into you but you don't know what you're like
Yeah
You would be into you but you don't know what you're like
I'm Downtown Venus
And it's alright to kiss my life 
I got misdemeanors
Mounting up for sleeping on the "nows"
I'm Downtown Venus
And I can't get behind my worth 
But they keep saying
You could be into you but you don't know what you're like
Yeah
You would be into you but you don't know what you're like
I'm Downtown Venus
Where simplicity is always hurt 
Oh, I can't stop screamin'
'Cause I'm failing to entertain all of my selves
I'm Downtown Venus
And I constantly remind myself 
I could be into me but I don't know what I'm like
Yeah
I could be into me but I don't know what I'm like
I'm like
What I'm like...
