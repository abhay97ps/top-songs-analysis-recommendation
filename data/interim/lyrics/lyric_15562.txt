If I had my time again
I would do it all the same
And not change a single thing
Even when I was to blame
For the heartache and the pain
That I caused throughout my years
How I learned to be a man
Through the laughter and the tears
Situation no win
Rush for a change of atmosphere
I can't go on, so I give in
Gotta get myself right outta here
Now I'm fully grown
And I know where it's at
Somehow I stayed thin
While the other guys got fat
All the chances that I've blown
And the times that I've been down
I didn't get too high
Kept my feet on the ground
Situation no win
Rush for a change of atmosphere
I can't go on, so I give in
Gotta get myself right outta here
"Yes, yes, delightful, delightful"
Rush for a change of atmosphere
"Mmm, I wish I could sing like that
'Cause not everything's singing, you know
The only important thing these days is rhythm and melody
Rhythm
And melody"
And of all my friends
You've been the best to me
Soon will be the day
When I repay you handsomely
Broken hearts are hard to mend
I know, I've had my share
But life just carries on
Even when I'm not there
Situation no win
Rush for a change of atmosphere
I can't go on, so I give in
Gotta get myself right outta here
Situation no win
Rush for a change of atmosphere
I can't go on, so I give in
Gotta get myself right outta here
Gotta get myself right
Gotta get myself right
Gotta get myself right
Outta here
Gotta get myself right
Gotta get myself right
Gotta get myself right
Outta here
