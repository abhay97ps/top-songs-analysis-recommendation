Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's a cold man to hurt his woman
And watch her walk away crying
When all along, he knows he's wrong
To be so hard on a woman that's trying
I was so unkind to hurt you so
Going out of my mind
I just gotta let you know that
Baby, I can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so
Our love, surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding
I remember you said
You would always care
Until death should we do part
Then it surely must be our destiny
To die the death of a broken heart
So before I go, a wandering rover
Let's get together
Talk this thing over now
Baby, I can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so
Our love, surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding
That's all it is
We've been loving so long
It just seems wrong
That our love could never be
You could be anywhere
Baby, I wouldn't care
If I thought that you're needed me
All the chains in the world
Like a robot your love
Baby, I can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so
Our love, surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding
That's all it is
Baby, I can't let you go 
I realize I hurt you so 
Our love, surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding
Baby 
I just can't let you go 
I realize I hurt you so 
Our love, surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding
Baby
