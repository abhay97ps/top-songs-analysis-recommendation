She's a lady
And I chanced to meet her
In my scufflin days
She's a lady
Hypnotized me there that day
I came to play in my usual way, hey
Floating along with a whimsical twinkling
In her strange green eyes
Linger with me. She said, 'Yes! '
And, oh, the time did fly
She's a lady
Give her time for she's
Allowed to change her mind
She's a lady
Happy to say she once was mine
Only sometimes I remember old times
And when she says, 'Can you guess, it's a dress
You won't believe
Would you come zip me up
And button up my sleeve'
Oh, lady, lady of ladies
I remember days that felt like
It was raining daisies
