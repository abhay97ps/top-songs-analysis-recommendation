I don't want to rush this thing
I don't want to jump the gun
I really want to say those three little words
But I'm going to bite my tongue
Yeah, I'm just gonna lay on back
Leave it on cruise control
I'm gonna hold it all inside
'Til the right time comes down the road
I got a feelin'
My head's a reelin'
My heart is screamin'
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an I
And ends with a you
I got a feelin'
Are you feelin' it too?
I guess I've all but said it now
So much for hopin' you'd go first
Don't leave me hangin' out here on the line
Baby, it's your turn
Say you couldn't sleep last night
Swore that you could feel me breathe
Had you wanting me there by your side
Yeah, baby I know what you mean
I got a feelin'
My head's a reelin'
My heart is screamin'
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an I
And ends with a you
I got a feelin'
You're feelin' it too
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an I
And ends with a you
I got a feelin'
You're feelin' it too
You're feelin' it too
Yeah, you're feelin' it too
You're feelin' it too
Oh yeah
