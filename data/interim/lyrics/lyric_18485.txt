Yo, this is MÃ½a
You know the hook
You see the bait
I know you want a bite
So why procrastinate?
Come on, yeah
Yes, you feelin' this
What you doin' over there?
You feel me?
Bring it over here and see what you got?
Listen
Everybody knows that yeah I'm kinda shy
And I'm not the kind of girl who could ever approach a guy
But I wanna find a way to get you to notice me
I got a four wheel drive, 5' 5", brown eyes
Then maybe you can handle these
Because I'm free
Free... single, sexy and sweet
Makin' my own money
Lookin' for the right party
And if you're free... spit your best game at me
If you like what you see
Maybe I'll let you share my fantasy
Now, I don't need a man in my life tryin' to tie me down
And I don't wanna player who got kids all over town
Don't want his curl juice dripping all over my Mercedes seat
I can't stand a man who thinks he looks better than me
I'm looking for a brother who like to have fun
A fly gentleman who knows how to please a woman
The last thing I need is a man that's soft
He better get it on up and break me off
Some a that fly high rise, 6'5", ain't shy
And that's the kind of man I need
Because I'm free
Free... single, sexy and sweet
Makin' my own money
Lookin' for the right party
And if you're free... spit your best game at me
If you like what you see
Maybe I'll let you 
Free... single, sexy and sweet
Making my own money
Looking for the right party
And if you're free... spit your best game at me
If you like what you see 
Maybe I'll let you share my fantasy
Mmm... If you're having a good time, just let go and don't be shy
Come on yeah... oh yeah
If you're down to do whatever
Then let's sing this song together
I'm free, oh come on and be free with me
Free... Uh, that's right
Free... single, sexy and sweet
Making my own money
Looking for the right party
And if you're free...
Spit your best game at me 
If you like what you see
Maybe I'll let you share my fantasy
Last chance
Everybody in the house... high rise
All the brothers up in here... 6'5"
Gotta get in on up... Get high
You know you looking good tonight... tonight
All the ladies in the house... 5'5"
Gotta show them what you got... thick thighs
Freak 'em on the floor... Get high
You know you looking good tonight... tonight
Ooh boy, you look so good to me
You might get lucky
Cause I feel free tonight
Are you available?
Did you come here alone?
Won't you hang out with me
I'll freak you on the dance floor
If you're having a good time 
I'm sexy and I'm free 
I'm free and I'm sexy 
I'm spendin' money tonight 
Party over here 
There's a party over there 
If you're having a good time 
Put your hands in the air 
All the fellas 
All the hustlers 
All the ladies 
Get it up, get it up, get it up 
Come dance with me 
I'm single and I'm sexy and free
