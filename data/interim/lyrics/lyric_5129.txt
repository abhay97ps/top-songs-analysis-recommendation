Hands up
Everybody's got their hold ups
Everybody's got their hang ups
So what?
We can move on
Hands up I'm about to blow your mind 
I'm about take what's mine
Hut! Line up!
We can be strong
Just do like Nike
Come and fight me
Livin' my dream
Can't stop me
I'm gonna break the mold
I'm going for the gold
Don't have the time to wait forever
Now!
I'm gonna take control
Doin' it for the gold
Don't have the time to wait forever
Stand up!
Take a deep breath and man up
See the way I hold my head up
That's what!
Aim for the sky
So long fear and hesitation
So gone
Here's the situation: tuck and roll
Then brush em' off
Leave them standing in the dust
And do like Nike just like me
Livin' my dream
Can't stop me
Now!
I'm gonna break the mold
I'm going for the gold
Don't have the time to wait forever
Now I'm gonna take control
Doin' it for the gold
Don't have the time to waste forever
Now throw your hands up high
Put em' up to the sky
It's your dreams your goals
See em' comin' alive
Ain't nobody better than you
Put your feelings aside
Keep your mind on the finish line
Swallow your pride
It's your time
The struggle is a reason to shine
Every mountain in the way
Just be ready to climb
You were meant to survive
If you do it for the gold
Take control of your life
Can't stop me now
I'm gonna break the mold
I'm going for the gold
Don't have the time to wait forever
And now I'm gonna take control
Doin' it for the gold
Don't have the time to waste forever
Now I'm gonna break the mold
I'm going for the gold
Don't have the time to wait forever
And now I'm gonna take control
Doin' it for the gold
Don't have the time to waste forever
Do it like Nike
Come on and fight me
Livin' my dream
It's my turn
It's my time
Get in line
Hands up
Everybody's got their hold ups
Everybody's got their hang ups
So what
We can move on
