The planet dies... no one cries
So hard to believe
If there was somewhere else to go
You know I'd be the first to leave
I don't mean to sound ungrateful
But I'm afraid that I just can't stay
I had a dream the other night
And as the dream unfurled
I took a trip in a rocket ship
And I found another world
They told me about their Kaptin
They'd have to ask him could I stay - I said
Take me to the Kaptin
And tell him why I'm here
I want to stay in your world
While my world disappears
Won't you take me to the Kaptin
And tell him why I'm here
I want to stay in your world
While my world disappears
I had a dream the other night
And as the dream unfurled
I took a trip in a rocket ship
And I found another world
They told me about their Kaptin
They'd have to ask him could I stay - I said
Take me to the Kaptin
And tell him why I'm here
I want to stay in your world
While my world disappears
Won't you take me to the Kaptin
And tell him why I'm here
I want to stay in your world
While my world disappears
