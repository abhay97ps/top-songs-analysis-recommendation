I didn't have to turn my head whenever you walked in
The only one to let these chills roll down my skin
My heart beats faster, I hear your name
I feel my confidence slippin' away
I thought I was doing fine
'Bout to get you off my mind
I see your face and then I'm
Wrapped around your pretty little finger again
It feels like ages since you laid down in my arms
I see no good reason but still I'm tangled in your charms
My God, you're smiling and you catch my eye
My heart is pounding deep inside
I thought I was doing fine
'Bout to get you off my mind
I see your face and then I'm
Wrapped around your pretty little finger again
Ain't gonna let no man go down without a fight
'Cause my stalls and walls look better in the bright daylight
My heart beats faster, I call your name
I feel my confidence slippin' away
I thought I was doing fine
'Bout to get you off my mind
I see your face and then I'm
Wrapped around your pretty little finger again
Your pretty little finger
Baby, I'm wrapped around your pretty little finger
Pretty little finger
