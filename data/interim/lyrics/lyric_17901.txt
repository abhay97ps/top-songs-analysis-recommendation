You and I, 'til the day we die 
Yo, yo
Ex-girlfriend, how you been?
I see you still tryna fuck with other women's men
Remember when I first met you in my cousin's house?
A week later, we was fuckin' on your mama couch
Now it's been said that big girls, they don't cry 
But they damn sure lie, look you in the eye, sayin' you they only
You and I, 'til the day we die
Said you'd never leave me lonely 
Fly tenderoni, but you phony
Shoulda listened when my mama told me 
Soon as I turned my back, you tried to fuck my homies
That was then, this is now, I got a new friend
Ever since I cut them loose ends, you wanna bone me
Add strife to my life, pussy that'll make me think twice
About leavin' the wife even, picture that
You ain't want me when you had me
Now you on your third baby daddy
And you hate to see a nigga happy
So you're tryin' mad ways to trap me 
Lookin' at my girl nasty, tryna throw the pussy at me 
Now look at this bitch over here tryna act like me
Uh-huh, fuck that bitch, she must like leftovers
I'm still in love with you, babe 
Every break up
I'm still in love with you, babe
Just to make up
I'm still in love with you, babe 
Oh, girl
I'm still in love with you, babe
I said that we...
I'm still in love with you, babe 
Break up
Little bit of loving you, babe
I'm still in love with you, babe 
I'm still in love with you
Little bit of loving you, babe
Girl, I'm in love, girl 
It's always you and your crusty-ass crew, be actin' new
Let me find out you fuckin' with boo, and y'all gon' feel it
Waitin' for the day that you front, and catch a lump
From my black butterfly, that arm pack a lullaby
Sleep on her, she said you bitches tried to creep on her
In the mall and didn't know she had the reach on her
Pearl-handle .22, my boo
She go ahead and walk her dogs and represent Wu
To the fullest, you and hon can shoot the fair one, I'll bring the bullets
You know what I'm sayin'? Stop playin'
You and them dyke-lookin' bitches actin' like y'all jumpin' somethin'
Go 'head with that bullshit 
I'm still in love with you, babe 
I'm still in love with you, babe
I'm still in love with you, babe 
I'm still in love with you, babe
I'm still in love with you, babe 
Little bit of loving you, babe
I'm still in love with you, babe 
Little bit of loving you, babe
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Got tired of the games, the lies, the feeble alibis
Now you fuckin' with the next guy, a thug nigga
Derelict be actin' bugged, nigga
Show this nigga mad love, but get no love, nigga?
Stupid-ass
Plus, I heard that he be beatin' on you
I seen him at the club cheatin' on you 
With your best friend, got you stressin'
And used up, pull your shoes up
All you need's affection
But you're headed in the wrong direction
Tryna make this nigga jealous, with other fellas
All up in my face actin' overzealous 
Like you want somethin' from Meth, I hope it ain't love, girl
'Cause I ain't got none left for you, plus you miserable
And misery love company, shit, I'm livin' comfortably
Don't need no nigga huntin' me down for fuckin' 'round
With his kitty, talk to him
Before my brother put a spark through him, won't be pretty
The situation got my whole attitude shitty
And got you actin' high saditty with your slut committee, you know I know
So go find another sucker, yo
I been there and been done that befo', and don't need it no mo'
That's my word
So go to your room with that there, word up
And tell that big head nigga you run with to do the same
I'm still in love with you, babe 
I'm still in love with you, babe 
I'm still in love with you, babe 
I'm still in love with you, babe
Every break up
I'm still in love with you, babe 
Just to make up
Little bit of loving you, babe
I'm still in love with you, babe 
Said that we, yeah
Little bit of loving you, babe
Baby, please
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Baby, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Baby
