I'm eighteen with a bullet
Got my finger on the trigger, I'm gonna pull it
I'm picked to click now
I'm a son-of-a-gun
So hold it right there little girl, little girl
We're gonna have big fun
I may be an oldie, but I'm a goodie, too
I'll last forever and I'll be good to you, oh, yes I will
I'm eighteen with a bullet
Got my finger on the trigger, I'm gonna pull it
I'm a super soul, sure shot, yeah
I'm a national breakout
So let me check your play list, mama
Huh, c'mon let's make out
I'm high on the chart
I'm tip for the top
But till I'm in your heart
I ain't never gonna stop, never, never baby
We got a smash double-header
If we only stay together
Talkin' 'bout you
Talkin' 'bout me
I'm eighteen with a bullet
Got my finger on the trigger, I'm gonna pull it
Yes I will
Be my A-side
Baby, be beside me
Right now, right now I'm a single
But pretty soon you'll see
We'll have a hit first time
And won't be long we'll find
That we're raising a whole L.P
Yeah I'm eighteen with a bullet
Yes I am, baby
I got my finger right there on the trigger
I'm gonna pull it, pull it, pull it
You better start makin' plans, baby
This old house is too small, now, now, now
I, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i
I, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i
