We're on the right track
We're  on the right track now
Both  you and I have done things that we learned to regret
You know love is the way that we want to forgive and forget
Now we've found the right direction
We've  found love and affection
I  bet you  selection
Why don't you stay under my protection
We're  on the right track 
We're on the right track now
We're on the right track 
We're on the right track now
Love  sent for me makes me feel like I dance to this song
You know you brought to me that love that we have is too strong
We could be a legend in our time
We make up for the rhyme 
We could go down in history
As the greatest love of all time
We're on the right track 
We're on the right track now
We're on the right track 
We're on the right track now
Love sent for me makes me feel like I dance to this song
You know you brought to me that love that we have is too strong
We could be a legend in our time
We make up for the rhyme 
We could go down in history
As the greatest love of all time
We're on the right track 
We're on the right track now
We're on the right track 
We're on the right track now
We're on the right track 
We're on the right track now
We're on the right track 
We're on the right track now
