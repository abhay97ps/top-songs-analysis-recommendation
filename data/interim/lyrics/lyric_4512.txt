Did you ever see a girl grow up before your eyes
Her girlish smile has turned to woman's sighs
And denim has turned to chiffon and lace
To adorn the beauty of a woman's face
That time goes by so very fast
And you know your younger years won't last
So take these childhood dreams as they come
Oh, and learn to live each day one by one
Oh, she could have been like any girl who lived next door
Or the one you played with a thousand times before
Well, you'd see her growing up before your eyes
And as time goes past you'll soon realize
That time goes by so very fast
And you know your younger years won't last
So take these childhood dreams as they come
Oh, and learn to live each day one by one
Oh, and learn to live each day one by one
