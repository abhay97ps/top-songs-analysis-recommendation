Oh-oh-oh, ooh
'Cause I can't take it no more
No, you ain't like them bitches, tell 'em hoes, "Adios"
And you can drop your panties, leave them shits at the door
Dior falls on the floor, I swear we been here before
I'm tryna see you from my own perspective
You all in my section tryna come to my session
We rollin' up pressure, you know that we flexin'
We bought all the bottles, we came with the models
Girl, this a confession, I'm not like your exes
I came up from Texas, and now that we textin'
You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'
Panties on the dresser, your hair gettin' messed up
The feelin' we catchin', my love is a blessin'
Made love in that Lexus, made love in that Lexus
I know you remember 
Tell me, is that déjà vu? 
'Cause you want me and I want you 
Tell me, is that déjà vu? 
'Cause, baby, it ain't nothin' new, no
Tell me, is that déjà vu? 
'Cause you want me and I want you 
Tell me, is that déjà vu? 
'Cause, baby, this ain't nothin' new, no
Oh, you actin' reckless 
I told you that I need affection 
So let me point you in the right direction 
It's so important that you get the message , yeah
Yeah, I gotta say, gotta say somethin' to you, you, you
I'm on a roll, I'm gonna roll out in that new, new, new
If you wanna do what I wanna do, well, mmm, mmm, mmm
Well, I guess that is just déjà vu
Tell me, is that déjà vu? 
'Cause you want me and I want you 
Tell me, is that déjà vu? 
'Cause, baby, it ain't nothin' new, no
Tell me, is that déjà vu? 
'Cause you want me and I want you 
Tell me, is that déjà vu? 
'Cause, baby, this ain't nothin' new, no
Tell me if you want it, baby, 'cause I know I can drive you crazy
I just wanted you to know now, oh-oh, oh-oh
Show up in that new Mercedes, you already know I'm faded
Girl, I been thinkin' about you lately, oh-oh, oh-oh
Tell me, is that déjà vu? 
'Cause you want me and I want you 
Tell me, is that déjà vu? 
'Cause, baby, it ain't nothin' new, no
Tell me, is that déjà vu? 
'Cause you want me and I want you 
Tell me, is that déjà vu? 
'Cause, baby, this ain't nothin' new, no
'Cause I can't take it no more
No, you ain't like them bitches, tell 'em hoes, "Adios"
And you can drop your panties, leave them shits at the door
