Hustle da money we making the moves
Watch me pull up to your block

Watch me swerve up in a drop
I bet you gon’ pree
Watch me walk out with your bitch
She left with the team

See me run fast
Im doing laps
Ya’ll can't contest
I gotta pay my dues
Lets just think this thru
Don’t leave out the rule
You want that money too
Shout out to my crew
Two tone drippin’ cool
Hold that Uzi too
See me acting a fool
I gotta move
If you standing too close I'm dropping a body, nobody can choose
She getting loose
Thick lil shawty with a body dripping she getting the juice
Rocks all wet like surfer
Im grabbing her neck like a choker
Im the dark knight of her dreams
I make her go crazy like the joker
Lil bitch you be doing too much
Let me eat that booty like I'm eating my lunch
Lil bitch theres no fronting on us
And I know that I'm ugly but i ain't no J Hus
They call me RRAZ coz im the GOAT
They call me V coz that’s my bro

No cap on my route bitch stay away

I been working on myself in my own cave
And my lifestyle too great so can't trade
Ya know i am Latino

Damn she a 10 outta 10
She call me Tarantino
I be drippy
You be blinded with the sauce like I'm Stevie
Imma hit you up when I'm in the city
I need my money by Monday the call me 50
Super-fly kicks on it hit with the jean
Ya’ll can't be looking how i move with the lean
Im at the top of, the top of the team
Jump on a train but it ain’t what it seems
Pic for the Gram but it look like a mugshot
Hit in the liver and it feel like i been shot
They call me RRAZ coz im the GOAT
They call me V coz that’s my bro
I dont give a shit about no hoe yeah
Watch me pull up to your block
I bet you gon’ see
Watch me swerve up in a drop
I bet you gon’ pree
Watch me walk out with your bitch
She left with the team
Watch my feature in demand
