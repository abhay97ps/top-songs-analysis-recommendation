City life was gettin' us down
So we spent the weekend out of town
Pitched the tent on the patch of ground
Down by the river
Lit a fire and drank some wine
You put your jeans on the top of mine
Said, come in the water's fine
Down by the river
Down by the river
Down by the river
Said, come in the water's fine
Down by the river
Didn't feel too good all night
So we took a walk in the morning light
Came across the strangest sight
Down by the river
Silver fish lay on its side
It was washed up by the early tide
I wonder how it died
Down by the river
Down by the river
Down by the river
Silver fish lay on its side
Down by the river
Doctor put us both to bed
He dosed us up and he shook his head
Only foolish people go, he said
Down by the river
Why do willows weep, said he
Because they're dying gradually
From the waste, from the factories
Down by the river
Down by the river
Down by the river
Why do willows weep, said he
Down by the river
In time, the river banks will die
The reeds will wilt and the ducks won't fly
There'll be a tear in the otter's eye
Down by the river
The banks will soon be black and dead
And where the otter raised his head
Will be a clean white stone instead
Down by the river
Down by the river
Down by the river
Will be a clean white stone instead
Down by the river
