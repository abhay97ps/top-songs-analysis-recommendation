Oh, my angel
Come back to me
And I will love you
Till eternity
Oh, my angel
This fire in my heart
Concerns my happiness
Since we are apart
I have nothing to hope for
I have nothing to cling to
Life for me has no meaning, darling
If I have to live it without you
Oh, my angel
Come back to me
And I will love you
Till eternity
Oh, my angel
