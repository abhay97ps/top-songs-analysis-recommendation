I've been looking for a boy like you
All of my life
I've been looking for a love that's true
All of my life
I've been hoping for some happiness
All of my life
I've been waiting for a special kiss
All of my life
Been searching for a hand to hold
When things aren't right
To keep me warm
When I get cold at night
All of my life, all of my life
Been looking for a love like you
I can't wait 'till we say I do
Then I'll have all of you
All of my life, all of my life
