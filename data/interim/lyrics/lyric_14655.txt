Zapping it to you
The pressure's everywhere
Going right through you
The fever's in the air
Oh, yeah
It's there!
Don't underestimate
The power of a lifetime ahead
Electric youth
Feel the power
You see the energy
Coming up
Coming on strong
The future only belongs
To the future itself
In the hands of itself
And the future is
Electric youth
It's true
You can't fight it
Live by it
The next generation
It's electric
We've got the most time
To make the world go round
Oh, can you spare a dime?
Place your bet on our sound
Come back to town
Don't lose sight
Of potential mastermind
Remember when you were young
It's electric
We do what comes naturally
You see now
Wait for the possibility
Don't you see
A strong resemblance to yourself?
Don't you think
What we say is important?
Whatever it may be
The fun is gonna start with me
Cause I'm bringing it back
It's electrifying
Take it Fred!
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
Inflation
Flirtation
Relaxation
Elation
Generation of an electric youth!
