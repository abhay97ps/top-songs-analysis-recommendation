Lookin' 'round at all the faces
I can see they're all the same
Drifting shadows on the sidewalk
Slowly walking in the rain
The moon shines down, she sees, she knows
And I follow, through rain and sun
But you see I'm walking in my sleep
And I don't know how I got here
And when I try to keep the beat
You see I'm walking in my sleep
Didn't know that I was dreaming
Sunny days come out of midnight
In the darkness of the evening
Running softly from the light
The moon shines down, she sees, she knows
The star, the end, the tide, the flow
The night, so black, it looks so real
Am I awake, or am I dreaming still?
But you see I'm walking in my sleep
And I don't know how I got here
And when I try to keep the beat
You see I'm walking in my sleep
And through this nightmare, the dream unfolds
I'm by a window, the night so cold
My mind, my body, my room, this heat
A drain is pouring into the street
But you see I'm walking in my sleep
And I don't know how I got here
And when I try to keep the beat
You see I'm walking in my sleep...
