I need your lovin'
I said I want your lovin'
And I need you every minute of the day now
Girl, listen what I say
Get it on in the morning now
I want you when the moon shines bright
I said I want you when the time is right now
I need you all through the night now
There are feelings out of sight
Get it on in the morning now
I'm gonna tell you just what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna make love to you
That's the kinda feeling that just won't quit
I said come on, girl, now this is it
Get it on in the morning now
Ah that feeling's gonna be
That feeling's gonna be
It's gonna be just you and me
In ecstasy!
I got to get it on, I got to get it on
I got to get it on, I got to get it on
I got to get it on, I got to get it on
I got to get it on, I got to get it on
I said I'm gonna tell you just what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna make love to you
That's the kinda feeling that just won't quit
Said now come on, girl, now this is it
Get it on in the morning now
Ah, that feeling's gonna be
That feeling's gonna be
It's gonna be just you and me
In ecstasy
