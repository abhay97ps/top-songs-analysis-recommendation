In love with love
In love with a passionate heart
In love with love
In love even when we're apart
I wondered the difference of how it could last
I heard the celebration of champagne in glass
No wonder, it's no wonder why I'm in love with love
In love with a passionate heart
In love with love
In love with the form of the art
We love through the fighting of everyday life, of glass that gets broken and cuts like a knife
I wonder and I wonder why I'm in love with love
In love with a passionate heart
In love with love then on with the delicate march
Heart of fire
House of fire
In love with love
In love with a passionate heart
In love with love
On fire with a passionate heart
Ablaze with reflection, our hot house is set blazing with a flaming with a fire
It's so passionately racing with a chaser
It's so hard to keep my wits about me!
