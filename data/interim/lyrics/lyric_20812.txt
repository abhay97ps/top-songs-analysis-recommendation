We were as one, babe for a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting that you would always be mine
Now you want to be free so I'm letting you fly
'Cause I know in my heart, babe our love will never die, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm a part of you indefinitely
Girl, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way, you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
I ain't gonna cry, no and I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave girl I will not stand in your way
But inevitably you'll be back again
'Cause ya know in your heart babe our love will never end, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Girl, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my, baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way, you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
I know that you'll be back girl
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder, oh
I know that you'll be right back, babe
Ooh, baby believe me it's only a matter of time
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Girl, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way, you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my, my baby
You'll always be apart of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Girl, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way, you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
Always be my baby
