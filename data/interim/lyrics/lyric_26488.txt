Shit is a jam, shit is a jam
I can tell who's on the way out 
Twenty-five shows, check the pay out
I ain't goin' home, I'ma stay out 
Motherfuckers hate you when they lookin' for a way out 
I just sit back and let it play out 
And she gon' let me hit it any day now, ooh 
What you gon' say now? Ooh
Oh my, ex-girl got a bae now, ooh
But she still let me stay now, ooh 
I got a Dallas and an H-Town boo
Got a baddie out in Cape Town, too 
Whole gang eatin' steak house food
Get the check, I ain't checkin' what it came out to 
I tell promoters, "I don't talk about the money
You know who to hand the envelopе to" 
Big John got the cash and he been the go-to
Hеard the beat, told Nickie, "Put it in the Pro Tools"
Got a fountain on the chain and it's indigo blue 
Might fuck around and get a gold tooth
I'm a restaurant-goer, never been to Whole Foods
She gon' listen to the song, say, "This shit a whole mood"
I'm in the mountains out West on a tour bus
Textin' this chick I used to mess with 
Got her in the bath, doin' video shoots
Tried to send one to me, but it didn't go through 
And she gon' let me hit it any day now, ooh 
What you gon' say now? Ooh
Oh my, my ex girl got a bae now, ooh
But she still let me stay now, ooh
I can tell who's on the way out 
Twenty-five shows, check the pay out
I ain't goin' home, I'ma stay out
Motherfuckers hate you when they lookin' for a way out 
I just sit back and let it play out 
And she gon' let me hit it any day now, ooh 
What you gon' say now? Ooh
Oh my, ex-girl got a bae now, ooh
But she still let me stay now, ooh 
I get paid to do me, that's a fact check 
I run it up, then retrace my last steps 
I'm in her eardrums talkin' 'bout assets 
"Do you wanna?", "Yes," hol' up, I ain't even ask yet 
She got her hair done, she finna need it redone 
Boy, that pussy so good 
Stuck it in, damn near almost made me pre-cum 
I let her give me some advice like I need some 
Booked up, tell a dumb bitch, "Read some" 
I'm anointed, I'm the boss
I done came out of pocket so much 
You thought that I was disjointed 
They pointed me towards your diss
Um, I'm disappointed 
My ex treat me like I ain't there 
What happened to the feelings and love that we still share? 
Just like the girls who got my name tatted and covered up
I know deep down, under the surface it's still there, still there 
And she gon' let me hit it any day now, ooh
What you gon' say now? Ooh
Oh my, ex-girl got a bae now, ooh
But she still let me stay now, ooh
I can tell who's on the way out
Twenty-five shows, check the pay out
I ain't goin' home, I'ma stay out
Motherfuckers hate you when they lookin' for a way out
I just sit back and let it play out
And she gon' let me hit it any day now, ooh
What you gon' say now? Ooh
Oh my, my ex-girl got a bae now, ooh
But she still let me stay now, ooh
Shit, she so fine
