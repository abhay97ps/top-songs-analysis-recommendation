There may be clouds in the sky, but even if it starts to raining
My days are bright as can be, oh you don't catch me complaining
'Cause I got a guy sweet as he can be
And I love him like he loves me
So why do I care if the sun don't shine?
As long as I know he's mine
He may be down and out now, he doesn't have much money
But he'll make it one day, yeah, I've got faith in my honey
He's broke right now, but I don't care
I try to make him feel like a millionaire
So why do I care if he don't have a dime?
As long as I know he's mine
Doesn't matter if the wind don't blow
Doesn't matter if the snow don't snow
As long as I know that he is mine
Why do I care if the sun don't shine?
I'm gonna stick by him, yeah, all the way down the line
I'm gonna follow his lead, oh if he should fall behind
'Cause I don't think he's gonna lead me astray
And I'll be with him every step of the way
Why do I care where the road may wind
As long as I know he's mine
Don't you know that he's mine
Come rain or come shine
Oh I love him all the time
Cause he's so fine
Don't you know all the time
He's mine, all mine
