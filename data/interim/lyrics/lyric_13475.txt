Told her that there was a place like Heaven
'Cross the water on a 747
Yeah, we're living in, in a modern world
And pretty soon, she'd really got the notion
Of flying out across the big, blue ocean
Yeah, we're living in, in a modern world
Talk is cheap on satellite
But all I get is
Information, I'm still here
Redial on automatic
Can't get a message through
That's what she said to do
That's where she has to be
She left a number for me
But I'm just talking to a satellite
20,000 miles up in the sky each night
Yeah we're living in, in a modern world
All I had to do was pick up the phone
I'm out in space trying to talk to someone
Yeah, we're living in, in a modern world
She left a number I could call
But no one's there, no one at all
There must be something going wrong
That number just rings on and on
Can't get a message through
That's what she said to do
That's where she has to be
She left a number for me
Said she'd call when she'd been gone a while
Guess she's missing me across the miles
Yeah, we're living in, in a modern world
Can't get a message through
That's what she said to do
That's where she has to be
She left a number for me
