Yeah, baby
Out here, ain't nothin' but woods and water
Drop a beer from a stand, catch a fish with a bobber
Drink a beer out the can, liquor out the bottle
How the good Lord intended it
Yes, he did
I love my country, I love my country
Six strings and fiddles, whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky we like how it sounds
Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
Up loud and proud, rollin' into town
Hanging out the window like a Bluetick hound
Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
I love my country, I love my country up loud
Barbecue, steak fries, styrofoam, plate date night
George Strait, singing greats, while we turning up, sitting lake side
That pedal steel, she straight slidin' over here to me
She do that Alabama Shake, like you ain't ever seen
I love my country, I love my country
Six strings and fiddles, whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky, we like how it sounds
Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
Up loud and proud, rollin' into town
Hanging out the window like a Bluetick hound
Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
I love my country
I love my country up loud
I love my country up loud
I'm talking way up loud
I like pop, and rock, and rap, I like Skynyrd
And going out downtown when I'm with her
Like driving too fast down a four-lane road
But damn sure nowhere close to the way that
I love my country, I love my country
Six strings and fiddles, whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky, we like how it sounds
Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
Up loud and proud, rollin' into town
Hanging out the window like a Bluetick hound
Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
I love my country, I love my country up loud 
I love my country up loud, yeah, way up loud
That's a country ass lyric right there, boy
Haha, yee-yee
