Perhaps love is like a resting place
A shelter from the storm, it exists to give you comfort
It is there to keep you warm, and in those times of trouble
When you are most alone, the memory of love will bring you home
Perhaps love is like a window
Perhaps an open door, it invites you to come close
It wants to show you more, and even if you lose yourself
And don't know what to do the memory of love will see you through
Oh, love to some is like a cloud
To some as strong as steel, for some a way of living
For some a way to feel, and some say love is holding on
Some say letting go, some say love is everything
And some say they don't know
Perhaps love is like the ocean full of conflict, full of pain
Like a fire when its cold outside, or thunder when it rains
If I should live forever and all my dreams come true
My memories of love will be of you
And some say love is holding on
Some say letting go, and some say love is everything
And some say they don't know
Perhaps love is like the ocean full of conflict, full of pain
Like a fire when it's cold outside or thunder when it rains
If I should live forever and all my dreams come true
My memories of love will be of you
