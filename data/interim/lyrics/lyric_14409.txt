Summertime's in the air
And summergirls are everywhere
They raise excitability
I like the things they do to me
Summergirls
All day long
Summergirls
Sing this song
Summergirls set the pace
With sunglasses on their face
Excuse me if I stop and stare
I like the kind of clothes they wear
Summergirls
All day long
I like summergirls
Sing this song
I wish they all could be like summergirls
Summergirls at the beach
Sexy suits and hard bodies
Their golden brown bodies sweat
I like to see them soaking wet
Summergirls in the sun
All day long
Summergirls
Just having fun
Sing this song
I wish they all could be like summergirls
I like the summergirls
They're turning me on
They look so good to me
These summergirls are sweet
I wanna take one home with me
Summergirls in the sun
All day long summergirls
Just having fun
Sing this song
I like summergirls
The way they walk and talk
I wish they all could be like summer
Wish they all could be like summergirls
