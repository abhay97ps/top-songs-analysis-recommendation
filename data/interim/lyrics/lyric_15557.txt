Step left around and together with the rest
Now, here comes the music
Here comes the music
One, two, three, four
Are we getting funky
There she go, there she don't
You don’t want to, you don't need to
Feel the warmth
Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm
One, two, three, four
Oh world, keep on
Oh world, keep on
One, two, three, four
Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm
Oh world
One, two, three, four
You don't need her
Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep keep warm
Keep warm
One, two, three, four
