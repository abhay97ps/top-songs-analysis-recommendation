Haha, mami like⁠—
Mami like, "Damn boy, you made it" 
But she said, "You ain't nice" 
I tell her I know I'm nice, ha 
I don't talk to niggas , I don't feel these niggas 
Got a hundred round in my pocket, I'm ready, go kill these niggas , look
And it's tunnel vision  when I'm in the field, nigga 
If I tell Mikey Woo , then he gon' go drill a nigga 
I'm a Brooklyn nigga, but shout out my Philly niggas 
I don't fuck with a lot of niggas because I'm too real for niggas 
They don't know what it means  to have million dollar dreams 
Then you wake up on the block and it's back to servin' fiends 
I don't drink Belaire , but I'm in Bel Air like I'm Uncle Phil
Don't call me bluff, nigga, I am and, nigga, I will, look 
And I'm from the fields , now it's million dollar deals 
And it's all out of nowhere, push me and I'ma go there
All in a second, gun kickin' like it's Tekken 
I'm a force to be reckoned, I'm God's perfection
Look, God gave me a lot in some months, but it could go in a second
If I fuck the wrong bitch  or walk up in the wrong section
I don't talk to niggas , I don't feel these niggas 
Got a hundred round in my pocket, I'm ready, go kill these niggas , look
And it's tunnel vision  when I'm in the field, nigga 
If I tell Mikey Woo , then he gon' go drill a nigga 
I'm a Brooklyn nigga, but shout out my Philly niggas 
I don't fuck with a lot of niggas because I'm too real for niggas 
They don't know what it means  to have million dollar dreams 
Then you wake up on the block and it's back to servin' fiends 
Stepped in the game, started changin' it, changin' it, haha
Never who, forever the Woo
What do you want your impact to be on the music industry?
Like, a hundred years from now, how do you want people to remember you?
Pop Smoke did this, he did that, he did what?
Pop Smoke came in and changed the game
Pop Smoke came in and showed them niggas a new vibe
You know, the whole sound, the whole vibe, the whole movement
Different
Forever my heart, forever my dawgs
We still gon' put on for you
The smoke will never clear
Never
Woo, woo, woo, grrt-baow
