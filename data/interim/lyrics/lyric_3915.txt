How you living and still dead
Just a bystander in your own life 
A bystander in your own life 
A bystander in your own life, uhhh
Lost in the world, you're hopeless
Ain't come from the money, but stayed for you, okay
Drowning and you need focus
You'll never be high enough to jump these obstacles, no way
Death on my line, don't call back
Spoke on it when I rapped, all you did was laugh at me
So if I ever make it back, don't you ask for me
I ain't with the...
Man, look
Can’t nobody come for me
I mean, I’m too stressed for all this middle school gossip
Suckers ain’t too confident, jump to conclusions like y’all do models
I see delusion in blue checks
But you follow the leader that follows you, depending on who follows
Y’all are looking like Seattle, you ain’t catch that
Don’t tell me I’m the hardest, I’m just Harden with the step back
I talk about my losses because often I was lost in what you call a minor setback
I mean, I pushed people away due to my problems
The same dang problems left my late best friend Rina hanging like Sadam
If you don’t see the terror in that, let me know how you stomach that plate of dust
They’re throwing shade at my shadow, strange fruit
I’ll probably hang from the gallows if memories ain’t enough
Ain’t you the same as me, a flame they can’t touch
I only hurt who I’m close to, so till I recover, I can’t trust
Tell me who gon ride, dawg
Who gon ride when the well wishes run dry, dawg
I don't have a clue as to who's really on this side
But relationships sink and everybody's got to die, dawg
What am I to do besides tell you that your vibe's off
Running round chasing vanity and your desires
All the I don’t bend or break talk, we know that’s a lie, dawg
When they’re shooting shots, no horse, just lives, dawg
Tell me who survives y’all
Looking for a way out
To lie with you, they'd lie for you
Ride for you, die for you
Who love you like I love you?
All them putting morality to the side for you
Be on that auction block when it's time for you?
Not me
I’ll never hustle for a necklace
I just want to know who’s down for me when it’s hectic
Deep breath, knee to elbow, chin in chest
Guess I’m going off the deep end dawg, and I accept it
You can judge me if you feel so inclined to
But don't expect a response to your lies
Already wasting your breath, no reason to waste mine too
You mention me, you've already met your demise
You're worried bout blue lives, you're probably sick with that swine flu
I see so many blue faces
Yet so many blue faces on people trying to decipher whose race they’ve been running
My trigger finger is itchy, that’s a copout
You wonder who’s racist, until they’re saying cop now
They’ll come through and Jenga your whole block
I’ll just let the pen bleed for the leeches
And everyone I ever pushed away, I see in the bleachers
I don’t know what’s real anymore, hallucinations are creeping
Done battling, demons had me basking in youth
Now I’m trafficking truth while your President is trafficking humans
You laughed when I prophesized, now he’s laughing at you
Recovery ain’t what I thought, so I’m asking for proof
Tell me who gon ride, dawg
Who gon ride when the well wishes run dry, dawg
I don't have a clue as to who's really on this side
But relationships sink and everybody's got to die, dawg
What am I to do besides tell you that your vibe's off
Running round chasing vanity and your desires
All the I don’t bend or break talk, we know that’s a lie, dawg
When they’re shooting shots, no horse, just lives, dawg
Tell me who survives y’all
Looking for a way out
To lie with you, they'd lie for you
Ride for you, die for you
Who love you like I love you?
All them putting morality to the side for you
Be on that auction block when it's time for you?
Not me
I’ll never hustle for a necklace
I just want to know who’s down for me when it’s hectic
Deep breath, knee to elbow, chin in chest
Guess I’m going off the deep end dawg, and I accept it
People keep telling me I’ve done enough thinking bout somebody’s son in New Orleans that was left hanging from the bleachers after Piedmont
They kept it a secret for a reason, revenge all summer sixteen, huh?
Black lives matter
But we keep it moving till we die by someone other than us, so what’s a movement?...
Cause it’s amusing how people of power can sway opinions, it’s being proven
How these rappers rap about everything except what they’re doing
What we’re going through is the same battle we’re always losing
They put their heart into using these soon to be veterans and discard them with PTSD
What are you settling for, huh?
The truth is such a bitter pill to swallow
I don’t care about a Grammy; I just want to see tomorrow
I just want to see my best friend one last time...
