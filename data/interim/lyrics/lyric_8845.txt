Well I'm sittin' down in San Anton'
Waiting on an eight o'clock train
My woman left me here last night
Things ain't been quite the same
I gotta get back to Dallas
And tie up a few loose ends
I'm gonna work a week make a hundred dollars
Aw and hit the road again
So I don't want you to think
That you're the first one
To leave me out here on my own
'Cause this ain't gonna be the first time
This ol' cowboy spent the night alone
Well honey I've been a fool, but a bigger fool
I can't remember when I've been
Just to open up my heart
And let you walk right in
But there's one thing in life
That ain't hard for me to do
That's as soon as I kiss the lips of another woman
I'm gonna forget all about you
So I don't want you to think
That you're the first one
To leave me out here on my own
'Cause this ain't gonna be the first time
This ol' cowboy spent the night alone
But if you wrote all the woman's names down I know
And let me pick one out
I don't believe there'd be one in the whole bunch
Aw I'd give a hoot about
So I don't want you to think
That you're the first one
To leave this ol' boy out here on his own
No it ain't gonna be the first time
This ol' cowboy spent the night alone
No it ain't gonna be the first time
This ol' cowboy spent the night alone
