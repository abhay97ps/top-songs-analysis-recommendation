I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothin' he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always tryin'
To keep my baby cryin'
Treacherous, cunnin', declinin'
You got my baby cryin' 
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
You're a vegetable 
You're a vegetable 
Still they hate you 
You're a vegetable 
You're just a buffet  
You're a vegetable 
They eat off of you  
You're a vegetable, aaow!
Billie Jean is always talkin' when nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', spyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
You're a vegetable 
You're a vegetable 
Still they hate you 
You're a vegetable 
You're just a buffet  
You're a vegetable 
They eat off of you  
You're a vegetable, aaow!
Aaow!
Hee-haw! 
If you can't feed your baby 
Then don't have a baby 
And don't think maybe 
If you can't feed your baby 
You'll be always tryin'
To stop that child from cryin'
Hustlin', stealin', lyin'
Now baby's slowly dyin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
Lift your head up high and scream out to the world
"I know I am someone," and let the truth unfurl 
No one can hurt you now because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you
