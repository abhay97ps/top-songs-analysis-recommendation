Hey man, come on over here
Let me play some of nothin' for your ears
Well, I sat down and listened to him say
Love keeps gettin' in the way
Well, how many times will I fall in love
With a girl that was my friend?
You see love is a hole in the middle of my heart
Like a well that has no end and I said
Oh yeah, I know what you mean
'Cause a friend in love is a friend in need
There's a soul out there that yours wants to find
Set your spirit free and I said
Oh, yeah, I know what you mean
'Cause a friend in love is a friend in need, yeah
She said, hey man, come on let's go
Let me tell you about something that you don't know
Well, I paced the floor, listened to her say
Love keeps gettin' in the way
And how many times will I fall in love
With a boy that was my friend?
You see love is a pole that blocks the door
With a key the boy can't lend and I said
Oh yeah, I know what you mean
'Cause a friend in love is a friend in need
There's a soul out there that yours wants to find
Set your spirit free and I said
Oh, yeah, I know what you mean
'Cause a friend in love is a friend in need, yeah
Well, I tried to find some reason why
I know our love is better but I've been sinkin', yeah, I've been sinkin'
Well, I tried to find a corner in my mind
Leave it all behind, but I've been thinkin', yeah, I've been thinkin'
We can put it all together babe, we've got plenty of time
I remember sittin' 'neath the stars
Talkin' 'bout love in a broken down car
He said, what are we gonna do, we've lost our way
And love keeps gettin' in the way
Well, I replied to the question on his face
Said, love's not a time or a convenient place
Got rocks in you shoes, you gotta fly
If it's love there is no question why, he said
Oh yeah, I know what you mean
'Cause a friend in love is a friend in need
There's a soul out there that yours wants to find
Set your spirit free and I said
Oh, yeah, I know what you mean
'Cause a friend in love is a friend in need, oh yeah, oh yeah
And I've been sinkin', I've been sinkin', babe
And I've been sinkin', I've been sinkin', babe
