I must have rehearsed my lines
A thousand times
Until I had them memorized
But when I get up the nerve
To tell you the words
Just never seem to come out right
If only you knew
How much I do
Do love you
If only you knew
How much I do
I do need you
I dream of moments we share
But you're not there
I'm living in a fantasy
Cause you don't even suspect
Could probably care less
About the changes I been going through
If only you knew
How much I do
Do love you
If only you knew
How much I do
I do need you
No, you don't even suspect
Could probably care less
About the changes I been going through
