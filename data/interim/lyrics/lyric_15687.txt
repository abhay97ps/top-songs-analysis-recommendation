Turn it on
Let it pour
Ice cold
I can't take it anymore
So this is love
So this is love
There's a fire burning in my heart
When you're close
That's when it starts
There's a flame where there once was a spark
Cold shower
I heat up
Can't cool down
This only happens when you're around
Turn on the water
Cause I think I should drown
Cold shower
The closer you get
You fan the fire
Filling me up with a wild desire
Your gentle touch
The move of your hand
You got a way to make me feel
Like no other man
There's a fire burning in my heart
When you're close
That's when it starts
There's a flame where there once was a spark
Cold shower
I heat up
Can't cool down
This only happens when you're around
Turn on the water
Cause I think I should drown
Cold shower
Cold shower
Cold shower
I'm starting to melt
You're making me burn
Emotions and lust
They twist and they turn
I'm over the edge
I'm out of control
Feel the rise of heated passion
From deep inside my soul
Cold
Cold
Cold
Turn it on
Let it pour
Ice cold
I can't take it anymore
So this is love
So this is love
There's a fire burning in my heart
When you're close
That's when it starts
There's a flame where there once was a spark
Cold shower
I heat up
Can't cool down
This only happens when you're around
Turn on the water
Cause I think I should drown
Cold shower
Cold shower
Cold shower
There's a fire burning in my heart
When you're close
That's when it starts
There's a flame where there once was a spark
Cold shower
I heat up
Can't cool down
This only happens when you're around
Turn on the water
Cause I think I should drown
Cold shower
