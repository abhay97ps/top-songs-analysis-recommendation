I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both
We made a start, be it a false one I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
We took a chance, God knows we've tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink, oh love
Let's split the night wide open
And we'll see everything we can
Living love in slow motion, motion, motion
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
When we were eighteen
Oh Lord, when we were eighteen
Kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
