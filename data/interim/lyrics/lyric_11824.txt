In the streets
There's people dancing
You sit home and wonder why
He would turn on his heels and go
No backward glancing
What he said last night
You still can't quite recall
You can try
You can try
But you just can't win 'em all
One good turn deserves another
He wasn't the first to leave you this way
Oh, you tried so hard to keep your bases covered
Now you say
That no one told you 'bout the price you had to pay
Wasn't it you
Who said that nothing mattered?
Wasn't it you
Who had to have it all?
Now your broken wings are all in tatters
I would learn how to fly
But it's just too far to fall
You can try
You can try
But you just can't win 'em all
Don't ask me why
You just can't win 'em all
You can try
You can try
But you just can't win 'em all
