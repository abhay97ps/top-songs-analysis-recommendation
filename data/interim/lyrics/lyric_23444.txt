Got nowhere to go and all night to get there
But I'm going there with you
Tonight we're running on luck
If we're gonna use it all up
There's only one thing left to do
Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
Twirl you around 'til my head spins
Kiss that lipstick and wear it thin 'til it's gone, 'til it's gone
Break every rule we ever learned
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone
You look way too good
And this feels way too right
It'd been way too long to start
And it's sure worth drinking to
So baby here's to you
I don't wanna waste a drop
Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
Twirl you around 'til my head spins
Break every rule we ever learned
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone
One life, one chance
One ticket to the big dance
You and me still holding on
Right down to the last song
Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
Twirl you around 'til my head spins
Kiss that lipstick and wear it thin 'til it's gone, 'til it's gone
Break every rule we ever learned
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone
Yeah, 'til it's gone
You're sure worth drinking to
Baby, here's to you
I don't wanna waste a drop
I'm gonna drink it all up
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone, it's gone
