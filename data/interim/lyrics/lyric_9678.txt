One more time
Well we play that funky music
And we were looking so good yeah
Electrified funky feeling
Was coming down like I thought it was
So we went out on the road yeah
Try to get ourselves ahead
And on the way I was surprised to discover
That all those funky people
Had been mislead they were selling out
Black now, white right oh what a sight
I really didn't know the suckers was white
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
That the honkey's got soul
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
That the honkey's got soul
Yeah yeah yeah
When we flew into motor city
There was a riot going on
There was fighting in the street
Let me tell you I was afraid we was gone
Then they gave the introduction
And so we took it to the stage
I heard the brothers and the sisters
Shout something in a rage
They were screaming to me
Black now, white right oh what a sight
I really didn't know the suckers was white
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
That the honkey's got soul
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
That the honkey's got soul down in Memphis, Atlanta, and Philly too
The word is coming down, yeah
If you listen to this message
You'll hear when we hit town
Dancing and singing
Moving to the grovin too
And then we'll all join in together
To tear the roof of the sucker
Black now, white right oh what a sight
It really doesn't matter if the suckers are white
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
That the honkey's got soul
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
That the honkey's got soul
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
That the honkey's got soul
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
That the honkey's got soul
