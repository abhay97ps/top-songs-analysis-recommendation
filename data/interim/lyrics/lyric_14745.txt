You can't get up
You can't get down
You can't sit still
You never settle down
Don't say you love me
Just say 'huh'!
You love runs hot
Your love runs cold
You can't get loose
Until you get control
Don't say you love me
Just say 'huh'!
Don't say you love me
Just say 'all right'
You're scared to win
You're scared to lose
You're scared to live
With the life you choose
Don't say you love me
Just say
You can't say 'yes'
You can't say 'no'
Your mind's made up
You don't know where to go
Don't say you love me
Whatcha say?
Don't say you love me
Just say 'huh'!
I can see you comin' round again
I can feel you but I can't say when
I will be there in your now and then
