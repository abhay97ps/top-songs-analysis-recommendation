Not too long ago
You said you'd love me 'til the end
But lately you're indifferent
And I can't even be your friend
If I'm really such a bore
And you don't want me anymore
Leave my heart
So I can love again
So untie me 
Untie me, baby 
You're not ever there
When I need you
You don't care where I go
And what I do
So untie me 
Untie me, baby 
Well, if you found a new love
I won't put the blame on you
But just give me a chance
To start my life anew
If you're really gonna go
I want to be the first to know
Break these chains
That bind my heart to you
So untie me 
Untie me, baby 
You're not ever there
When I need you
You don't care where I go
Or what I do
So untie me 
Untie me, baby 
You better on tie me 
So baby, come on 
Come on and untie me 
Oh, yeah
