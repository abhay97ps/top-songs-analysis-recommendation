You like a dozen wine red roses
Candlelight on porcelain set tables
And that's fine, I'll go out of my way
For you anytime
That's right baby
The fire's warm
So you take off your sweater
Now it's my turn and I'll do you one better
That's the game we both like to play
CHORUS
You wink
I laugh
'cuz we know a little hug leads to a foot rub
Then a hot tub
Then a french kiss on a bear rug
Do you like it, do you like it
How about this wanna try it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll Take That As a Yes
You like snuggling with your pillow
With my arms tight holding us together
Breathing deep and drifting like a feather in a stream
Then I touch you on the shoulder
Feel your skin soft underneath my fingers
And I know we'll never get to sleep
Repeat CHORUS
It's written all over your face there's no mistake
No guess, no doubt, no beatin around the bush
Baby it's understood
Repeat CHORUS
I'll Take That As a Yes
I'll Take That As a Yes
Cause we know a little hug leads to a
Foot rub, hot tub, bear rug, yeah
Wouldn't you love
Wouldn't you love
Wouldn't you love
I like it, I like it yes
