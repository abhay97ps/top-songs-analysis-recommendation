Big beat talk to me
Waking up blind with the house on fire
Well I pick up my guitar, 
I look in the mirror
It's like a stranger in my hand 
There comes a time when the boy must leave 
And the man has to enter
For the soul to understand 
As if it ain't hard enough this life I'm living in
I was caught with my guard down
When the world came knocking
I feel the big beat, the Rock Of Life
Big beat talk to me
Hey! Whoo!
I feel the back beat, the Rock Of Life
Waking up blind with the house on fire
Is it something in my head 
Or the time of season
Or the little boy in my hands 
Yeah, there's new meaning in my life 
But there's pain and confusion
And I'm trying to understand 
I've been cut so deep but I can't make it bleed
I was caught with my head in the sand
When the world came knocking
I feel the big beat, the Rock Of Life
Big beat talk to me
Hey! Whoo!
I feel the back beat, the Rock Of Life
Waking up blind with the house on fire
It ain't no perfect life
This one I'm living in
And I was caught with my guard down
When the world came knocking
I feel the big beat, the Rock Of Life
Big beat talk to me
Hey! Whoo!
I feel the back beat, the Rock Of Life
Waking up blind with the house on fire
