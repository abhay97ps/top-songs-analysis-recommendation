Sometime I think what turned her on
Was my old broke down boots
She wanted her a real cowboy
It was a phase she was goin' through
But not one week after she moved in
I caught her paintin' the bedroom blue
She brought home a bottle of pink Chablis
And poured out my best brew
I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
While she packed her things to leave
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me
She changed direction headed out west
Changed her tune to some hip-hop mess
Her dark brown hair went blonde
And her pretty blue eyes went green
She changed everything when she couldn't change me
She was sittin' beside the ocean
Looking out at the waves
Watching how they keep on rollin'
But always seem the same
She called and said she'd been thinkin' about
All those quiet country nights
And whatever she thought was so wrong with me
Suddenly seemed all right
I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
When her truck pulled into view
She said I changed my mind when I couldn't change you
She changed direction headed back home
She changed her tune it's all Haggard and Jones
She had her dark brown hair pulled back
And blue eyes like you've never seen
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me
She said I guess when you love someone you just gotta let it be
Yeah, she changed her mind when she couldn't change me
