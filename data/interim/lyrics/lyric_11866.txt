I hear you found a brand new friend
Well if I try to take you back again
I finally decided to make amends
Don't let me in
You know I've got the be inside
Don't you listen when you hear me cry
Not even just to say good bye
Don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I never want to do you harm
Pay no head to all my false alarms
If I should come with pleading arms
Don't let me in
You hear me knocking on your door
A pounding of a heart you can't ignore
Soon it isn't there anymore
Don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
