I am, I am
Lord, who will be with you
Every day, all the way, come what may
Your story may go through
Thick and thin and back again
I'm gonna hang right in
I said I am, I am, I am, I am
Oh baby, I am, I am, I am, I am
You can bet your life I am, yeah
Lord, who'll be standin' by
Prepared to take some heartache for your sake
Can you dig that, baby?
What kind of fool am I
When rising up, take it into your cup
When the going gets rough
Can you dig that, mama?
I said I am, I am, I am, I am
Oh baby, I am, I am, I am, I am
You can bet your life I am, yeah
And if the world don't like it
I don't give a damn
Why do you give your love
And like a flower age through every stage
Of youth and age
Can you dig that, baby?
What of the life give you
Realize your dream
Though it may seem a little too extreme
Can you dig that, mama?
I said I am, I am, I am, I am
Oh baby, I am, I am, I am, I am
You can bet your life I am, yeah
And if the world don't like it
I don't give a damn
I am, I am I am
I am I am I am, I am
Oh baby, I am I am I am
Oh, you bet your life I am
And if the world don't like it
I don't give a damn
