It's summertime summertime sum sum summertime
Summertime summertime sum sum summertime
Summertime summertime sum sum summertime
Summertime summertime sum sum summertime summertime...
Well shut them books and throw 'em away
And say goodbye to dull school days
Look alive and change your ways
It's summertime...
Well no more studying history
And no more reading geography
And no more dull geometry
Because it's summertime
It's time to head straight for them hills
It's time to live and have some thrills
Come along and have a ball
A regular free-for-all
Well are you comin' or are you ain't
You slow poke are my one complaint
Hurry up before I faint
It's summertime
Well I'm so happy that I could flip
Oh how I'd love to take a trip
I'm sorry teacher but zip your lip
Because it's summertime
Well we'll go swimmin' every day
No time to work just time to play
If your folks complain just say
"It's summertime"
And every night we'll have a dance
Cause what's a vacation without romance
Oh man this jive gets me in a trance
Because it's summertime
Chorus
It's summertime
It's summertime summertime sum sum summertime
Summertime summertime sum sum summertime
Summertime summertime sum sum summertime
Summertime summertime sum sum summertime
Summertime
It's summertime
