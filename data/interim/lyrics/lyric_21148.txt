Haha, not again
Oh, this ain't supposed to happen to me
Keep rocking, and keep knocking
Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they're serving on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did 
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, our kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around
And you knocked me down, knocked me down
Sometimes, love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes, love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
I never thought I'd hear myself say 
"Y'all go 'head" 
"I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today"
I used to be commander-in-chief
On my pimp ship, flying high 
'Til I met this pretty little missile 
That shot me out the sky 
Hit, so now, I'm crashing 
But I know it feels so good
Said if I could go back and 
Don't you know I would, baby, if I could? 
Miss Independent 
The load never too much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life 
I swear to you, the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl, sometimes, love...
Sometimes, love comes around 
Oh, it comes around
And it knocks you down 
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Ooh, when it knocks you down, oh 
Sometimes, love comes around 
Comes around
And it knocks you down 
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Knocks you down
Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
That seemed to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby; we just happened
So, please, don't mess up the trick
"Hey Young World," I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice?
OMG, you listen to that bitch?
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying; now, I'm crashing 
This is bad, real bad—Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad—Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'ma ask him
So you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
And let it bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
 I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
 And if it hits better make it worth the fall
When it comes around, hey
Sometimes love comes around
Comes around, whoa
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Get back up when it knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around 
When love comes around
And it knocks you down 
Just get back up when it knocks you down
Knocks you down 
Knocks you down
Won't see it coming when it happens 
But when it happens 
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down
Oh, no, when it knocks you down
Won't see it coming when it happens 
But when it happens 
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now 
You see when love comes and knocks you down
Yeah
