Oh, baby
Do it, baby
Dancin', dancin', dancin'
She's a dancin' machine
Ah, babe
Move it, baby 
Automatic, systematic 
Full of color, self-contained 
Tuned and channeled to your vibes  
Captivating, stimulating 
She's such a sexy lady 
Filled with space-age design 
She's movin', she's groovin'
Dancin' until the music stops now
Yeah-yeah 
Rhythamatic, acrobatic 
She's a dynamite attraction 
At the drop of a coin, she comes alive 
Ye-eah 
She knows what she's doin' 
She's super bad now 
She's geared to really blow your mind 
Dancin', dancin', dancin'
She's a dancin' machine
Oh, baby
Do it, baby
Dancin', dancin', dancin'
She's a dancin' machine
Oh, baby
Move it, baby
She's a dance, dance, dance dance, dancin' machine
Watch her get down, watch her get down
As she do, do, do her thing
Right on the scene
She's a dance, dance, dance dance, dancin' machine
Watch her get down, watch her get down
As she do, do, do her thing
Right on the scene
Come on baby 
Come on babe 
Ooh baby 
Ooh baby 
Shake it baby 
Shake it babe 
Ooh baby
