Sun arise, she bring in the morning
Sun arise, bring in the morning
Fluttering the skirts all around
Sun arise, she come with the dawning
Sun arise, come with the dawning
Spreading all the light all around
Sun arise, on the kangaroo paw
Sun arise, on the kangaroo paw
Glistening the dew all around
Sun arise, filling all the hollows
Sun arise, filling all the hollows
Lighting up the hills all around
Sun arise, come with the dawning
Sun arise, she come every day
Sun arise, bring in the morning
Sun arise, every-every-every-every-day
She drive away the darkness
Every day, drive away the darkness
Bringing back the warmth to the ground
Sun arise, ohh-oh!
Sun arise, ohh-oh!
Spreading all the light all around
Sun arise, bring in the morning
Sun arise, bring in the morning
Sun arise, bring in the morning
Spreading all the light all around
