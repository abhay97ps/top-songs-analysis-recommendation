Yield not to temptation
Oh my love, while I am away
Don't you know you gotta be strong?
Leave all other guys alone
One fine sunny day
I'll be back home to stay
Yield not to temptation
And then no one lead you astray
So many times you gonna be lonely
So many times you gonna be blue
But yield not, yield not yeah
Oh, yield not, yield not
Don't you know you gotta be strong?
Leave all other guys alone
One fine sunny day
Oh, I'll be back home to stay
Yield not to temptation, oh
So many times you gonna be lonely
So many times you gonna be blue
Yield not, yield not
Oh yeah, yield not
Don't you know you gotta be strong?
Leave all other guys alone
One fine sunny day
I'll be back home to stay
Yield not to temptation
Yield not to temptation
Yield not to temptation
