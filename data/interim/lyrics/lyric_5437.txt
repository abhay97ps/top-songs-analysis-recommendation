Don't cry my love, I'll be back
Don't cry my sister, now that's no way to act
I'm goin' to war, and find the brother
Bring him home safe, for our worried mother
Come on now
Don't cry my love, you just be true
Keep your mind on things more important to do
Keep on smiling and spark others to fight
For our respect and our long overdue free human right
I can see no reason for our fighting this time
So many have gone and it's a shame and a crime
So much wrongdoing here I pretend not to see
But it makes me sometimes wonder
Everybody's free here but me
Well, come on now
Don't cry my love, I'll be back
Don't cry my sister, now that's no way to act
I'm goin' to war to find my long lost brother
Bring him home safe for our worried mother
Come on now
Don't cry my love, you just be true
Keep your mind on things more important to do
Keep on smiling and spark others to fight
For our respect and our long overdue free human right
Oh baby, don't worry about me
There will come a time when we'll long to be free
Keep a smiling
