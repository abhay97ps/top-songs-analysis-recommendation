Nightmare!
Now your nightmare comes to life
Dragged ya down below, down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever 
Hate to twist your mind, but God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed 
Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal 
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning pull the trigger
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare
While your nightmare comes to life
Can't wake up in sweat, 'cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons 
Beyond the will to fight, where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason 
You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel 
So sedated as they medicate your brain
And while you slowly go insane they tell you:
"Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications"
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare, ha, ha, ha, ha
Fight , not to fail , not to fall 
Or you'll end up like the others
Die , die again , drenched in sin 
With no respect for another, oh!
Down , feel the fire , feel the hate 
Your pain is what we desire
Lost , hit the wall , watch you crawl 
Such a replaceable liar
And I know you hear their voices 
And I know they may seem real 
But our life's made up of choices 
They took for granted your soul
And it's ours now to steal
As your nightmare comes to life
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare
