Everyone that I can see is gettin' right in tow
Changin' songs to be on the radio
Now there are things that I believe in
I'd never sell my soul
It always feels so good to hear good music
I need good music--Good good music
It always feels so good to hear good music
How can I get back to you when I'm so far from home
In any port or foreign shore-alone
So many ways to be betrayed believe me when I say
I think that I would die without good music
I need good music--Good good music
It always feels so good to hear good music
I know that I would die without good music
I need good music--Good good music
It always feels so good to hear good music
I know that I would die without good music
And even though you might think it's funny
I couldn't care if there ain't no money
I'm a little mixed up
But I'll be alright
If I can hear a loud guitar all night
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I need good music--Good good music
It always feels so good to hear good music
It always feels so good to hear good music
