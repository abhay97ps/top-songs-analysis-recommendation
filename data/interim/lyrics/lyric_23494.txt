Tuesday night, crowded bar
Some guy lights a cheap cigar
Bartender yells at him
So he walks out and you walk in
Right through that cloud of smoke
Catcalls and dirty jokes
Scan the room a couple times
Find a seat right next to mine
Lonely eyes, well it sure looks like
You just might be looking for something
For something, whoa oh oh oh
Look at me and I think you'll see
Those lonely eyes don't have to be alone tonight
They analyze your glass of wine
Roll away a pickup line
Now and then they check your phone
Catch mine and let 'em go
From the little bit I've seen
They're the perfect shade of green
Next time they come my way
Heaven help me, make 'em stay
Lonely eyes, well it sure looks like
You just might be looking for something
For something, whoa oh oh oh
Look at me and I think you'll see
Those lonely eyes don't have to be alone tonight
Don't make me pay my tab, catch a cab
Go home and kick myself to sleep tonight
Gimme a sign, just a smile
Baby, I'll be glad to lose myself deep inside
Lonely eyes
Lonely eyes, sure looks like
You just might be looking for something
For something, whoa oh oh oh
Look at me and I think you'll see
Those lonely eyes don't have to be alone tonight
Lonely eyes, you don't have to be alone tonight
