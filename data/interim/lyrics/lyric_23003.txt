Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n' roll
I don't care about my makeup
I like it better with my jeans all ripped up
Don't know how to keep my mouth shut
You say "So what?" 
I don't care if I'm a misfit
I like it better than the hipster bullshit
I am the motherfuckin' princess
You still love it 
Some-somehow, it's a little different when I'm with you
You know what I really am all about
You know how it really goes 
Some-some way, we'll be getting out of this town one day
You're the only one that I want with me
You know how the story goes 
When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
What if you and I
Just put up a middle finger to the sky?
Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll
Hey, hey, hey
Rock 'n' roll
Hey, hey, hey
Call it a bad attitude, dude
I'm never gonna cover up that tattoo
I might have a couple issues
You say, "Me too" 
Don't care about a reputation 
Must be living in the wrong generation
This is your invitation
Let's get wasted 
Some-somehow, it's a little different when I'm with you
You know what I really am all about
You know how the story goes 
When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
What if you and I
Just put up a middle finger to the sky?
Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll
Hey, hey, hey
Rock 'n' roll
Hey, hey, hey
Rock 'n' roll
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
What if you and I
Just put up a middle finger to the sky?
Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n' roll
When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
What if you and I
Just put up a middle finger to the sky?
Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll
Hey, hey, hey
Rock 'n' roll
Hey, hey, hey
