I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it; baby, stay with me
Love the game intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
I'll get him hot, and show him what I've got
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
I'll get him hot, and show him what I've got
Can't read my
Can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
I wanna roll with him
A hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me
Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun
And, baby, when it's love, if it ain't rough, it isn't fun
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot and show him what I've got
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh, I'll get him hot
Show him what I've got
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
I won't tell you that 
Kiss or 
Cause I'm  with my 
I'm not 
I'm just 
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I am marvelous
I'm marvelous
I'm marvelous
I'm marvelous
So marvelous
She's got to love nobody
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
