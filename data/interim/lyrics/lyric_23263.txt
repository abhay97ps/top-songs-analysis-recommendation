Oh, babe
I don't wanna lie
I'm gonna take what you're giving
Cause I know you're willing
To take me all the way
You got me right here
Combustible, and I can't wait to finally explode
The big, big bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide
In this universe inside
The big, big bang
The big, big bang
The big, big bang
Some people like to talk
But I'm into doing what I feel like doing when I'm inspired
So if we take a walk down the beach tonight
I bet that we could light up the sky
The big, big bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide
In this universe inside
The big, big bang
The big, big bang
The big, big bang
Take it from me, I don't wanna be mummified
Sometimes I feel so isolated, I wanna die
And I'll take it from you if you got it every time
So baby, bring your body here next to mine, next to mine
When I don't wanna a thing, I just wanna live it
So baby, let's not miss this thing
The big, big bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide
In this universe inside
The big, big bang
The big, big bang
The big, big bang
The Big, big, big bang
Oh, babe
Oh, babe
Oh, babe
