Pretend my kisses are new
As perfect strangers would do
Why should a word or two
In anger mean goodbye
We shared so many dreams
How can we let them die
While tender memories remain
Or face a lifetime of pain
Oh, I just can't go on without you
Now you know how I feel about you
So don't break my heart
And let's start over again
Pretend my kisses are new
As perfect strangers would do
Oh, I just can't go on without you
Now you know how I feel about you
So don't break my heart
And let's start over again
