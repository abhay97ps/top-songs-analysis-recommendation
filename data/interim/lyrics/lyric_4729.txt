La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
There are times in this life of mine
I think that the sun forgot how to shine
But as long as you're always there
It don't bother me 'cause why should I care
When all I've gotta do
Is run to you
Even the bad times are good
Soon as I get to you baby
You just gotta hold me
And even the bad times are good
Even the bad times are good
Soon as I get to you baby
You just gotta kiss me
And even the bad times are good
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
When the day seems to drag along
And all that I do is workin' out wrong
Still I find that I never cry
As long as I know that you're standing by
Then all I've gotta do
Is run to you
Even the bad times are good ..
