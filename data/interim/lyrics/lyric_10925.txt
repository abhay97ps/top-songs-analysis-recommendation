Every night the sun goes down
All alone my room gets dark
I wish I could shut down
This feeling in my heart
I got no chance of loving you
No chance at all
I got no chance of loving you
No chance at all
I hate it when you come my way
But I hate when you leave me too
I'm hooked, I know that look
There's nothing I can do
I got no chance of loving you
No chance at all
I got no chance of loving you
No chance at all
I'm a hard boy to beat
I get back on my feet
But I better go home
And leave that girl alone
I got no chance of loving you
No chance at all
I got no chance of loving you
No chance at all
