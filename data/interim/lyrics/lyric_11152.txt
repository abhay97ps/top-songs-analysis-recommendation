Sometimes it seems like
I just can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
You and I are as close as two is two three
And we're growing closer together
We found that magic seed, better than love
And it will grow forever and ever
:
Every day love grows 
Deeper and deeper
I just want to get inside of you
Oh, I wanna be more than a part of you
'Cause loving you the way that I do
Our love is like a house on a firm foundation
That's standing on solid ground
We build a wall of love and trust all around us
And no one can tear it down
Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
Seems like I just 
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you 
Because I love you so much
Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
It seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
