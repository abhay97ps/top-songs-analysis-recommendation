Beauty can be sad
You're proof of that
When the damage is done
You're damaged goods
That's not to say it's not okay
I wouldn't have it any other way
A heart, a heart that hurts
Is a heart, a heart that works
A heart, a heart that hurts
Is a heart, a heart that works
Sweet, sweet pain comes with the sun
Lie down and soak it up
Burn off layers of insulators
Exposed
Nose to the cold
I'm bleeding pretty colors
Yeah, all over myself
A heart, a heart that hurts
Is a heart, a heart that works
A heart, a heart that hurts
Is a heart, a heart that works
Black wave comes to take me away
I ride it almost to the grave
Landing on a crowded shore
High-fiving
What a trip, I'm better for it
I feel a live sensation
A heart, a heart that hurts
Is a heart, a heart that works
A heart, a heart that hurts
Is a heart, a heart that works
A heart, a heart that hurts
Is a heart, a heart that works
A heart, a heart that hurts
Is a heart, a heart that works
