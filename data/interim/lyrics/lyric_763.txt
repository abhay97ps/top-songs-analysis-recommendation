Well, I was rollin' down the highway
See my baby, Ruth
Car broke down, tire blew out
Found a telephone booth
I tried to call my honey
What was the sound I had to hear
 in my ear?
It's some endless yakkin' hound dog
Hawkin' and sweet talkin' to my dear
Central seven
Who's on that line?
Break through to my baby
Three-o-ninety-nine
Oh, S.O.S., sweet mama
Switch me to Heaven, get me through
Telephone operator
Our lovin' future hangs on you
 Hang on
Central seven
Who's on that line?
Break through to my baby
Three-o-ninety-nine
Oh, S.O.S., sweet mama
Switch me to Heaven, get me through
Telephone operator
My lovin' future hangs on you
Come on, honey 
Get my baby 
Come on, sugar 
Get me honey 
Talk to me, baby 
Come on, honey 
Get my baby
