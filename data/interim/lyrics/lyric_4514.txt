Here I am, stuck on this couch scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah
Waking up to headlines, filled with devastation again
My heart is broken, but I keep going
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it, yeah, I know it
You can't take my faith away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my faith away x2
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my faith away
I won't lie to you cuh that's not me
Catch me chilling on my own in the mosque b
And I don't say that to think that I'm pious
I'm just painting you a picture so I gotta do it properly
My heart done broken when Twon died
Can't lie, feel like God took the wrong guy
So more time I'm just chilling on my Jack Jones
Couple shows in Toronto then I'm back home
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it, yeah, I know it
You can't take my faith away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my faith away x2
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my faith away
Who cares about the haters and what they on
I'm too busy tryna swing it out with Shaytan
Cuh these girls wanna burst through my door
Telling em that I'm married don't even work any more
On the road to heaven, need to go through hell
If you wanna know God, you need to know yourself
Know this and notice how the thorns only gather round the roses
You can't take my faith away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my faith away x2
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my faith away x2
