You keep telling me you want me
Hold me close all through the night
And I know, that deep inside, you need me
No one else can make it right
Don't you try to hide your secrets
I can see it in your eyes
You said the words without speaking
Now I'm gonna make you mine
Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche
I'll give you the time of your life
Your rustic passion makes me crazy
Your existence makes me wild
I wanna loosen up your feelings
See what's hiding inside
Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche 
I'll give you the time of your life
Ay, que rico, me pone loca
Como te mueves, como me toca
Tu movimiento, tu sentimiento
Si yo te quiero, te doy la noche
Toda la noche, ay, vamos
Give me just one night 
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night 
I'll give you the time of your life 
Give me just one night
Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side 
Give me just one night, una noche 
I'll give you the time of your life
Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side 
Give me just one night, una noche
I'll give you the time of your life
Yeah, ooh yeah, oh
Ooh yeah
