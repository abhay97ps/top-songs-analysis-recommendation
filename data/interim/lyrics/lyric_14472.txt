This jam is way out, way out
You fake MC's are on your way out
Way out
Too bad you're on your way out
This is a way out jam 
For some way out girls 
The ones that are constantly
Rocking your world
With the hyper cuts 
And the slamming beats  
That make you other girls sound oh so weak
But that's O.K
We know how it is
J.J. Fad reigns supreme in the rapping biz
I've got something to say
I'm kinda mad
This is coming from
The one and only J.J. Fad
You may try to bag 
You may try to diss 
That just lets us know who's running this
Yeah
We're getting stupid 
And there's no doubt
That this here jam
Is just so way out
Sassy
We're busting the charts 
Every week
And we'll stay on top
And you know that we are freaks
We're here to please 
So get on your knees 
And pray to be like us
Before you take your Z's
We have a classy style 
That's worth your while
So sit back and relax
And let us get you riled
Now that you know
What we're talking about
Then you too can be way out
The W is for wild
The A is amazing
The Y is for you suckas that are perpetrating
The O is for outstanding
And the U is for unique
The T is for too bad
Your jam is so, so weak
