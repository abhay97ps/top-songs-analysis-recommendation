I believed in you
Thought what you said was true
It didn't occur to me
It was a lie
Ha ha ha, silly wasn't I, oh
I was lost in a world
And like a foolish girl
I really thought
You were my guy, oh
Ha ha ha, silly wasn't I, oh
I remember the time
You called me on the phone
Said you'd had a busy day
You'd hurry home
I waited, I waited
Time went by
I tried to laugh
But all i could do was cry
Silly, silly  wasn't I
Oh wasn't I silly
To think I'd found the love
I was dreaming of
I never thought you would say goodbye
Ha ha ha 
Oh, wasn't I silly 
To think that you loved me 
Oh wasn't I silly, oh 
Ha ha ha, silly
