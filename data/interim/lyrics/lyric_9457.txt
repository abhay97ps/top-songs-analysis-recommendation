I can't stand to wait a minute longer
There must be some way to let you know
My love is ready
My heart is beating fast
I'm growing weaker
And I don't know
How long I can last
I can't stand to hear
This early morning
Tossing pebbles
At your window pane
I'm trying to wake you
I'm tired so all alone
I've got to see you
And I won't believe
That you're not home
Wake up, Susan, don't you know
What you're missing? I'm right here
Wake up, Susan, don't you know
What you're missing? I'm right here
I'm right here
I can't wait to put
My arms around you
Only if it's for a little while
My body's aching
I want you oh so bad
Why can't you hear me?
If you'd just wake up
I'd be so glad
Wake up, Susan, don't you know
What you're missing? I'm right here
Wake up, Susan, don't you know
What you're missing? I'm right here
I'm right here
