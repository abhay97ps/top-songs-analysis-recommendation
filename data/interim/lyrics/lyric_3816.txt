ROEDER: The Führer is not accustomed to being ignored, Herr Schmidt. He funds your research because you promised him weapons. You serve at his pleasure. He gave you this facility as reward for your injuries.
JOHANN SCHMIDT: Reward, call it what it is, exile. I no longer effect his image of Aryan perfection.
ROEDER: You think this is about appearances? Your HYDRA division has failed to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year and we have learned through local intelligence that you have mounted a full scaled incursion into Norway.
SCHNEIDER: The Führer fears... How does he put it? The Red Skull has been indulged long enough!
JOHANN SCHMIDT: Gentlemen. You have come to see the results of our work, hmm? Let me show you.  Hitler speaks of a thousand year Reich, but he cannot feed his army for month. His troops spill their blood across every field in Europe. But he is still no closer to achieving his goals.
ROEDER: And I suppose you still aim to end this war through magic?
JOHANN SCHMIDT: Science, but I understand your confusion. Great power has always baffled primitive men. HYDRA is assembling an arsenal to destroy my enemies in one stroke. Wherever they are, regardless of how many forces they possess. All in a matter of hours.
ROEDER: Your enemies?
JOHANN SCHMIDT: My weapons contain enough destructive power to decimate every hostile capital on earth. Quite simply, gentlemen, I have harnessed the power of the Gods.
SCHNEIDER: Thank you, Schmidt.
JOHANN SCHMIDT:: For what?
SCHNEIDER: For making it clear how obviously mad you are.
HUTTER: Berlin is on this map!
JOHANN SCHMIDT: So it is.
HUTTER: You will be punished for your insolence. You will be brought before the Führer and-
JOHANN SCHMIDT: My apologies, Doctor. But we both knew HYDRA could grow no further in Hitler's shadow. Hail HYDRA!
SCIENTISTS: Hail HYDRA!
Dr. ARNIM ZOLA: Hail HYDRA!
STEVE ROGERS: Think you got enough?
PEGGY CARTER: Any hope of reproducing a is locked in your genetic code. But without Dr. Erskine it will take years.
STEVE ROGERS: He deserved more than this.
PEGGY CARTER: If it could only work once, he'd be proud it was you.
SSR AGENT: Colonel Phillips, my committee is demanding answers.
Col. CHESTER PHILLIPS: Great, why don't we start with how a German spy got a ride to my secret installation in your car?  What do we got here?
HOWARD STARK: Speaking modestly I'm the best mechanical engineer in this country... but I don't know what's inside this thing or how it works. We're not even close to this technology.
SSR AGENT: Then who is?
Col. CHESTER PHILLIPS: HYDRA, I'm sure you've been reading our briefings.
SENATOR BRANDT: I'm on a number of committees, Colonel.
PEGGY CARTER: HYDRA is the Nazi deep science division. It's led by Johann Schmidt, but he has much bigger ambitions.
Col. CHESTER PHILLIPS: HYDRA's practically a cult. They worship Schmidt, they think he's invincible.
SENATOR BRANDT: So what are you gonna do about it?
Col. CHESTER PHILLIPS: Spoke to the president this morning. As of today the SSR is being retasked.
PEGGY CARTER: Colonel?
Col. CHESTER PHILLIPS: We are taking the fight to HYDRA. Pack your bags Agent Carter. You too, Stark. You're flying to London
tonight.
STEVE ROGERS: Sir, if you're going after Schmidt, I want in.
Col. CHESTER PHILLIPS: You're an experiment. You're going to Alamogordo.
STEVE ROGERS: The serum worked.
Col. CHESTER PHILLIPS: I asked for an army and all I got was you. You are not enough.
SENATOR BRANDT: With all due respect to the Colonel, I think we may be missing the point. I've seen you in action, Steve and more importantly, the country's seen it.  Paper!  The enlistment lines have been around the block since your picture hit the news stands. You don't take a soldier, a symbol like that and hide him in a lab. Son, you want to serve your country on the most important battlefield of the war?
STEVE ROGERS: Sir, that's all I want.
SENATOR BRANDT: Then congratulations. You just got promoted.
STEVE ROGERS: I don't know if I can do this.
BRANDT'S AIDE: Nothing to it. Sell off a few bonds, bonds buy bullets, bullets kill Nazis. Bing bang boom. You're an American hero.
STEVE ROGERS: It's just not how I pictured getting there.
BRANDT'S AIDE: The senator's got a lot of pull up on the hill. You play ball with us, you'll be leading your own platoon in no time. Take the shield. 
SINGING LADIES: Who's strong and brave, here to save the American way?
STEVE ROGERS:  Not all of us can storm a beach or drive a tank, but there's still a way all of us can fight.
SINGING LADIES: Who vows to fight like a man for whats right, night and day?
STEVE ROGERS: Series E Defense bonds. Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy's gun.
SINGING LADIES: Who will campaign door-to-door for America? Carry the flag shore to shore for America. From Hoboken to Spokane. The Star Spangled Man, with the plan.
DIRECTOR: Cut! All right, don't look at the camera.
SINGING LADIES: We can't ignore there's a threat and a war we must win.
STEVE ROGERS:  Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guys gun.
SINGING LADIES: Who'll hang the noose on the goose-stepping goons from Berlin? Who will redeem, heed the call for America? Who'll rise or fall, give his all for America? Who's here to prove that we can? The Star Spangled Man with a plan!
STEVE ROGERS: We all know it's about trying to win the war. We can't do that without bullets and bandages, tanks and tents.  That's where you come in. Every bond you buy will help someone you love.
KIDS: Turn around! He's right behind you!
STEVE ROGERS: The Germans will think twice about trying to get the drop on us.
