We go out skating
On ice slowly melting in
Someday I think we're gonna drown
You're your own person
Just the same way that I am
So sometimes we get each other down
Then I replace you with a breaking body
A pretty face
But no mind
And I found feeling coming back to me
And I think I love again
Dancing together on thin lines of parting
Weighing the future all alone
One girl I'm where is forever
Is it somewhere in the sky
Or just a place you call home
Sometimes while smiling
In the middle of the night child
As I taste this stranger's kiss
Oh, I miss you, baby
Feel it coming back to me
And I found feeling coming back to me
And I think, I love you again
Baby, I know I love you again
Sometimes while smiling
In the middle of the night chat
As I keep this stranger's kiss
I miss you, baby
Feel it coming back to me
And I think
I think I love you again
I think, I love
I love you again
Baby, I think
I think I love you again
Don't you know I love
I know love you again
