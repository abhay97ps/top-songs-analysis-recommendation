Sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows
Everything that's wonderful is what I feel when we're together
Brighter than a lucky penny
When you're near the rain goes, disappears, dear
And I feel so fine just to know that you are mine
My life is sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows
That's how this refrain goes, so come on, join in everybody!
Sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows
Everything that's wonderful is sure to come your way
When you're in love to stay
Sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows

That's how this refrain goes, so come on, join in, everybody!
Sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows
Everything that's wonderful is sure to come your way
'Cause you're in love
You're in love
And love is here to stay!
