Ahhh
This ain't no love song girl
Wow wow wow
This is for the G's, the bedroom G's
If you wanna to take me home
You better make me moan and groan, 
If you wanna to take me home
Your better make me groan and moan, 
If you need it, need it, need it
It's right here
All you have to do is ask
Have no fear
I will show, show you, show you, 
What I can do 
And if you still don't believe
Thats cool
You fool
But you gotta wet me up and wet me down
I can do it 
Then you gotta dry me up with some foreplay
Any problem
I can solve it
Push it, work it, hurt it, all night, all night, all day
Show me how you love a woman
Till the morning light 
If you wanna take me home you better make me groan and moan 
If you wanna take me home you better make me moan 
Gonna moan
If you wanna take me home you better make moan
Make me moan
If you wanna take me home you better make me groan
Cos I told her, told her, told her 
What I've got
If you want to come and see
Just open my drawers 
Cos I've got, got it, got it, got it, going on, going on
And baby
If you dare to play
Lets just go my place
You'd better lick me up and lick me down
I will lick you
Then you gotta rub me up with some foreplay
Rub it on , rub it on 
Make it, break it, shake it, all night, all night, all night
Show me you can love a woman to the morning light, morning light
It's her night
If you wanna take me home you gotta make me moan 
If you wanna take me home you gotta make me groan 
If you wanna take me home you gotta make me moan 
Wow wow wow
Make me moan
Make me groan
Take me home
Yeah
Make me moan
Take me home

But you gotta lick me up and lick me down
I will lick you
Then you gotta rub me up with some foreplay
Rub it on, rub it on
Make it, break it, shake it, all night, all night, all night
Show me you can love a woman to the morning light, morning light
If you wanna take me home you better make me moan 
Repeat and fade
