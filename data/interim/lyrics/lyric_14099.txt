No sitting down on your butt
The world don't owe you
No sitting down in a rut
I wanna show you
Don't waste your energy
On making enemies
Just take a deep breath
And work your way up
Let's work, be proud
Stand tall, touch the clouds
Man and woman, be free
Let's work, kill poverty
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la)
Work your way up
Let's work, be proud
Stand tall, touch the clouds
Man and woman, be free
Let's work, kill poverty
You're sitting down on your butt
And you're get greedy
You start to lose your nuts
Don't you look seedy
Can generosity
Bring you humility?
So take a deep breath
Ain't gonna sweat for you
Ain't gonna sigh for you
Ain't gonna cry for you
If you're lazy
Ain't gonna slave for you
Ain't gonna hurt for you
It just won't work for you
If you're lazy, oh
Come on, come on
Let's work, be proud
Stand tall, touch the clouds
Let's work, let's eat
Let's live in ecstasy
Man and woman, be free
Let's work, kill poverty
Let's work, be proud
Stand tall, touch the clouds
Man and woman, be free
Let's work
Let's work
Get down, get down, get down
Get down in the dirt and let's work
Get down in the dirt and let's work
Get up, be free
Let's work, kill poverty
Get down in the dirt, let's work
Get down in the dirt, let's work
Get down in the dirt
Take off your shirt
Get down in the dirt
Now let's work, let's work
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
