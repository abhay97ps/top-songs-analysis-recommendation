Love can't wait so don't hesitate
When you feel it's touch, don't deny it, try it
Love can't wait, if it's your's don't be late
When it comes your way, don't forsake it, take it
For love is the ruler of all on earth
It can't be measured, not true love's worth
But love is free for you and for me
Let's take love, love, love
For love is the ruler of all on earth
It can't be measured, not true love's worth
But love is free for you and for me
Let's take love, love, love
