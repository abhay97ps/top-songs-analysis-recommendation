Here we go
Yo
A day in the life of a player named Quik
I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow with a head like a brick
And just because I drink the eight, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc-ness
Now this is how we do it when we checkin a grip
Teddy Bear is in the house, so don't even trip
We're bustin funky compositions as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick it to this funky ass rhythm
It's Friday morning, the phone is ringin' off the hook
And AMG is in the den reviewin' rhymes in his notebook
Or should I say dope sack, because we don't bust wack
I pick up the phone and it's the D 
He said he's comin' down about two on the dot
So I'm about to rush the tub while my water's still hot
And now I'm soakin', a brother like the devestatin' DJ Quik ain't jokin'
Fuck with me on DSP and you'll get broken
My name is Quik, but you can call me daddy
Yo, open up the door 'cause here come Freak-man in a Caddy
Now Freaky's in the El-Dog and Shabby's in the El-Co
And everybody's sippin on a quart 
D just came with a forty and a quart
In addition to the three that Greedy just bought
But I don't wanna start early, so I just might
Put my forty in the freezer 'cause I wanna get bent
Tonight
Tonight is the night 
Tonight
Tonight is the night
Tonight
Tonight is the night 
Tonight
Tonight is the night 
And now I'm out of the tub, I'm feelin' fancy free
Spray on some Xeryus and put on my Givenchy
Sweatsuit, the gray one with the burgundy trim
And it's a medium, fit me proper 'cause I'm nice and slim
Five thirty on the clock and the sun is steadily sinkin'
And I am steadily thinkin' about the eight that I'll be drinkin'
You know I ain't ashamed and you know I ain't bashful
So go on and pop the forty so I can pour me a glassful
Hamm is in the bedroom rollin' up a stencil
Fatter than a pinky and the length of a pencil
Freaky lit it up and hit it one, two, three
Shabby took a hit and then they pass it to me
Yo, I can feel my senses 
Yo, fuck the forty ounce 
I'm chillin' like a villain 
And that's how I'm livin'
Tonight is the night and I'm lookin' real sporty
Proper Friday evening, and I'm ready to party
Crusher came in with a handful of snaps
Fuck it, let's shoot some craps
 A fin or a half
 Don't make me laugh
Hi-C won a dub and he think that shit is funny
But I'm seven and eleven and I'm takin' niggas money
Tonight
Tonight is the night 
Tonight
Tonight is the night 
Tonight
Tonight is the night 
Tonight
Tonight is the night 
Tonight
Ahh yeah
Givin' em somethin they can roll on
Hold on
Wake up Saturday morning, and I got a headache
I can't believe that I'm sick from all the shit that I drank
Soon as I felt it comin' on, I shoulda quit
It's true that a drunk ain't shit
To the man up above to whom thanks I give
I'll never drink again if you just let me live
Mike P spoke to me and I said I couldn't call it
Callin' Earl like a mother while I'm grippin the toilet
I need a 7-Up, because my head is spinnin
Round and round, I think I better sit down
My homey Shot is alright, but I'm feeling faint
I guess he's used to it, but a nigga like Quik ain't
K is on the phone, and Teddy's at the door
And some fine ass bitches comin over at four
 Yeah right
Because as soon as they come, we doin' the same ol' shit tonight
Tonight
Tonight is the night 
Tonight
Tonight is the night 
Tonight
Tonight is the night 
Tonight
Tonight is the night 
Tonight
Tonight is the night 
Tonight 
Tonight is the night 
Tonight 
Tonight is the night
Tonight 
Tonight is the night 
Tonight 
To-To-To-Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
To-To-To-Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
To-To-To-Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
We out 
Fuck peace, nigga, give me another brew
