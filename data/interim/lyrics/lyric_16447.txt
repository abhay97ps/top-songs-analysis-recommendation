If your father says I can’t have your hand
And your mother feels that I’m not your man
And your sisters says she don’t like my style
And your brother feels that you’re still a child
Your friends always tell you that I’m a fool
But you and I both know that it’s not true
So it’s up to you to make up your mind
‘Cause I really don’t wanna waste my time
Oh, darlin’, we’re leavin’ 
I know we’ve got to get away from here 
We’ll go away and build a mansion 
Til no one know what we have for each other 
Let’s pack our bags and let’s leave, girl
I know that you really want to be with me
So don’t let them dictate how we’ll be
You know how it feels when we are alone
So girly you blow me like a saxophone
Girl, I like all your friends, now, don’t get me wrong
So stop, look, and listen before I’m gone
Our love is cock diesel and everyone knows
So let’s wave “bye bye” ‘cause we’re going on home
I know that we’re leavin’ 
But I know we can do much better 
There’s so many things we haven’t done 
I love the way we are together 
Ooh ooh ooh, baby, let’s go away, let’s go away 
We’ll come back and visit them some other day 
I love, I love, I love you to death 
Ooh baby, baby, baby, baby, please 
Girl, pack your bags and let’s go away
Going bye-bye…going bye-bye…going bye-bye
Girl, I know, I know we gotta leave 
Oh, I know we could leave and have so much fun 
We’ll go away and build a mansion 
Somewhere so far away no one could find us 
And if you really wanna leave, say yes
Just say yes
Going bye-bye
Going bye-bye; we’re leaving early in the morning, baby 
We’re leavin’, baby; tell all of your friends 
Tell ‘em we got another place on the other side of town 
We’re leavin’, baby; yes, we’re leavin’ 
Tell your little sister, tell your big brother, baby 
Tell everybody we’re going to another place 
Tell ‘em we’re leaving early in the morning 
We’re leavin’, baby, yeah yeah 
We’re going, going, going, going, gone 
We’re going, baby, yeah yeah yeah 
Tell your next door neighbor that we’re leavin’, leavin’, leavin’ 
Leavin’, leavin’, leavin’ 
Oh, I know I’m so glad about it; I know you’re so glad about it 
Oh, baby baby 
We’re going, going, going, going, going, going 
Going, going, going, going, going, going, going, going
Going, going, going, going 
Oh, bye-bye, bye-bye
