This is the real action: the pot party, the trippers, the grasshoppers, the hip ones
All gathered in secrecy and flying high as a kite
Hmm-hmm
Just know what this about
Hmm-hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Palm trees, oceans, fresh air, that can break your heart
Hmm-hmm 
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hm
Hmm-hmm 
Hmm-hmm 
Hmm-hmm 
Hmm-hmm 
Hmm-hmm 
Ride for it every night
Visions and these angles tight
Truth be told, I never try
Diamonds are the wife of life
All three Rollies look alike
After two you get a hook-up price
Stripper never worked a nine-to-five
Delta and I ship it overnight
Stop tryna be God Almighty
Fuck the money, never leave your people behind, yeah
It's never love, no matter what you try
Still can see it comin' down your eyes
'Cause they did not create commandments 
When you hustle, always make it fancy 
The signal's far from what you can be 
'Cause air traffic controls the landing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hmm-hmm 
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hm
Hmm-hmm 
Hmm-hmm 
Hmm-hmm 
Hmm-hmm 
Hmm-hmm 
Stop tryna play God Almighty
Always keep your circle tight
I been wantin' shit my whole life
I'm warning you, best not try to play God tonight
If I love her, I'ma pass on her
First rule of war, you find an act on her
You can't win a trophy or a plaque off her
But never turn your back on her
'Cause they did not create commandments
When you hustle, always make it fancy
The signal's far from what you can be
'Cause air traffic controls the landing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You won't succeed tryna learn me
Stick to the roads in my journey
Stay out of court when you got the attorney
She say she love but want to really burn me
Hmm-hmm 
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hm
Hmm-hmm 
Hmm-hmm 
Hmm-hmm 
Hmm-hmm 
Hmm-hmm 
Is it the complex of the saint
That's keepin' you so, so, so still, still?
Is it a coat of old paint
That's peelin' every day against our will?
Is it too long since the last
Open conversation you had? Oh, no
And did you see the void in the past?
And can you ever see it comin' back?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
That it?
