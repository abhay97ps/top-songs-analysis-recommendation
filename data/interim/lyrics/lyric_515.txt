Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Hoo-ah-ooh-ooh
I'm like a - rubber ball, baby that's all
That I am to you  
Just a rubber ball 'cuz you think you
Can be true to two  
You bounce my heart around 
And like a rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
If you - stretch my love 'til it's thin enough to tear
I'll just stretch my arms to reach you anywhere
And like a -
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
You bounce my heart around 
And like a rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Hoo-ah-ooh-ooh
Bouncy, bouncy ... bouncy, bouncy
Bouncy, bouncy... bouncy, bouncy
Eee-ah-eee-eee;
You bounce my heart around 
And like a rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Eee-eee-eee
I'm like a rubber band
When on my shoulder you do tap
Just a rubber band
Because my heartstrings, they just snap
You go and squeeze me till I'm all aflame
But like a rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
