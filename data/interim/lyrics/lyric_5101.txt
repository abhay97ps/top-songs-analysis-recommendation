Look at you baby look at me
So in love we used to be
But now it's just a memory
Baby, how'd we ever get this way
Tell me baby, how'd we ever get this way
Well I recall when things were fine
And every day the sun would shine
When I was yours and you were mine
Baby, how'd we ever get this way
Tell me baby, how'd we ever get this way
Remember how it used to was
Before the rovin' eye of love
Why does it do the way it does
Baby, how'd we ever get this way
Tell me baby, how'd we ever get this way
Time and time and time again
I wonder why it all began
Tell me how's it gonna end
Baby, how'd we ever get this way
Ba-la, la, la, la, la, la
Ba-la, la, la, la, la, la
Ba-la, la, la, la, la, la
Baby, how'd we ever get
Baby, how'd we ever get
Baby, how'd we ever get this way
Ba-la, la, la, la, la, la
Ba-la, la, la, la, la, la
Ba-la, la, la, la, la, la
