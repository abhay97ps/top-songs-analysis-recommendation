I got this beat runnin' 'round in my head, 'round in my head
Can't sleep got me pullin my hair, tossing in bed
I can't take it no more, please somebody stop this song
I got this beat runnin' 'round in my head, 'round in my head
Music is my life take it from me is like taking my soul
I knew every word to Bohemian Rhapsody at 2 years old
And I'll be singing it until mama mia let me go
Going ill sick nasty, gonorrhea on the flow
Got that fever burning slow steady rep Brooklyn
Looking fresher than brand new crazy like an unmanned zoo
Understan who I am  so
Say it three times with the lights out and it might sound like
What a fight sound like keep the lights off regretting what the sight might be
It is me smiling teeth whitening
My rhymes might not be good for your health and if you ain't feeling me well
I probably ain't feeling you neither so press your ears against the speakers
And blow your brains out oxy clean the stains out
Music is my weapon of choice but I'm not 5'9 like Royce
I still stand tall keep my held high look above it all
All the bullshit and the lies keep a temper mental state of mind
So throw your CDs in the crapper surpised that this cracker flow
Is better than your favorite rappers
History inevitable when I step in the vocal booth
My bars on beast mode you can call me Beowulf
My brain so inkredible but don't call me Trae the Truth
Look through the peep hole see you begging on my stoop
Please please put me on please please take me back
I know I did you wrong let's put it in the past
Girl don't make me act a ass because you acting like a fool
Take out your pen and paper because I'm taking you to school
Don't steal nobody's lyrics once I found that out knew you was a gimmick
Jumping Jimminy Cricket that ain't the business
Your bars they are so terrible mine heal and soothe like theraflu
I am so ahead of you I wrote this in 3002
Lurking like Plies and Flocka rolling out with all my dudes
MME Crankupondabeat turn up we making moves
Eating good and drinking bubbly
Case of that Dom P man that's nothing
Coupe with the fly feet now that stuntin
Swerve to the fly beat Mercy bumpin ah
