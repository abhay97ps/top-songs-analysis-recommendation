I just bought a bad bitch, dripped her in karats
Flyin' out to Paris , purests are the rarest
Different colored stones on the neck like a parish
Lookin' at the score, you can tell she ain't average
Put the bitch on, all the hoes be starin'
Had to hit the horsepower on 9-11
Ordered my garments and I'm gettin' mine, get it
Buyin' out the mall and I splash the baguettes
Thanks for that new morning, thanks for that new money
Thanks to my new bitch, she bringin' more bitches
Breakin' four-fours, and I'm gettin' my digits
Change wardrobes, gotta spend at least a milli' 
Make a rapper throw away a closet, yeah 
Nigga talk loud, but my money is the loudest 
Stackin' up, rackin' up, pilin' 
Flying with your girl off an island, yeah
I'm getting so much fuckin' money
I bossed up my bottom bitch, yeah, she litty, yeah
I got some Spanish lil' hotties calling me papi, I can't do nothing but win 
Transportation got this bitch in a trance 
Switch up the style and gave her some bands 
Fillin' the back of the Maybach with a MAC
Got enough capital to go and buy a jet
Add it up, add it up, count up a check
Made a bitch blow it up, sellin' hot mix
Shawty got three Glocks and a vest
Pourin' more lean, more money, more sex 
Pop half an X and I'm drinkin' Hi-Tech 
Iced out chains, keep 'em in my fridge 
Goin' to the moon, I'm a space cadet
On the strength of me, this bitch gettin' blessed
Bought a bad bitch, bought a bad bitch, bought a bad bitch, yeah
Bought a bad bitch, bought a bad bitch, bought a bad bitch, yeah
