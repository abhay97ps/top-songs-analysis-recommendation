I know how quickly love can slip away
Yes, I know how love can die, that's why I say
I'm gonna try with all my heart
To keep you happy so we'll never part because
I don't wanna lose you baby
I don't wanna lose you baby
I don't wanna lose you baby
No, no, no - no, no, no
I know how quickly hearts can lose their way
All along the road to love, when led astray
And that is why I'm gonna give
You all my love ev'ry day that I live because
I don't wanna lose you baby
I don't wanna lose you baby
I don't wanna lose you baby
No, no, no - no, no, no
Now that you've taught me the thrill of your kiss
Now that you've taught me to love you like this
I don't wanna lose you baby
I don't wanna lose you baby
I don't wanna lose you baby
No, no, no - no, no, no
