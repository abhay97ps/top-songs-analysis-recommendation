I've found piece of mind
I'm feeling good again
I'm on the other side
Back among the living
Ain't a cloud in the sky
All my tears have been cried
And I can finally say
Baby, Baby stay
Stay right where you are
I like it this way
It's good for my heart
I haven't felt like this
In God knows how long
I know everything's going to be okay
If you just stay gone
I still love you
And I will forever
We can't hide the truth
We know each other better
When we try to make it work
We both end up hurt
Love ain't supposed to be that way
Baby, Baby stay
Stay right where you are
I like it this way
It's good for my heart
I haven't felt like this
In God knows how long
I know everything's going to be okay
If you just stay gone
When we try to make it work
We both end up hurt
Love ain't supposed to be that way
So Baby, Baby stay
Stay right where you are
I like it this way
It's good for my heart
I haven't felt like this
Oh, In God knows how long
I know everything's going to be okay
If you just stay gone
I know everything's going to be okay
If you just stay gone...
