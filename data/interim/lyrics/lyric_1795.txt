When I go to sleep, I never count sheep, I count all the charms about Linda
And lately it seems in all of my dreams, I walk with my arms about Linda
But what good does it do me, for Linda doesn't know I exist
Can't help feeling gloomy, think of all the lovin I've missed
We pass on the street ,my heart skips a beat, I say to myself, hello, Linda
If only she'd smile I'd stop for a while, and then I would get to know Linda
But miracles still happen and when my lucky star begins to shine
With one little kiss, I'll make Linda mine
