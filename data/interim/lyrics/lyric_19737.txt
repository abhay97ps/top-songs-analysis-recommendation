Pressure!
Pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Bah bah dah bah bah dah
That's okay!
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends scream
Pressure on people
People on the streets
Bah bah dah bah bah dah
Okay!
Chipping around
Kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days
It never rains but it pours
Bah bah dah bah bah dah
People on streets
Bah dah dee da day
People on streets
Bah dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends scream
Pray tomorrow takes me higher 
Turned away from it all
Like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn
Why? Why? Why?
Love !
Love !
Love !
Insanity laughs under pressure
We're cracking
Why can't we give love, give love, give love?
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?
The edge of the night
And love dares you to change our ways
Of caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure
