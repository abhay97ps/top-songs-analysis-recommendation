I thought I spoke to you last evening
I woke up cryin' in my sleep
I dreamed that we were still together
But now I'm back out on the street
I've been runnin' so hard tryin' to find the place
Where my baby might be stayin'
I just gotta see her face
I know there's lots of lonely people
Cryin' all over the world
And this is just another story
About a boy who lost his girl
Well, I'm not expectin' changes to happen overnight
But baby, if you're listenin'
Won't you come home and make it right
Until your love comes back around
Until your love comes back around
I can't get my feet back on the ground
And things won't be the same
I hope you're thinkin' 'bout me, baby
Though I don't wish you any pain
But if you miss me like I miss you, darlin'
You must be livin' in the rain
I've been runnin' so hard tryin' to find the place
Where my baby might be stayin'
I just gotta see her face
Until your love comes back around
Until your love comes back around
I can't get my feet back on the ground
And things won't be the same
I hope you're thinkin' 'bout me, baby
Though I don't wish you any pain
If you miss me like I miss you, darlin'
You must be livin' in the ra-a-a-ain
Well, I know we haven't spoken much lately, Lord
But you gotta bring her back to me
I won't make any promises that I can't keep
But you know I'm a better man when I'm not alone, you see
Until your love comes back around
Until your love comes back around
I can't get my feet back on the ground, yeah
And things won't be the same 'til your love comes back around
Until your love comes back around
I can't get my feet back on the ground
And things won't be the same and I won't be the same
Ahhhhhh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
