Johnny loves me
He just told me so last night 
Now each star I see belongs to me
And they're all shining twice as bright 
Johnny loves me
Johnny's heart is really mine 
Love is everywhere and I could swear
The world's a great big valentine
I feel so pretty
I'm all aglow 
When he says I'm wonderful
He makes me feel it's so 
Yes, Johnny loves me
Now each day is bright and new 
And I only pray that I can say
For every day my whole life through
"Johnny loves me"
"And I love my Johnny, too"
Now each day is bright and new 
And I only pray that I can say
For every day my whole life through
"Johnny loves me"
"And I love my Johnny, too"
Johnny loves me 
Johnny loves me 
Johnny loves me 
Johnny loves me 
Johnny loves me
