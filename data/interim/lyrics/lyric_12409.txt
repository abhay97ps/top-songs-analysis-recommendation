Two broken hearts, neither one knows what to say
Both falling for love, but not quite all the way
Look at us now, reaching back to yesterday
Longing to know if they are the ones to stay
After all I'm the one who said we're through
Now I can't live without anymore
Out there lost is the dream that can't come true
Is it worth the reaching for?
Don't you want me anymore, darling?
Hold me till the morning comes
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the morning sun
Let me stay we've just begun
Where shall we start? Tender words that we can share
Different beliefs, in time we will get there
Look at us now, wanting more than words can say
Both falling for love but distant all the way
Out there lost are the words, I still love you
But they're worth the reaching for
Do you love me anymore, darling?
Hold me till the morning comes
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the morning sun
Let me stay we've just begun
Hold me till the morning comes
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the morning sun
Let me stay we've just begun
I wanna stay with you
Hold me till the morning comes
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the morning sun
Let me stay we've just begun
Would you love me in the morning?
We used to be there in the morning
Would you leave without a warning?
Say you love me too
Say you love me too
Say you love me too
