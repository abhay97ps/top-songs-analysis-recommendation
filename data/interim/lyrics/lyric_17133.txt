I love the way you look tonight
With your hair hanging down on your shoulders
And I love the way you dance your slow sweet tango
The way you wanna do everything but talk
And how you stare at me with those undress me eyes
Your breath on my body makes me warm inside
Let's make out - Let's do somthing amazing
Let's do somthing that's all the way
'Cause I've never touched somebody like the way I touch your body
Now I never wanna let your body go
Let's make a night, to remember
From January, to December
Let's make love, to excite us
A memory, to ignite us
Let's make honey baby, soft and tender
Let's make sugar darlin', sweet surrender
Let's make a night, to remember
All life long
I love the way you move tonight
Beads of sweat dripping down your skin
Me lyin' here - and you lyin' there
Our shadows on the wall and our hands everywhere
Let's make out - Let's do somthing amazing
Let's do somthing that's all the way
'Cause I've never touched somebody like the way I touch your body
Now I never wanna let your body go
Let's make a night, to remember
From January, to December
Let's make love, to excite us
A memory, to ignite us
Let's make honey baby, soft and tender
Let's make sugar darlin', sweet surrender
Let's make a night, to remember
All life long
Oh and I think about you all the time
Can't you see you drive me out of my mind
Well I'm never holding back again
Yeah I never want this night to end
'Cause I've never touched somebody like the way I touch your body
Now I never wanna let your body go
Let's make a night, to remember
From January, to December
Let's make love, to excite us
A memory, to ignite us
Yeah - Let's make honey baby, soft and tender
Ohh - Let's make sugar darlin', sweet surrender
Let's make a night, to remember
Oh - All life long
Yeah, Oh let's make out
Let's do somethin' amazin'
Let's do somethin' that's all the way
Every day - Yeah, oh
Let's make honey - Let's make sugar
Let's make a night, to remember - oh
Let's make love - Slow and tender
Let's make a night, to remember
