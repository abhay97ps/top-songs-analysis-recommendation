Whoa
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Here we go again
We're sick like animals
We play pretend
You're just a cannibal
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight
Whoa oh, I want some more
Whoa oh, what are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Whoa oh, I want some more
Whoa oh, what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's gettin heavy
And I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time
You're killin' me now 
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you
Whoa oh, I want some more
Whoa oh, what are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Whoa oh, I want some more
Whoa oh, what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
Hush hush the world is quiet
Hush hush we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
No, I won't sleep tonight
Whoa oh, I want some more
Whoa oh, what are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Whoa oh, I want some more
Whoa oh, what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin'
Here we go again 
Here we go again 
Here we go again 
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Whoa oh, I want some more
Whoa oh, what are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
