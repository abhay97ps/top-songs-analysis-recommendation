Come on over here my brand new baby
You look so alone and the night's so fine
Won't you take your trembling lips and kiss me one more time
Yeah, you're gonna do just fine
Oh that didn't hurt too bad, now did it
That shouldn't make you sad
'Cause it's only love you're running from
That didn't hurt too bad now did it
I'm gonna handle you like a baby
I'm gonna love you like you never knew
It'll be everything and more than you ever thought it could
You're gonna be so good
Oh that didn't hurt too bad, now did it
That shouldn't make you sad
'Cause it's only love you're running from
That didn't hurt too bad now did it
Wasn't it everything and more than you ever thought it could be
Baby you were so good
Oh that didn't hurt too bad, now did it
That shouldn't make you sad
'Cause it's only love you're running from
That didn't hurt too bad now did it
