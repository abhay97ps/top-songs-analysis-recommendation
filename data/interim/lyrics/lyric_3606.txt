Girl, you've been so good to me
Stayin' by my side through the bad times
All my dreams never came true somehow
But things are gonna be different now, baby
My ship is comin' in, baby, baby
My ship is comin' in
And won't it be fine?
Girl, we're gonna make it this time
You can throw away that shabby dress
Buy yourself the finest things in town, girl
Dry your eyes, we're celebratin'
Oh, there's so many good times awaitin', baby
My ship is comin' in, baby, baby
My ship is comin' in
And won't, won't it be fine?
Girl, we're gonna make it this time
I know it's been tough on you
But through it all you've been so true
Happy to be just lovin' me
And anything you want, it's yours 'cause, baby
My ship is comin' in, baby, baby
My ship is comin' in, baby, baby
My holy ship, I've been waitin' and it's comin'
Oh, can't you see it, baby?
Can't you feel the ship?
I know it's comin' in, yeah, yeah
Just for me and you
Everything we wanted
Everything we ever wanted is comin' in, yeah
So dry your eyes
