Part-time love is bringin' me down
'Cause I just can't get it started with you, my love
Did I hear you sayin' that I'm too hard-hearted
Wipe those stars from your eyes
And you'll get quite a surprise
Because you'll see everybody's got a part-time love
You've been seen runnin' around
There's not much I don't a-hear of, and a-still, you try
Tellin' me all the things I must stay clear of
Don't tell me what to do
When you been doin' it too
Because you, me and everybody's got a part-time love
Fallin', I'm fallin', can't get free
Baby, if you keep on stallin'
Oh, how can I make you see
That you, me and everybody needs a part-time love
Part-time love
I seem to be pullin' in the wrong direction with you, my love
Whatever I do, you raise the same objection
Now, I've got someone at home
But she's got a love of her own
Because you, me and everybody got a part-time love
I'm waitin', I'm waitin' all the time
And it's gettin' so frustratin'
Love, well it ain't no crime
Because you, me and everybody needs a part-time love
No, you, me and everybody's got a part-time love
No, you and me and everybody needs a part-time love
You, me, everybody got a part-time love
