Broken promises
But you don't really mind
It's not the first time
And you know it, don't you know?
Tell me why it is you only smile inside
But when you break me into nothing
Don't you know?
It's not like I haven't tried
Over and over again
Stupid fights
Wrong or right
Goodbye
I remember when you came with me that night
We said forever, that you would never let me go
But here I am again with nothing left inside
No, I don't wanna but I gotta let you go
You're the one mistake
I really didn't mind
So beautiful, unmerciful
It took me down
Too little and too late
So now I know your kind
You fake it easy, just to please me
Don't you know?
It's not like we haven't tried
Over and over again
Sleepless nights wrong or right
Goodbye
I remember when you came with me that night
We said forever, that you would never let me go
But here I am again with nothing left inside
No, I don't wanna but I gotta let you go
I gotta let you go...
It's you
There's nothing I can do
I remember when you came with me that night
You said forever
You said forever
You said forever
Here I am again
With nothing left inside
No I don't wanna but I gotta
Let you go
I remember when you came with me that night
We said forever, that you would never let me go
But here I am again with nothing left inside
No, I don't wanna but I gotta let you go
