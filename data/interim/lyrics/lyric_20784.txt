Together we made it
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall
See, a nigga survived the worst, but my life is glorious
Better know that I leaped every hurdle and I'm so victorious
Take a look, I'm a symbol of greatness
Now call a nigga Morpheus
As force securin' the win, better believe I'm so notorious
You know that I've been 'bout my bread
Even though we rappin' now 
And yes, we used to live on the strip
Even though a nigga higher level trappin' now 
Superseded every one of my little struggles and 
Failure has never ever been an option 
A nigga paper long like rush hour traffic
And I'm about to take the hood shoppin'; get it!
Oh, together we made it 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall
 Forever we waited 
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But we took it on the road 
On the road 
On the road 
On the road 
On the road 
On the road 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
When it all got started we were steadily just gettin' rejected
It seemed like nothin' we could do would ever get us respected
At best we were stressed
At the worst they probably said we're pathetic
Had all the pieces to that puzzle, just the way to connect it
I was fightin' through every rhyme, tightenin' up every line
Never restin' the question if I was out of my mind
It finally came time to do it or let it die
So we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride
Sing it, yeah!
Oh, together we made it 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall
 Forever we waited 
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But we took it on the road 
On the road 
On the road 
On the road 
On the road 
On the road 
Look, in case you misunderstand exactly what I'm buildin'
Shit that I can leave for my children's children's children's children
Now on my wake-up I smile to see how far I've come
Fightin' for sales on a strip to I gained the hustle from
From nights in jail on a bench usin' my muscles, son
To countin' money like Dre and Jimmy and Russell was
But now I live when I dream, you see we finally did it
Let's make a toast to the hustle regardless how you get it
Sing it!
Oh, together we made it 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall
 Forever we waited 
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But we took it on the road 
On the road 
On the road 
On the road 
On the road 
On the road 
Oh...
