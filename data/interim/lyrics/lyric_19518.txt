I watched him take the two strike call
He hadn't tried to swing at all
I guess he had all he could take
He walked away for goodness sake
His father's voice was loud and mean
"You won't amount to anything"
That little boy quit trying
He just walked away
There were tear drops on his face
Tell me how would you feel
You'd probably give up too
If nobody believed in you
That old man said, "One more try
I know I'm not too old to drive
I promise son, I'll do my best
This time I'm gonna pass the test"
"Give me the keys dad and get in"
His father never drove again
That old man quit trying
He just turned away
There were tear drops on his face
Tell me how would you feel
You'd probably give up too
If nobody believed in you
We take his name out of schools
The lawyers say it breaks the rules
Pledge of allegiance can not be read
And under God should not be said
I wonder how much he will take
I just pray it's not too late
What if God quit trying
He just turned away
There were tear drops on his face
Tell me how would you feel
You'd probably give up too
If nobody believed in you
Tell me how would you feel
You'd probably give up too
If nobody believed in you...
