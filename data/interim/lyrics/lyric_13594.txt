Have you heard the latest 
Have you seen who just walked in 
Right over there
I'm glad you've found someone who loves you
But sad to say that someone is you
And now perhaps you'll both be happy
Guess that makes two, just you and you
Someone who cares so much about you
But does that someone have to be you
Vanity kills, it don't pay bills
Vanity kills, you love you
Vanity kills, it don't pay bills
Vanity kills, it kills
So glad I found you glancing in the mirror
Gazing deeply at love's patron saint
Admire the frame, survey the scenery
Or are you just inspecting the paint
Temptation's strong modesty's so weak
High on yourself, humble you ain't
Vanity kills, it don't pay bills
Vanity kills, you love you
Vanity kills, it don't pay bills
Vanity kills, you love you
Vanity kills, it don't pay bills 
Vanity kills, you love you
Vanity kills, it don't pay bills
Vanity kills, it kills
Give it, give it us, give it us
Vanity kills, it don't pay bills
Vanity kills, you love you
Vanity kills, it don't pay bills
Vanity kills, you love you
Vanity kills, it don't pay bills 
Vanity kills, you love you
Vanity kills, if the blast don't get you
Then the fallout will
You love you
