You are my light, I have to go on
Have me anyway you want to
Just take care and love me
'Til my tension's gone
'Cause you are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
Yes, you are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
And don't you come too soon
Baby yeah
Oh, oh, you are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
Yes, you are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
And don't you come too soon
I can't say
It's here that you want me
Oh, baby, I don't want nobody
Nobody kissing you but me
Oh, baby
'Cause you are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
Yes, you are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
And don't you come too soon
Baby, oh yeah
Take me up tonight
And don't be late
Oh, you are my starship
Won't you take me tonight?
And don't be late
And don't you come too soon
