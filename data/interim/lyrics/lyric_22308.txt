Calling all the monsters, calling all the monsters
Calling all, I'm calling all, I'm calling all the monsters
Uh, ye-ah 
Uh, ye-ah 
Uh, ye-ah 
Eh-eh
Heart thumps and you jump
Coming down with goosebumps
You dare to go there?
I'ma, I'ma get you so scared
If you stayed in too late to be getting afraid
This scene extreme
I-I-I-I'ma get you so scared
Gonna get your body shakin'
Wishin' you could just awaken
Here we go...
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
We're comin' to getcha
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
We're comin' to getcha
If you're only dreamin', why I hear you screamin'?
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
We're comin' to getcha
We're comin' to getcha
Calling all the monsters, calling all the monsters
Calling all, I'm calling all, I'm calling all the monsters
You hide, or you try
Kiss tomorra' goodbye
We thrill to your chill
B-B-Buckinâ€™ for a freak out
We might just bite underneath the moonlight
More fun if you run
I-I-I-I'ma, I'ma already chasin'
Gonna get your body shakin'
Wishin' you could just awaken
Here we go!
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
We're comin' to getcha
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
We're comin' to getcha
If you're only dreamin', why I hear you screamin'?
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
Calling all the monsters, calling all the monsters
I'm calling all, calling all, I'm calling all the monsters
Gonna paint it red
Get inside your head, head, head
Like a demon choir playin' with fire, fire, fire
Gonna get your body shakin'
Wishin' you could just awaken
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
We're comin' to getcha
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
And we're comin' to getcha
If you're only dreamin', why I hear you screamin'? 
Tonight all the monsters gonna dance
Uh, ye-ah 
Uh, ye-ah 
Uh, ye-ah 
Coming to get you
