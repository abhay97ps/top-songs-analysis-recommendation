Huh
Yeah
Woo!
Hey yeah
Huh
Ooh yeah
Uh-huh
Yeah
I want to dance
Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
Loneliness calls
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Somebody who, somebody who
Somebody who loves me
Yeah
Somebody who, somebody who
To hold me in his arms, oh
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Ooh, ooh
Ooh 
Come on, baby
Ha ha ha ha 
Woo!
Yeah 
Now get with this
Whoa-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh 
Don't-cha wanna dance? 
With me, baby
Don't-cha wanna dance? 
With me, boy
Hey don't-cha wanna dance? 
With me, baby
With somebody who loves me
Don't-cha wanna dance, say you wanna dance
Don't-cha wanna dance? 
Don't-cha wanna dance, say you wanna dance
Don't-cha wanna dance? 
Don't-cha wanna dance, say you wanna dance, uh-huh 
With somebody who loves me
Ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh 
Hey, baby
Don't-cha wanna love, don't-cha wanna love me?
