You look so fine, you move so hot
Each time you touch me, it's just the right spot
Can't stop this feeling, won't try to pretend
I'm a sucker for passion, don't want it to end
I can feel you burning up inside of me
I need you bad, can't you see?
Each time we touch, you turn me inside out
Don't stop me now, don't let go
Every time we meet, you've got to
Love me
Move me
Thrill me
I need more
Oh, touch me
Tell me
Hold me
I need more of you
Make me feel good, make it real nice
Don't ever stop, I want you all night
You make me crazy, but what do I care?
I'm a sucker for passion, I want you right here
I can feel you burning up inside of me
I need you bad, can't you see?
Each time we touch, my body starts to shake
Don't stop me now, don't let go
Every time you're near, you've got to
Love me
Move me
Thrill me
I need more
Oh, touch me
Tell me
Hold me
I need more of you
I need more of you
I need more of you
The L.A. boys are truly wild
Miami posse's hot
The Texas boys are chili-most
The southern tip's the spot
Chicago's home's for all the real
The fellas whoop while I'm in their Rover
But New York, you are the most fierce
You make me over and over, yeah
I can feel you burning up inside of me
I need you bad, can't you see?
Each time we touch, you turn me inside out
Don't stop me now, don't let go
Every time we meet, you've got to
Love me
Move me
Thrill me
I need more
Oh, touch me
Tell me
Hold me
I need more of you
I need more of you
I need more of you
Love me
Move me
Oh, you thrill me, yeah
I need more
Oh, touch me
Tell me
Hold me, baby
I need more of you
I need more of you
