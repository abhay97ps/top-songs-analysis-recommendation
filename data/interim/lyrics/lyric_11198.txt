On the rebound
On the rebound
That's how you fell for me
That's how you changed my life
You cut me like a knife
On the rebound
On the rebound
You came, you saw, you took
It only took one look
And, lady, I was hooked
On the rebound
On the rebound
On the rebound
On the rebound
On the rebound
You came and took my soul
You came and left a hole
Where your love used to be
On the rebound
On the rebound
He left you drowning in your tears
And after all these years
You give your pain to me
On the rebound
On the rebound
On the rebound
Oh, yeah
When you came
You wanted my money
And when you left me
You took my life, honey
On the rebound
On the rebound
On the rebound
On the rebound
On the rebound
On the rebound
Oh, yeah
On the rebound
On the rebound
On the rebound
On the rebound
On the rebound
On the rebound
On the rebound
On the rebound
