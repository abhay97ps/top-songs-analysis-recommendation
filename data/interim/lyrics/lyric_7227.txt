Every single day
I got a heartache comin' my way
I don't want to say goodbye
But look at the tears you made me cry
I don't wanna say goodbye, mama
But look at the way you made me cry, yeah
Every way this dies
You've got a heart that's made of ice
That's why I know
Fire and Water
Has to make you their daughter
You've got what it takes
To make a poor man heart break
A poor man heart break
Woman you turn me on
As quick as a flash, your love is gone
Baby I'm gonna leave you now
Ah, I got to make you believe somehow
That fire and water
Has to make you their daughter
You got what it takes
To make a poor man heart break
A poor man heart break
Ah!
I don't wanna say goodbye
But look at the way you made me cry, yeah
Every way this dies
You gotta heart that's made of ice
That's why I know
Fire and water
Has to make you their daughter
You got what it takes
To make a grown man heart break
Oh, water, water has to make you their daughter
Ah, you got what it takes
To make a poor man heart break, Ah!
 Your water, has to make you their daughter
You got what it takes
To make a poor man heart break
Fire and water
Has to make you their daughter
