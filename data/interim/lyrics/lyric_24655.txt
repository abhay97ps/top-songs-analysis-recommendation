Alright
Whoa, oh, yeah
I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you blame my head and not my heart?
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, no
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies”
Baby, I just gotta know
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady 
I've been feelin' it lately, baby
Ooh-ooh 
Ooh-ooh 
Ooh-ooh-oh
I'll admit , it's my fault 
But you gotta believe me
When I say it only happened once, mmm
I try , and I try , but you'll never see that
You're the only one I wanna love, oh, yeah
She said "Boy, tell me honestly 
Was it real or just for show?", yeah 
She said, "Save your apologies" 
Baby, I just gotta know
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me 
While you're callin' me "baby" 
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady 
I've been feelin' it lately, baby" 
Ooh-ooh

How long has it been goin' on, baby?

Ooh-ooh-oh
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies"
Baby, I just gotta know
How long has this been goin' on? 
And you' been creepin' 'round on me 
While you're callin' me "baby"
