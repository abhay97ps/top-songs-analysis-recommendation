Sittin' here, sittin' here
Sittin' here, sittin' here
All alone
I've been feelin' kinda strange lately
I don't know what's goin' on
Ever since I came back from out of town
Something's tellin' me some bullshit is goin' down
Boy, is it someone else you're seekin'?
Is there someone else?
Movado's tellin' me you're creepin'
Findin' numbers in your jeans
You're talkin' in your sleep
Phantom letters written by me
Ghetto-u-t
No more sittin' at home alone
While you're out with somebody else.  
No more starin' at the phone
'Cause I can do bad all by myself
Yeah
It's obvious how things have changed within a year.  
Just give me half of the rent and get out of here
No more talkin', save your lines for somebody else
Keep on walkin', 'cause I can do bad all by myself
Boy, is it someone else you're seekin'?
Is there someone else?
Movado's tellin' me you're creepin'.  
I'm findin' numbers in your jeans
You're talkin' in your sleep
Phantom letters written by me
Ghetto-u-t
No more sittin' at home alone
While you're out with somebody else.  
No more starin' at the phone
'Cause I can do bad all by myself.  
No more sittin' at home alone 
While you're out with somebody else
No more starin' at the phone
'Cause I can do bad all by myself
I gave you all,  all of my time
But you would not know a good thing, yeah
If it stares you in the face
Boy, is it someone...
Is it someone else you're seekin'?
Is there someone else?
Movado's tellin' me you're creepin'.  
Findin' numbers in your jeans
You're talkin' in your sleep
Phantom letters written by me
Ghetto-u-t
No more sittin' at home alone 
While you're out with somebody else.  
No more starin' at the phone
'Cause I can do bad all by myself
No more sittin' at home alone
While you're out with somebody else.  
No more starin' at the phone, 
'Cause I can do bad all by myself.  
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, eh, eh, eh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, eh, eh, eh
 No more sittin' at home alone
 While you're out with somebody else
 No more starin' at the phone
 'Cause I can do bad all by myself
 No more sittin' at home alone
 While you're out with somebody else
 No more starin' at the phone
 'Cause I can do bad all by myself
 No more sittin' at home alone
 While you're out with somebody else
 No more starin' at the phone
 'Cause I can do bad all by myself
 No more sittin' at home alone
 While you're out with somebody else
