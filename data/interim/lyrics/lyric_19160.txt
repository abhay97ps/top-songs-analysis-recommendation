Yeah
I want to
Wake up, yeah
And I want to
Wake up, wake up, wake up
I want to wake up to you tomorrow morning
I want to wake up to you tomorrow, uh
I want to wake up to you tomorrow morning
I want to wake up to you tomorrow
What's better 
Than staying in? 
With my baby, yeah 
Don't worry 'bout the cover
'Cause girl, I got you covered
You and me, we V.I.P. tonight 
I want your brown sugar, baby, if you give it, I'ma take it
I can't wait to ta-taste you all night 
I know this life can drive you crazy, don't stress it, girl, you're my baby
I'ma make sure that the world know you're mine 
And I'm yours 
Good Lord 
To have the woman I've been dreaming 'bout, uh
Sitting on my couch, uh, kissing on my mouth, uh
Giving me that knick-knack paddywhack, body like a Cadillac
Fuck around and give this dog a bone 
Now let me get that, uh, Kit-Kat, I'll sit back
And break me off a piece of that though, uh
Zi-zi-zi-zim-zim-zimmer, you're riding that Bimmer 
Fuck up all the switches 'til you scream out, uh
And you the Queen to this Slim and you know 
I'll take this ride with you, tell me where to go, oh, oh
You're the Queen to my Slim and you know
I'll take this ride with you, tell me where to go, oh, oh
What's better 
Than staying in? 
With my baby, yeah 
Don't worry 'bout the cover 
'Cause girl, I got you covered 
You and me, we V.I.P. tonight 
I said I'm clockin' out to put the work in 
Baby girl, tonight's about prioritizing 
Know the way your aura ties in with the vibes
Make it easy for me to put pride on the line, and I ain't lying
Sutter Home for your wine glass, ooh
I'm watching time pass with your fine ass, ooh
My thoughts stuck at a intersection, love
Cocoons break in my midsection, love
But a fly could look at you and look at I
And know that you the shit despite the bullshit in our lives
Tonight we ain't worried 'bout no bills or the weight you gained 
The way your boss ain't been putting respect on your name 
The dishes in the sink that get you tight can wait 
And we gon' order in once I finish what's on my plate
I'm nasty and you like that
Tell me everything you like and we gon' try that
Is pineapple still your safe word?
Alright, my fault, I be playin' too much
Look, alright, all due respect
We ain't gotta go out tonight, let's stay in the nest, uh
We can chill and see what flicks is on the Net
The WiFi don't work, my hotspot is on deck
So we ain't never gotta leave, we can remix Lumidee
While I speak your body language fluently 
True indeed, ah, ah, ah, ah 
I love you, I love you 
I love you, girl, I love you
I love you, I love you 
I love you, girl, I love you
I love you, I love you 
I love you, girl, ayy, ayy-ayy
