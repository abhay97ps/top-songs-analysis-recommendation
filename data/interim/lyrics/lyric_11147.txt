You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
Our mystery fans
You in lonely shoes
With two hearts a beating
The rhythm and blues
Three doors down
At the end of the hall
Hands in your pockets
Waiting for his call
Girl, you say that you are ready
It's a promise you can taste
You believe you are hungry
For a love that just won't wait
You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
From the unbending night
You have fashioned a new life
Where your moves are like you're
Walking on the sharp edge of a knife
You knock back your feelings
Like you knock back a drink
Oh, you knock back your contest
Then you can think
Then you tell me that you're ready
When I had it up to here
You are standing in the doorway
And you just won't get through here
You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
Hey
Then you tell me that you're ready
When I had it up to here
You are standing in the doorway
And you just won't get through here
You need a real love
You need a real love
Girl, you need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
