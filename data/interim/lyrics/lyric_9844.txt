All the kids on the street
Know the songs because they know the beat
Everyone's getting wise
Want the truth about stayin alive
All the kids on the street sing the same sweet music
All the kids on the street know the same two words
And the young want to change they're bound by a common flame
With the fire in their heart and the freedom of a brand new start
All the kids on the street sing the same sweet music
All the kids on the street know the same two words
How did so many dreams collide
They don't want to cry tragic tears
Because they need those happy years
All the kids on the street
All the kids on the street
Got the old understand new dreams of the promised land
If the young have no chance how can this crazy world advance
All the kids on the street sing the same sweet music
All the kids on the street know the same two words
All the kids on the street sing the same sweet music
All the kids on the street know the same two words
