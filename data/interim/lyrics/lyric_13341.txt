Took a walk to the corner store
Just to buy a loaf of bread and a box of s'mores
Up pulled a guy in a yellow van
Shiny gold badge flashing in his hand
He said, alright all you mojados down here
I want you all to hit the floor
I got one thing to ask you and nothing more
So answer in English, if you can
Where were ya born, man
Huh? Where was I born?
That's right, I said
Where were ya born?
Hey, are you one of those dudes who do horoscopes, man
Hey, I'm a Cancer with a bad moon rising
Look here, el vago, watch my lips
Where were ya born?
I was born in East LA
Man, I was born in East LA
Oh yeah, you were born in East LA
Let's see your green card
Huh? Green card?
I'm from East LA
Alright, then who's President of the United States
Oh, that's easy, man
That guy that used to be on Death Valley Days, John Wayne
Alright, let's go, come on
Next thing I know, I'm in a foreign land
People talkin so fast, I couldn't understand
There was nobody there to lend a helping hand
I was cold, it was dark where is a burger stand
I want to go back to East LA
I wish I was back in East LA
I don't belong here in downtown TJ
Cause I was born in East LA, ole
I crawled under barbed wire, swam across a stream
Rode in six different trucks packed like a sardine
Walked all day in the burning sun
Now I know what it's like to be born to run
Up ahead was the promised land
Shining like a star just beyond my hand
All I could see was a golden door
I looked up, a sign said five zillion sold
And I was back in East LA
Yes, I was back in East LA
You know I'm never gonna stray
Cause I was born in East LA, oralé!
I'm a low rider vato from East LA, cuìdate!
East LA, oralé!
This ain't no Datsun it's a Chevrolet, cruise all day!
What I say, East LA, oralé!
Soto Street 
Brooklyn Avenue 
City Terrace 
Whittier Boulevard  oralé!
Wilshire! I said, how do you get to Wilshire?
What am I lost or what....?
I'm a lowrider vato from a-far away
I was born, I was born in East LA, how to say
East LA, don't delay
Cruise all day in East LA, oralé!
I'm from East LA, what I say
East LA.................!
East LA!
