"Some people say I look like me dad"
"What? Are you serious?"
I say, hey boy, sittin' in your tree
Mummy always wants you to come for tea 
Don't be shy, straighten up your tie
Get down from your treehouse sittin' in the sky 
I wanna know just what to do
Is it very big? Is there room for two? 
I got a house with windows and doors
I'll show you mine if you show me yours
Gotta let me in, hey, hey, hey
Let the fun begin, hey
I'm the wolf today, hey, hey, hey
I'll huff, I'll puff
I'll huff, I'll puff, I'll blow you away
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you're true, say to me
C'est la vie
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you're true, say to me 
C'est la vie
Do you play with the girls, play with the boys?
Do you ever get lonely playing with your toys? 
We can talk, we can sing
I'll be the queen and you'll be the king 
Hey boy, in your tree
Thrown down your ladder, make a room for me 
I got a house with windows and doors
I'll show you mine if you show me yours
Gotta let me in, hey, hey, hey
Let the fun begin, hey
I'm the wolf today, hey, hey, hey
I'll huff, I'll puff
I'll huff, I'll puff, I'll blow you away
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you're true, say to me 
C'est la vie
Say you will, say you won't 
Say you'll do what I don't 
Say you're true, say to me 
C'est la vie
Huh, huh
Na-na-nah, hey
Na-na-nah, oh
Na-na-nah, hey
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't 
Say you're true, say to me
Wanna say, c'est la vie
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you're true, say to me 
C'est la vie 
Na-na-nah oh 
Na-na-nah, hey
Huh, huh, huh, huh
