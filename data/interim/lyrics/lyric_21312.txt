The moon was shining on the lake at night
The Slayer T-shirt fit the scene just right
Through smeared mascara
I looked into your eyes and saw a light
You told me stories about your chickadees
They didn’t like BB guns or stupid archery
You charmed the lifeguard
He let them use the pool all day for free
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at my feet
I was next to you and you were right there next to me
Then I said girl, if you’re wondering if I want you to
 I want you to 
So make the move 
Cause I ain’t got all night
The rest of the summer was the best we’ve ever had
We watched Titanic and it didn’t make us sad
I took you to Best Buy
You took me home to meet your mom and dad
Your mom cooked meatloaf, even though I don’t eat meat
I dug you so much, I took some for the team
Your dad was silent
His eyes were fixed to what was on TV
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at the ring
Your folks were next to you, and you were right there next to me
And I said girl, if you're wondering if I want you to
 I want you to 
I swear it's true 
Without you, my heart is blue
Girl, if you’re wondering if I want you to
 I want you to 
So make the move 
Cause I ain’t got all night
So much pain may come our way
There may come a day when we have nothing left to say
When the conversation stops and we’re facing our defeat
I’ll be next to you and you’ll be right there next to me
And I said girl, if you're wondering if I want you to
 I want you to 
I swear it's true 
Without you, my heart is blue
Girl, if you’re wondering if I want you to
 I want you to 
So make the move 
Cause I ain’t got all night
