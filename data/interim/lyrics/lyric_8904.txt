Do it, do it, you can do it
Do it in the name of love
 baby 
I like to see you
Oh, woman, why don't you 
I'd like to see you try 
Why don't you do it
My mama told me a long time ago
Remember, in love
There's no easy road
You've got to give more than you get
You never know what to expect
Hey, sometimes you're up 
Sometimes you're down 
Sometimes you whole word will
Come crashing down 
Oh, love can be
No more than you make it
Hang on in there
And you're gonna make it
Just get your strength
From the Lord above
Hey, do it  do 
Do it in the name of love
 oh, yeah 
Why don't you do it
In the name of love 
You've got to work 
Fight 
Try with all your might
Get your strength from
The Lord up above, oh, oh, hey
Do it in the name of love
 and I'd like to see you try
 why don't you
I'd like to see you try 
Why don't you  oh, no, no
There's temptations all around
Don't you let it get you down
Think about your woman
Think about your man
Keep it together
Stay hand in hand
Sometimes you cause
Each other so much pain
And then again
You're sweet as sugar cane
You've got to show
What you give for each other
Then you will succeed as lovers
Just get your strength from
The Lord up above 
And do it, do it
Do it in the name of love
 yeah, hey, hey 
Why don't you do it in
The name of love 
You've got to work 
Fight 
Try with all your might
Get your strength from
The Lord up above
 oh
Do it in the name of love
 why don't you try 
Do it, do it, do it
Hey, honey
Why don't you try 
You can do it 
Why don't you
