Standing in the corner at the dance last night
I was almost leaving when you came in sight
You were dancing to the beat
Man, my head was spinning when I saw your feat
I didn't know I loved you, till I saw you Rock N Roll
I didn't know I loved you, till I saw you Rock N Roll
I didn't know I loved you, till I saw you Rock N Roll
I didn't know I loved you, till I saw you Rock N Roll
You're my inspiration, you're my hearts desire
You really set me Rocking, set my soul on fire
Now I'm gonna spend my life
Rockin' and a rolling if you'll be my wife
I didn't know I loved you, till I saw you Rock N Roll
I didn't know I loved you, till I saw you Rock N Roll
I didn't know I loved you, till I saw you Rock N Roll
I didn't know I loved you, till I saw you Rock N Roll
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey...
Dance to the music
