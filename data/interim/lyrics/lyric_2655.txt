No time to lose 
Love ain't got no time to lose
I've got to find a man 
Make his mother friend 
I ain't got to try to see 
If you're come back to me
I've got no time, woah, no time, no time to lose 
I was a fool 
Oh, I was such a poor fool
Why I've been living here? 
Living here 
I've to find a guy 
And apologize
I've got no time, woah, no time, no time to lose
No time to lose 
I will cry
When you told me
Is there a woman?
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Darling, my darling
Darling, my darling 
Woah, somebody, please tell to my darling
Have got you slept in my bed? 
 my  
And if it  me 
That you're slept on me
I've got no time, woah, no time, no time to lose
No time to lose 
No time to lose 
No time to lose 
No time to lose 
No time to lose 
No time to lose
