Disappointed youth
Where is all the flash
I can't be uncouth
I can speak no trash
What's gonna happen to me
Don't want to turn out to be
Top40db.org
Not another nice girl
Wanna stay out late
With those ostracized guys
Silver glitter on my face
Smear a little round my eyes
What's gonna happen to she
Who can't turn out, can't be
Nothing but a nice girl
Oh, what a shame
She's nobody's dream
She's got nothing to say
Remains lonely and clean
Body pressure up
Gets my fantasies wound
Wanna eat you up
Pull you down to the ground
Whats gonna happen if she
Spends her life all pristine
Like a proper nice girl
Such a game, middle class
Throwing sticks in the mud
Shame, shame, shame middle class
Nipping girls in the bud
Wanna stay out late
With those ostracized guys
Silver glitter on my face
Smear a little round my eyes
What's gonna happen to she
Who can't turn out, can't be
Nothing but a nice girl
What's gonna happen to she
Who can't turn out, can't be
Nothing but a nice girl
