We never spoke a word
But every thought she had, I heard
From across the room
We were standin' face to face
I couldn't find the words to say
Give me one more move
I don't even know her name
I guess foolish pride's to blame
Now I'm fallin' in love as she's walkin' away
And my heart won't tell my mind
To tell my mouth what it should say
May have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Now I'm fallin' in love as she's walkin' awa-a-ay
Wise man next to me did say
About the one that got away
Son, I missed my chance
Don't you let regret take place
Of the dreams you have to chase
Ask her to dance
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith
Don't be fallin' in love as she's walkin' away
When your heart won't tell your mind
To tell your mouth what it should say
May have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Don't be fallin' in love as she's walkin' awa-a-ay
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith
Don't be fallin' in love as she's walkin' away
When your heart won't tell your mind
To tell your mouth what it should say
May have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Don't be fallin', fallin', fallin' in love
As sheâ€™s walking awa-a-a-ay, he-e-ey
