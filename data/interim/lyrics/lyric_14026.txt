When you want something bad enough
You got to stick to it
Ain't nobody telling me that I can't do it
Don't let no one tell you what you should be
Nobody in this World can say no to me
Chorus:
Stand back, I'm coming through
Stand back, I know just what to do
Stand back, Let me make my way
Stand back, listen to what I say
Steppin' up in life you got to help yourself
That don't mean you have to step on no one else
Go for it man you got nothing to lose
But don't let nobody step on you
Chorus
I ain't gonna run and hide if you think I am
You better step aside
I ain't gonna turn the other cheek
If you want the world you can't be meek
You can't get by if you don't take a chance
You got to pay the fiddler if you want to dance
I learned my lesson a long time ago
You got to keep pushin' if you want it to go
Chorus
One of these days you got to speak your mind
Even if they say that you're out of line
One of these days you're gonna know the score
I'm not telling you something you don't know
Chorus
