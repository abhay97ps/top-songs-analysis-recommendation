Oh, a tongue can accuse and carry bad news
Gossip is cheap and it's lo-o-ow
So unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Just be careful of stones that you throw
SPOKEN: A neighbor was passin' my garden one time. She stopped and I
Knew
Right away that it was gossip, not flowers, she had on her mind. And
This is what I
Heard my neighbor say-"You know, that girl down the street should be run
From our
Midst. She drinks and she talks quite a lot. She knows not to speak to
My child
And me." My neighbor then smiled and I thought
Oh, a tongue can accuse and carry bad news
Gossip is cheap and it's lo-o-ow
But unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw
SPOKEN: Just then a car speeded by in the screamin' of brakes-a sound
That
Made my blood chill. For my neighbor's one child had been pulled from
The path
And saved by a girl lyin' still. The child was unhurt and my neighbor
Cried out "Oh
Who was that brave girl so sweet?" I covered the crushed broken body
And said
"The bad girl who lived down the street."
So unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Just be careful of stones that you throw
