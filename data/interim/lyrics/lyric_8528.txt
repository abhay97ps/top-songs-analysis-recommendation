You got to be the one
You got to be the one
You got to be the one
You got to be the one
I got the stars, the moon and sun
All rolled up in one
I'm not one who talks a lot
Always brags about what he's got
Woman, you make me feel like a king
And I say, it's a wonderful thing
You got me hung up in
This love thing, yeah
And though I've been in love before
Never thought I wanted any more
You place at my command
More love than a body could stand
A joy so strange to me
One I feel so easily
Ask me how your love is
I would say heavenly, yeah
I'm not one who brags a lot
Always talks about what he's got
Woman, you give me all your love
Ready to answer every call
Girl, you make me feel like a king
And I say, it's a wonderful thing
You got me hung up
Strung out in this love thing
This love thing, this love thing
This love thing
You got to be the one
You got to be the one
You got to be the one
The one and only one
Oh, you got to be the one for me
You got to be the one
You got to be the one
The one and only one
I would swim the deepest ocean
Swim the deepest sea
Anything, baby
To bring your love to me
Oh, oh, oh
You got to be the one
The one and only one for me
You got to be the one
The one and only one
Oh, you got to be the one
The one and only one for me
Oh, you got to be the one
The one and only one
Oh, you got to be the one
The one and only one for me
You got to be the one
The one and only one
