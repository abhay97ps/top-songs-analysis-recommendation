Hey! This is Skitty Rock  At the hip hop barber shop
It's time to floss with Kris Kross
So bust a move big baby 
It's like 3 into the 2 and 2 into the 1
No it don't stop, no it don't stop
It keeps on humming, coming at ya
I choked up in this Macadoshish rap sha
And you can't sleep and you can't eat
All you do is geek geek geek off the funk that I freak in ya jeep
 Now you know it don't get realer than this
The M-A-C D-A double D-Y taking you to total bliss
And it don't stop and it don't quit serving all them little fools for the '9 Tre like this
It's that nigga that them litters can't stay away from
I gets dumb ditty ditty dumb dumb
 Ya steady steady loving what ya heard
 Ya wonder if we fallin' of the curve
 When we maintain the same thing we maintained
When we came from Jump, Warm it Up and It's a Shame
I'm Real!
So all that stuff that you pop needs to stop cause I'm real
It ain't my fault, what I drop is the top, so just chill!
And all that stuff that ya pop needs to stop cause I'm real
And when I drop what I drop niggas know the deal
Just call me the real one, like Cyprus Hill son
I freak the funk the phone freaks me and I gets ill 
Think you could get with these, All ya get is these and my K-C-I-D
My man in ya mouth
Moment to let them boys from the south drop the house
 Cause I'm steady steady breaking em off
 They ain't ready cause they way to soft
Well make way for the Mac, for the Mac pack
That's got you back against the fools talking this and that
I hit em up with the 
Make em say 
Where did ya get ya frame of my Macadoshish smooth style from
I know you want some I know you want some
It's nothing but the bomb nothing but the bomb and here it comes!
See, the quicker quicker ripper done got a lot bigger since the last time you heard me rhyme so I figure
I kick a dose of flows for those schmoes that try to play the K's and act like they don't know It goes
On and on till the break of dawn nonstop baby pop till the early morn'
 Cause I'm steady steady breaking em off
 They ain't ready cause they way to soft
And I'm Real!
So all that stuff that you pop needs to stop cause I'm real
It ain't my fault, what I drop is the top, so just chill!
And all that stuff that ya pop needs to stop cause I'm real
And when I drop what I drop niggas know the deal
X2
There it is
Two niggas put it down
For all the real niggas around
You heard what they said
So just bop your head
And nigga if you try'na floss
You definitely gonna get tossed by Kris Kross
Nevertheless I stress I'm outta here
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
