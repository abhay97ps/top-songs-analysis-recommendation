When I was little I had big dreams
Of being one of the greats
Used to walk around with my headphones on
Writing raps to any old beats
Little older now i see
How  big  that dream could be
Wanna say what I feel and rap from the heart
Change the world cause god chose me
Last week at one of my shows
Little boy bout 6 years old
Walked up to me, at a bully rally
With a story that he told he said
My name is Sebastian
And I love what you do
Your raps are tight your dance is sick
When I grow up I wanna be like you
The kids at school they pick on me because I likе to sing
I said you were meant to fly don't lеt anybody clip your wings
He had me sign his arm and said he'd never wash it away
I'll never forget the look on his face or the way that I felt that day
Follow me
Look up in the sky and believe
You can be who you want and we can do the impossible
Don't nobody hold you down or keep your feet on the ground
We can fly away, alway, alway, alway yeah, fly away yeah, away, away, away
One of my first letters
Came from across the sea
Envelope was a little torn
I'm surprised that it got to me
I opened it and and read it
And it brought tears to my eyes
It was the first time anything id read
Had ever made me cry
She said my name is lee
And South Korea is where I live
I'm a big fan of your music
There's nothing I wouldn't give
To meet my inspiration
The boy who saved my life
I've seen a lot of darkness
And It was hard to see the light
My moms an alcoholic
And I dont have many friends
Couple weeks ago couldn't take no more  just wanted it all to end
But instead your music reached me
And I stood back up to fight
You're my guardian angel
You helped me shine my light
Follow me
Look up in the sky and believe
You can be who you want and we can do the impossible
Don't nobody hold you down or keep your feet on the ground
We can fly away, alway, alway, alway yeah, fly away yeah, away, away, away
Gotta break those chains that bind you
Any roots that are in the ground
When you dream there are no limits
And theres nothing to hold you down
Imagine the possibilities with faith you'd never fail
You'd step without no hesitation
Impossible then prevails
Sometimes you may be lost
And your futures outta site
Well follow me look up in the sky
He's shining down his light
And his dreams are far more bigger
Than the could ever see
And everything is possible for one who just believes
Lord, take these broken wings so we can learn to fly again
There's hope in the future
Not the darkness where we've been
You can say that i'm a dreamer
But i'm not the only one
A voice for my generation
One people under one
Follow me
Look up in the sky and believe
You can be who you want and we can do the impossible
Don't nobody hold you down or keep your feet on the ground
We can fly away, alway, alway, alway yeah, fly away yeah, away, away, away
