I keep waiting…
For you to do something I don't like
I keep waiting…
But everything you do, you do all right
You give me love when I want you;
You leave me alone when I don't
Something says I ought to leave you
But something tells me I won't
'Cause you keep tightening up on me, and I can't break away
'Cause you keep tightening up on me, with a sweeter love every day
It scares me just a little bit, knowing I'll never be free
Woman, I'm at your mercy, 'cause you keep
Tightening up, tightening up, tightening up on me
Yeah…
O-o-o… yeah…
La-la-la…
Your kind of love…
Makes it hard for a man to say no to you
One look at me…
And I know I've got to go to you
Even when I'm looking away
In my mind I can see you
I ain't sure that I love you, baby
But I know that I need you
'Cause you keep tightening up on me, and I can't break away
'Cause you keep tightening up on me, with a sweeter love every day
It scares me just a little bit, knowing I'll never be free
Woman, I'm at your mercy, 'cause you keep
Tightening up, tightening up, tightening up on me
Yeah…
O-o-o… yeah…
Uh-uh-uh-huh…o-o-o…
You keep tightening up on me, and I can't break away
You keep tightening up on me, with a sweeter love every day
