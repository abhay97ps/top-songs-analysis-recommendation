Blood spilled on the street top as a another revolver goes pop
And a little chalio at the age of fifteen, his heart stopped
Now look at the little vato
Who thought he was a sly little gato
Burnt his nine lives quick but what did you expect
He was living his life in full throttle
And the same damn shit is going on across town
Another little cholo claiming that it's them
So tonight it was going to do another drive-by
Under and forming a group to a gangster lullaby
And the bullets fly from the Uzi-R, why
How many Chicanos got to die
Aye yo man, what was we doing this for
No more wars, no more
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Mmm, why can’t we live together
Tell me why, tell me why
All we need just a bit of little peace in this world
Whittier boulevard, cruising in my car
And Rolla by is a real precision
We're killing off our own race
And at the same time, you talk about progression
Why, here's another lesson
That the Smith & Wesson has got homicide detectives guessing
I don’t talk to the narcos, I didn't see shit
And so I stepped in the carpools
Being a rat will get you served a queso
And all of the homeboys would be out to get you
There's rules on these streets and we almost go by
Or end up with a shove stick quick in a drive-by
The trap will squeeze, the rat ain't cheesing
All went down into a hot summer breeze
Temperature Ninety-nine point one
A young Chicanos dies under a gun
Aye man, what's it all for
No more wars, no more, no more
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Mmm, why can't we live together
No more wars, no more wars
All we need just a little bit of peace in this world, yeah
No more wars, no more wars, no more wars
Mmm, no more wars
Tell me why, tell me why, all the homies are killing each other
Sysco was a cholo from East L.A
Who traded of a image all the way
And just to be down with all his tights
He used to get high in generic nights
Hang out in a corner behind the tracks
Slinging them big ass Indo sacks
And rolling in his Riviera
And everybody knew of Sysco's tierra
One day, some foos decided to roll on
Give up the cash or we're gonna go upside your head
Sysco pulled out his cuete and shot one of the vatos, dead
And now it’s on the front page
I guess it’s true what they say, the whole world is a fucking stage
Set in a concrete arena
C.R.A.S.H. must think and that makes us go meaner
Yo, I don't know what possessed you
To want to shoot at the police when they came to arrest you
It was like he was tripping off acid
Bland, bland, bland, and you kept blasting
The juras started acting like a gang
And task was out to bust that ass
Is this the life you’re looking for
No more wars, no more, no more
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Mmm, why can't we live together
No more wars, no more wars
All we need just a little bit of peace in this world, yeah
Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we live together
Tell me why too many brothers dying
Too many mothers crying
When will we ever learn
We got to have some peace in this world
No more wars, no more wars...
