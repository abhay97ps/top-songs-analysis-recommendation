So many nights
I'd sit by my window
Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams
I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark
But now you've come along
And you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song
Rolling at sea
Adrift on the waters
Could it be finally
I'm turning for home
Finally a chance to say, "hey, I love you"
Never again to be all alone
And you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song
You
You light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my life with song
It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
Cause you you light up my life
