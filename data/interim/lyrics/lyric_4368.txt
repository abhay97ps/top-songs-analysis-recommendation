Mmm hmm...
The whole world is a stage
And everybody's playing a part
The stage is set
The curtain goes up
The scene is a broken heart
You told me you loved me
A grand opening start
You read your lines so perfectly
Like the words came straight
From your heart
And I believe you
The whole world is a stage
And everybody's playing a part
You forgot your makeup
And at last I saw the real you
Your heart was
Under your costume
But your eyes revealed
We were through
And I believe you
The whole world is a stage
And everybody's playing a part
You hear someone crying
But for me, it's a tragic end
But you, oh, make your exit
With the guy I thought
Was my friend
And I believe you
The whole world is a stage
Yes, it is, baby
But now that the act is all over
I can see you was nowhere
