Ooh, well, yeah, yeah, well...
I was looking for a place to go
To forget about someone I used to know
Where the music was playing loud
Started dancing with the memories among the crowd
And there she was 
Dancing by herself 
Digging on the music, while looking for someone else
By the time we were doing the perfect dance
When she took me surprise
And asked me to be her disco man
Well, we fell in love while dancing 
It was just like magic, when we hit the floor
Well, well, we fell in love while dancing 
This music of love made me want her so much more and more
We fell in love while dancing 
We never thought we'd ever see each other again, no
We fell in love while dancing
Hey, we romanced while we danced at the disco
Alright, yeah, woo
Alright, yeah, well
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Now every night we're on the scene 
Down at the disco, where the lovers meet
Just to hear our favorite song
That brought us together, yeah, where we belong
I know the music won't let this love die
That we feel in our hearts, if we let it survive
Please, Mr. DJ, keep on playing that song
While I tell her again I've got to be her disco man
Oh, we fell in love while dancing 
It was just like magic when we hit the floor
Well, well, we fell in love while dancing 
This music of love made me want her so much more, more
We fell in love while dancing 
Hey, we never thought we'd ever see each other again, no
We fell in love while dancing
Hey, we romanced while we danced at the disco
Alright...  ooh...
 yeah
 ooh...
 yeah
 hey, hey, hey, yeah
We fell in love while dancing
It was just like magic when we hit the floor
Don't you know, we fell in love while dancing
This music of love made me want her so much more, more
We fell in love while dancing
We never thought we'd ever see each other again, hey
We fell in love while dancing 
Girl, you put your spell on me, what you're doin' to me
Hey hey, yeah yeah, yeah, well
Never thought we'd ever see each other again, girl
 hey, hey
Just like magic when we hit the floor
 don't you know, hey
I want this girl so much more, and more, and more
Don't you know
 hey hey, yeah, well
What you're doing to me, go now
Oh, never thought we'd ever see each other again, oh yeah
Girl, what you're doing to me, girl you put your spell on me
Yeah, got me running around, got me fooling around
Ooh, yeah, well...
