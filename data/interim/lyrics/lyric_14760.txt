Smoke-filled room
Champagne on ice
Bed of roses
But something still ain't right
Light through my window
Lazy afternoon
I wanna taste the good life
But I'm missing you too soon
Take my heart, take my soul
Love has taken its toll
I got no feelings, no control
Love has taken its toll
I'm halfway around the world
You're halfway gone
Please don't say you're leaving
I know where I belong
I see only you
In every face I meet
I may not say I love you, sugar
But I sure know what it means, yeah!
Oh, yeah, yeah
Take my heart, take my soul
Love has taken its toll
I got no feelings, no control
Love has taken its toll
They say that love is like the edge of a knife
Cold and hard and waiting to cut you
But I could hold you for the rest of my life
I close my eyes and reach out to touch you again
Touch you again
Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa
Yeah!
Spring turns into winter
The day kisses the night
And all I can remember, honey
Is kissing you goodbye
I still think about you
On those deep dark lonely nights
I hold you in my aching heart
And I pray that you're still mine, yeah
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, oh, yeah
Take my heart, take my soul
Love has taken its toll
I got no feelings, got no control
Love has taken its toll, yeah!
Love has taken its toll
Sha, la, la, la, la, la
Love has taken its toll
