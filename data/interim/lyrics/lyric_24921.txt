Ooh-ooh, wow
Ahh, yeah-yeah 
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
We got London on the track
Hunnid and twenty, come catch me
Forties inside of my belly
Shouldn't be drivin', I'm faded 
Rock that Nirvana, my favorite
Damn, I forgot what her name is
She in the front seat, head-bangin' 
Yeah, money counter sound somethin' like a chopper, chopper 
Speaker system bumpin', fuck your fuckin' block up 
Used to mock him, now it's custom Bentley mock-ups 
Killer drop, a call from lockup
If you buy that Echo, why you lyin'? You broke
Got a nine in my tote, get you smoked like a stoge
Keep on ridin' my coat, your new shit is a joke
Why you bitin' my flows? What you tryna be, Post?
Yeah
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin'
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas' glancin'
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin' 
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin'
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas' glancin'
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin'
She used to shoppin' at the mall 
I'll teach lil baby how to ball
I hit Rodeo, spent like 40 G's 
Four hunnid pairs of Gucci socks 
I lost all my friends, made a lot of foes
Made a lot of M's, made a lot of moves
Open up the safe , I'm just with the bros
Cop the 458, cost me 250 
Man, look at all my ice 
I hit your main thing twice 
Take a word of advice 
Break up with that ho 
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin' 
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas' glancin' 
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin' 
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin' 
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin' 
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas' glancin'
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin'
Cold wrist frozen
Got sacks, Goldman
Bought the bar, Roseanne
No joke, deadpan
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin'
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas glancin'
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin' 
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin' 
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin' 
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas glancin' 
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin'
Ooh 
Yeah, haha 
Ooh 
We got London On Da Track
