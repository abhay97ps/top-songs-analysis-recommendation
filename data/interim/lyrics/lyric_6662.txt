Where's the love that we knew
Is it gone or have you thrown it away
While the joy that we shared
I feel sure is not here anymore
Like smoke from a cigarette
Dreams that you soon forget
It's fading away
And it's 1900 yesterday
I thought you felt the same
Tell me who, who's to blame
The broken heart you've given me
All the hurt and misery
Where did I go wrong
Like smoke from a cigarette
Dreams that you soon forget
And night has no day
And it's 1900 yesterday
Where's the love that we knew
Is it gone or have you thrown it away
While the joy that we shared
I feel sure is not here anymore
Log on to kill this message
Like smoke from a cigarette
Dreams that you soon forget
And night has no day
And it's 1900 yesterday
And it's 1900 yesterday
And it's 1900 yesterday
