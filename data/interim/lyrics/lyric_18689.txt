Uh, yeah, another one of those 
Down to earth joints 
There's so many that don't know 
This goes out to my nigga Q, rest in peace, baby 
They don't know who we be 
What they don't know is
The bullshit, the drama , the guns, the armor 
The city, the farmer, the babies, the mama 
The projects, the drugs , the children, the thugs 
The tears, the hugs, the love, the slugs 
The funerals, the wakes, the churches, the coffins 
The heartbroken mothers, it happens too often 
The problems, the things we use to solve 'em 
Yonkers, the Bronx , Brooklyn, Harlem 
The hurt, the pain, the dirt, the rain 
The jerk, the fame, the work, the game 
The friends, the foes, the Benz, the hoes 
The studios, the shows, comes and it goes 
The jealousy, the envy, the phony, the friendly 
The one that gave 'em the slugs the one that put 'em in me 
The snakes, the grass too long to see 
The lawnmower sittin' right next to the tree 
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be
What we seeing is
The streets, the cops, the system, harassment 
The options, get shot, go to jail, or getcha ass kicked 
The lawyers, the part they are of the puzzle 
The release, the warning, "Try not to get in trouble" 
The snitches, the odds , probation, parole 
The new charge, the bail, the warrant, the hole 
The cell, the bus, the ride up North 
The greens, the boots, the yard, these hearts 
The fightin', the stabbin', the pullin', the grabbin' 
The riot squad with the captain, nobody knows what happened 
The two years in a box, revenge, the plots 
The twenty-three hours that's locked, the one hour that's not 
The silence, the dark, the mind, so fragile 
The wish that the streets would have took you when they had you 
The days, the months, the years, despair
One night on my knees, here it comes, the prayer
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be
This here is all about
My wife, my kids , the life that I live 
Through the night, I was his 
It was right, but I did 
My ups and downs , my slips, my falls 
My trials and tribulations , my heart, my balls 
My mother, my father, I love 'em, I hate 'em 
Wish God, I didn't have 'em, but I'm glad that he made 'em 
The roaches, the rats, the strays, the cats 
The guns, knives and bats, every time we scrap 
The hustlin', the dealin', the robbin', the stealin' 
The shit hit the ceiling', little boy with no feelings 
The frustration, rage, trapped inside a cage
Got beatin's 'til the age I carried a twelve gauge 
Somebody stop me , somebody come and get me 
Little did I know that the Lord was ridin' with me
The dark, the light , my heart , the fight 
The wrong , the right , it's gone , aight?
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be 
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be
Man, listen 
These motherfuckers don't know who we are
They don't know 
They couldn't possibly fuckin' know, dawg
That's from the heart
Dawg, this shit is crazy
