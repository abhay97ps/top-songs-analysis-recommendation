You have proved yourself at being a way-out guy
Even  the suit and hat you're wearing is superfly
But  if you ain't getting down with it
Like you know you should
If your woman don't dig it
Ain't  no good
Lord  have mercy. How bout that?
One more thing I'm going to say out loud right here
Sock  it back to her
Like she socks it to you
Let that woman know that you can please her too
Get down with it like you know you should
If  your woman don't dig it just ain't no good
Lord. Ho!
Take a closer look at the woman you're with
Lord have mercy
Can't you feel her heart pounding, Oh about midnight
What are you looking for tonight, other direction
When standing right beside you is true love and affection
Take a closer at the woman you're with
Can't you feel the yearning to be loved
Lord have mercy
Can't you feel the yearning to be loved
Can't you feel the yearning to be loved
Lord, hell yeah
Hell yeah
I'm beginning to fell it now
Can't you feel the yearning
Can't you feel the yearning
Can't you feel the yearning, lord
Feel the yearning
Feel the yearning
Feel the yearning, to be loved
Take a closer look
Take a closer look
Take a closer look
