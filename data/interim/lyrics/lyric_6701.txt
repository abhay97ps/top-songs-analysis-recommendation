Freedom, this is what I call freedom
Well, I wanna say, I wanna tell you
I wanna say when you can do what you wanna do
And go where you wanna go
And live where you wanna live
And love who you wanna love
And be what you wanna be
Join what you wanna join
Well, well, well, that's freedom
Yeah, yeah, freedom, yes sir
When you can learn what you wanna learn
And read what you wanna read
And write what you wanna write
Do what you feel is right
Hey, hey, hey, hey, freedom, freedom
Oh yeah, freedom, freedom, freedom
Oh yeah, freedom, oh that's freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom, oh yeah
Free, free, free
Free, free, free
Free, free, free
Free, free, free
When you can eat what you wanna eat
And sleep where you wanna sleep
And say what you wanna say
I like the children play what they wanna play
And work when you wanna work
Flirt when you wanna flirt
Oh, that's freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom
When you can laugh when you wanna laugh
And cry when you wanna cry
And don't have to feel ashamed
Sing the song you wanna sing
When you can buy what you wanna buy
When no one to ask you why
Dress the way you wanna dress
Just because you feel the space
Rock the way you wanna rock
Talk the way you wanna talk
Shake the way you wanna shake
No one to put you at
Oh, that's freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom, oh yeah
Freedom, that's freedom, freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom
Freedom, oh, freedom, freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom, freedom
