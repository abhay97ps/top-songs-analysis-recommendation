"Another hour deeper in the night
Another mile farther down the road
A man can drive as hard as he can drive
And never get as far as his heart was meant to go
Sometimes when you look up in the sky
You think we might be closer than you know
Another tune forms in my head
More harmonies more empty words
Oh I could play these songs 'til I was dead
And never approach the sound that I once heard
I remember when I was just a kid
Listening in the sky
Believing that the wind would stir
And I know the river is deep
I found out that the currents are tricky
And I know the river is wide
And oh the currents are strong
And I may lose every dream
I dreamt that I could carry with me
But I have failed so many times
And You've never let me fall down alone
Maybe she could come to Wichita
And maybe we could borrow Beaker's bike
We'd let the road wind tie our hair in knots
Let the speed and the freedom untangle the lies
Maybe fear can vanish before love
Oh God don't let this love be denied
'Cause I know the river is deep
I found out that the currents are tricky
And I know that the river is wide
And oh the currents are strong
And I could lose every dream
I dreamt that I could carry with me
Oh but I will reach the other side
Please don't let me have to wait too long
Another hour deeper in the night
Another mile farther down the road
We could be closer than you know"
