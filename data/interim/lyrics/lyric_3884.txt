Past, well now let me tell you about the past
The past is filled with silent joys and broken toys
Laughing girls and teasing boys
Was I ever in love? I called it love—I mean, it felt like love
There were moments when, well, there were moments when...
Go out with you? Why not
Do I like to dance? Of course
Take a walk along the beach tonight? I'd love to
But don't try to touch me, don't try to touch me
'Cause that will never happen again
Shall we dance?
Tomorrow? well tomorrows a long way off
Maybe someday I'll have somebody's hand
Maybe somewhere someone will understand
You know I used to sing—a-tisket, a-tasket, a green and yellow basket
I'm all packed up and I'm on my way and I'm gonna fall in love
But at the moment it doesn't look good
At the moment it will never happen again
I don't think it will ever happen again
