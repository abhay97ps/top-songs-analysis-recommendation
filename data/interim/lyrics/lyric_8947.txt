You're the sunlight that opened my eyes
When the world was tumbling down
You're the river that gave me a drink
When a drop of water couldn't be found
You give me what I want when I want it
And all I'll ever want is you, ooh, ooh
I was born to be loved by somebody
And I know that somebody is you
I'm gonna love you 'til the day that I die
And there ain't nothing that nobody can do
I love the way you
Make love when you make it
And I just wanna make it with you
So I just wanna keep our love alive
So I can go on living, we've got to keep
So don't ever stop what you're giving to me
You're like a summer of breeze on my face
When it looks like there'll be nothing but rain
You brought the sunshine and now I can say
There'll never be a cloudy day again
I love the way that you do
When you do it
And I just wanna do it to you
So I just wanna keep our love alive
So I can go on living, we've got to keep
So don't ever stop what you're giving to me
Don't let it die
Don't let it die
No, don't let it die
We've got to keep
Our love alive
So I can go on living, we've got to keep
So I can go on living
We've got to keep
So don't ever stop what you're giving to me
We've got to keep our love alive
So I can go on living, we've got to keep
So don't ever stop what you're giving to me
