If you've thought it over
And you've made your mind up
You don't want my love any more
If you're gonna leave and
Nothing's gonna stop you
And you're absolutely sure
I want to try to change your mind
Or waste your precious time
Or talk you out of leaving tonight
Just don't ask me to pretend
That I'll fall in love again
The minute you walk out that door
I'm gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss
Every touch and every kiss
I'm gonna miss you, girl, when you go
More than you'll ever know
I don't know what I will do
Don't even have a clue
Can't think that far ahead right now
Do the things you want to
Guilt should never haunt you
I'll go on without you somehow
You don't have to call again
No, I don't need no friend
I could never see you that way
So don't spare me the lie
And I'll promise not to cry
Baby, when you walk away
I'm gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss
Every touch and every kiss
I'm gonna miss you, girl, when you go
More than you'll ever know
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you, whoa, oh
I'm gonna miss you
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
I won't try to change your mind
Or waste your precious time
Or talk you out of leaving tonight
Just don't ask me to pretend
That I'll fall in love again
The minute you walk out that door
I'm gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss
Every touch and every kiss
I'm gonna miss you, girl when you go
More than you'll ever know
