We said that summer we'd go down to Cancun
But no money makes that kind of hard to do
Forget the beach – I’d rather be here with you
Playing Croquet okay, maybe, that’s not true
But you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway
Hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home
We’ll put on bug spray and we'll lose our clothes
Put out the lawn chairs and turn on the hose
We’ll play Jack Johnson, he’s the new Don Ho
And we’ll go surfing, surfing, we'll surf the radio
But you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway
Hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home
Drink margaritas and take in the sunset
Later on we'll slip up to our king size bed
And make love, love, sweet love
You make it easy, easy
Oh, yes, it's easy, easy
But you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway
Hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home
Let's get away baby
Oh, let's get away, baby
Oh...
Go on a little holiday...
