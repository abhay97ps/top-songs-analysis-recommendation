Am I really that much to handle?
Breakin' these niggas down like enamel 
Yet I'm ready to blow you out like a candle
Can I really just blow you out like a candle?
You a man, you say you the man 
You say you 'bout it, you say you got it planned 
I really wasn't tryna listen
You say I ain't got no discipline 
And that there why I wasn't listenin' 
But I need a nigga who can handle me 
I want a, a nigga who can handle me, oh
Nigga keep your hands off me
You wanna stay with me
But nigga, you just a fan of me 
Cuff your bitch, nigga
Nigga, cuff your bitch
Caught you slippin' and a nigga hit a lick on you
Are you really tellin' me that...
I could break you down like a gym, sweat
Fuck it and catch me at V-Live
I'll be sippin' D'USSE 'til I dizzy
Actin' like he care, he just don't decide
I be tryna numb the pain, I be so hizzigh 
Fuck it, you can catch me in the Hills 
Watch me close 'cause I'll be poppin' pills 
All I ask for you to keep it trill 
All I ask for you to keep it real, real, real, real, real
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Real, real, trill, keep one hunnid, oh no
Not too much emotion, no, no
You know I been fucked up, yeah, yeah
I should keep it trill, trill for me
I should keep it real, real, one hunnid
