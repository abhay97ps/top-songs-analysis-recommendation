Nights didn't seem so long no more
Ain't one man like it was before --
Just when I thought I was really okay
I saw Linda yesterday
My heart went up, down
Like a merry-go-round and 'round
Like a forest fire, Down, down
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
Looked like I'd found peace of mind
Looked like I was gonna make it this time --
Just when I thought I was really okay
I saw Linda yesterday
Oh, she smiled that same old smile
My heart was runnin?wild --
My love for her is reelin'Sit around and watch me cry --
People ask what's wrong, I say
"I saw Linda yesterday."
My heart went up, down
Like a merry-go-round and 'round
Like a forest fire, Down, down
Oh, oh, oh, dum-didly, dum-didly, dum-dum-dum...
Hey, hey, dum de dodie-dodie
Hip, hip, dum de dodie-dodie
Hip, hip, dum de dodie-dodie-do
Dum-diddly, dum-diddly, dum-dum...
