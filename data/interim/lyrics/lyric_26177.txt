Dread Woo, nigga, the fuck, nigga?
Fuck is wrong with niggas?
Niggas don't really be on shit 
Niggas really be fuckin' broke, nigga
09 to the fuckin' Swish, nigga
We see niggas in traffic, nigga
Then Ricky run, nigga, yeah
Suck my dick, nigga
To all the fuckin' opps 
You know what's up, nigga, gang 
, look
I make it rain on whoever 
I make it rain, that Woo weather 
Bitch, I'm a dog, a blue devil
I got the hoes like Hugh Hefner 
I make it rain on whoever 
I make it rain, that Woo weather 
Bitch, I'm a dog, a blue devil
I got the hoes like Hugh Hefner 
I can't fuck with these niggas, they not a hundred 
Trap phone keep jumpin' 
Until the fiends don't want it 
Tell Drell keep drummin' 
Tell Dread keep dumpin' 
Run, Ricky, he runnin' , run, Ricky, he runnin', look 
Gas in the air , you can smell the aroma
Bet I change up the motion, Pop Smoke in the Rover
Pop Smoke run 'em over, big wheel in the ocean 
Everything icy , three carats and a pointer
Look, ain't no apology
These niggas doubted me, I keep a pole tucked 
Run up, catch a cold cut 
Put his head on his shoulder 
Got the guns in the sofa 
Nigga, what's the commotion? 
Put the guns in a holster 
'Til they smokin' with the soldiers 
Then I'm back in the deep end 
Trap, trap all season 
Trap open on the weekends 
Niggas mad 'cause I'm eatin' 
And I'm in the flossy 
Where we stay reckless
Twenty-five on the left wrist 
Spent twenty-five on the necklace 
Have your mama like, "Woah, there go Pop Smoke" 
Know the opps can't stand me 
Rolls Royce, no Camry 
Or skrrt off in the Panny 
Hoodie on, duckin' cameras 
If my opps in the foreign 
Then we shootin' up the Phantom 
Know I'm outside , and I keep a pole 
And I'm on the roads , 30K a show 
Get it in between , get it any means 
Amiri for the jeans , let a nigga run 
I make it rain on whoever 
I make it rain, that Woo weather 
Bitch, I'm a dog, a blue devil
I got the hoes like Hugh Hefner 
I make it rain on whoever 
I make it rain, that Woo weather 
Bitch, I'm a dog, a blue devil
I got the hoes like Hugh Hefner 
I can't fuck with these niggas, they not a hundred 
Trap phone keep jumpin' 
Until the fiends don't want it 
Tell Drell keep drummin'
Tell Dread keep dumpin'
Run, Ricky, he runnin', run, Ricky, he runnin', look
Gas in the air, you can smell the aroma
Bet I change up the motion, Pop Smoke in the Rover
Pop Smoke run 'em over, big wheel in the ocean
Everything icy, three carats in the pointer 
Hello, this is a prepaid collect call from Rowdy baby, bitch 
I got the call behind the wall that it's still lit, then fuck it
I told Fetty go and up it
My niggas ain't talkin', they dumpin'
I treat his face like Busta Rhymes, why you say that? I touch it
Then I threw the grip inside of the toilet with no remorse and flushed it
Why niggas still bluffin? I still haven't seen nothin' 
My chain hang, don't tuck it, I touch down, I'm bustin'
Tell the label I need five M's, if not, I ain't signing nothin'
'Cause I'm on a flight with a Russian, getting head, concussion
And niggas saying that it's lit, real shit, it's nothin'
'Cause I'm in the Wraith with your bitch, gettin' lit, stuntin'
Pole out in any weather, shit on Rowdy, you could never
Go and grab your umbrella, 'cause we make it rain on whoever
Baow, we make it rain on whoever
Look, I make it rain on whoever 
I make it rain, that Woo weather 
Bitch, I'm a dog, a blue devil
I got the hoes like Hugh Hefner 
I make it rain on whoever 
I make it rain, that Woo weather 
Bitch, I'm a dog, a blue devil
I got the hoes like Hugh Hefner
