Piano Intro
WOO!
The joint was a jumpin' on the corner 
Down on a Honky Tonk Street 
When all of a sudden up drove a Cadillac 
And out stepped a cat named Pete
Diamonds on-a every finger 
Wore a tailor-made suit
He smoked a black cigar 
He wore a Stetson hat 
He wore a pair-a cowboy boots
He busted on through the doorway 
Bad as-a he could be 
He pulled out his pistol, he turned around
He said, 'My name is a Big Boy Pete'
The music stopped, there wasn't a sound
A-over in the corner stood-a, Bad Man Brown
Brown smiled a grin, he said, 'My friend'
Now Pete said, 'A look it, here buddy' 
'Fore I tan your hide' 
I got a forty-five to keep me alive
Seven bullets on my side
Brown pulled a knife, he jumped on Pete
They fought from the counter right on out to the street
They swung from north, they swung from south
Brown cut that black cigar right outta Pete's mouth!
Pete hit the ground, he yelled and screamed
Now if you're ever down on the corner 
Down on-a Honky Tonk Street 
Don't mess with Brown 
He'll cut you down
Take a message from-a Big Boy Pete
Umm-umm, umm umm umm 
Umm-umm, umm umm umm 
FADES-
Umm, umm, umm
