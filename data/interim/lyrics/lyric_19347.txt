You're doin' all you can, to get in them old jeans
You want that body back, you had at seventeen
Well, baby, don't get down, don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause the way you fill 'em out, hey, that's alright with me
I don't want the girl you used to be
An' if you ain't noticed, the kids are fast asleep, and you're...
One hot mama
You turn me on, let's turn it up, and turn this room into a sauna
One hot mama
Oh, what do you say, babe? You wanna?
Well, I know sometimes you think, that all you really are
Is the woman with the kids, and the groceries in the car
And you worry about your hips, and you worry about your age
Meanwhile I'm tryin' to catch, the breath you take away
Oh, an' believe me, you still do
Baby, all I see, when I look at you, is...
One hot mama
You turn me on, let's turn it up, and turn this room into a sauna
One hot mama
Oh, what do you say, babe? You wanna?
I can't imagine me lovin' someone else
I'm a lucky man, I think Daddy's got himself
One hot mama
You turn me on, let's turn it up, and turn this room into a sauna
One hot mama
Oh, what do you say, babe?
Oh, now what do you say, babe? You wanna?
You're one hot mama
Let's turn this room into a sauna, yeah
What do you say, babe?
What do you say, babe?
