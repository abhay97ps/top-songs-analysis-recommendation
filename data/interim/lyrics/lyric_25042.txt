Wooh
Show time
King's back, argh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pulling off in the 215
Told you it's Meek time
Meek time, it's Meek time, argh
For the love of the city 
All my niggas on the block 
12 o' clock, we ain't wheeling 
Fuck 12 and the cops 
They wanna see me in the cage, I'd rather see me in a Wraith
I'm motivation on the 'gram
I'm going live on these bitches on stage, goddamn
Who love the streets? 
Who dropping heat? 
Who locked the city up, pull up in that Bentley truck
Rest of them motherfuckers see? 
Who dropping shit through the worst? 
Who really dropping that fire? 
Back on the water, they listen when I speak
Who got the key to the streets? 
They was screaming "Free Meek!" 
Now Meek free, judge tryna hold me 
Remember back when I was dead broke
Pretty bitches, they ain't even know me 
Taught these niggas how to post up on the jet
For the 'gram, busting Rollies 
'Member that? I'ma be humble
But I need receipts 'cause these niggas up 
Nigga, ain't nothin' 'bout me average 
Jumping out the Wraith with a bad bitch 
At the Clearport, moonwalking 
Wrist all glitter, Michael Jackson 
Nigga bad, messin' with the rachet 
Same with the internet capping 
When we do a hit, it's a murder
Shit'll get ugly like a catfish
Who came and tripled this work? 
Who shall inherit the Earth? 
Who see the plug, get 'em dirt 
I get 'em bad bitches thirs-ty
Make it rain on 'em, pourin' Champagne on 'em
Bad bitches do whatever I say 
I bought a Rolls Royce just to burn that shit
And set that shit on fire, niggas 
For the love of the city  
All my niggas on the block  
12 o' clock, we ain't wheelin'  
Fuck 12 and the cops  
They wanna see me in the cage, I'd rather see me in a Wraith
I'm motivation on the 'gram
I'm going live on these bitches on stage, gah damn
Who love the streets? 
Who dropping heat? 
Who locked the city up, pull up in that Bentley truck
Rest of them motherfuckers see? 
Who dropping shit through the worst? 
Who really dropping that fire? 
Back on the water, they listen when I speak
Who got the key to the streets? 
Who really popping shit? 
Came to your city and got it lit? 
All of these pretty hoes I done hit 
You better pray that I got a bitch 
I show no mercy on niggas' hoes 
All I gotta do is just like a pic' 
If you a opp, I'ma buy your bitch 
This for the trap, this's not a hit 
Nigga, I'm a icon living, huh
Jumping on the chopper outta prison, huh
Bunch of supermodels wanna visit, huh
I'ma let her lover get a picture, huh
Aventador, Aventador, Aventador 
Turn your hellcat into a kitten 
I can smell rat niggas snitching 
Touch down and it's back to the business
Who they say that's dropping that work? 
Who hit them bad bitches first? 
Who charge 250 a verse? 
Who rap and still get you murked? 
Cops try put me on the north side of Philly
'Cause I'm still popping wheelies like what?
New jewelry, new money on the way
And I just ordered that Rolls Royce truck, ya dig?
For the love of the city 
All my niggas on the block 
12 o' clock, we ain't wheeling 
Fuck 12 and the cops 
They wanna see me in the cage, I'd rather see me in a Wraith
I'm motivation on the 'gram
I'm going live on these bitches on stage, gah damn
Who love the streets? 
Who dropping heat? 
Who locked the city up, pull up in that Bentley truck
Rest of them motherfuckers see? 
Who dropping shit through the worst? 
Who really dropping that fire? 
Back on the water, they listen when I speak
Who got the key to the streets? 
P-H-I double L-Y, he that guy
He never gon' lie, forever be fly
I've been that nigga, I can swear to my god
Cross my heart and put that on my mom
I bought her Patek ice, setting the time
Like Kim Jong, I been ready to bomb
I get gone, take a jet to Dubai
You not a hundred, nigga, 75
You play big, must be ready to die
Nigga for f'ing with I!
