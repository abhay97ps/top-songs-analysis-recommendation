Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby 
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby 
When you left you took the sun right out of the sky, yes, you did
Wondered why you went away and never told me why
When the sun goes down, the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appears
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby 
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby 
Loneliness haunting me when I go to bed, honey
Like a character in a book that I have read
When the sun goes down, the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appears
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it
When the sun goes down, the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appears
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't want to dream about you, baby 
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't want to dream about you, baby
When the sun goes down, the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appears
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't want to dream, dream about you, baby 
Hold back the night, turn on the lights 
Don't want to dream, dream about you, baby 
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't want to dream, dream about you, baby 
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
