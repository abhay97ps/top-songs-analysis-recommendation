If everybody had an ocean
Across the U.S.A
Then everybody'd be surfin'
Like California
You'd see them wearin' their baggies
Huarachi sandals, too
A bushy, bushy blonde hairdo
Surfin' U.S.A
You'll catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar
Ventura County Line
Santa Cruz and Tressels
Australia's Narabine
All over Manhattan and down Doheny way
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A
We'll all be plannin' out a route
We're gonna take real soon
We're waxin' down our surfboards
We can't wait for June
We'll all be gone for the summer
We're on safari to stay
Tell the teacher we're surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A
At Haggarty's and Swami's
Pacific Palisades
San Onofre and Sunset
Redondo Beach, L.A
All over La Jolla and Waiamea Bay
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A
