Mhm, mmm, mhm, mmm, mmm
Oh, oh, oh, oh ho ho oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh
Said I'm singing my heart out to you, baby
 Oh, baby
 Listen to me
There comes a time in a man's life
When he's tired of the games, messing around
He needs a good woman to settle down
And I'm at that time in my, in my life
And I found what I needed in you
I swear I'll always be true, oh
After searching and searching and searching
What treasure I found in you
So baby, I'm ready, say you'll be my lady
And I'll give my all to you, hey hey hey, oh oh
I just can't help myself
I'll tell the world I love you, I love you
See, girl, I don't want no one else
I just can't help myself, oh, oh
I just can't help myself
I'll tell the world I love you, I love you 
I don't want no one else
I just can't help myself
See, I want us to get married and have a family
Can't you see, babY? 
A girl for you 
And a boy for me 
A great big old house, babyb just wait and see, oh baby
I know you wonder, I know you wonder
I know you wonder if I'm serious 
Baby, if you love me like you say you do
Oh, do me a favor, give me your trust
See, 'cause girl, I've had time to think it over
And over and over and over
And if you think that I'm letting you go, baby 
Baby, you must be crazy
I want the whole world to know that I
I just can't help myself
I'll tell the world I love you, I love you
I don't want no one else
I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself
I'll tell the world I love you, I love you
I don't want no one else 
I just can't help myself 
See, my friends think I'm crazy 
For loving you the way that I do
Oh, but they won't understand 
Until they become a man
And find a good woman, good woman like you
I just can't help myself
I'll tell the world I love you, I love you
I don't want no one else
I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself
I'll tell the world I love you, I love you
I don't want no one else
I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself
I'll tell the world I love you, I love you
I don't want no one else
I just can't help myself
