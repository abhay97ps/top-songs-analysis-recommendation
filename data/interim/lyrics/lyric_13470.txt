Chorus/Hook:
And really, Crack until the death of me
Foolish till they find my cold vessel hanging from a tree
They asking how you cook that crack? Well thats easy
3 crazy mothafuckas and a beat thats the recipe
Still really, Crack until the death of me
Foolish till they find my cold vessel hanging from a tree
They asking how you cook that crack? Well thats easy
3 crazy mothafuckas and a beat thats the recipe
Classic Cris:
I wrote this high off orange peels in a jail cell
Biodegradable gotta be good brain cells
Just shanked Shaw in the jaw with my fuckin toenail
Guess the pedi paid off he bled to death without a single yell
For help, honestly im scared of hell
The only thing holdin me back from killin myself
And Im just actin crazy, foolish if ya will
But if you won't then fuck you n everybody in your will
Matter fact, fuck every rapper with a deal
Cuz im better than u all, id love to see u prove me wrong
Now im grown, came a long way from
Sittin at the cool table sendin dicktures to your mom
Tucknastee on the keys let it be known
Word to my 3rd momma thats queen Fiona
Died hard while i was watchin friends
Masturbating to Rachel until i ran outta breath
What a way to go i know i bet ya love my crazy ass
Crackhouse, Classic, Maniac
GKpaypa$tak$:
Dont step up in the crib and then rap like you werent able to
Ill rep it till you bitches screaming crack, and Im thinkin anal too
This fatal proof Im busting at the beat, you bussin tables fool
Get crack on the track you the back of the pack
So bet we turn the tables too
Aye, Im aiming at you Grab the gat and spray it at you
David blaine on acid this the magic Ima lay it on you
Play ya game then save it on you
Im the next in line and they dont got the time to wait on you
Devil in the flesh with a heavenly mind
Im fresher than death call it heaven at night
See I get yo chick wet, you can call me the tide
Because Im always bringing it back and you dont gotta rewind
This cause Im hotter than you wouldve imagined
Me when I hop on this track its a rap again
Clack on on your clique click clack once again
Its the crinack we been-ack
You think were shitty well shinat
We got the city on the mizzap
The mishap was fuckin with us
You get it? you nothin binitch
And nobodys fuckin with us
So fuck with us
Dee Jay:
Paid all my dues and now my dues are payin me
Never be a royal or what the industry Invisions the
So as we proceed to give you what you need I'll keep Rollin up this green and lacin tracks with feddacheene
If you don't like the way I spit my rhymes why don't you change it
Any attempt they'll find the body rottin in the basement
I'm not what it seems in fact a humble person widda thought process some people call it disturbing
I don't like the way you talk il plot to murda you
Bury you alive and brag about the crime to the crew
Make your parents the ingredients for a stremendous stew
Call me Erick cartman when you're eatin them without a clue
The crackhouse consists of a group of foolish dudes
That make chicks devour dicks like a starving African
Them crackheads are back again
Another track to snap again
Bring more heat I'm strapped again
And could say I've almost mastered this
