Sweet, succulent and fine
A twinkling eye on my darling divine
I love the way you move all the way you're designed
Your only lines are my mind, forget the corny line
Now let me hit you off with this question sign
You seem to be the type for me to wine and dine
A little candlelight dinner toasted over some wine
Well, I will hit you off with this lyrical rhyme
Mr. Lover, keep her rockin', Mr. Lover, keep her rockin'
Mr Lover, keep her rockin', and sweat
Now Mr. Lover, keep her rockin', Mr. Lover, keep her rockin'
Mr. Lover, keep her rockin', and sweat
Ooh boy, I love you so
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go 
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy, I love you son 
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go 
I hope you feel the same way too 
Step in my caravan of love
So I can love, gonna give you hotter rubs
Dem ever wet kissies wit' dem brazen hugs
And now your sweet, silky body on my Persian rug
While we sippin' Coke from da same ol' mug
I'm readin' fortune cookies from the Chinese proverb
It had some great stuff written in it with some cool rub-a-dub
A little ol' reminisce in the hot tub, huh
Let's fog up some window sills, girl, uh
Ooh boy, I love you so
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go 
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy, I love you son
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go 
I hope you feel the same way too 
Girlie, girlie

Girl, you're unique
Now let me take a whiff of that sweet physique
You're the only girl allowed to make my heart stop beatin'
Let me, ha, ha, start lickin' , let's kick it heartlessly
To be the lady of your color is an honor indeed
Leave a lastin' impression for weeks and weeks
I want to throw rose petals to your humble feet
Lay you gently on my sheet and sexercise you to sleep, huh
Let's fog up some window sills, girl, uh
Let's fog up some window sills, girl, uh
Ooh boy, I love you so

And the girls get moist for the sound of the baritone voice
You get that, you get that
