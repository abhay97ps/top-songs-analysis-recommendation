Somebody hit the lights, so we can rock it day and night
People gettin' down, that's right
From AM to PM 
Everybody lookin' like stars 
All the chicks and the fellas in the bars 
All of y'all bumpin' this in your cars 
From AM to PM
Come on, yeah
Bloodshy... Milian
Everybody wanna get down
When you hear the sound and you bump the beat
Three sixty-five days a year
Twenty-four a day, seven days a week
Now when you're driving in your four by four
And you turn this up on your stereo
Whether night or day, non-stop, you'll play
And you know you still want more
So, find a honey that's standing on the wall
All the girls get the guys on the floor
From the front to the back, let's go
Hear this 
Somebody hit the lights, so we can rock it day and night
People gettin' down, that's right
From AM to PM
Everybody lookin' like stars
All the chicks and the fellas in the bars
All of y'all bumpin' this in your cars
From AM to PM
Ooh-ooh, yeah
Everybody in the club, c'mon
Keep bobbin' your head now to this song
You got the beats and breaks and your body shake
And we're doin' it all night long
Any time or place
Any place or time
No, we don't need no sleep
Three sixty-five days a year
Twenty-four a day, seven days a week
So, find a honey that's standing on the wall 
All the girls get the guys on the floor
From the front to the back, let's go 
Hear this 
Somebody hit the lights, so we can rock it day and night
People gettin' down, that's right
From AM to PM
Everybody lookin' like stars 
All the chicks and the fellas in the bars
All of y'all bumpin' this in your cars
From AM to PM
Somebody hit the lights, so we can rock it day and night
People gettin' down, that's right
From AM to PM 
Everybody lookin' like stars 
All the chicks and the fellas in the bars
All of y'all bumpin' this in your cars

Three sixty-five days a year
Twenty-four a day, yeah, yeah

All night we rock that beat
So you know what to do
Just make it move, and make it move, yeah
Find a honey that's standing on the wall
