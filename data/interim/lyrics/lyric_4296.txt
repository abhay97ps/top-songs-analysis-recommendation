Train whistle blowing
Makes a sleepy noise
Underneath their blankets
For all the girls and boys
CHORUS
Rocking, rolling, riding
Out along the bay
All bound for Morningtown
Many miles away
Driver at the engine
Fireman rings the bell
Sandman swings the lantern
To show that all is well
CHORUS
Maybe it is raining
Where our train will ride
All the little travellers
Are warm and snug inside
CHORUS
Somewhere there is sunshine
Somewhere there is day
Somewhere there is Morningtown
Many miles away
CHORUS
