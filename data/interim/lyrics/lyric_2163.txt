Well hello there
My it's been a long, long time
How’m I doin'
Oh I guess that I'm doin’ fine
It's been so long now
And it seems that it was only yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away
How's your new love
I hope that he's doin' fine
I heard ya told him
That you'd love till the end of time
Now that's the same thing that you told me
Seems like just the other day
Ain’t it funny how time slips away?
’Gotta go now
Guess I'll see you around
’Don't know when though
I never know when I'll be back in town
But remember what I tell you
That "in time you're gonna pay"
And it’s surprisin' how time slips away
