I'm here to love you
Lay my heart on the line for you
Live and die for you
Sure as the sunrise, baby
You can bet that I'll be around
No way I'll go, I'll stay so close
I'll be there
I've made a commitment of the heart
To keep this love together
I, I'll do whatever it takes
To make this love work out
I, I'm in this forever
I promise from the start, my baby
Commitment of the heart
I'll be right there beside you
To share the good and the bad times, too
Pledge my soul only to you
And when you turn to me, baby
You can bet I won't turn away
I won't walk out, no way, no how
I'll be there
I've made a commitment of the heart
To keep this love together
I, I'll do whatever it takes
To make this love work out
I, I'm in this forever
I promise from the start, my baby
Commitment of the heart
Commitment of the heart
I promise from the start, my baby
To always love you
I'm committed every minute
To always show you
Show you all the love you need
There's nothing I won't do
I'll do it all for you, baby
I'll be there
Committed to your heart, baby
I've made a commitment of the heart
To keep this love together
I, I'll do whatever it takes
To make this love work out
I, I'm in this forever
I promise from the start, my baby...
