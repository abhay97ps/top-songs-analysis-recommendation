There's something that I want to say
But words sometimes get in the way
I just want to show my feelings for you
There's nothing that I'd rather do
Than spend every moment with you
I guess you should know, I love you so
You are my lady
You're everything I need and more
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for
There's no way that I can resist
Your precious kiss
Girl, you've got me so hypnotized
Just say that you'll stay with me 
'Cause our love was meant to be
I promise to love you more each day
You are my lady 
You're everything I need and more 
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for
You are my lady, yeah 
You're everything I need and more 
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for
I love your shine, shine, shine, shine
Let's make it last until the end of time
Ooh, ooh ooh, woo, whoa-ho, oh-ho
You are my lady, yes you are 
You're everything I need and more 
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for
You are my lady 
You're everything I need and more 
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for
Go out and tell the world 
That you're my girl 
Sweeter than the day, the day, the day before 
Ooh, you're all I'm living for
I love the way you move, girl 
I love you so, yeah 
Come on, let me love you, baby, baby 
Ooh, you're all I'm living for
