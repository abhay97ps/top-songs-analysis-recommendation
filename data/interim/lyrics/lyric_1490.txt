HULLY GULLY BABY
The Dovells
I went down to Miami
I met a girl named Sammy
The moon was bright
The time was right
I said, a hey girl, I love you
What ja wanna do
An' she said a hully gully, baby
Hully gully baby
All I wanna do with you
Is a hully gully baby
We said goodbye to Mammy
Hit ev'ry joint in Miami
We danced all night
Till dawn's early light
I said, a hey girl, I love you
What ja wanna do
An' she said a hully gully baby
