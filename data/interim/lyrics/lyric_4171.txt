Lately these days I get so paranoid
With so many stories of families broken
Fathers being deployed
All for this war that no one really wants
Too many doctors
Too many headstones
Too many dying to count
If we could today we'd bring them all back home
But they'll never listen
These politicians
Their hearts have turned to stone
And if we had a voice then by God we be heard
But we're so divided
And we're undecided
So we never say a word
And we all go to sleep
Like good little sheep
Never make a peep
So I'm taking a stand
And I'm making demands
And I'll stand even if I have to stand alone
And say
Bring
The
Troops
Back
Home
With all of the beauty to behold in this world
Why would you want to feed the destruction?
With all of wonders to witness in this world
Why would you want to see Armageddon?
With all of the things you could be in this world
Why would you go and be a soldier man?
Oh, oh, oh, oh I
Oh I, I think I know why
Cause when you were 3 years old
They put a toy gun in your hand, and
They showed you shows of G.I. Joes how could you overstand
The difference between fiction and reality?
Oh if your parents knew how it impacted you they would've burned the TVs
But they were too busy 
Working for the man
And they were too busy 
Just fitting into the plan
So when you were 6 years old
They put you in the Boy Scouts
So harmless it seemed to be marching waving the flag about
But they already got you wearing that uniform on your back
Using weapons, earning medals, gaining rank in your pack
Yeah it's the symbolism 
That keeps you coming back
Esoteric symbolism 
That they subconscious tap
Oh yes the symbolism 
Keep you slipping through the cracks
It's the symbolism 
Got your mind under attack
But youth put on your thinking cap
Don't get caught in their trap
No
With all of the creativity in this world
Why would you create nuclear weapons?
With all of wonders to witness in this world
Why would you want to see Armageddon?
With all of the billion things to be in this world, oh why
Why would you go and be a soldier man?
Oh I
Oh I'm starting to see why
Cause when you were 13 years old
You joined the ROTC
Your high school version of your immersion in the military
They got you dreaming of that M16 in your hands
Heroically killing enemies for democracy in a foreign land
Why it's the mind control 
That keeps you killing blindly
Government mind control 
Been going on for centuries
So when you were 18 years old
The recruiters came to your school
With fancy dress and propaganda trying to make you their fool
Telling you you're never gonna amount to anything
But look at all of the rewards and benefits Uncle Sam will bring
Just sign on the dotted line
The officer says with a grin
Sign your name on the dotted line
Just there and we'll take you in
Just pick up the pen and sign
We'll take care of everything
Sign your name on the dotted line
And your bright future can begin
But can you hear the bugle play
As you sign your life away, yeah
Oh Lord
Give me one good reason
Give me one good outcome
From all of this killing
It don't make no sense
Oh so many are dying
Orphaned babies crying
In the name of freedom
What a false pretense
Oh with all the money
All the power
All the souls that you devour
Mr. Politician man
It could never equal the power of Jah love that I hold in the fingers of my pure, clean hands
So Mr. Soldier man
I'm begging you come back home
Oh Military man
Leave them war machines alone
Cause them politicians sit in their mansion
Reaping all the benefits
While you lay dying in the trenches
And they just don't give a shit
No
Oh Lord there's got to be a better way
To communicate
I don't believe that killing man
Makes us more safe
Lord I know the opposite is true
Oh how 'bout you?
Do you buy into the news?
Have they got you so confused?
But when I feel the pressure in the air
I get so scared
Will we live to see another day?
Another month, another year?
How can I protect my family
From these crazy
Leaders addicted to war
Tell 'em we don't need no more of these
Broken dreams
And fantasies
Are falling down the well
Or Daddy's gone
And left his family
A living hell
So many die
Lifeless they lie
In graves with names unknown
Oh Mommy cries
Waits for her son
Who is never coming home
Oh Lord so we don't need
Oh no, no we don't need
Oh no we don't need
No more war
Oh no our wounds won't mend
By hurting them
So what are we fighting for?
Oh Lord no we don't need
No, no we don't need
Oh no we don't need
No more war
Not in Iraq
Not in Afghanistan
Not in Libya
Not in Israel
Palestine no
We don't wanna see more
Brothers coming home in body bags
Wrapped up in American flags
Bloody in American flags
We don't wanna see no more villages burned
We don't wanna see no more innocent victims dying
No more orphaned babies crying
We don't want no more
No more war, yeah
Oh no, no we don't need
Oh no, no we don't need
Oh no we don't need
No more war
