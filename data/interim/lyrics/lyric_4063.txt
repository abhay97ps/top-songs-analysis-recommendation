Stop, look and listen
Stop, look and listen
Stop, look and listen
Before you leap
 and think it over
 into my eyes
 to what I'm gonna say
 you'll never find
 as good as mine
 if desire's what you?
I know you've grown familiar
To her touch but she's
Still a stranger
Don't give up
The sweetness we shared
Baby 
You're heading for danger
Whoo, baby 
You're heading for danger
So before you leap
Before you leap
You better stop, look and listen
Stop, look and listen
Stop, look and listen
Before you leap
You better look before you leap
The water looks shallow
But it's, it's really deep
Don't get out, out over your head
Baby 
You're heading for danger
Whoo, baby 
You're heading for danger
So before you leap
Before you leap
 and think it over
 into my eyes
 to what I'm gonna say
 you'll never find
 as good as mine
 if desire's what you?
