Get down, now
Walkin' through the moonlight
'Til the sun gets in our eyes
Holdin' on for dear life
As we grab the sunrise
We'll have it made, together
We'll have it made, yeah
Every eye will follow
But none will understand
Most love is hollow
But ours has strength to stand
We'll have it made, together
We'll have it made, yeah
'Cause when we build all our dreams come true
And every day we'll find things to do
Could make this love as endless as time
Together we will leave tears behind
Ridin' high on the future
We know which way to climb
We've found what's due us
And we'll get it all the time
We'll have it made, together
We'll have it made, yeah
Ooh
We'll have it made
Ooh oh alright
'Cause when we build all our dreams come true
And every day we'll find things to do
Could make this love as endless as time
Together we will leave tears behind
Ridin' high on the future
We know which way to climb
We found what's due us
And we'll get it all the time
We'll have it made, together
We'll have it made, yeah
Get with it now
We'll have it made
Ooh baby
Baby, have it made
Oh
We'll have it made
Ridin' on the future
