Yeah, oh, ah, ah, ah
You know what it is
When your head go back and forth
So so def, ha, ha
Chant√©, 2K 
Baby, come on, come on, come on
Straight up I can love you forever, yo 
'Cause you're the kind of guy I can settle for
I'm not the type to love you and let you go
Let me know, it's now or it's never, yo
'Cause I know them other girls try and do you in 
But I'm not the average girl you've been fooling with
'Cause those other females are counterfeit
But everything all up here's legit
It's like this, like this, like that, baby
Put the other girls way to the back, baby 
So you know I'm not just talking that stuff, baby
Call me up and let me know what's up, baby 
Here's the number to my cell
Now hit me on the hip
Here's the number to the crib where I really live
 I'm not thinking 'bout them other chicks
 They ain't even coming close to this
Here's the number to my job
Or call me in the whip
Now how many chicks you know come with this?
 'Cause I'm tryna put you on to this
 And I'm not just talking it
So tell me, baby, are you spoken for ?
'Cause I don't see a ring on your finger, boy 
Excuse me if I'm bold with my question now
But I'm not looking for a hit and run
Don't you tell me how those other girls used to be
Just think about you getting used to me
I'ma show you everything you tryna see
I'ma put you right where you need to be 
It's like this, like this, like that, baby
Put the other girls way to the back, baby 
So you know I'm not just talking that stuff, baby
Call me up and let me know what's up, baby 
Here's the number to my cell
Now hit me on the hip
Here's the number to the crib where I really live
 I'm not thinking 'bout them other chicks
 They ain't even coming close to this
Here's the number to my job
Or call me in the whip
Now how many chicks you know come with this?
 'Cause I'm tryna put you on to this
 And I'm not just talking it 
A lot of girls won't do the things I do 
A lot of girls won't say the things I say 
Know that all of this is true 
Talking 'bout me loving you
 Boy, I do
Coming straight up asking me
Lettin' you know what I'm about 
With a game sweeter than can be
So, baby, won't you check me out?
Y'all know what it is
When your head go back and forth
Y'all know what it is
When your head go back and forth
Here's the number to my cell
Now hit me on the hip
Here's the number to the crib where I really live
 I'm not thinking 'bout them other chicks
 They ain't even coming close to this
Here's the number to my job
Or call me in the whip
Now how many chicks you know come with this?
 'Cause I'm tryna put you on to this
 And I'm not just talking it
Here's the number to my cell
Now hit me on the hip
Here's the number to the crib where I really live
 I'm not thinking 'bout them other chicks
 They ain't even coming close to this

 'Cause I'm tryna put you on to this
 And I'm not just talking it, talking it
Here's the number to my cell

 They ain't even coming close to this
Here's the number to my job
