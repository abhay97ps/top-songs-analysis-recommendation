Where ya going off to? The beach, that's a bet 
It's summertime so it's time to get some of these
Some of those and I won't call whores
'Cause in the 90's you gotta respect the ladies
So step up to 'em and say, we love you sweet Sadie, uh
That's how you get your true mack on but
Brothers be stepping up, popping that sad song
Hey don't I know you from somewhere?

I pull up in the lot, pop the trunks, make their heads bob
And it's sunny so it's time to get a summer bunny, yeah

So beep, beep, beep, it's time for me to make a move
I'm on my way to his picnic
Yeah, but I wanna be early, fool
So I can catch the new bunnies coming in just like the old school
Strolling the block so I can check the scenery
The sun plays, the day is feeling good to me, huh
I can just smell the funky beats
You know the flavor "In Between the Sheets"
I saw my boy Big Al, I said, "Just keep it straight"
He said, "I know I got a novelty to validate"
So who's the bunny looking sweet like a honeycomb?
He say, "No my brother, you gots to get your own summer bunny, yeah
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy

This party is packed tops, word to the mother
I love it when there's three bunnies to one brother
And wine coolers is what I'm packing, yeah
And when I get my buzz on is when I start bunny-jacking
Jacking fools for their bunnies
'Cause I'm the K, the E, the double L, the Y, they wanna get with me
And the PAs in the house 
So check, check, check it out
My stomach is growling so it's time to get my hungry on
Some soul food, Kool-Aid and you know it's on
Then after that I hate to eat and run but I'm outtie, my homie
