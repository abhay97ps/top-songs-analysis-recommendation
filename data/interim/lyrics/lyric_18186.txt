I was standing in the grocery store line
The one they marked express
When this woman came through with about 25 things
And I said don't you know that more is less
She said this world is moving so fast
I just get more behind with every day
And every morning when I make my coffee
I can't believe my life's turned out this way
All I could say was
Love's the only house
Big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house
Big enough for all the pain
He was walking by the other day and I said
Hey baby, how you've been
Yeah I got me a little girl now and she's 4 years old
And she's got her daddy's little grin
And you only wanted what you can't have
And baby you can't have me now
I gave my heart to another
Yeah I'm a mother and he's a father and we're a family and we got each other
And I found out the hard way that
You drive three miles from all this prosperity
Down across the river and you see a ghetto there
And we got children walking around with guns
And they got knives and drugs and pain to spare
And here I am in my clean white shirt
With a little money in my pocket and a nice warm home
And we got teenagers walking around in a culture of darkness
Living together alone, all I can say is
And I can't explain it and I can't understand
But I'll come down and get my hands dirty
And together we'll make a stand
Somewhere 'cross the parking lot some bands playing out of tune
City streets are going burn if we don't do something soon
And se√±orita can't quit crying
Baby's due now any day
Don Juan left got sick of trying
No one there to show him the way
She came down to the grocery store
And she said I want to buy a little carton of milk
But I don't have any money
I said hey I'll cover you honey
Because the pain's got to go somewhere
Yeah the pain's got to go someplace
So come on down to my house
Don't you know that
