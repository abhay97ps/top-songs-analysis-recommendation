There's a place down the street we call Sam's Place
It starts a-jumpin' every evening when the sun goes down
You can always find me down at Sam's Place
For that's where the gang all hangs around
There's ol' Shimmy Shakin' Tina
She hails from Pasadena
She always got a big smile on her face
There's Hootch-y-kootchy Hattie, she comes from Cincinnati
Yeah, there's always a party at Sam's Place
Well, they've got a swingin' band down at Sam's Place
You can hear 'em pickin' twenty blocks away
They're playin' country music down at Sam's Place
From the setting sun until the break of day
There's ol' Shimmy Shakin' Tina
She hails from Pasadena
She always got a big smile on her face
There's Hootch-y-kootchy Hattie, she comes from Cincinnati
Yeah, there's always a party at Sam's Place
And I'll meet you tonight at Sam's Place
