I look at you
You look at me
It's obvious
We have some chemistry
Girl I wanted so long to know
Now you're telling me you gotta let it go
I never thought that this day would come
I realize that you're the one
What's inside of my heart it ain't going to change
So it shouldn't be so easy to walk away
Baby, I don't know what love Is
Maybe I'm a fool
I just know what I'm Feeling
And it's all because of you
Don't tell me
I don't know
I want the truth
Because they call it
We call it
You call it
I call it love
It's so clear for you to see
Why they can't they just let us be happy
If you know whats really in your heart
Then don't let them tear us apart
(Because you feel it, I feel it
Let's think this through)
Baby, I don't know what love Is
Maybe I'm a fool
I just know what I'm Feeling
And it's all because of you 
Don't tell me
I don't know
I want the truth
Because they call it
We call it
You call it
I call it love
We have a bond that's unbreakable
And it's not time to let it go 
And now that we know it's real
We are going to let it show
To the whole world
That I'm yours forever
And you're my girl 
You might live with me, oh oh
I don't know
Baby, I don't know what love Is
Maybe I'm a fool 
I just know what I'm Feeling
And it's all because of you 
Don't tell me
I don't know
I want the truth 
Because they call it
We call it
You call it
I call it love
Baby, I don't know what love Is
Maybe I'm a fool
I just know what I'm Feeling
And it's all because of you
Don't tell me
I don't know
I want the truth
Because they call it
We call it
You call it
I call it love
Love
They call it love
I call it
Love
