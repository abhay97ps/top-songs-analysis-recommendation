L.A., 
 New York
Everybody knows you've been chasin' that rock
Chasin' the rock, chasin' the rock
Everybody knows up and down the block
That you've been chasin' the rock, chasin' that rock
And if you don't give it up, you might be in for a shock
Homeboy had a good job, his bed was laid
A pretty young wife, man, he had it made
His two little kids, they were the apple of his eye
You know he had it all together, i tell you no lie
One night in a club, in a moment of weakness
He met a real fine dame, she said her name was Pеaches
They went ovеr to her house and she pulled out a pipe
And ever since then my man just hasn't been right
He missed days from the job, neglecting his rent
Started smelling funky everywhere he went
Now his two little kids, they even know what's up
They just look at their dad, and say "D, what's up?"
Homegirl's got her welfare check
And it's just about enough to cover the rent
But she went over to her friend's house and took one hit
And now she wonders where her money went
She couldn't afford food for the kids to eat
She couldn't afford shoes to put on their feet
But she told her grandmama she was going out to shop
And all night long she was hitting that rock
 He smoked his whole check
And now it's all gone and he's getting depressed
He didn't think about his bills at all this week
So they turned off his gas and electricity
Now he's thinking about how he can buy himself more
He's down on his knees, looking for pieces on the floor
You know the sweetness of life is what he really should be tasting
Instead of wasting his life always chasing and basing
Do you wanna go up, do you wanna go down
When you fool with that rock you mess your whole life around
Now if you ever ever dreamed about making it to the top
You're never gonna make it if you're chasing that rock
He's just-a chasing, he's just a-basing
He's just-a chasing, he's just a-basing
Take a look at your face, take a look at your face
It's all broken out and you're losing weight
Take a look at your face, just take a look at your face
You know you just can't win when you mess with that base
