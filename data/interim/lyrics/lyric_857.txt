Heart and soul
I fell in love with you, heart and soul
The way a fool would do madly
Because you held me tight
And stole a kiss in the night
Heart and soul
I begged to be adored, lost control
And tumbled overboard gladly
That magic night we kissed
There in the moon mist
Oh, but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling
Never before were mine so strangely willing
Uh huh, but now I see
What one embrace can do, look at me
It's got me loving you madly
That little kiss you stole
Held all my heart and soul
Bom ba bom bom, ba dip da dip dip
Da da da da, dun, dun, da ding, da ding, da dong
Bom ba bom bom, ba dip da dip dip
Da bom ba ba bom bom, dip, da dip, da dip
Oh, but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling
Never before were mine so strangely willing
Yeah, but now I see
What one embrace can do, look at me
It's got me loving you madly
That little kiss you stole
Held all my heart and soul
