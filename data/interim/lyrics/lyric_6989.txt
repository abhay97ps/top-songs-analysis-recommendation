I like the way you smile at me
I felt the heat that enveloped me
And what I saw I liked to see
I never knew where evil grew
I should have steered away from you
My friend told me to keep clear of you
But something drew me near to you
I never knew where evil grew
Evil grows in the dark
Where the sun it never shines
Evil grows in cracks and holes
And lives in people's minds
Evil grew, it's part of you
And now it seems to be
That every time I look at you
Evil grows in me
If I could build a wall around you
I could control the thing that you do
But I couldn't kill the will within you
And it never shows
The place where evil grows
Evil grows in the dark
Where the sun it never shines
Evil grows in cracks and holes
And lives in people's minds
Evil grew, it's part of you
And now it seems to be
That every time I look at you
Evil grows in me
