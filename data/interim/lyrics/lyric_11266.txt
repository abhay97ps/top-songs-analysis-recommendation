I never knew love like this before
Now I'm lonely never more
Since you came into my life
You are my lovelight this I know
And I'll never let you go
You're my all, you're part of me
Once I was lost and now I'm found
Then you turned my world around
When I need I call your name
Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise
Cause I never knew love like this before
This feeling's so deep inside of me
Such a tender fantasy
You're the one I'm living for
You are my sunlight and my rain
And time could never change
What we share forevermore
I never knew love like this before
Now I'm lonely never more
Since you came into my life
Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise
Cause I never knew love like this before
You are my lovelight this I know
And I'll never let you go
You're my all, you're part of me
Once I was lost and now I'm found
Then you turned my world around
When I need I call your name
Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise
Cause I never knew love like this before
Inside of me
Never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
 Never
 Never
 I never knew, I never knew, I never
 Never
 Never
 I never knew, I never knew, I never knew
 Never
 Never
 I never knew
 Never knew
 Never
 I never knew
 Never knew
 Never
 I never knew, I never knew, I never knew
 I never knew, I never knew, I never knew
 I never
 Never knew love like
Never knew
 Never knew
 Never
 Opened my eyes
 What a surprise
 Never
 I never knew
