Oh, I love you when you hug and kiss me
I get the feeling that you really miss me
Girl, I can't stand it when you start acting funny
And look at me like I'm buggin' you honey
Oh, moody woman 
You change like the weather
Moody woman 
But you got it together
Moody, moody, moody woman 
I love you
You bet your life I do
Oh variety is the spice of life
Guess the pain makes the pleasure nice
You make my day when you say you need me
But, that's no way to play when you say you're gonna leave me
Moody woman 
Oh, I love you
Moody woman 
I think the world of you
Moody, moody, moody woman 
I love you
Oh baby you could be impossibly smart
You know you can, girl
But I know you love me
You think the world of me
And you got a great big heart
People tell me that love's blind
There ain't no love as blind as mine
And though I have to suffer when you're feeling blue
My life would be much tougher if I didn't have you
Oh, Moody baby 
I know all about you
Moody woman 
Can't live without you
Moody, moody, moody 
Woman, I love you
You bet your life I do
Oh, moody woman 
You know I love you
Moody woman 
I think the world of you
You have been my whole life, baby
Moody woman 
I don't wanna leave you
Moody baby 
You know that I need you
Why don't you let me love you?
Moody woman, I just wanna seize ya
Moody woman you know that I need ya
