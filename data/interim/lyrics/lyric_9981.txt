Lost
Lost as a child's first thought
I must have arms to hold me
Lost without loving care
I must have my fair share
Fair
Fair is a changing word
But fair is an honored promise
Justice, if you're still there
I will have my fair share
Justice is a lady
Lay me down with justice in a long white gown
With a breath of love, we can share
Share
Sleep with me if you dare
Celebrate my fair share
Fair
Fair is a changing word
But fair is an honored promise
Justice, if you're still there
I will have my fair share
Justice is a lady
Lay me down with justice in a long white gown
With a breath of love, we can share
Share
Sleep with me if you dare
Celebrate my fair share
