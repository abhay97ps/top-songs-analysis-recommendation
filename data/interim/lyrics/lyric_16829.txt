Seen you naked in the bath
Cigarette stains on your hands
Wilted flowers in a vase
I ask how are you? Yeah, how are you?
I see your lipstick on your glass
And I think you're drunk, I start to laugh
I find your note, the letters ran
It said, "I loved you, yeah, I loved you"
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Sixteen candles down the drain
I watch you passed out for awhile
Touch your face and start to smile
And on your note is my reply
I wish I'd loved you, I wish I'd loved you
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Sixteen candles down the drain
The drain
The drain
The drain
The drain
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Sixteen Candles down the drain
The drain
The drain
The drain
The drain, the drain, the drain
