If you wanted that star that shines so brightly
To match the stardust in your eye
Darlin', I would chase that bright star nightly
And try to steal it from the sky
'Cause I would give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your tasty kiss thrills me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never, ever let you go
And if you needed a dream to keep you smiling
I'll tell the sandman you were blue
And I'll ask him to keep that sand a-piling
'Til your dreams would come true
'Cause I would give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your tasty kiss thrills me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never, ever let you go
If you wanted a love to last forever
Then I would send my love your way
And my love would only last forever
But forever and a day
'Cause I would give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your tasty kiss thrills me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never, ever let you go
