Whatever you got, I want
Whatever you want, I'll give to you
Whatever you got, I want
Whatever it takes
I'm willing to do girl
Your eyes speak, your walk is rhythm in motion, hum...
You're too hot to handle
You're full of emotion, girl
My pride's weak
I can tell I'm standing in line
Again yeah
When you pass by, guys double take
It's a crime,yeah
Where there's a will there's a way
Even with the games you play
Girl, you've got a one track mind
Make you mine to stay
Whatever you got, I want
Whatever you want, I'll give to you
Whatever you got, I want
Whatever it takes
I'm willing to do, girl
You got me right on your finger tips
But i'm gonna keep my balance, I won't slip
Your sunshine ain't gonna melt my heart, yeah
If you let it shine on me we'll never part
Where there's a will there's a way
Even will the games you play
Girl, you've got a one track mind
I'll make you mine to stay, no, no
Whatever you got, I want
Whatever you want, I'll give you
Whatever you got, I want
Whatever it takes
I'm willing to do, girl
