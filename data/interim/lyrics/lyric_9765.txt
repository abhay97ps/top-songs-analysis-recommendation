Oh, you can't stop dancin'
Just because the music's gone
You know you can't stop dancin'
Yeah, yeah
Just because
The band has packed it up and gone home
You know you can't stop dancin'
Just because the music's gone
Cause if you keep on dancin'
If you keep on dancin'
If you keep on dancin'
You're gonna turn the music back on
There's a rhythm in the universe
And the music is always there
But whenever life goes wrong
Sometimes it's so hard to hear just the same
We've got to move with the time
If you don't
You're gonna be left behind
Just remember that the beat goes on
Pretty soon
They're gonna play your song
And you can't stop dancin'
Just because the music's gone
You know you can't stop dancin'
Yeah, yeah
Just because
The band has packed it up and gone home
You know you can't stop dancin'
Just because the music's gone
Cause if you keep on dancin'
If you keep on dancin'
If you keep on dancin'
You're gonna turn the music back on
