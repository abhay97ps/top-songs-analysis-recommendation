I got Elvis on my elbow
When I flex Elvis talks
I got hula girls on the back of my leg
And she hulas when I walk
Speaking cherry red
Screaming electric green
Purple mountains' majesty
Really talk to me
Talk to me babe!

Tramp stamp tat
Mousewife to Momshell in the time it took
To get that new tattoo
Show me your dragon magic
So autobiographic
Best believe that needle hurt you
Best to see these true colors than follow one of your false virtues
Tell you a secret to make you think
Why is this crazy stuff we'd never say poetry in ink?
Speaking day-glow red, Explodo pink
Purple mountain's majesty
Tell me you, I'll show you me

Mousewife to Momshell in the time it took
To get that new tattoo
Woo!
Sexy dragon magic
So very autobiographic
Got a hold on me
You put a spell on me-eehh
Baby-yeeaahh
Uncle Danny had a coal tattoo
He fought for the unions - some of us still do
On my shoulder is a number of the Chapter he was in
That number is forever like the struggle here to win
Everybody!

Mousewife to Momshell in the time it took to get that new tattoo
Tattoo, Tat-too!
Sexy dragon magic
So very autobiographic!
You got a hold on me
You put a spell on me
I'm in love with you
Show me, show me your
Look at me, look at you!
Whoa!
