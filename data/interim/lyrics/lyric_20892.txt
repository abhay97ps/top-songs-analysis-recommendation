Got the news today
Doctor said I had to stay a little bit longer and I'll be fine
When I thought it'd all been done
When I thought it'd all been said
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, no, no
You don't even know
All this time goes by, still no reason why
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
Waiting on a cure, but none of them are sure
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, no, no
You don't even know
You don't even know, no, no
You don't even know, no, no
Yeah
But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low, yeah
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, yeah, oh
You don't even know, no, no
So I'll wait 'til kingdom come
All the highs and lows are gone
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
I'll be fine
