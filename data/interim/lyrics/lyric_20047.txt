Free, you better love me
And hide or run away 
From all your yesterdays
Speak the truth, or make your peace some other way
Oh yeah, yeah
I never knew, but I believe that your trust in me
Oh, will speak to me
In way beyond your controlling mind 
And no more believing in all your precious lies
Yeah
Speak the truth, or make your peace some other way
Oh yeah, yeah
I never knew, but I believe that your trust in me
Oh, will speak to me
Speak the truth, or make your peace some other way
Oh yeah, yeah
I never knew, but I believe that your trust in me
Oh, will speak to me
In finding balance between lies and trust
They'll never be a better
Source than to speak your truth
Or make your peace in some other way
Speak the truth, or make your peace some other way
Oh yeah, yeah
I never knew, but I believe that your trust in me
Oh, will speak to me
Speak the truth, or make your peace some other way
Oh yeah, yeah
I never knew, but I believe that your trust in me
Oh, will speak to me
Speak
Oh, speak
Speak
Oh, speak
Speak
