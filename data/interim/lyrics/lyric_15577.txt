When I turn back all the pages
Of my life through all the stages
It's been you through all the changes
I been through, it was always you
There to make me be strong
And helpin' me to hold on through it all
It was your love that got me through the night
No one's ever known me better, baby
Through your eyes, I can see the mirror of my soul
You're the story of my life
You're the one that got me through the night
You've been right here by my side
When I needed you, when I needed you
You were there to make it right
If I wrote a book, you'd be in every line
For all time, you're the story
You're the story of my life
When I think about tomorrow
There'll be joy and there'll be sorrow
But I know that I will follow you
'Cause I'm lost without your love
I'll be there, there when you need me
There like the very air you're breathin'
You're my blood, oh, my love
Oh, you're the story of my life
You're the one that got me through the night
You've been right here by my side
When I needed you, when I needed you
You were there to make it right
If I wrote a book, you'd be in every line
For all time, you're the story
You're the story of my life
Through the night
No one's ever known me better, baby
Through your eyes, I can see the mirror of my soul
Oh, you're the story of my life
You're the one that got me through the night
You've been right here by my side
When I needed you, when I needed you
You were there to make it right
If I wrote a book, you'd be in every line
For all time, you're the story
You're the story of my life
You're the one that got me through the night
When I needed you, you know I needed you
You were there to make it right
If I wrote a book, you'd be in every line
For all time, you're the story
You're the story of my life
You're the story of my life, oh
You're the story of my life
