Man, disagreements turn into fights
Got us shouting back and forth to prove who's wrong and right
You mad as hell because of something I said
While I'm confused because I don't even think it's really that big
And it's crazy when you are angry
I'm looking at your expressions
I get a different perspective
Like damn baby you sexy
I'm smiling because I'm feeling it
I promise I take you serious
It's just those mad faces make me want to experiment
Like I know you mad but can we take a minute
Instead of trying to makе a point let's make a new positions
I know you wanna talk this out lеt's do it when we finish
Cause only thing up on mind is handling this business
You sexy when you are mad please don't get offended
Distracted by what Im seeing make it hard to listen
You wanna get everything out I wanna get up in it
I work you out and we can work this out when we are finished
Lets just take a second take an intermission
Yeah I hear you talking but its hard to listen
Baby girl you sexy when you mad
Got a nigga thinking like
Can we talk about this later
After I put it on you
Can we talk about this later
After I put it down
Talk about it later
Why you always doing all this stupid shit
I try to be serious and you ruin it
But i won't give into it, I'm here listening
I peep both are sides ain't the same this ain't symmetry
Your eyes gazing at me, you tryna offset my energy
You know that little look that you be giving me
Its the same exact look when you be kissing me
You really trying to taste this treat but you ain't tricking me
Right, you think you slick don't ya
Grabbing my hips won't make me shut up but you wish don't ya
And you love it when I'm pissed don't ya
You say you like it when I'm mean
Unless theres cameras and the mood set you not tryna make a scene
I yell your name many times but you tryna make me scream
And you asking for desert, you talking peaches with the cream
I'm not gone give up and say to hell with this
You gone get me we gone settle this
Lets just take a second take an intermission
Yeah I hear you talking but its hard to listen
Baby girl you sexy when you mad
Got a nigga thinking like
Can we talk about this later
After I put it on you
Can we talk about this later
After I put it down
Talk about it later
Ok baby i get it but please listen
I understand that you mad I see you up in yo feelings
Please don't turn yo back if you don't want me to get it
You showing all this emotion and don't expect me to feel it
Look I ain't saying that this argument is done
I just wanna take a break so we can have a little fun
You wanna fight it out then f it baby you won
I'll throw in the towel we can use it when we are done
Lets just take a second take an intermission
Yeah I hear you talking but its hard to listen
Baby girl you sexy when you mad
Got a nigga thinking like
Can we talk about this later
After I put it on you
Can we talk about this later
After I put it down
Talk about it later
