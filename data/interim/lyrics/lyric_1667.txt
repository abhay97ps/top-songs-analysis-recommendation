The love of a boy
Can change a girl
Into a woman!
I know that it's true
My love for you
Made me a woman!
One time I was only a girl
Young and afraid
You came to me
And you gave me love –
What a difference you made!
The love of a boy
Can change a girl
Into a woman!
With just one caress
Your tenderness
Made me a woman –
Made me a woman in love!
You are faithful and true
Love burning deep
In my heart and soul
And it's only for you
My true, true love!
Woah, oh oh, oh oh
Woah, oh oh, oh oh . .
