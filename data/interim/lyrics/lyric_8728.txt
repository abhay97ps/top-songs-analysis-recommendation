I have these moments
All steady and strong
I'm feeling so holy and humble
The next thing I know
I'm all worried and weak
And I feel myself
Starting to crumble
The meanings get lost
And the teachings get tossed
And you don't know what
You're gonna do next
You wait for the sun
But it never quite comes
Some kind of message
Comes through to you
Some kind of message
Comes through
And it says to you
Love when you can
Cry when you have to
Be who you must
That's a part of the plan
Await your arrival
With simple survival and
One day, we'll all understand
One day, we'll all understand
One day, we'll all understand
I had a woman
Who gave me her soul
But I wasn't ready to take it
Her heart was so fragile
And heavy to hold
And I was afraid
I might break it
Your conscience awakes
And you see your mistakes
And you wish someone
Would buy your confessions
The days miss their mark
And the night gets so dark
And some kind of message
Comes through to you
Some kind of message
Shoots through
And it says to you
Love when you can
Cry when you have to
Be who you must
That's a part of the plan
Await your arrival
With simple survival and
One day, we'll all understand
One day, we'll all understand
One day, we'll all understand
There is no Eden
Or heavenly gates
That you're gonna
Make it to one day
But all of the answers
You seek can be found
In the dreams that
You dream on the way
