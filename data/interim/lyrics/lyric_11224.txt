Free me
Can't you hear that's what I say
Free me
Anyhow or anyway
I hear a voice, call in the night
Push on the brain, fades with the light
And I've seen a face with so many eyes
I hear the words, knowing they're lies
Can't you hear me say, can't you hear me say
Can't you hear me say...
Free me!
Free me
Inside I'm bleeding can't you see
Free me
From all this pain and misery
I am a flame, but he held the fire
Call me a fool; don't call me a liar
Take me to hell, and let me stay
If that's the price that I'll have to pay
Can't you hear me say, can't you hear me say
Can't you hear me say...
Free me!
I lie awake, burning inside
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
Old lady time, she's no friend to me
I feel her change and she holds the key
Can't you hear me say, can't you hear me say
Can't you hear me say...
Free me!
Free me
Can't you hear that's what I say
Free me
Anyhow or anyway
