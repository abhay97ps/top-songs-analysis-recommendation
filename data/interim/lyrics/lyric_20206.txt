Girl, there's somethin' 'bout me, things you oughta know
I've never felt the need to lose control
Always held on back and played it slow, but not this time
Baby, don't be gentle, I can handle anything
Baby, take me on a journey, I've been thinkin' lately
I could use a little time alone with you
Crazy, let's do something maybe, please don't take your time
You got me right where you want me 
Right where you want me 
Girl, I'm gonna let you have your way with me
But when you move like that, it's hard to breathe
I never thought that it could be like this, but I was wrong
Baby, don't be gentle, I can handle anything
Baby, take me on a journey, I've been thinkin' lately
I could use a little time alone with you
Crazy, let's do something maybe, please don't take your time
You got me right where you want me
Can't explain it, how you swept me off my feet, unexpectedly
In slow motion
My imagination's on me, tryin' to keep my body still
Oh, I can hardly stand the thrill, yeah
Well, baby, don't be gentle, I can handle anything
Baby, take me on a journey, I've been thinkin' lately
I could use a little time alone with you 
Crazy, let's do something maybe, please don't take your time
You got me right where you want me
Baby, take me on a journey, I've been thinkin' lately 
I could use a little time alone with you 
Crazy, let's do something maybe, please don't take your time
You got me, whoa, whoa
You got me right where you want me
Right where you want me
You got me
Oh-oh
Right where you want me
Whoa, oh, ooh
