Rainbow, Look me up look me down, rainbow, You were fun to have around
I was dreamin', Of the love I had to share, Never thinkin', You were here you were there

Not a word, not a sound, could see or even feel the ground
A pot of gold, I was sold, by the way you let it fly

And I pray, You will stay, For ever in my eyes
