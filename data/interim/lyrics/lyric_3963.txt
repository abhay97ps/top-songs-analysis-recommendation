Just yesterday
We were two
Lonely people far apart
Who never knew that
Love was on it's way
And that it soon
Would fill our hearts
Just yesterday
The world was empty
And our chances were so small
That you and I would ever find
Each other's lonely arms at all
But now today
Seems so much brighter
Than our yesterday
Somehow our two lost dreams
Have found their way
And now together walk as one
Here at last
The once impossible
Has come to pass for us
We're heart to heart
Two lonely people
Once so far apart
Have found their love
And now will never be
Two lonely people anymore
Here at last
The once impossible
Has come to pass for us
We're heart to heart
Two lonely people
Once so far apart
Have found their love
And now will never be
Two lonely people anymore
