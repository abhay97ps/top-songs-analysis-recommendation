Life, life is full of struggles
You either let it stop you and crumble
Or go ahead and face’em to reach the top
That’s what I’m trying to do right here, man
I’m climbing
I’m climbing the highest heights
I’m touching the sky, I look down
I ain’t afraid of heights
And I’ll keep going ‘til I can’t go
I’m seizing chances, I’m eating rappers
To me that enhances, and I’ll keep going ‘til I can’t go
Tired? Nah! I keep going
Only got one chance now I’m in win flowing
As I go, you can’t stop me, no no no
I'm more than ready , Picasso of rap rolling in a chevy 
Not being braggadocios cause in this rap game I'm predacious 
To them odious haters
Now my past is full of suffer 
So they wanna judge me on my rap but man that just makes me tougher 
Been spending a lot of time with cola
Even coke starting to be jealous 
Like them industries
Givin’ a lot of chances to rappers like us
But man it’s all like jewpons
They just can't value me; everything I touch turns gold 
Like the day when I touched a German Shepherd, it turned to a Golden Retriever
Shit that make anybody in me a believer 
I wanna go back to cassettes and boom-boxes
So I can have the opportunity, I be harder than Brandon Lee
They've been waitin’ on me
And I’m here doing my strategic wank
Ready to fuck shit up and my rap backs it up 
Now look at the sky 
Cause BILL is up
I’m climbing the highest heights
I’m touching the sky, I look down
I ain’t afraid of heights
And I’ll keep going ‘til I can’t go
I’m seizing chances, I’m eating rappers
To me that enhances, and I’ll keep going ‘til I can’t go
Tired? Nah! I keep going
Only got one chance now I’m in win flowing
As I go, you can’t stop me, no no no
Just imagine what I’d be doing if rap hadn’t been around
Seven years and running, found out about the culture and drowned
Indulged myself completely
Divulged my true passions
To sit and rhyme on a beat, this is The Art of Rapping
Studied all the classics, taught me what my classes
Failed to, it became to me what molasses is to bees
Observed MCs for years, were music to my ears 
Time to prove myself, get out the rhyming dictionary
Scribbled crappy rap evolved to Rhythm and Poetry
GOATs watered my seed of talent, now it’s a growing tree
A craft, a profession, an art, a hobby
Call it what you see, but
I’m bringing to your attention that ain’t no stopping me 
The game is in need of players but I’ma coach’em all
I’m the franchise, the Phil and Michael of the Chicago BULLS
So I’ma pip in your game with my rod, man
Major record labels will know I’m a flash in the pan, damn!
I’m climbing the highest heights
I’m touching the sky, I look down
I ain’t afraid of heights
And I’ll keep going ‘til I can’t go
I’m seizing chances, I’m eating rappers
To me that enhances, and I’ll keep going ‘til I can’t go
Tired? Nah! I keep going
Only got one chance now I’m in win flowing
As I go, you can’t stop me, no no no
Egypt is where we started, worldwide is where we go
And I won’t stop, even if I had to crawl
This year was our genesis, shoutout to Genesis
No boundaries, no premises
Stop the myth, we are continuing
We building an empire
Get a chance to witness this, rap is genuine
Troy gave us the chance now we here to HELLA WIN
I’m climbing the highest heights
I’m touching the sky, I look down
I ain’t afraid of heights
And I’ll keep going ‘til I can’t go
I’m seizing chances, I’m eating rappers
To me that enhances, and I’ll keep going ‘til I can’t go
Tired? Nah! I keep going
Only got one chance now I’m in win flowing
As I go, you can’t stop me, no no no
You can't stop me, no!
