Verse 1:
There’s some things that I can’t change
I still got a mountain on my license plate
Every hat I wear says I’m proud of where I come from
I still bleed black and red
Got all the same buddies I had when I left
That city limit sign
We stole that night
You bet I got it here hanging up
Chorus:
Well these boots have walked down every dirt Georgia road
That old Florida/Bama man it never gets old
Up in Tennessee it’s always gonna be country music and old JD
I guess small town ties are stronger than time
It’ll be that way til the day I day
When I get back
No matter where I go
I’ll be holding on to home
Verse 2:
I wanna hear about the fights
Who won who lost
Hear all about the big buck
My buddy got
Hear the family’s still being family
Just agree to disagree
I left all of that for this
Playing my guitar for beer and tips
I love where I’ve been
I’ll probably go again
But I’ll carry my little town with me
Chorus:
Well these boots have walked down every dirt Georgia road
That old Florida/Bama man it never gets old
Up in Tennessee it’s always gonna be country music and old JD
I guess small town ties are stronger than time
It’ll be that way ‘til the day I day
When I get back
No matter where I go
I’ll be holding on to home
Bridge:
Down in Tuscaloosa it’s all roll tide
New York and Vegas they’re fun for a night
But the place I love, I can’t get there much
But I can get right back to that state of mind
Chorus:
Well these boots have walked down every dirt Georgia road
That old Florida/Bama man it never gets old
Up in Tennessee it’s always gonna be country music and old JD
I guess small town ties are stronger than time
It’ll be that way ‘til the day I day
When I get back
No matter where I go
I’ll be holding on to home
Holding on to home
Yeah
Holding on to home
