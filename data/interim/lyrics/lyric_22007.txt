Wake up in the morning
Feelin' like P. Diddy 
Grab my glasses
I'm out the door
I'm gonna hit this city 
Before I leave
Brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night
I ain't coming back
I'm talking pedicure on our 
Tryin' on all our 
Boys blowing up our 
Drop-topping, playing our favorite 
Pulling up to the 
Trying to get a little bit tipsy
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tik, tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, who, oh 
Oh, woah, who, oh 
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tik, tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, who, oh 
Oh, woah, who, oh 
Ain't got a care in world
But got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket
But I'm already here!
And now the dudes are lining up
'Cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb
Unless they look like Mick Jagger
I'm talking about everybody getting 
Boys trying to touch my 
Gonna smack him if he getting too 
 we goin' til they kick us 
Or the police shut us 
Police shut us 
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tik, tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, who, oh 
Oh, woah, who, oh 
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tik, tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, who, oh 
Oh, woah, who, oh 
You build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me
With my hands up
You got me now
You got that sound
Yeah, you got me 
You build me up
You break me 
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me 
With my hands up
Now the party don't start 'til I walk in
Make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Til we see the sunlight
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, who, oh 
Oh, woah, who, oh 
Make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
But the party don't stop, 
Oh, woah, who, oh 
Oh, woah, who, oh 
Hah...haha...
