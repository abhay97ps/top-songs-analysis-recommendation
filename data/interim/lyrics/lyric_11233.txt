When things go wrong, don’t walk away
That’ll only make it harder
Why you want to run away
That won't get you any farther
I don't know how to do
Any more for you
You say I don't love you enough
Ooo, eee, I
Can hardly satisfy
When I know you're needing so much
Your deep emotions inside yourself
They're hard to face but you must try
You had your feelings for the one you love
You got me wondering why
I don't know how to do
Any more for you
You say I don't love you enough
Ooo, eee, I
Can hardly satisfy
When I know you're needing so much
I don't know how to do
Any more for you
You say I don't love you enough
Ooo, eee, I
Can hardly satisfy
When I know you're needing so much
I don't know how to do
Any more for you
How can I satisfy?
How can I satisfy?
