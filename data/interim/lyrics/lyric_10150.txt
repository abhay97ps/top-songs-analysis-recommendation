Well, you woke me
From a dream about you
Just to say that you were leaving
I'm sleepy but I thought
That you said that our love
That will last forever is ending
Well, before you walk out of my life
Would you be especially quiet?
And don't you let my heart
Know that you're leaving
Don't you say another word about it, darling
Don't you let my heart
Hear your footsteps walking out the door
Of my hopes and dreams
And don't you let my heart
Know that you're leaving
Don't you say another word about it, darling
Leave me now before my heart finds out
Well, I see you writing something down
And leaving it on the dresser
And the tears in your eyes look a lot like mine
But I guess it's all for the better
Well, before we say our last goodbye
Baby, won't you hold me
Just one more time?
And don't you let my heart
Know that you're leaving
Don't you say another word about it, darling
Don't you let my heart
Hear your footsteps walking out the door
Of my hopes and dreams
And don't you let my heart
Know that you're leaving
Don't you say another word about it, darling
Leave me now before my heart finds out
Leave me now before my heart finds out
