It's been so long that I haven't seen your face
I'm trying to be strong, but the strength I have is washing away
It won't be long before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you, tell you what's been on my mind

Girl I know, mistakes were made between us two
And we showed our eyes that night even said some things weren't true
Watch you go? And haven't seen my girl since then
Why can't it be the way it was' cause you were my Homie, lover, and friend

I can't lie 
Watching everyday that goes by 
Till I get you back I'm gon' try 
Cuz you are the apple of my eye

I want you to fly with me 
I miss how you lie with me 
Just wish you could dine with me 
The one that'll grind with me 
I want you to fly with me 
I miss how you lie with me 
Just wish you could dine with me 
The one that'll grind with me ...
