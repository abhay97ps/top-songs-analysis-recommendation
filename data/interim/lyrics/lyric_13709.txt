Is it fate or random chance
How can I decide
Are we victims of circumstance
When destinies collide
All the odds are against you
But somehow you make it through
You can rationalize it away
But it all comes down to you
Half our lives we spend waiting
For the knock upon the door
When it comes, will it be the one
That I've been waiting for
Somebody's out there, somewhere
Waiting for someone to come their way
Somebody's out there, somewhere
I will somehow be somebody's someone
Some day
Standing in the shadows
Hiding from the light
Reach out in the darkness
And hold on for your life
All the fear of the future
All the loneliness inside
When the moment of truth arrives, hey
You can run but you can't hide
Somebody's out there, somewhere
Waiting for someone to come their way
Somebody's out there, somewhere
I will somehow be somebody's someone
Some day
I can feel it inside me
I've been holding on so long
Something's telling me something's got to give
'Cause the feeling's way too strong, too strong
Somebody's out there, somewhere
Waiting for someone to come their way
Somebody's out there, somewhere
I will make them mine
Somebody's out there, somewhere
Waiting for someone to come their way
Somebody's out there, somewhere
I will somehow be somebody's someone
Some day 
Some day 
Some day 
I will make them mine
