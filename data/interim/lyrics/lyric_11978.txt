Babe, your love surrounds me but never gives me half a chance
I need a little heart and affection ‘cause love needs a little romance
And we’ll never ever make it if you’re pushin’ me
You gotta back up baby or I might leave
You gotta show me, hold me, and let love breath tonight
Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love
Give me the right kind of love
And I’ll be yours tonight
I’ll be yours
Baby, you want some kind of promise, well, nothin’ is forever these days
Lovers come and go, friends bought and sold, everything blows away
You know everything is changin’, baby, overnight
You gotta hold on to love but not too tight
You gotta see it, see it’s not so long but alright
Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love
Give me the right kind of love
And I’ll be yours tonight
I’ll be yours
Just tell me that love is right and look me in the eye
I’ve gotta know your heart tonight before I give away a piece of my life
Oh! Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love
Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love
Oh! Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love
Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love
Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love
Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love . .
