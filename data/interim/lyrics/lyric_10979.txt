She said she don't love me anymore
She knows my life will never be
The way it was before
She wishes I weren't so far away
But then again
There isn't much she has to say
If I only had some time
It would be all right
But I have to be this
Stargazer every night
While I'm dancing in the beam of a laser light
I'm dying, I'm trying
She said that she'd find somebody new
To understand this crazy man
Is more than she can do
She's sorry it had to be this way
But then again, it's just another
Price to pay
If I only had some time
It would be all right
But I have to be this
Stargazer every night
While I'm dancing in the beam of a laser light
I'm dying, I'm trying
Oh, you gotta believe in something
You gotta love her true
Oh, you gotta believe in someone
And crazy as it seems
Oh, you always believed in me
If I only had some time, it would be all right
But I have to be this stargazer every night
While I'm dancing in the beam of a laser light
I'm dying, I'm trying
She said she don't love me anymore
