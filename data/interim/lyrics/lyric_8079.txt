Everybody, are you ready?
To rock to a beat that's always steady
It's a double beat-beat that'll move your feet
So we can rock your body right viciously
Everybody, are you ready?
Say forty, thirty, twenty, ten
Come on Flame, let the funk begin!
Time to get down
Ahh yeah 
Come on everybody, get ready to go
We're gonna show you the best damn disco show
You have Pretty C and I'm as sweet as I can be
My originality is for the young ladies
To please their desire, be their admirer
When I rock the place I make the house jump high
Yes Mighty Rock, with light brown eyes
To give all the ladies a golden try
Stop actin' shy, stop wonderin' why
Because I'm Mighty Rock and my words are no lie
So all the foxy ladies just come on by
We got Pleasure, surely not the wack
And get back to back and let's shake it around
We're gonna jam the jam for the whole damn town
We got another cool brother who cuts insane
Look out everybody, his name's the Flame
I said dance, shout, without a care
'Cause I am the man that has debonair
My rhymes will leave you a little spellbound
Snap out of it, go tell the town
That I'm Pretty C, I'm gettin' down
And I move your feet to the funky-fied sound
We came to rock this disco set
With a brand new beat that you can get
Just find a guy or you find a girl
If you wanna party like the rest of the world
Just throw your hands up in the up position
Don't waste no time, it's your decision
Just move your body from side to side
Don't miss a beat, don't break a stride
Just boogie to the beat 
We'll rock your body right viciously
You go work, work, work, work your body
Everybody just work your body
You go work it, work, work, work your body
Everybody just work, work, work your body
Go work, work, work, work, work your body
Everybody just work your body
We're the Dynamite Three with the Flame
See shockin' the house is our favorite game
See I'm the one called Pretty C
My home is Chattanooga, Tennessee
And Pleasure's my name so pleasure's my game
And New York City is from where I came
And I'm Mighty Rock and I'm throwin' down
Said Bronx, New York is my hometown
And Brooklyn, New York is the place
Where the Flame entered the human race
We're four cool brothers who came to break
We want all you party people to participate
To participate, I said participate
So break, break, break, break, the break, break, break
Now if you like to jam, show us that you're down
Scream out the name of your hometown
Say what's that town? 
Now we're on the move and it sounds real great
Scream out the name of your home state
Say what's that state? 
Say louder 
Ha ha
Come on, foxy ladies get out your seat
It's time for the one called Pretty C!
See I come from the city as nice as can be
Where everybody tries to be an MC
Before you get to the city you see
You must pass through MC Galaxy
Well anyway let me go on a story
Of how I got my fame and glory
See my father  and he was king DJ
He could rock the house without any delay
He could cut the sounds, spin the tables around
And make you shake your body down to the ground
And now I'm standing here today
The living proof of his protege
Pretty C , the rockin' MC
Hey Pleasure!
You see the brother called Pleasure, hey that's me
And I'll rock-shock your body to eternity
See I'm a young, cool brother, I know I'm fine
And hey Cancer is my zodiac sign
Well the fellas want me to tell you the story
Of how I got my fame and glory
Well check it out y'all, without a doubt y'all
When they made me, you see they made no more
'Cause I am the one that they all adore
They took a little of this and a little of that
A lot of mixing and a lot of rap
And then they bounced me twice to make me nice
And they gave me peace so I could shock the beat
I rock the beat, 
Come on girls, jump out of your seat
Come alive girl, if you wanna rock
My stereo voice will make you hot
Now the ladies want me like bees on the hive
Come on Mighty Rock, get all the way live!
And I'm swift as , I'm cool as ice
If I rock you once, you'll want me twice
Said the city I'm from is widely known
And Watts is the town I call my home
It's the baddest city in all the world
 the sure-shot gangster, the real fly girls
The cheeba's good, it's on the street
'Cause movie stars is not hard to meet
See back in New York we like to talk
 the words , the pace we walk
To the pace we walk is right on time
With a radio station to blow your mind
The radio station is BLS
We listen to them because they jam the best
The jams they play are always hot
From the time you turn 'em on, it'll make you 
So if you like to party and you want to jam
New York is the city where you know you can
We have the Flame, he doesn't rap that much
He cuts the sounds and things and such
He's genuine, he's one of a kind
The Flame!  Will your blow mind
See everybody knows my name
The unforgettable name of the Flame
You see F-L-A-M-E it spell
The gangster man with the clientele
I'm from New York City to the depths of hell
I rock so hard I make your head swell
Ever since the first day that I was born
I was shockin' the house until the break of dawn
See a little lady had a baby who loved to stereo
So the baby grew up to the rhythm of the beat
Now I'm the Flame that you know
See when I came out of my mother's womb
The doctor took me to a special room
And there he sat me on his knee
And this is what he said to me
He said "Hey Flame, I give to thee
The power to make automatically
So viciously and deliciously
And hey Flame, I just want you to know
Through rain, hail, sleet or snow
You deliver a show we call disco
To the beat, to the beat, and to the funky beat
You get 'em on the floor and make them move their feet"
I said a dip-dip-dive, so-so-socialize
Come out the house, jump into the cab
Come on down to the place to be
Then you check out the sounds of little ol' me
We're the Dynamite Three
Everybody, are you ready?
To rock to a beat that's always steady
It's a double beat-beat that'll move your feet
So we can rock your body right viciously
Say forty, thirty, twenty, ten
Come on Flame, let's do it again
Now if you like to jam, so do we
Somebody say "Dynamite Three" 
Louder 
Well if you know the man that's really hot
You see he cuts so on, he won't be stopped
He's jammin' his way on up to fame
Somebody say "The Flame!" 
Ho! 
Some people say that disco sucks
But we all know that they know too much
They come to the disco quiet as a mouse
And an hour later we'll have 'em shockin' the house
When you rock with us we'll make you do it right
We'll have you rockin' to the beat all your might
If you can learn our words and stay on time
We'll put the double beat boogie in your behind
We're three MCs and one DJ
If you're lookin' for a party we'll show you the way
We'll crank up our , turn on our mics
We'll rock your body all through the night
Just travelin' around from place to place
So we can rock everybody in the human race!
Like this y'all
Like that y'all
So unique y'all
To the beat y'all
And we rock to the beat!
Ha ha ha
Check it out y'all, alright
Check, check, check
See late one night I got the notion
To mix myself a disco potion
In my mix, here we go
The ingredients of a stereo
I said a little boogie here, a little rock there
A lot of funk everywhere
Then a bunch of this and a bunch of that
Everything to make it thick and fat
See I rock so good and I rock so fine
I make you'll shake and shiver
Just get on the floor, go for what you know
I'm sure to deliver
You go work, work, work, work your body
Everybody just work, work, work your body
Go work it, work, work, work your body
Everybody just work, work, work your body
Go work it, work, work, work your body
Everybody just work your body!
We gotta go y'all, we gotta go
Like atomic watch that keeps on tickin'
Like mashed potatoes and the Colonel's chicken
Like roller skatin' without no wheels
Like a big time thief that does not steal
