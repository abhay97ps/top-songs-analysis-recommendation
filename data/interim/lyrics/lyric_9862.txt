Tellin' you darlin' we can do it in style
My imagination is drivin' me wild
'Cause the things that you're sayin'
Cuttin' right through me
Way that you're swayin'
Is gonna undo me and I'm
So high 
Rock me baby
Roll me away
So high 
Rock me baby
Roll me away
Baby you know you're lookin' good tonight
I don't know what's wrong or what's right
'Cause you're shaking me up
I'm lost in the feeling
Taking me up
Up to the ceiling, it's
So high 
Rock me baby
Roll me away
So high 
Rock me baby
Roll me away
Somewhere deep inside my mind
Emotions feeling right
Lay me down and hold me close
Take me through the night
Rock me baby
If you're looking for an ornate man
Baby, I'm doing the best I can
'Cause I'm takin' my time
Finding ways
Out of my mind
All I can say is that I'm
So high 
Rock me baby
Roll me away
So high 
Rock me baby
Roll me away
Keep on rocking me baby
Keep on rocking me baby
Roll me away
 x4
So high 
Rock me baby
Roll me away
So high 
Rock me baby
Roll me away
