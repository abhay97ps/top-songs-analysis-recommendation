It's gonna be all right, all right, all right
It's gonna be all right
The day you came my way
I knew I would stay
Close by your side
To keep you staisfied
It's gonna be all right, all right, all right
It's gonna be all right
When you look at me
In your eyes I can see
The love that grows each day
That's why I've gotta say
It's gonna be all right, all right, all right
It's gonna be all right
Never thought I'd find a girl like you
Now I have, I know I'll never be blue
It's gonna be all right, all right, all right
It's gonna be all right
Every time we meet
My heart skips a beat
And now you're here to stay
You'll always hear me say
It's gonna be all right, all right, all right
It's gonna be all right
Never thought I'd find a girl like you
Now I have, I know I'll never be blue
It's gonna be all right, all right, all right
It's gonna be all right
Every time we meet
My heart skips a beat
And now you're here to stay
You'll always hear me say
It's gonna be all right, all right, all right
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
