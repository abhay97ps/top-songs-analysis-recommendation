All my life I wanted to fly
Like the birds that you see way up in the sky
Making circles in the morning sun
Flying high in the sky 'til the day is done
Like a child in his fantasy
Punching holes in the walls of reality
All my life I wanted to fly
But I don't have the wings and I wonder why
Woah, well mama told me
When I was young
Stand tall girl
Your number one
But you can't be what you wanna be
But you can shake the course of your destiny
I can't break away
Well no, no ,no ,no, no
I can't break away
Oh yeah
One is one
And two is two
You want me
And I hang you
Black is Black 
And white is white 
So come out in the middle
'Till midnight
I can't break away
Well no, no ,no ,no, no
I can't break away
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah-heh-heh
Well mama told me
When I was young
Stand tall girl 
Your number one 
You can't be what you wanna be
But you can change the course of your destiny
I can't break away
No, no, no ,no, no
I can't break away
I can't, I can't, I can't break away
No, no, no., no, no
I can't breakaway
Woo ooo ooo oh oh
I can't break away
