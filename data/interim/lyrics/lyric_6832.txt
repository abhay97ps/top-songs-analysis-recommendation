Little girl, please stop your crying
'Cause I'll erase away your pain
You're the only girl in town
Who always get pushed around
So girl, don't change 
Don't let yourself go, girl
Don't change 
'Cause I love you just the way you are
So little girl, please stop your running
'Cause I'll erase away woo your pain
 Your pain
Just be true to only me
Tell me you're as happy
As a girl can be
So girl, don't change 
Don't let yourself go, girl
Don't change 
'Cause I love you just the way you are
So little girl, please stop your running
'Cause I'll erase away woo your pain
 your pain
 your pain
 your pain
