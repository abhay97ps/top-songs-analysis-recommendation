Ladies and gentlemen, my farewell to Elvis
From the sun years of the fifties and the birth of rock and roll
Millions screamed to see him do his thing
Elvis touched the life of every ear that heard him
And they couldn't help but listen when he sang
It's a long way from Memphis to that mansion in the sky
But he kept his faith in Jesus all along
It's a long way from Graceland across Jordan to the Promised Land
But Jesus finally came to lead him home
From the days of Love Me Tender to his mama's last farewell
Some say he knew how long he had to stay
His life was two days longer than the one who gave him life
And he almost knew the number of the days
