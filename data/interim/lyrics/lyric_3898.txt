We'd like to continue
Hope you're enjoying yourselves during the break
We thought not too long ago that we'd do something in retrospect
We had such a glorious time singing duets in our lifetime
We've had the pleasure of singing with a lot of lovely ladies
Kim Weston, Mary Wells, Miss Diana Ross
It's been a lot of fun, thank you
But, um, there's someone I love very deeply
And, um, we thought we'd get together and do a medley in her honor
We call this medley the Tammi Terrell Medley, ladies and gentlemen, because
Thank you, because these were some of her favorites
Ah, oh 
If This World Was Mine
If this world were mine, I'd place at your feet
All that I own; you've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees
Ooh, with your love beside me, that would be all I need
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything
Ooh-hoo-woo, oh
Yes I would, oh yeah
Give you flowers, baby
Give you anything, work for you, darlin'
Oh, all my money, all the lovin', baby
Sugar, yes I would
Oh, 'cause I love you
Oh, ooh-hoo
Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, no no no
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
I've got your picture hangin' on the wall
It can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame
I read your letters but you're not near
Oh, they don't move me
They don't groove me like when I hear
Honey, your sweet voice whispering in my ear
Ah baby, ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Oh, nothing like the real thing, baby
There's nothing like the real, oh, real thing, real thing, baby
Woo, yeah
We wasn't always down, you know
Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson wrote some very very up songs
Been recorded a lot, too, I'm sure you might recognize it
You wanna sing along, help yourself
Ain't No Mountain High Enough
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you
Oh, ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you
Remember the day I set you free
I told you you could always count on me, darling
From that day on, I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Some way, some how
Oh, baby there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, baby
To keep me from getting to you, baby
Oh, to keep me from getting to you
From getting to you, ooh
