Intro:
I'm Comin... I'm Comin... I'm Comin... I'm Comin
I am the man in black I'm back
Breaking the back of the random attackers
So can the flak
Yo Im dangerous
I've been trained to bust
When a stranger fuss try to endanger us
Praise me y'all
Dont nothing faze me y'all
When they see me their gaze be all crazy y'all
They say I'm a myth
Trust me if somebody riff
Out of the depths of your imagination appears Will Smith
Black suit, the black shades, the black shoes
Black tie with the black attitude
New style black Ray-Bans
I'm stunning man
New hotness pitch black six hundred man
Don't you understand?
What you thought I wouldn't come again?
Leave you hanging without bringing you the fun again?
Tangling with the alien scum again
Monumental it's the black suits running in
Chorus 1:
Let me see you 
Like this, let me see you 
Like this, let me see you bop your head, nod your head, come on!
Let me see you 
Like this, let me see you 
Like this 
Check it
Yo it's this chick right
Serleena, making me sick right
Earth is worthless to her she be tripping like
Threatening me and my mens
Trying to get the light
Thinking she's superwoman
But black kryptonite finishing whatever you start son
The best looking crime fighter since myself in part one
Better act right and play nice and sing along
Cause K is back and he hype
What? Bring it on!
Wanna brawl with me? Trying to brawl with me?
Unh Unh What What
Yo... what what... then... lemme... see you just...
Come on... just come on and
Chorus 2:
Like this, let me see you 
Let me see you 
Like this, let me see you
Let me see you 
Let me see you 
Come on! Come on! Let me see you 
Like this, let me see you 
Check it, Check it
Yo, case closed
Erase my foes
Chased away by the black suits, shades, and clothes
We above the law
Feds can't touch me y'all
Highly ranked black blank I.D. card
So disregard what you think you saw
Put that phone down now
Who you think you calling huh?
One little flash then good night there
Just open your eyes honey look right here
Thank you mission completed
I mean it we won't be defeated
You seen it we did it even with weapons depleted
Galaxy defenders don't act like you don't remember
Taking contenders and proving they only pretenders
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
The Men In Black is back to protect the world
When the enemy is near the elite is here
So have no fear just let me see you
Chorus 3:
Come on! 
Like this, let me see you 
Like this, let me see you 
 Woo!
 Unh!
Yo, yo 
Yo, Yo
If you want to rock just say 
Tell me if you want to rock just say 
If you want to rock just say 
Come on if you want to rock just say 
Yo if you want to rock just say 
Tell me if you want to rock just say 
If you want to nod just say 
Tell me if you want to rock just say 
Ha!
