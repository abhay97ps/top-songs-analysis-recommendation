You’ve got a cousin who’s telling you somethin’
That doesn’t have nothin’ to do with the lovin’ that we’re in, baby
I hear she’s sayin’ this game we’re playin’ should be complicated
If you won’t, I’ll say it, I think she’s crazy, 'cause
Love don’t have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-down, drag-outs, cryin' in the rain
It’s all right to keep it light now mama, don’t you think
We’re having such a good time together and it’s only just begun
My heart’s never smiled so hard
Baby, lovin’ you is fun
It’s fun
I’m walkin' around all over this town, ten feet off the ground
So happy I found you, baby, I love it
There’s no self-help book on your shelf, you know too well
They’re trying to sell you somethin’ for nothin’, 'cause
Love don’t have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-down, drag-outs, cryin' in the rain
It’s all right to keep it light now mama, don’t you think
We’re having such a good time together and it’s only just begun
My heart’s never smiled so hard
Baby, lovin’ you is fun
Love don’t have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-down, drag-outs, cryin' in the rain
It’s all right to keep it light now mama, don’t you think
We’re having such a good time together and it’s only just begun
My heart’s never smiled so hard
Baby, lovin’ you is fun
This ol' heart’s never smiled so hard
Lovin’ you is fun
Yeah, it’s fun
Yeah, it’s fun
Lovin’ you is fun
