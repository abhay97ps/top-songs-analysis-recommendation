You move it to the left
Yeah, then you go for yourself
You move it to the right
Yeah, if it takes all night
Now baby kinda slow
With a whole lot of soul
Don't move it too fast and make it last
You know you scratch just like a monkey
Yeah, you do, real, yeah
You slide into the limbo
Yeah, how low can you go?
But oh, come on, baby
I don't want you to scuffle now
You just groove it right here to the Harlem shuffle
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem shuffle
Oh, do the monkey shine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem shuffle
Hitch, hitch-hike, baby, across the floor
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I can't stand it no more
Now come on, baby
Now get into your slide
We're gonna ride, ride, ride, little pony ride
Yeah
Shake, shake, shake, shake a tail feather, baby
Ooh
Shake, shake, shake, shake a tail feather, baby
Ooh 
Shake, shake, shake, do the monkey time, baby
