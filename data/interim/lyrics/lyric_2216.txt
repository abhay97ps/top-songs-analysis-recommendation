Feeling better, now that we're through
Feeling better, 'cause I'm over you
I've learned my lesson, it left a scar
And now I see how you really are
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good
You know, I broke a heart that's gentle and true
I left a boy for someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness on bending knee
But I wouldn't blame him if he said to me
It's no good
No good
It's no good
Baby, it's no good
Hey, I'm gonna say it louder
No good
No good
It's no good
Baby, it's no good
Mm, no good
Mm, if you help me, we'll start anew
It'll be easy, forgetting you
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good
Oh, you know what I mean
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Oh, oh, oh
I'm warning you now, baby, and I'm going my way
Forget about you, baby, I'm leaving to stay
You're no good
No good
No good
Baby, you're no good
Oh, oh, I say
You're no good
No good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good
