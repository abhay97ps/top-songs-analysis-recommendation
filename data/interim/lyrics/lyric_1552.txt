I'm so close to Cathy
I know just what she's dreamin' of
She always calls me up to tell me
Every time she falls in love
Oh, I'm so close to Cathy
I know her every tender sigh
She loves to cry upon my shoulder
Always for some other guy
Oh, why can't she see
The one true, lasting love in her life should be me?
I'm so close to Cathy
As close as anyone can be
And I'll stay close to Cathy
Hoping some day she'll feel close to me
I'm so close to Cathy
As close as anyone can be
And I'll stay close to Cathy
Hoping some day she'll feel close to me
