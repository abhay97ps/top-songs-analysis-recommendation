Is this the moment where I look you in the eye?
Forgive my broken promise that you'll never see me cry
And everything, it will surely change even if I tell you I won't go away today
Will you think that you're all alone
When no one's there to hold your hand?
And all you know seems so far away
And everything is temporary, rest your head
I'm permanent
I know he's living in hell every single day
And so I ask "Oh god, is there some way
For me to take his place?"
And when they say it's all touch and go
I wish I could make it go away
But still you say
Will you think that you're all alone
When no one's there to hold your hand?
When all you know seems so far away
And everything is temporary, rest your head
I'm permanent
I'm permanent
Is the moment where I look you in the eye?
Forgive my promise that you'll never see me cry
