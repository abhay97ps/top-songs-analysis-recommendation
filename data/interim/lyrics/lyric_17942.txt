I've been sitting, baby
At home, yeah
Sitting home waiting for you 
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do 
I try my best to be good to you
But you're never around when I'm in the mood
I'm getting tired of being tired your ways
You haven't come home or even call me today
And you don't know the pain when I'm feeling alone
I'm calling out your name when you're not even home
And I need you with me, babe
Can't see you leaving me, babe
'Cause I don't know no other road I would go
And I hope your feelings change
Come bring your lovin' back to me
So I can give you all you need and much more
Oh, I'm sitting
Sitting home waitin' for you 
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do 
I try my best to be good to you 
But you're never around when I'm in the mood
All my friends think that I am a fool
And since you have been gone I've been thinking so too
Just tell me what is it and what you feel I do wrong
We should stay together 'cause our love is so strong
And I need you with me, babe
Can't see you leaving me, babe
'Cause I don't know no other road I would go
And I hope your feelings change
Come bring your lovin' back to me
So I can give you what you want and much more
Oh, I'm sitting
Sitting home waiting for you 
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do 
I try my best to be good to you
But you're never around when I'm in the mood
By myself all day long 
These feeling that I feel for you feel so strong 
With myself all day long 
With this feeling that I feel for you since you been gone
Sitting home waiting for you 
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do
I try my best to be good to you
But you're never around when I'm in the mood
Sitting home waiting for you
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do
I try my best to be good to you
But you're never around when I'm in the mood
Sitting home waiting for you
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do
I try my best to be good to you
But you're never around when I'm in the mood
Sitting home waiting for you
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do
I try my best to be good to you
But you're never around when I'm in the mood
