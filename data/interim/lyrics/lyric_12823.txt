Three words to the whack "step yourself back"
'Cause we're gettin' down, and ain't givin' no slack
Like a Burger King with a sack of Big Macs
We're throwin' down with a rack of Bozaks
One time, in your mind you see
You gotta boogie to your best ability
You gotta funk it up until it knocks you down
And when you've funked enough, make sure you pass it around
Come on, let's go to work
We got what'll make your body jerk
Make you throw your hands up in the air
Shake your booty and scream, oh yeah
'Cause we are the Jam-On Crew
And jammin' on it is how we do the do
We'll funk you up until you boogie down
So come on people check out the sound
Check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound
Check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound
Say, don't ya hear the sound
Jam-On is gettin' down
Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Chilly B
And I'm a surefire, pure blooded bonafide house rockin' Jam-On Production MC
If you want the best, come put me to the test, and I'm sure you'll soon agree
That I've got no flaws 'cause I'm down by law when it comes to rockin' viciously, you see
'Cause when I was a little baby boy, my mama gave me a brand new toy
Two turntables with a mic, and I learned to rock like Dolemite
Time went by, on this God's creation, I knew someday I would rock the nation
So I made up my mind just what to do and I joined with the Jam-On Production Crew
So go crazy, go crazy, don't let your body be lazy
I said don't stop the body rock till your eyesight starts to get hazy
Clean out your ears and you open your eyes
If you wanna hear the music just come alive
An if you don't know how get ready to learn
Cause Cozmo's takin' his turn to burn
You take a C, an O and a Z
Then you add M-O and a freaky D
Add a funky beat, and then what do you see
It's Cozmo D, yeah, baby, that's me
I've got the beat that's, oh, so sweet
Without me rockin' it's incomplete
So rock this y'all, rock that y'all
Rock on and don't you dare stop
You rock this, rock that, and that's a fact
'Cause the Jam-On Crew will rock your body right back
Rock a steam locomotive right off the track
And give the whole wide world a funk attack
A to the beat y'all, get down
Let me rock you to the rhythm of the funky sound
From hill to hill, from sea to sea
When Jam On's rockin' everybody screams 
Jam on it
Jam on and on, on and on it
And if you're feelin' like you wanna dance all night
Then go on ahead and flaunt it
'Cause jammin' on is what we do best
It's what separates us from the rest
And if you don't think our crew's down for real
Let me tell you what happened to the man of steel
 "Hah, be for real!"
He said, I'm faster than a speedin' bullet when I'm on the set
I don't need no fans to cool my amps, I just use my super breath
I could fly three times around the world without missin' a beat
I socialize with X-ray eyes, and the ladies think it's sweet
We rocked his butt with a 12 inch cut called "Disco Kryptonite"
Well, Superman looked up at me, he said, "You rock so naturally"
I said now that you've learned the deal, let me tell you why I'm so for real
I'm Cozmo D from outer space
I came to rock the human race
I do it right 'cause I can't do it wrong
That's why the whole world is singin' this song
 Jam on it
I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it
As day turns to night and night turns to day
Whatever time it is I wanna hear you say
 Jam on it
I said jam-m-m-m-m, jam on it
Jam all around and upside down
Keep jammin' to the Jam On Production sound
 Jam on it
I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it
I said Jam On is the funky beat that takes control
With the sure shot boogie that'll rock your soul
 Jam on it
I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it
Get outta your seat and jam to the beat
And don't you dare stop till early mornin'
Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it
Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it
Say, don't ya hear the sound
Jam On is gettin' down
