You got that?
Get your hand-
Give me my money!
Stop stop, I told you to stop
I'm not doing this anymore!
Give me my money!
Beggars can't be choosers, huh?
Ah-uh-huh, listen
Dollar, dollar bill, ya'll
Everybody lookin' for somethin'
Can make you wanna kill, ya'll
You can't get somethin' for nothin'
Work hard and play even harder
Gotta save up all my nickels and quarters
Can't ask you for a handout
It's time to be a man now
I don't need it, you can keep your money
I don't want it if you gonna throw it up in my face
I'm still leavin', you can keep your money
Because you ain't worth the time
Can't let it go to waste
 Makes the world go 'round
 Makes the world go 'round
I'm hungry and you got me goin' 
I'm hungry and you got me goin' 
Temporary lay off
Guess that all the good times are over
When will it ever pay off?
I guess I didn't know when to fold em'
Work long, so I can play all the time
Gotta save up all my nickels and dimes
Can't ask you for a handout
It's time to be a man now
I don't need it, you can keep your money
I don't want it if you gonna throw it up in my face
I'm still leavin', you can keep your money
Because you ain't worth the time
Can't let it go to waste
 Makes the world go 'round
 Makes the world go 'round
I'm hungry and you got me goin' 
I'm hungry and you got me goin'
