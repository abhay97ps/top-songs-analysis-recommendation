Sabotage on a downtown street
Police cars overturned
You can't do nothing to beat the heat
And if you don't, you'll get burned
Sleek women behind every door
Cost more than you got
You best be up if
You want some more
Cause if you don't
You'll be shot
Dog, dog, dog eat dog
Dog, dog, dog eat dog
Dog, dog, dog eat dog
Kamikaze from
The hundredth floor
Swan dive to the street
He couldn't handle
This madness no more
He craved that sweeter meat
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dog, dog, dog eat dog
Dog, dog, dog eat dog
Dog, dog, dog eat dog
Dog, dog, dog eat dog
Dog, dog, dog eat dog
Dog, dog, dog eat dog.....
