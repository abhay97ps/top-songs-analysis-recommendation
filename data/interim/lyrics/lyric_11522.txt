One day in your life
You will remember a place
Someone touching your face
You will come back and you will look around, you will
One day in your life
You will remember the love you found here
You will remember me somehow
Though you do not need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You will remember one day
One day in your life
When you find that you are always waiting
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I will be there
You will remember me somehow
Though you do not need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You will remember one day
One day in your life
When you find that you are always lonely
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I will be there
