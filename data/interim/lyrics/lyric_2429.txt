Oh, will you let me have all
Of your loving and affection, yeah
Will you give me your heart
And leave it under my protection, yeah
If you will
I want you to be my wife
If you will
I'll love you for the rest of my life
Hand it over
Hand it over, yeah
Hand it over
And I'll hand my love to you, yeah
Give it to me now, honey
Please don't wait until tomorrow, no
Give it to me now
Putting it off would only bring me sorrow, yeah
Say you need my arms
Around you every night
Baby, please tell me
Everything is all right
Hand it over, baby
Hand it on over
I beg you to hand it on over
And I'll hand my love to you
I would give you everything
If you would only say yes
I would try to borrow spring
If you'd only admit your happiness
Let me know where I stand
Tell me that you really want me, yeah
It would be a happy man
If you would really love me sincerely
Come on, baby
And give me a kiss
Come on, baby
That's just what I miss
Hand it over
I need you to just hand it over
I want it right now, so hand it over
And I'll hand my love to you
Come on and hand it over
I need it right now
Come on, baby, hand it over
I need it right
