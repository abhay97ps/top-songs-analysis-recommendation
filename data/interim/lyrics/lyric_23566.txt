Everybody's looking for that something 
No one ever wants to pay the price 
Everyone is scared of going nowhere 
But we ain't going anywhere tonight 
I should be more cynical and tell myself that’s not okay
I try my best to fight it, say "I hate you", but I always stay
Woah, oh, oh, cause
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Everybody's talking bout the next thing
Feel like what they got ain't good enough 
But all I wanna do is release the tension 
Bring the conversation back to us 
I should be more cynical and tell myself that’s not okay
I try my best to fight it, say "I hate you", but I always stay
Woah, oh, oh, cause
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Can we stop all the yelling baby, hear me out
I want you here and now
I try my best to fight it, say I hate you but I always stay
Hey, hey, hey-ey! Oh yeah!
Yeah, all right, everybody’s looking for that new thang
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Ain't nobody, nobody, nobody love
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain’t nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain’t nobody love like you do
