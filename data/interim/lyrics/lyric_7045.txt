Yeah
Ey homie, it's Summer Time
I'mma take a little cruise, ay
Barbecue out the park & shit
Swigging on a 32
It's Summer Time, homeboy
Slept in til about two
Jumped in my ride, hit my switch
Cause you know, holmes, that's what we do
Hit the liquor store, bumper on the floor
Got myself a six-pack
Walking out tienda, saw my homeboy pullin' up
In a Fleetwood Cadillac
Candy blue, with an attitude
"Ey ese, what you gonna do?"
Same thing as you, get a six pack or two
Smoke a joint and catch some altitude
After that, I'll probably throw a cruise
Bumpin' some old school, rhythm and blues
With the top down, nothing like it
Therе's no other time quite likе Summer Time...
"Summer time
And the livin' is
Is easy" - 
"You know how we do"
"Nothing like it" - 
"Summer time
And the livin' is
Is easy" - 
"You know how we do"
"With the top town
"Bumpin' oldies" - 
The sun is out, and I'm out and about
On E, but I won't run out, come on, homie
You know how we do
Word up on three, to the barbecue
Probably won't eat, but I'll drink a few
If you got some weed, then I'll drink with you
Sittin' on the bench, with my back against the fence
Swiggin' on a 32
What's happenin', baby, she said:
"Wait a minute aren't you the oldie man
The only man who can make a rap jam
Without fuckin' up the oldie jam"
Oh, yes I am, by the way, who are you and
What do you like to do
Meet me right outside, I got my ride outside
Let's take a little Summer Time cruise 
"Summer time
And the livin' is
Is easy" - 
"You know how we do"
"Nothing like it" - 
"Summer time
And the livin' is
Is easy" - 
"You know how we do"
"With the top town
"Bumpin' oldies" - 
The freaks come out at night, looking to excite
Any man that comes within their sight
Take no woman light, when they're dressed all tight
Walk on by, look really nice
Smell so good, like a woman should
'Brought Up in The Neighborhood'
With the pretty face and the tiny waist
Any man would take a second look
But we're driving O.G.'s, bumpin' oldies
Hide your hatin', homie, sittin' in the forties
Scrapin' and takin' the pavement
Part of the summer time entertainment
There's no other way I could say it
There's no other way to explain it
There's no other time
Quite like Summer Time
"Summer time
And the livin' is
Is easy" - 
"You know how we do"
"Nothing like it" - 
"Summer time
And the livin' is
Is easy" - 
"You know how we do"
"With the top town
"Bumpin' oldies" - 
"Yeah
Summer time
And the livin' is so easy
Summer time
Alright" -
