I'm havin' dumb money
Ayy, we can fuck lil' mama, I can't lip lock 
Gucci, spent a hunnid on some new socks 
Coulda bought a crib, bought a drop top 
I can't love a bitch, trust no thot 
Never bring a freak to your spot 
Dolce and Gabbana on my flip flops
I don't do no relaxing 
Run up the bag, get the cash in 
Fendi, am I drippin' or I'm splashin' 
12, they can't catch me when I'm passin' 
How you got a check and went broke again? 
Bitches wanting clout and I ain't kissin' 'em 
Since I first got them hundreds, I've been flippin' 'em 
Off-White with the Gucci, I might mitch match 
When I fuck her, you can get your bitch back 
What the hell she was thinking? I can't kiss that 
Why she ask me where the hell I got my wrist at? 
Why the hell a hundred-thousand in my backpack? 
Why these bitches think that we can come in contact? 
This is my drank, this ain't cognac 
You ain't get a milli, why you sign that? 
She wanna fuck, I decline that 
Look at my bitch, she a dimebag 
Look at my pinky, it's a waterslide 
Rich Forever, come and see the money side 
We can fuck lil' mama, I can't lip lock 
Gucci, spent a hunnid on some new socks 
Coulda bought a crib, bought a drop top 
I can't love a bitch, trust no thot 
Never bring a freak to your spot 
Dolce and Gabbana on my flip flops
I don't do no relaxing 
Run up the bag, get the cash in 
Fendi, am I drippin' or I'm splashin' 
12, they can't catch me when I'm passin' 
How you got a check and went broke again? 
Bitches wanting clout and I ain't kissin' 'em 
Since I first got them hundreds, I've been flippin' 'em 
I flip the money, got my check up 
I'm flexing up, but I'm no wrestler 
Blue cheese pockets got the extras 
I stack the money up like Tetris 
How I got two-fifty from my neck up? 
How I made it from the hood to a Benz truck? 
Bitches wanna fuck, I got them lined up 
How you with the gang but you ain't signed up? 
Pull out my dick, tell her kiss that 
She just want a nigga with a big sack 
Pull out the choppa, we in combat 
Touchdown on the plug like a lineback 
We can fuck lil' mama, I can't lip lock 
Gucci, spent a hunnid on some new socks 
Coulda bought a crib, bought a drop top 
I can't love a bitch, trust no thot
