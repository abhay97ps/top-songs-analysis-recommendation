Tear a star from out the sky and the sky feels blue
Tear a petal from a rose and the rose weeps too
Take your heart away from mine and mine will surely break
My life is yours to make, so please keep the spark awake
Would you take the wings from birds so that they can't fly?
Would you take the ocean's roar and leave just a sigh?
All this, your heart won't let you do
This is what I beg of you, don't take your love from me
All this your heart won't let you do
This is what I beg of you
Don't, don't, don't take your love from me
