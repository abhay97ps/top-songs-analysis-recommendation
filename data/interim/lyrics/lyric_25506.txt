Mirror, mirror on the wall
Don't say it ’cause I know I'm cute 
Louis down to my drawers
LV all on my shoes 
I be drippin' so much sauce
Got a bih lookin’ like RAGÚ 
Lit up like a crystal ball
That's cool, baby, so is you
That's how I roll
If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine 
I was born like this, don't even gotta try 
I'm like chardonnay, get better over time 
Heard you say I’m not the baddest, bitch, you lie 
It ain’t my fault that I'm out here gettin’ loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I’m the pudding in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice 
No, I'm not a snack at all
Look, baby, I'm the whole damn meal 
David, you ain't bein' slick
Don't dare try to cop a feel 
The juice ain't worth the squeeze
If the juice don't look like this 
Hold up, nigga, please
Don't make me have to take your bitch, shit 
If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine 
I was born like this, don't even gotta try 
I'm like chardonnay , get better over time 
Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie 
It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee , ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee , ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice 
Ya-ya-ee
Somebody come get this man
I think he got lost in my DMs, what? My DMs, what?
You better come get your man
I think he wanna be way more than friends, what?
More than friends
What you want me to say?
It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the proof 
Gotta blame it on my juice 
Ya-ya-ee , ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee , ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
