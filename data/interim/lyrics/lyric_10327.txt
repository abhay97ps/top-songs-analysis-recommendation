So many times
These few dreams of mine
Seem hidden behind
A mountain too high to climb
But you were the one
Who said, 'go on, follow your star'
When the song in my heart
Was just a voice in the dark
You could hear my mellow key
There's only one moon
That shines in the night
And only one love in my life
Only one love in my life
Only one love in my life
I'm a ship on the open ocean darling
You're my guiding light
The radio played
My new song today
And I heard someone say
Man, he sure got it made'
If only they knew how much you
Have made of me
Together we came
From nowhere to fame
And I never could have made it
Alone
For me there's only one moon
That shines in the night
And only one love in my life
Only one love in my life
Only one love in my life
I'm a ship on the open ocean
Darling, you're my guiding light!
Yeah!
Only one love in my life
Only one love in my life
I'm a ship on the open ocean
Darling, you're my guiding light!
Yeah!
You're my guiding light
And you're the only love in my life
