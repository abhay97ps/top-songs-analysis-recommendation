I fell in love today
Never thought I'd feel this way
Been so tired of one-night stands
Now I'm ready for a new romance
Ooh, it's a mystery, do you know
I can't figure it out
Ooh, it's a mystery, do you know
What I'm talking about
Do you love me?
Do you want me?
Maybe it's crazy, give it a chance
I think I like this new romance
It was only yesterday
That love felt so far away
Then you smiled and asked me to dance
Now I'm ready for a new romance
Ooh, it's a mystery, do you know
I can't figure it out
Ooh, it's a mystery, do you know
What I'm talking about
Do you love me?
Do you want me?
Maybe it's crazy, give it a chance
I think I like this new romance
Ooh, it's a mystery, do you know
I can't figure it out
Ooh, it's a mystery, do you know
What I'm talking about
Do you love me?
Do you want me?
Maybe it's crazy, give it a chance
I think I like this new romance
Do you love me? 
Do you want me? 
Do you love me? 
Do you want me? 
Do you love me? 
Do you want me?
