Change with the times
Change with the times
Change with the times
Wake up and look around
Change with the times
Check out what's going down
Change with the times
Forget what used to be
Change with the times
Deal with reality
Change with the times
You've gotta:
Change with the times
Keep an open mind
Or you'll wake up and find the world's left you behind
You better catch up
Change with the times
You've gotta change with the times
Change with the times
Change with the times
Change with the times
Change with the times
Change with the times
Wake up and you will hear
Change with the times
The truth is loud and clear
Change with the times
The good old days are gone
Change with the times
And time is marching on
Change with the times
You've gotta:
Change with the times
Keep an open mind
