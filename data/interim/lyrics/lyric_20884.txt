 What's happenin baby
 Let ya lil whoa Plies tell you what's goin on with it man
My hands been gettin me in a lot of trouble lately so
Ooh-hooooooo
Please excuse my hands, they just wanna touch
They just wanna feel, they don't mean no harm
Baby just excuse, my hands 
Baby please excuse my hands, I apologize
They have a one track mind, to squeeze on your behind
Baby just excuse, my hands 
Please excuse my hands
With my hands, I can make you do a lot of thangs
Have you engaging in some activities you can't explain
Leave my fingerprints on every inch of yo damn frame
With this one finger, I could make you get off the chain
Get to lickin, and my hands, they get they own brain
They wanna touch ya, they wanna rub ya, they wanna feel ya frame
Run my hands through yo hair and go against yo grain
Let me massage ya baby, and help ya ease yo pain
You wanna get comfortable? Take yo shorts off, I can help you change
Wanna take my hands off but I can't, they just gon' call yo name
If I can't squeeze ya and I can't hold ya, it don't feel the same
It ain't my fault baby, my hands is the one to blame
Please excuse my hands, they just wanna touch
They just wanna feel, they don't mean no harm 
Baby just excuse, my hands 
Baby please excuse my hands, I apologize 
They have a one track mind  to squeeze on your behind
 Baby just excuse, my hands
 Please excuse my hands
I'ma do ya like this, then do ya like that
I promise you gon' like the way I touch on you
So jump up in this Benz and let the seat back
I promise you gon' like the way I feel on you
I'ma do you 'til yo body say, "Whoa"
I'ma do it til yo mouth breathes, "No more"
I said excuse my hands, she said, "Boy stop playin'
Come make love to yo number one fan", ohh
Please excuse my hands
Before I kiss ya or make love to ya, I wanna touch
Can you please face the wall? You 'bout to get strip searched
My hands talkin to me, they want now what's under yo skirt
Let me be the one that do the honors and help you with yo shirt
My hands don't like to be unemployed, they like to work
I been told my hands are a lil mannish, they like to flirt
God knows woman the sexy thing you put on this earth
My hand cravin yo lil sweet body and it's gettin worse
I wanna thank you and your body fo helpin me write this verse
My hands will never leave yo body baby, they so loyal
Do me a favor, look on the dresser and grab that baby oil
Ain't got to be the one that do it, my hands gon' spoil ya
Please excuse my hands, they just wanna touch
They just wanna feel, they don't mean no harm
Baby just excuse, my hands 
Baby please excuse my hands, I apologize 
They have a one track mind, to squeeze on your behind
 Baby just excuse, my hands
 Please excuse my hands
Keep doin it, keep doin it, keep doin it to me 
Keep doin it, keep doin it, I swear I'll never leave
Keep doin it, keep doin it, keep doin it shawty, shawty
Keep doin it, keep doin it
Aye, aye 
Woke up in the spot 
Ooh yeah that boy's on fire 
I'm wit my nigga Plies
