Hey
I know what I came to do
And that ain't gonna change
So go ahead and talk your talk
'Cause I won't take the bait
I'm over here doin' what I like
I'm over here workin' day and night
And if my real ain't real enough
I'm sorry for you, bae
Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holdin' us down
Just come and get it, let them say what they say
'Cause I'm about to put them all away, woo
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me, woo
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me, woo
Focus on me , f-f-focus on me, woo 
Focus on me , f-f-focus on me, woo 
I can tell you're curious
It's written on your lips
Ain't no need to hold it back
Go 'head and talk your shit 
I know you're hopin' that I'll react
I know you're hopin' I'm lookin' back
But if my real ain't real enough
Then I don't know what is 
Let's find a light inside our universe now 
Where ain't nobody keep on holding us down 
Just come and get it, let them say what they say 
'Cause I'm about to put them all away, woo
Focus on me , f-f-focus on me, woo 
Focus on me , f-f-focus on me, woo
Focus on me , f-f-focus on me, woo 
Focus on me , f-f-focus on me, woo 
One, two, three, c'mon girls 
You know I like it 
 Come on, now, now
 Oh, woah, hey
Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holding us down 
Just come and get it, let them say what they say 
'Cause I'm about to put them all away, no
Focus on me   , f-f-focus on me, woo
Focus on me , f-f-focus on me, woo 
Focus on me  , f-f-focus on me, woo  
Focus on me  , f-f-focus on me, woo  
Focus on me , f-f-focus on me , woo
Focus on me  , f-f-focus on me , woo
