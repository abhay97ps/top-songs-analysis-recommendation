Checkin' every move you make
I wonder just how long it's gonna take
No matter what I say or do
I know I'm gonna end up lovin' you
My heart's already on the line
And how can I just ignore my heart
When I feel the feeling coming on
I can't hold back, it's much too strong and
Here I go, fallin' in love again
Rushin' in just like the fool I am
Here I go, here I go
It's a feeling that I can't describe
Like an achin' inside
And I've been through it all before
But like a fool, I'm comin' back for more
I'm feelin' shaky, can't disguise
Love light comin' through my eyes
It always seems to come to this
I try but I just can't resist and
Here I go, fallin' in love again
Rushin' in just like the fool I am
Here I go
I'm fallin'
Just like the fool I am
Hear me callin'
Here I go, fallin' in love again
Rushin' in, I'll play the fool for you, baby
Here I go, fallin' in love again
Rushin' in, just like the fool I am
Here I go
