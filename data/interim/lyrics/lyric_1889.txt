Listen to the rain
Hear it falling down
Ooh~
Look at all the raindrops
Falling from the rooftop
Down. Down. Down
Down. Down. Down
Down. Down. Down
Leaving puddles on the ground
And making ripples all around
Take a moment and listen to the sound
And when the night has come
Don't be afraid, my little one
See how the stars above make beautiful of
The puddles of mud
Let the sky be full of gloom
Let the rain inside your feet
Let it soak and make you cold
Let the flowers have their feast
I remind you someday soon
As we're more than flesh and meat
That this water makes you clean
And becomes your quenching drink
Listen to the rain
