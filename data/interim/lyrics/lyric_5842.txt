There was a hill we climbed
And a verse we rhymed
Went flying across the waving grass
Like, like silver bells
Against the curtain that the sky had made
Ooh, and so we played
It was a sunny day, and so we lay
Beneath the rock that sheltered us
From passing planes
And the earth caught fire when you turned
But nothing burned
There were nights when the lights
Would take us nowhere
For just a little while cars would pass
And we were out of gas
But we didn't care even though we walked a mile
There was a deejay in L.A
We used to tune in at night
To hear our favorite song
We always heard it at that perfect time
Up on that hill we climbed
And now you're gone and I'm alone
And though they say I should be
Safe, secure, and sane
Oh, I still remember yesterday
And the games that children play
