We choose it..win or lose it
Love is never quite the same
I love you..now Ive lost you
Dont feel bad..your not too late
So kiss me goodbye
And I'll try not to cry
All the tears in the world won't change your mind
Theres some1 new
And shes waiting for you
Soon your heart will be leving me behind
Linger awhile...then I'll go with a smile
Like a friend who just happened to call
For the last time..pretend you are mine
My darling...kiss me goodbye
My darling..kiss me goodbye
