The greatest romance that's ever been sold
So what do you know, you and me
Finally face to face
Checking each other up and down
In all of the obvious places
Was there ever a reason for us to be apart?
The air that fills up this room says not hardly
So this is where you end
And you and I begin
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
Baby baby, now your mind is open
To poetry seldom heard
Your heart has never been broken
Until you have heard these words
Your body was designed to respond to mine
In spite of your desire to mold me
And in the middle of it all
We kiss and like rain  we fall into
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
Baby, baby baby
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
Oh, I know you can feel me, I know that you can dance
But what do you know about the greatest romance?
Not what you think, but what you believe
What was the real reason that Adam never left Eve?
And if the truth sounds like a memory
Then you know it was meant to be , meant to be
Leave your inhibitions behind, come on, come on and see
So this is where you end 
And you and I begin 
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
I know you can feel me, I know you can dance
But what do you know about the greatest romance?
Not what you think, but what you believe
Can you tell me the reason, the reason that Adam never left Eve
The greatest, listen to me, uh
You brought me the grapes from the vine, oh yes you did
 Can I talk to you
 Listen
You help me to remember the secrets of time
And you, you, you, you offer me your love
Your love, your love, so divine
And in return, girl, in return I will surrender
Oh yeah, I will surrender, oh, yes I will
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
