It's not surprising it could end like this
Your eyes are open even when you kiss
You're so distant
So cold, so resistant
You see the world in only grey and black
Now how can anybody live like that
Without screaming
Without dying for dreaming
And you stare out the window with the passing cars
And you look at the sky
Thank your unlucky stars
No, you're never quite happy right where you are
So you keep on, inventing shadows
Where there are none
No there are none
Yeah you, keep on inventing shadows
Where there are none
You don't even see the sun
Can't you see the sun?
You can't be shocked that I might want to leave
The way you're living's like you're half asleep
You just drain me
If I go, who could blame me?
And you stare out the window with the passing cars
And you look at the sky
Thank your unlucky stars
No, you're never quite happy right where you are
Right where you are
With all that you are
So you keep on, inventing shadows
Where there are none
No there are none
Yeah you, keep on inventing shadows
Where there are none
You don't even see the sun
Can't you see the sun?
You're so young
So beautiful
So flawless in my eyes
Don't you know the world shines
Every time you smile
Why can't you just smile?
So you keep on, inventing shadows
Where there are none
No there are none
Yeah you, keep on inventing shadows
Where there are none
You don't even see the sun
Can't you see the sun?
You dim the lights in the world I see
How I wish that I could still believe
Time to save me
If I go, who could blame me?
