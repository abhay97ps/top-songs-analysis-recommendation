Sweeter than the birds that go in the trees
That's what she meant to me
Sweeter than the wine and she looked so fine
When she met me in Tennessee
I felt so grand when she took my hand
And said, 'Come, go with me'
Held me tight on a moonlit night
Someplace in Tennessee
Sweeter than the birds that go in the trees
That's what she meant to me
Sweeter than the wine and she looked so fine
When I met her in Tennessee
I felt so grand when she took my hand
And said, 'Come, go with me'
Held me tight on a moonlit night
Someplace in Tennessee
