Is he really goin' out with 'er? I don't know. Look, here he comes now. Let's ask
'im. Hey, Murray, is it true Betty's wearin' your ring? Uh-huh
Who's that bangin' on the piano? I don't know. You goin' out with
Her tonight? You bet yer fur. By the way, where'd ya meet her?
I met her one day at the Laundromat
She turned around and smiled at me, ya get the picture? 
And that's when I fell in love with the Leader Of the Laundromat
My folks were always putting her down 
Because her laundry came back brown 
I don't care if they think she's bad
I fell in love 'cause she looked so sad
I got a date tonight with the Leader Of the Laundromat
My dad said "Find a laundry that's new" 
How can I tell my baby we're through 
Gotta drive right into town
I don't care if my shirts are brown
I got a date tonight with the Leader Of the Laundromat
When I finally got there, I told her it was all over between us. I'll never forget the
Hurt and the funny look in her eye. She grabbed my laundry and ran into the street
Directly into the path of a runaway garbage truck. I yelled "watch out, watch out
Watch out, watch out, watch ou-ou-t"
I felt so messy standing there 
My daddy's shorts were everywhere 
Tenderly I kissed her goodbye
Picked up my clothes, they were finally dry
But I won't forget you, oh Leader Of the Laundromat
(Who's that bangin' on the piano?
I don't know.)
