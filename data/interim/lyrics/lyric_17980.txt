Times are tough on an honest heart
People don't follow through with what they start
Lying eyes looking at me up and down
Making talk that's only cheap
Making promises they never keep
But I keep looking for what I still haven't found
One honest heart
That I can believe in
Two loving arms that will never let me go
One good man that I can count on
It shouldn't be so hard
Finding one honest heart
Now I've been close a time or two
I thought I saw my dreams coming true
But I was just living in a fairy tale
I won't play the fool again
I won't play a game that I can't win
But I still have faith and I keep telling myself, there's
I don't think I'm asking too much
Just once in my life I want to be touched by
One good man, one honest heart
