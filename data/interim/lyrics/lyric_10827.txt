We're on the shores of nowhere, looking out to sea
I turn and kiss your face and you laugh at me
You laugh at me
How do I feel? Well I feel like rain
Feel like saying
It feels so good, so right
To be with tonight
 hight
There is no space between the ocean, you, and me
Exchanging life force as we live and breath
Together we'll be
How do I feel when I feel like being
Feel like singing
Feels so good, so right
To be with you tonight
 hight
You make me feel so young, the way you laugh and play
Like a child in the sun, you know I wanna stay-ay
In lo-ove this way
How do I feel when I feel like praying
 whoaa
Feels so good, so right
To beeeee with you
Hey baby 
You know it feels so goo-ood, ahhhahhhhh
You know it feels so good
Uh-huh
 uh-huh
