Whatcha doing out in the night time?
Why'd you call me on the phone?
Your mama can't solve your problems
When's daddy ever get home?
So you did your little move and cried
In the middle of a suicide
Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes
Don't sing your last lullaby
There's no one there to hold you
No one hears your scream
You live life up and down
Your nightmare's are your dreams
I know it's lonely when you're hanging 'round
Don't you take it lying down, no, no
Hold on, hold on tight
I'll make everything all right
Wake up, don't go to sleep
I pray the Lord your soul to keep
Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes
Don't sing your last lullaby
Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes
Don't sing your last lullaby
