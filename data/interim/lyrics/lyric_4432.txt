What's your name, is it Jane?
Would you mind sitting next to a silly old fool?
It's just that I'm tired of wasting my hours
Talking to trees, watching the flowers grow
Watching birds, chasing bees
Little boys scraping knees
Even my tears have all dried
Can I sit by your side?
Don't misunderstand me
I'm just an old man with no place to go
And if you oblige me and sit here beside me
I'll tell you a story, a beautiful story
That you might not know, please don't go
Pardon me, Mister Tree
I hope that I didn't offend you before
You are my friend but I wanted much more
Now I'm back once again
Just like always before
Watchin' birds chasin' bees
Little boys scrapin' knees
Even my tears have all dried
Can I sit by your side?
Don't misunderstand me
I'm just an old man with no place to go
If you oblige me and sit here beside me
I'll tell you a story, a beautiful story
That you might not know, please don't go
