Hey baby, they're playing our song
The one we used to hear when we used to get along
Hey baby, they're playing our song
Let's get back together, that's where we belong
It's the one with the pretty melody
It's the one that made you fall in love with me
It made us feel so groovy
We fell in love, just like in the movies
Hey baby, they're playing our song
The one they used to play when we used to get along
Hey baby, they're playing our song
Let's get back together, that's where we belong
Pleasant memories are coming back to me
Can't you remember the way it used to be
It made us feel like dancing
It gave us time to think about romancing
Hey, baby, hey, baby
Hey, baby, hey, baby
It's the one with the pretty melody
It's the one that made you fall in love with me
It made us feel so groovy
We fell in love, just like in the movies
Hey baby, hey baby
They're playing our song
Hey baby, hey baby
I said they're playing our song
