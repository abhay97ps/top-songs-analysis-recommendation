Rearranged
Every room, every floor
Every inch from door to door
Every chair
Every chair and table's new
Every cup and saucer, too
Everything's been changed
Nothing's like before
Things I did with you
I do no more
They're all behind me
Everything's been changed
Since we've been apart
Everything that is
Except my heart
Yesterday, you were mine
The world was ours
Happy days of fun filled hours
And I don't know what to do
About all the tears I've cried
And I can't get over you
No matter how hard I try
Cause
