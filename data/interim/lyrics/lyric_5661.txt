There's a certain sound
Always follows me around
When you're close to me
You will hear it
It's the sound that lovers
Finally will discover
When there is no other
For their love
It's my happy heart you hear
Singing loud and singing clear
And it's all because you're near
Be my love
Take my happy heart away
Make me love you, make my day
In your arms I want to stay
All my love
Yeah'
Feeling more and more
Like I've never felt before
You have changed my life
So completely
Music fills my soul now
I've lost all control now
I'm not half, I'm whole now
With your love
It's my happy heart you hear
Singing loud and singing clear
And it's all because you're near
Be my love
Take my happy heart away
Make me love you, make my day
In your arms I want to stay
All my love
It is my happy heart
You can hear my happy heart
In love uoohhhhhh
Aaaaahhhhh
Take me
Take my happy heart
Please be my happy heart
Eeehhhhhhh'
