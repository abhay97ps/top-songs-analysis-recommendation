Yo, we battled 15 years ago
And I won't pretend I don't remember it
But I'm not suppose to mention it, I swore an oath on holy testament
Besides, it's history, we know the rest of it
You didn't past the torch to me, I took that shit while you were smoking meth with it
The Bay is home I'm thankful that I made it back to San Jo'
I set the standard, this ancient asshole laid a bad example
Now Rambo's aiming at then I'm taking back the ammo
After I leave Top half open like a baby grand piano
I'ma claim this as my castle but it doesn't stop here
It's two time everything, you get double shots: cheers!
I ain't the underdog once the fog clears
It's like the last Royal Rumble: someone incredible and a bunch of Top tears
You in my cross hairs, thinking he can beat me is crazy
Fuck a battle of the ages this is B.C. A.D
Now this beating brings back the same feeling graffiti gave me
I'll leave you split, it means my pen's been on a mean streak lately
Face it, you ain't the lord of a thing, I tried to warn him
I been the lord of this ring, homie: stare into the eyes of Sauron
This is my court, I am Jordan
My performance is a dissection, call me DJ Shadow to your vital organs
Every line from Saurus is high-octane
I taught Klay and Steph to let it fly long-range
So after this, your list of favorite rappers might not change
But when I give Top five, it ain't Dylan's name!
Now I'm not saying I'm a legend and this man's not
But my legend next to his legend is a desert to a sandbox
It's Severn vs Shamrock, I'm heavy with the hands Top
Stealing on holmes  call me Benny from the Sandlot
So give it everything you can, pops!
Don't talk that loud nonsense
Then step out on the field then show us all the Browns offense
Cause I'm trying to do more than knock this clown unconscious
I'm trying to create a world where my girl can walk around topless
Time
You dare talk about me on some graffiti shit? That shit is dead as fuck
I'll make you famous when I tag your toe but this time when I'm spraying cans nobody's getting up
Dan gave me the shot of the century I guess
Like Oswald to Kennedy's death
Nah dawg, this is Tesla versus Edison
Sabertooth versus Weapon X
My pen game sharp as a switchblade, knife embedded in flesh to sever his neck
I'll change his bitch's life in 90 seconds or less like a pregnancy test
Get him shook, cause every line is twisted, that's an Etch-A-Sketch
I'm so far ahead of my time with it I'm high on drugs that haven't been invented yet
Let loose a rampage, I'm Soundwave when his chest ejects
Bring his camp pain , that close left make him lean far right like Megadef
But I'm not Megadef, that fascist prick
I am more like Megatron, megalodon lexicon, smash the whip
Like a Decepticon with the weapons drawn, the level I'm on
One step beyond upper echelon
I'm armed and deadly, narcolepsy...that's criminally slept on
Get gone
Little homie, I was a legend before you stepped in
With open cases for having beef over paper like your delicatessen
Plus I was banging with Lords in Santa Clara when the Tec was a weapon
Have money dancing with a nina like a Mexican wedding
What up Pete? It's Topr the card's deep
Blood in the water it's Shark Week
I'm schooling a two time champ
Apollo Creed in Rocky 3 box like a G
Throw a combo lift him off his feet
And leave him next to the curb with three rights and a left like parking on Market Street
You don't want it with me
You always rap about fist fights
Try to measure up, I'll fucking beat you within an inch of your life
Caught on tape stealing on him like a thief of the night
But I prefer disrespect in the ring like I cheat on my wife
He needs this type of L to make him trip like taking vials of acid
A full clip all in his head, now it's psychosomatic
Plus I got a blade that's sharper than the ones the ancient vikings clashed with
That'll open up The Saurus like creative writing classes
I'm lit major with a razor
It's Stanley, originator, that's Stan Lee
So I gave y'all a fantasy cameo cause on cam' he owes for the fans to see
Two tens it ain't bluffing on cash creek
Draw the Mac, , damn Pete
Ya might play me but it won't be fun, I'm Zangief
He issued me a challenge to start throwing down with his fists
But when his face is a fucking mountain like this, how could I miss?
I can't believe, after all these years, that's what you really rhyme like
That was a piss-poor 32, you're a Miller High Life
You were battling before me, you were doing shows before me
Now you're over 40, making that big comeback on the road to glory
Damn, you one of the oldest friends I ever had Topr!
Yo, but I don't mean that like we're hella tight, it's more like you're my grandfather
Like when I first came up on the scene I thought he was someone who could help me learn more
So I asked him about his first tours and he told me about the first and second World Wars
I'm sure the gap between us can't get too much wider
I stay on the road cooking like a food truck driver
You went from being a true punchliner to lead singer of a metal band with the appeal of a school bus fire
But through time I've evolved
Any prize fight I lost I made up for with a hundred more highlights you saw
Muay thai fighter brawl with a right like a white line of raw
The way it's giving you that typewriter jaw
Now there's a fine line to draw between O.G. and "Oh Jesus"
You're older than our whole scene is
You've been old school since '03ish
No peace, I wish they found Harambe a hiding place
You came a long way to die today Andre The Giant face
Look I won't lie, the guy can paint but none of these fans give a fuck though
I got a cap set for your nozzle that ain't Montana or Rust O
Homie I brought so much ammo they had to cancel the gun show
I know you couldn't take a Jabber without landing a punch though
I'm cut throat, never sleep, that's insomnia
Helping my grandfather rest in peace I hadn't had the honor of
But it's obvious he can't stand the rain, so bag his body up
The hand of God will leave Top' spinning: Happy Hanukkah!
I offered you a chance, but some cats can't learn
Your brain's a piece of cheese on a string that helps the rat's wheel turn
I'm only here to see if that old Topper gas still burns
So I can send your bitch ass back to Asheville in an ash filled urn!
Last time you were here you lost to Fresco...doing the gang talk!
In a skin-tight...yellow tank top
He ignored your stripes and bounced around out of pocket: that's a bank shot
Well I'm the mighty Thor in a lightning storm: welcome to Ragnarok
I'm back in the Bay building against Wade Wilson without a mask involved
The astronaut from Planet Rock blasting off
Entire catalog out of this world
I am Isaac Asimov, riding high on Adderalls
Had your girl get naked, in a way it was a casting call
Cause she gives out so many head shots I nicknamed that bitch Kalashnikov
IT'S THAT FAT BROAD!
Hey, kitten
What's your favorite position? Rape victim?
I'll hold you down like a cartridge on a Nintendo game system
I came different
Pete, do you say, "I love you" on the first date with women?
You're so soft your teardrops got little fucking mermaids in 'em
But I ain't hating pimping
I'm sure the pussy on this chick is crack
But watching your relationship thrown up online is digital ipecac
I mean I know you love cup-caking obviously since you're fat but
Even Drake sees you pop up on his feed and thinks, "Pete's kind of a bitch for that!"
Yo, this is that aerosol paint for her white-washed brain
Old-school cuts go over a kid's head, that's a high top fade
The way you rap makes me gag like I'm high on yay'
Holding these beam shots back like Cyclops' shades
And the hands stay seasoned without lime or Tequila
Yeah you spazzing, but I make him bite his tongue like a violent seizure
Face looking like some kind of creature from Sci-Fi feature
So I keep a Heckler on each side like Mystery Science Theater
With a permit to conceal and carry where ever the handle's Pearl
It never jams, but it sings like Eddie Vedder
I apply deadly pressure to survive by any measure
Cause when I draw, it'll turn your world upside down like MC Escher
With that ox though, I'm Picasso, rearrange his traits
It ain't nothing to jump him, I got more battery charges than tripple A
And since we in California I'ma get in his face
And put a buck 50 on it, then another buck 50 on it like minimum wage
I'm the king of the Bay, I don't have to let lead fly
Shank in his left eye, turn Mr. Potato Head to french fries
Either write a rhyme on the side of the blade so the next time
Some skinny faggot bars your life away you get a word in edge wise
This is my girl and I do love her, every fucking thing you say is true
Except her favorite sex position, which is "A Thousand Feet Away From You"
Look, now y'all probably missed it, but I wrote an underlying theme
Because I see the bitch in Top'
So I put two big rounds up front to keep it official, Top'
But I got this last missile locked, pointed 'ere; Mr. Spock
And if you thought I'd keep it bottled in you got me twisted Top'
See Topr looked like a 1%er
Topr *is* a 1%er
Me? I'm the top 1% so fuck a Top gun, it's time Top got taught some respect
We can let Top' pick the topic, he'll get boxed up instead
Cause I'm only on this card to put one into Top's upper deck
Look, we can toss up a bet you ain't been served like that
Since back when there was only three venues we were all trying to earn stripes at
And I was anchoring our stars like the Burnside Flag
Homie, your shirt size tag says "Reverse Live's Dad"
But I ain't come to joke around, you know this clown's been broken down so for my home crowd
This is how a closing round is supposed to sound
For a decade there's heads that have wondered how I kept up this hunger
Like when will I finally hang it up like I won't get any younger
But if you think age is anything more or less than a number
Then you already missed the point like betting the under
Reinvented, restructure, I'm on that Rushmore
{Stumble}
Reinvent and restructure, I'm on that Rushmore hustling
If Top' wanna pop off, shit I can uncork something
I'll even let you choose the route
Either A: retire if you lose or round
Or B: We go back to Carolina to Duke it out
You shoulda knew by now to not cross me
On God my right cross is all topsy right before the autopsy
Sorry not sorry, but your buzz has fallen flat Top'
I will flat stomp you into the fresh asphalt til you're part of the black Top'
This has been a hell of a match Top'
But before I can say, "hats off", ax chop, you end up with your Apple in your lap top
Time
Hey Peter
Remember that time I saw you in the city with Lush getting drunk outside that shitty club?
I hit the blunt, passed it to Plex, you pulled me aside like, "Listen blood
After that time you served me in Santa Cruz I will forever give you love
Cause you inspired me to become the best at this there ever was."
I must admit I was touched, can't make this shit up
Topr's a mastermind, the metaphor's vivid enough
It's Dr. Frankenstein with the stitches cut
I created a monster with a lot of different bodies but he never really existed before I lit him up
I respect it, he's still standing like Stonehenge, maintaining tradition
{stumbles}
But this blueprint I drew it  and y'all don't put faith in my vision
I paid my dues, shouldn't have to pay again to maintain my position
Cause I'm the GOAT like Satan's depiction in most ancient religions
And if you say any different you're a goddamn liar
I can't count how many hot rounds these thoughts have inspired
It's the Bay's Johnny Blaze, y'all know, the Fresh Coast ghostwriter
My punches are off the chain when I raise Hell off the top, whooo I'm on fire
But I don't sleep on Pete, I know he looks like a sucker
But he's a thesaurus, and I was taught not to judge a book by its cover
But you've really had that pro bowler swag cooking this summer
Well stay in your lane when you roll up or you're getting hooked in the gutter
I'll smack him back to the 90's, these hands make him time travel
Cause he wasn't doing multisyllabics when him and I battled
But I was, this whole time he's been riding the buzz standing in my shadow
Rewriting history on film like Man In The High Castle
My advice, don't take a date to see the Bodied premier
Cause the sight of that face on a screen, 20 foot high is just weird
You're looking at the uncut dope that inspired your career
But the real problem's staring right back, like sniffing lines off a mirror
But real talk I love Pete, we're both titans in here
Over weight right? That's not in contention
But bitch, I am king of late night, Johnny carcinogenic
Got an appetite for destruction at the bar with my henchmen
You're just a glutton for punishment that's starved for attention
And it's hard to not mention, but it's brutal to see
Mr. Two Times Everything...including losing to me!
