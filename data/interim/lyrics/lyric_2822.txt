You ask me why, why I love her --
Woh-woh, dum-dee-dah-dee
Dum-dee-dah-dee, doh
I'll tell you why, why I love her
Woh-woh, dum-dee-dah-dee
Dum-dee-dah-dee, doh
She understands me the way you never did
She loves me, she loves me the way you never did
She takes the time to notice I'm around
She builds me up -- she never lets me down
You want to know if I'll come back to you --
Woh-woh, dum-dee-dah-dee
Dum-dee-dah-dee, doh
After knowing her, no other love will do
Woh-woh, dum-dee-dah-dee
Dum-dee-dah-dee, doh
She understands me the way you never did
She loves me, she loves me the way you never did
She takes the time to notice I'm around
She builds me up -- she never lets me down
That's why I love her...
She understands me...
