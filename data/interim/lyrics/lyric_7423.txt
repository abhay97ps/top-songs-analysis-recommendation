First thing I remember was asking papa "Why?"
For there were many things I didn't know
And Daddy always smiled; took me by the hand
Saying, "Someday you'll understand"
Well, I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast; you better learn it young
'Cause Someday Never Comes
The time and tears went by and I collected dust
For there were many things I didn't know
When Daddy went away, he said, "Try to be a man
And, Someday you'll understand"
Well, I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast; you better learn it young
'Cause Someday Never Comes
And then, one day in April, I wasn't even there
For there were many things I didn't know
A son was born to me, Mama held his hand
Saying "Someday you'll understand"
Well, I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast; you better learn it young
'Cause Someday Never Comes
Ooh, someday never comes
Think it was September, the year I went away
For there were many things I didn't know
And I still see him standin', tryin' to be a man
I said, "Someday you'll understand"
Well, I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast; you better learn it young
'Cause Someday Never Comes
Oh someday never comes
Hmmm
Hmmm
