Graduation Graduation
It's a time for joy
A time for tears
A time we'll treasure through the years
We'll remember always
Graduation day
Graduation Graduation
Graduation Graduation
At the senior prom
We danced till three
And then you gave your heart to me
We'll remember always
Graduation day
Though we leave in sorrow
All the joys we've known
We can face tomorrow
Knowing we'll never walk alone
Though The ivy walls
Are far behind
No matter where our paths may wind
We'll remember always
Graduation day
Graduation Graduation
Graduation Graduation
