Well, Interstate 80
We was cuttin' the fog
Just me and Old Sloan
We had a eighteen wheeler
With ten on the floor and a stereo
Layin' a strip
Then we spied a sign
Says "Eat and Gas Now"
We decided to whip in and pick up some chow
At the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin'
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up 
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe
Now I've been every place 'tween here and South Sioux
And we've seen us a truck stop waitress or two
But this gal's built like a burlap bag full of bobcats
She's got it to-gether
Well, she filled my tank
I said, "Thank you, honey"
Name was Mavis
I gave her the money
Old Sloan just sat there
Watchin', waggin', and wishin'
I says, "You wait in the truck, boy"
Then I went inside
She says, "What'll it be?"
I says, "A cup of your best and a number 3"
She come back with an order to go and a quart of hot C
And a bone for Sloan
I said, "Much obliged"
Old Sloan gave a bark
I left her a buck and he left his heart
At the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin'
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin'
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe
Well, Saturday night and we was truckin' along
Yeah, me and Old Sloan was a-gettin' it on
I said, "Sloan, I been thinkin' on a-gettin' up my courage
And tonight's the night"
Well, I popped the clutch
Gave the tranny a spin
Took the Beebeetown ramp and slid on in
To the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin'
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up 
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe
Well, I got me a stool
Took a load off my shoes
Made Mavis an offer that she couldn't refuse
I says, "How'd you like to go for a ride with me and Old Sloan?
I just had my truck washed"
She allowed as how that sounded like a whole lotta fun
But we was gonna have to wait until the dishes was done
And was it alright with me if she brought along her mother as a chaperone?
I said, "Why not?"
Well, we geared that tranny into super low
And the four of us went to see a picture show
Yeah, took 'em to the drive-in theater over by Pisgah to see True Grit
Saw the late late show
Old Sloan hit the sack
And then along about two o'clock I hauled 'em on back
To the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin'
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin'
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin'
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin'
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe
