Dreaming
Cliff Richard
4:00 I've been walkin' all night
It's the time I always think of you
If you could only see through my eyes
Then you'd know just what I'm going through
Here am I, I'm takin' a chance
In runnin' around with stars in my eyes
Here am I, I'm lookin' for you
Wonderin' why do I feel so blue
Chorus:
 I'm dreamin'
Dreamin' of me and you, oh
 I'm dreamin'
Dreamin' will see me through
Never letting chances pass me by
I'm gonna dream you right into my life
Yeah, dream you right into my life
Woman you better believe that I'm
Dreamin' you into my life
5:00 still walkin' around
I call you up but you just bring me down
I guess you'd say I'm gettin' nowhere
But in my dreams you always come around
Here am I, I'm takin' a chance
Walkin' on air, flyin' so high
Here am I, I'm facin' the truth
There's no other way I'll ever make you mine
Woman, you got to believe me woman
Oh woman, you got to believe me woman
I'll be 
You got to believe me woman
Woman, oh woman, you got to believe me
I'll be forever
