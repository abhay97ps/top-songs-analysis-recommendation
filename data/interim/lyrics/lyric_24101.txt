They boarding up this water town
Ain't nobody hanging around
Another grey September day
Was I crazy to think she'd stay
If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet on the beach
Instead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in, like a warm southern whisper on her 
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
If only I, had a little more summertime
I brace myself against the cold
And let her memory take hold
Stirring that old fire up
As if I don't miss her enough
If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer 
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet on the beach
Instead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in, like a warm southern whisper on her 
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
If only I, had a little more summertime
Just a little more summertime
If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer 
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
If only I, had a little more summertime
