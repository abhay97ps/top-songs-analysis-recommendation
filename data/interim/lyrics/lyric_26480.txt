Mm, uh, uh, uh, uh
Ah, uh, uh
Look
Show out, show up 
Back out, pole up
Man down, roll up
Man down, roll up
Show out, show up 
Back out, pole up
Man down, roll up
Man down, roll up
All my niggas is ready to go
Pop Smoke, big smoke
Clip in the stick, stick in the coat 
And they got guns same size as Kevin Hart
Please don't think it's a joke
Back on tour with the gang and it's sold out
Twenty-two dates, I ain't missin' a show
Got the ladies hittin' my phone 
Got the mandem hittin' the woah 
Me plus ten on the list, they know how I'm comin', I'm bringin' the bros
And I got G's that's stuck in the trap, no government name, they stick to the code 
Left wrist Audemars Piguet, right wrist whippin' the whip on the stove
He don't care 'bout fame, he just tryna get rich on the low
Show out, show up 
Back out, pole up 
Man down, roll up 
Man down, roll up 
Show out, show up 
Back out, pole up 
Man down, roll up 
Man down, roll up 
Me and the team runnin' up, hit 'em up, send 'em up, get 'em on impact 
Pull up on scene, have 'em all lookin', we stuntin', no, can not forget that 
Gather 'round, niggas, the realer, mane 
Look in the mirror, see who you are 
All of this evil that's in my way, I pray to God with open arms
No, can't trip, get grip, hands all over these chips, watch this flip
No, see, I ain't no bitch but I'm bent
I parlay with chicks, the man, the myth
See, I'm not dwellin' on that 
Focus on runnin' these laps, believe 
Who could it be?
Why am I feelin' so hellish? The devil, indeed 
Lord, are you hearin' me call out? Ayy 
Lord, are you hearin' me call out? Ayy 
Am I lost? Pray for me, ooh, yeah 
Dream on, fly away , dream on 
Lord, are you hearin' me call out? Ayy 
Lord, are you hearin' me call out? Ayy 
Am I lost? Pray for me, what's it cost? Everything
Dream on, fly away, dream on
Show out, show up 
Back out, pole up 
Man down, roll up 
Man down, roll up 
Show out, show up 
Back out, pole up 
Man down, roll up 
Man down, roll up
