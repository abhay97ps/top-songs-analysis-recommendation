Yeah, something of a strong wind is coming over me
It's got a hold of me, yeah
Thinking and doing things I shouldn't be
I really I shouldn't be
Yeah, but one more call
It's the one more “What'cha doing right now?”
It's the one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
It's the one more here we go again
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tearin' t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
I'm lyin' here, wishin' you could stay a little longer
So calm and so cool, yeah I try to be
Like it don't bother me
The last time was the last time
Until I'm all alone, then I'm picking up the phone
Yeah, it's the one more call
It's the one more “What'cha doing right now?”
It's the one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
It's the one more here we go again
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tearin' t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
I'm lyin' here, wishin' you could stay a little longer
Yeah
Yeah, one more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tearin' t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
I'm lyin' here, wishin' you could stay a little longer
Stay a little longer
Wishing you could stay a little longer
Mmm-hmm, oh
