Children, I wanna warn ya 
'Cause I've been to California 
Where Mickey Mouse is such a demon 
Where Mickey Mouse is as big as a house 
Ba da ba ba da da 
Ba da ba ba da da
Life is wasted on illusion 
Tom and Jerry's no solution 
Evil games for cartoon demons 
Pinocchio's a real boy, look around!
Ba da ba ba da da 
Ba da ba ba da da
And I cry all night
Do you wanna hold me, hold me tight?
Do you wanna hold me? Oh yeah
Do you wanna hold me, hold me there?
Children, you got to hear me 
You just got to understand me 
Love and death ain't no physical thing 
'Cause Mickey Mouse, he don't wanna know! 
Ba da ba ba da da 
Ba da ba ba da da
And I cry all night
Do you wanna hold me, hold me tight?
Do you wanna hold me? Oh yeah
Do you wanna hold me, hold me there?
Do you wanna?
And I cry all night
Do you wanna hold me, hold me tight?
Do you wanna hold me? Oh yeah
Do you wanna hold me, hold me there?
And I cry all night
There ain't no more confusion in the night
There's someone there to tell me what is right
Do you wanna hold me, hold me tight?
And I cry all night
There's only one solution to this life
There's someone there to tell me what it's like
Do you wanna hold me? Oh yeah
Do you wanna hold me? Oh yeah
Do you wanna hold me, hold me there?
Do you wanna hold me? Oh yeah
Do you wanna hold me, hold me there?
Do you wanna hold me? Oh yeah
Do you wanna hold me, hold me there?
Do you wanna hold me? Oh yeah
Do you wanna hold me?
