Um, we're gonna be voting
Yes
Get another Obama up in there
Yeah, absolutely 
Got another, we got to do it 
We can do it too, we can do anything 
You know? I'll say this
It's sad to think 
We can do this
We're not gonna make it
And it's gotten to the point
Where we just can't fake it
For some ungodly reason
We gotta work on it
We just won't let it die
I guess neither one of us 
Wants to be thе first to say goodbye
We just don't, we just don't want to
I keep wondеring
I keep wondering
What I'm gonna do without you
What I'm gonna do without you
And I guess you must be
Wondering the same thing too
So we go on
Go on together living a lie
Because neither one of us 
Wants to be the first to say goodbye
Oh, every time I find the nerve
Every time I find the nerve
To say I'm leaving
I can't go
Old memories
Those old memories get in my way
Oh, Lord knows it's only me
Oh, He knows it's only me
That I'm deceiving
When it comes to saying goodbye
That's a simple word that I just cannot say
There can be no way
There can be no way
This can have a happy ending
Can't make that note sitting down
No, no
So we just go on
Hurting and pretending
And convincing ourselves
To give it just one more try
Because neither one of us 
Wants to be the first to say
Neither one of us 
Wants to be the first to say
Neither one of us 
Wants to be the first to say
Farewell, my love
Goodbye
I can't sing that song sitting down
I can't get a note out
Oh my goodness
