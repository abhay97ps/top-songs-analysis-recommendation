Well, early one evening I was roamin' around;
I was feelin' kind of mean, I shot a deputy down
I strolled along home, and I went to bed
Well, I laid my pistol up under my head
He strolled along home 
And he went to bed 
Laid his pistol 
Up under his head; 
Well, early next morning 'bout the break of day
I figured it was time to make my getaway
I was steppin' right along but I was steppin' too slow
Got surrounded by the sheriff down in Mexico
He was steppin' right along  but he was steppin' too slow 
Got surrounded by a sheriff 
Down in Mexico 
When I was arrested; why, I didn't have a dime
The sheriff said, "Son, you're ridin' free this time
Where you're goin' you won't need a cent
'Cause the great state of Texas gonna pay your rent
'Cause where you're goin' 
You won't need a cent 
'Cause the great state of Texas 
Gonna pay your rent. 
Well, I didn't have a key and I didn't have a file
So natur'lly I stayed around until my trial
The judge was an old man; ninety-three
And I didn't like the way the jury looked at me
The judge was an old man 
Ninety-three 
I didn't like the way...
The jury looked at me. 
The judge and the jury, they did agree
They all said murder in the first degree
The judge said,  "Sam, I don't know whether to hang you or not. But this here killin' of deputy sheriffs has just naturally got to stop! "
It was a most unsatisfactory trial
They gave me ninety-nine years on the hard rock pile
Ninety and nine on the hard rock ground
And all I ever did was shoot a deputy down
Ninety and nine 
On the hard rock pile 
And all he ever did...
Was shoot a deputy down
