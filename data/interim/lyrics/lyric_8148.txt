Like a star, slipping out of place
Sliding from the sky, tumbling through space
When you touch my hand
I swear I feel like I'm falling
Seems like I'm falling
Like a wheel whirling, round and round
Rolling down a hill
Spinning on the ground
Your kisses make my dizzy
In the head and I'm falling
Falling
Uh oh girl
I think that I have fell for you
Uh oh girl
I think that I have fell for you
I was a bird soaring, through the air
Flying fancy free, without a care
Until you clipped my wings
Now look at me oh, I'm falling
Yeah, falling
Oh here I go, down and down I go
I can't help myself girl you thrill me so
Yeah you blew my mind
And I know that I'm falling
Yes, I'm falling
Uh oh girl
I think that I have fell for you
Uh oh girl
I think that I have fell for you
Oh, down, down, down I go
Oh, down, down, down I go
Oh, down, down, down I go
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh oh girl
I think that I have fell for you
Uh oh girl
I think that I have fell for you
Uh oh girl
I think that I have fell for you
