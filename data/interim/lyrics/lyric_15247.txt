Yea yea
Yea yea
And that’s for whom the bell tolls
I’m always losing bankrolls
I keep the real ones real close
And let my hubris take ‘trol
I have some demons they talk to me
Only way to slay to kill a beat
Here grab my hand we’ll go away
And take this on some other day
Go to the table and put 'bout 8 hundred on red
Maybe I shoulda bought me an apartment instead
One that’s real far from the feds 
I’ve just been smoking my meds
And taking the falls for my girls
I’m just a sucker for curls
I’ve been a healer for all of the world
But I got me some exes that’s turnin’ on me 
Keep a piece at home like the Turkish Army 
My royalties man they always free
Give that shit away to the working party 
Burn that shit away that’s word to Marley
I’m at the party but where’s the Molly
Keep it fly like my name was Marty 
Give an ear just to know that my night was starry 
You know I’m fiending for the bitch but I can’t be sorry
And I found love but I had to change
Man yo doves just brought pain
I had to understand to be better as a man
I got a firebrand like a marking on my hand 
Always fallin' in love at the first sight
Yo bitch don’t even look right
I’ve been at the shows hit you in the nose
And I leave it bleeding it don’t look right
When I can’t speak man who will speak for me
Future looks bleak man Hendricks speak to me
And that’s for whom the bell tolls
I’m always losing bankrolls
I keep the real ones real close
And let my hubris take ‘trol
I have some demons they talk to me
Only way to slay to kill a beat
Here grab my hand we’ll go away
And take this on some other day
I froze up 
Didn’t know where I was ten toes up 
Woke up in a bed like what’s up 
Big shot to the head but nose up 
Swear you’ll never know who shows up
Swear you’ll never know who blows up
Feelings were delt, said how I felt
Swear you’ll never know who grows up
Treat me like it’s Bernie how I made off
When home I drown myself in chaos
 Lascialo andare che fosse 
I’m comin’ for you 
Bitch I’m like okay
When I can’t speak man who will speak for me
Future looks bleak man X just speak to me
And that’s for whom the bell tolls
I’m always losing bank rolls
I keep the real one’s real close
And let my hubris take ‘trol
I have some demons they talk to me
Only way to slay is to kill a beat
Here grab my hand we’ll go away
And take this on some other day
And that’s for whom the bell tolls
I’m always losing bank rolls
I keep the real one’s real close
And let my hubris take ‘trol
I have some demons they talk to me
Only way to slay is to kill a beat
Here grab my hand we’ll go away
And take this on some other day
