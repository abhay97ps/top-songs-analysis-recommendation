People are changing
I  said people people are changing
This  whole world this whole world is changing
How do I know let me tell you so
Here's an example
Take  the time
When  it used to be man to boy
Take the time when we all had to go from front to back
There's  more love for your fellow man
Thousands of people joining hands
Oh people are changing
I said people people are changing
Don't  you know this whole world this whole world is changing
How do I know let me tell you so
One more example
Take the time
When we were afraid to even talk
White and black red and yellow never could walk side by side
Now we can
There's more love for your fellow man
Thousands of people all of us joining hands
People everybody's changing
People oh people are changing
I said people people are changing
Don't you people came from far and near
You know why they came? There's more love for your fellow man
Thousands of people all of us joining hands
Everybody's changing people
Do it with me
People are changing
