Ooh, hiya
I miss you so much
Your light, your smile, your way
And everything about us
Now you're gone
You're still here in my heart, in my tears
Yeah, you sure left your mark
And we were just getting started
It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough together
But it was long enough
Yeah, it was long enough to last forever
Sometimes I get so mad, I scream, I swear at this
'Cause this isn't how we planned it
I sit here in a cold room
Prayin', waitin' on you
To run back through that door
To the way is was before
You left
It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough together
But it was long enough
Yeah, it was long enough to last forever
I've been cheated 
Defeated 
To believe that you're gone
Ooh it was wrong 
It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough
No
It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough together
But it was long enough
Yeah, it was long enough to last forever
It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough
