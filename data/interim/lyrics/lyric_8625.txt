Where are all my friends
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Used to have lots of fancy clothes
And drive a big white Cadillac
Not knowing all the time I had these things
My friends were stabbing straight in my back
No, no, no
Even had a house then out there in Beverly Hills
I was moving so fast, y'all
I didn't even have time to worry about paying my bills
Something started changing
My life started rearranging
Now I'm all alone
All the friends I wanted
I-I don't have anymore
So somebody tell, tell me
Where are all my friends
I can't find nobody
Where are all my friends
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Used to take my friends out everywhere I went
But I used to tell them, y'all
Y'all ain't got to spend a red cent
'Cause I used to have lots of money
I had them in big old stacks
I used to lend them my clothes
But they never, never ever, never, never brought them back
Now I don't have nothing
I'm so all alone
Don't even have a home
I ain't got no place to lay my head
Wish someone would help me
'Cause I-I-I-I-I...I need a loan
Yeah, baby
Where are all my friends
I'm looking, y'all.  I'm looking all over
Where are all my friends
I'm looking for the friends I used to call my very own
Where are all my friends
I need somebody right now.  Hey
Where are all my friends
I can't find a father or a mother
Where are all my friends
I remember the time I used to be walking up and down the streets
And I remember you and you and you and you and you
I remember when used to say that, yeah, trying to get me to spare a dime
And I used to come out the bottom of my heart
'Cause I thought you were a friend of mine.  Huh
But it seems, yeah, it seems like that you didn't even give a damn about me, no
But now I'm down and out and I need a friend
I surely need a friend
