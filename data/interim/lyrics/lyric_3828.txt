 Yeah
 Everybody
 Now wait a minute
You know my baby, she won't let me in
I got a few pennies, I'm gonna buy myself a bottle of gin
And then I'm gonna call my buddy on the telephone and say
 Now listen
You know I work so hard all day long
Everything I try to do seem to always turn out wrong
That's why I wanna stop by on my way home and say
 Now let me tell you one more thing
Ain't no harm to have a little a taste
But don't lose your cool and start messing up the man's place
Ain't no harm take a little nip
But don't you fall down and bust your lip, no no
 Now now
I think everyone should come on and go with me
I'm gonna tell you one more time, that's what I'm gonna do
 Now now
 I think you ought to say it one more time
