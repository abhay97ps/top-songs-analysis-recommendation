Buy for me the rain, my darling, buy for me the rain;
Buy for me the crystal pools that fall upon the plain
And I'll buy for you a rainbow and a million pots of gold
Buy it for me now, babe, before I am too old
Buy for me the sun, my darling, buy for me the sun;
Buy for me the light that falls when day has just begun
And I'll buy for you a shadow to protect you from the day
Buy it for me now, babe, before I go away
Buy for me the robin, darling, buy for me the wing;
Buy for me a sparrow, almost any flying thing
And I'll buy for you a tree, my love, where a robin's nest may grow
Buy it for me now, babe, the years all hurry so
I cannot buy you happiness, I cannot by you years;
I cannot buy you happiness, in place of all the tears
But I can buy for you a gravestone, to lay behind your head
Gravestones cheer the living, dear, they're no use to the dead
