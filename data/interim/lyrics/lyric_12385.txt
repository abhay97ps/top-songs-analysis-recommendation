Talking to a friend I turned around
And saw a total stranger
Hiding out for safety’s sake I found
I put myself in danger
There must be someway I can try to find
An answer to the questions in my mind
Or will I have to always spend my time
Dancing in the shadows
Dancing in the shadows
I saw somebody earning more and more
But he was getting poorer
It seems to me the more things that you know
The less you can be sure of
There must be someway I can try to find
An answer to the questions in my mind
Or will I have to always spend my time
Dancing in the shadows
Dancing in the shadows
Ooh I’m looking for a straight line
Can’t sleep at night
There are words I never make rhyme
It’s like black, it’s like white
Dancing in the shadows
