Like a song about a sailor
Like a morning painted gray
I played my songs in scenes of black and white
Cause I couldn't see the colors
And I couldn't find my way
Til you flooded all my senses
With your life
And you touched my life with love and made it right
We've got one life to live
Making two lives one by weaving them together
We've got one life to give
Waking up beside you, feeling like I do
Living my one life with you
Like a book without a story
All my days were blank and bare
My life was such a waste of precious time
Now we're filling all the pages
With a happiness we share
And our love is making every moment shine
Now my life's complete because it's yours and mine
We've got one life to live
Making two lives one by weaving them together
We've got one life to give
Waking up beside you‚ feeling like I do
Living my one life with you
One life to live
Making two lives one by weaving them together
We've got one life to give
Waking up beside you‚ feeling like I do
Living my one life with you
