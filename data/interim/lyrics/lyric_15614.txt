I'm nobodys' wife & I'm nobodys' baby
I like it that way well then again maybe
I'm nobodys' valentine & I'm nobodys' pearl
Seem to always find some girl singin'
There are monsters, there are angels
There's a peaceful and a rage inside us all
There's sugar & there is salt
There's ice and there is fire in every single heart
There are monsters. There are angels
I'm nobodys promise and I'm nobodys chore
And I ain't got nobody that I feel I gotta
Live for - nobody to live for
I'm nobodys work & I'm nobodys' company
And every time I turn around I always seem to
Find just me singin'
There are monsters, there are angels
I'm nobodys' wife, I'm nobodys' baby
There are monsters, there are angels
There are monsters, there are angels
I'm nobodys' mother, I'm nobodys' child
