Never goodbye, baby
It'll be never goodbye, baby
That's how long I love you
That's how long you'll
Be in my heart
When you're gone
When you're gone
Never goodbye, baby
It'll be never goodbye, baby
Everything I do
Every little dream
I dream of you
Never, never, never
Never, never, never
Goodbye, baby
It'll be never goodbye, baby
