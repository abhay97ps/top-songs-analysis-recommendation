Baby 
Let's go
My uncles taught a nigga how to hustle
My mama taught me how to use a rubber
I was six years old tryna sell a nigga candy
All I knew was how to get the money 
I done broke a lot of records in a year now
GRAMMY-nominated nigga, bitch, it's lit now
I was tryna tell 'em I was special as a jit
I still'll open fire on a nigga, make him get down 
Yeah, bitch, you ain't seen a nigga do it like Baby 
Big chain and I'm solo in this bitch
Glock four-five, AP and four bracelets 
I just spent three million on the crib 
And I don't even be there, I just did it for my baby 
You prolly never met a nigga like me
Really 'bout whatever, from the bottom like the basement 
You might have a point but I ain't finna argue with you
Won't go back and forth, I be done shot him
I'm in the studio, I got my daughter with me in a Fendi dress, she rockin' diamonds 
Light show, nigga 
Heat me up, I got my ice on, nigga
I be signin' million-dollar deals with my fingertips on eSign on my fuckin' iPhone, nigga
I'm the nigga, let me talk about it 
My uncles taught a nigga how to hustle
My mama taught me how to use a rubber
I was six years old tryna sell a nigga candy
All I knew was how to get the money 
I done broke a lot of records in a year now

GRAMMY-nominated nigga, bitch, it's lit now
I was tryna tell 'em I was special as a jit
I still'll open fire on a nigga, make him get down 
Court dates for the New Year 
Twenty on the lawyer, twenty-seven thousand for a jet I never boarded
Everybody in the county treat a nigga like the truth 
Lock the jail down every time a nigga move 
In a dirty-ass cell, doin' push-ups, eatin' soup
The media believin' 'em, they wanna see me go back
Rich nigga can't rob a broke nigga and you know that
Locked a nigga up in South Florida like he Kodak
A quarter-million dollars in my motherfuckin' tote bag
They think I like to fight until a nigga get a toe tag 
Hang his jersey up, his shit a throwback 
Police ain't know me, they don't wanna see me bubble
Pretty-ass smile like my motherfuckin' mother
All the nigga know is hustle, multi-million dollar nigga
Got to stay up out of trouble, I'm the realest nigga in it
Let me talk about it 
My uncles taught a nigga how to hustle
My mama taught me how to use a rubber
I was six years old tryna sell a nigga candy
All I knew was how to get the money 
I done broke a lot of records in a year now
