If I only could be with you again
Under the apple trees in bloom
How the birds would fly in melodies
While we made love all afternoon
And if I only could be holding you close
When the moon was reaching full
How the shooting stars would shower the sky
While we slept covered in the dew
Memories of innocence still linger in my mind
We should cross each other's path
It's only a matter of time
If I only could have one more chance
I'd be on my bended knee
Just to look into your mystical eyes
While the wind caressed the trees
But if I only could be with you again
Under the apple trees in bloom
Just to look into your mystical eyes
While we made love, while we made love
While we made love all afternoon
While we made love 
While we made love 
While we made love all afternoon
