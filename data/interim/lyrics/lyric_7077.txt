Only you know and I know
All the lovin' we've got to show
So don't refuse to believe it
By reading too many meanings
Chorus
'Cause you know that I mean what I say
So don't go, and take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on gettin' your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday
I don't mean to mislead you
It's just my craziness comin' through
But when it comes down to just two
I ain't no crazier than you
Chorus
'Cause you know that I mean what I say
So don't go, and take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on gettin' your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday
We're both here to be pleasin'
Oh, no, no, not deceivin'
But it's hard to believe in
When you've been so mistreated
Chorus
'Cause you know that I mean what I say
So don't go, and never take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on gettin' your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday
Only you know and I know
Only you know and I know
Only you know and I know
