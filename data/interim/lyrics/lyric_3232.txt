A month of nights, a year of days
Octobers drifting into Mays
I set my sail when the tide comes in
And I cast my fate to the wind
I shift my course along the breeze
Won't sail up wind on memories
The empty sky is my best friend
And I just cast my fate to the wind
There never was, there couldn't be
A place in time for men to be
Who'd drink the dark and laugh at day
And let their wildest dreams blow away
Blow away
Blow away
So now I'm old, I'm wise, I'm smart
I'm just a man with half a heart
I wonder how it might have been
Had I not cast my fate to the wind
