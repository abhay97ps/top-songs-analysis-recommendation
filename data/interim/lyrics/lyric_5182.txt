I used to say I was sincere
Baby
But when you needed me most
I wasn't there
But if somehow you can forgive me
Look over your shoulder
There I’ll be
Waiting so patiently
Just look over your shoulder
Waiting
Waiting
I know you found someone new
And I haven't the right to keep asking you
But if somehow you can forgive me
Look over your shoulder
There I'll be
Just look over your shoulder
Waiting
Waiting
I know it’s not easy to find someonе who cares
Especially a love that's nеver been shared
If somehow you can forgive me
If somehow you can forgive me
If somehow you can forgive me
If somehow you can forgive me
Look over your shoulder
There I'll be
Waiting
Waiting
Just take one peep over your shoulder
And you're gonna find me
Just look over your shoulder
There I'll be
Waiting patiently
