Ah
Damn, I tried to stop, oh
Baby , baby , baby , babe
You literally are my everything 
Hah 
Baby, I been on the run 
But I would never run from your love 
If you feel on my dick, there's a gun 
Not right there, just a little above
I value my relationship, it's forever
But I've been cheatin' on the drugs 
Broke up with codeine, need a new plug 
Hit up Hot Rod, pints, I need two of 'em 
Huh,  lean, huh 
Put Biscotti in my lungs, I'm smokin' green
Chopper on me, I don't talk, I just up the beam 
Huh, let my gun bust a nut, then leave 
I ain't leave a clue on the scene 
Close range, so I got blood on my jeans 
Saints Row cup, ain't no red in my lean 
Bankrolled up, I been swimmin' in green 
Still the blue face king 
Benjamin Franklin come dirty and clean 
I know my haters hate to see me succeed
If they get the chance, they'll end up murderin' me 
That shit got me laughin', haha
Kel-Tec get to rappin', grrah, grrah 
Fuck nigga, I'm your father
Don't matter if you older
They say age is just a number
If that's the case, I'm way older
Than who? These niggas 
And these bitches that think that they get it 
For a backstage pass, she'll suck the dick 
Bitch, I got a bitch, better get you a ticket 
Walk through the night with my gun like a creep
On my shirt Maison Martin, my shoes double-C
I don't know what it's gonna take you to believe
I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't gon' leave you 
I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't gon' leave you
You stuck with me, apologies for my fuckery
Baby, I been on the run
But I would never run from your love
If you feel on my dick, there's a gun
Not right there, just a little above
I value my relationship, it's forever
But I've been cheatin' on the drugs 
Broke up with codeine, need a new plug 
Hit up Hot Rod, pints, I need two of 'em 
Huh,  lean, huh
Put Biscotti in my lungs, I'm smokin' green, huh
Chopper on me, I don't talk, I just up the beam
Huh, let my gun bust a nut, then leave 
I ain't leave a clue on the scene
Close range, so I got blood on my jeans
