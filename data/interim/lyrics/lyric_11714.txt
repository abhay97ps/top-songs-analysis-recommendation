When she's walking down the street
She might not even catch your eye
She don't talk much, maybe she's simple
Maybe she's just shy
When the lights go down
And the band begins to play
Her soul drinks up the sound
And her body starts to sway, yeah, yeah
When she dances
She's like the wind in the long tall grass
When she dances
She's got so much soul
She can make you forget
Everything you think you know
And she can make you fall in love
When she dances
Ooh, when she dances
Ooh, when she dances
She's the one who lives up the road
Her daddy's working on the line
And she's here most every night
To hear the music and pass the time
All night long she never stops
The time goes by like she's in a dream
And all the guys just sit and watch
'Cos she's the finest thing they've ever seen
But right now she's as young
And she's as free as anything in this world
Could ever be, yeah, yeah
When she dances
She's like the wind in the long tall grass
When she dances
She's got so much soul
She can make you forget
Everything you think you know
And she can make you fall in love
When she dances
When she dances
She's like the wind in the long tall grass
When she dances
She's got so much soul
She can make you forget
Everything you think you know
And she can make you fall in love
When she dances...
