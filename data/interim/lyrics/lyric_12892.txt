She's got her eye on an older guy
Tired of being treated like a kid
Her friends keep saying she better act her age
But he'd never notice her if she did
She paints her eyes and colors her cheeks
Slides her nylons up her legs
She's going to wrap his love around her little finger
And squeeze 'til the poor boy begs
She wants to do what the big girls do
Ready to try anything new
She's going to show them all a thing or two
She wants to do what the big girls do
She takes his hand when he asked her to dance
As they move out onto the floor
The other girls talk behind her back
But they're really wishing they were her
She's been waiting for such a long, long time
Not going to turn back now
She's gonna do a little growing up tonight
And he's going to show her how
She wants to do what the big girls do
Ready to try anything new
She's going to show them all a thing or two
She wants to do what the big girls do
On a deserted road, she'll give her heart away
The girl is gone, a woman takes her place
She wants to do what the big girls do
Ready to try anything new
She's going to show them all a thing or two
She wants to do what the big girls
She wants to do what the big girls do
Ready to try anything new
She's going to show them all a thing or two
She wants to do what the big girls
She wants to do what the big girls do
Ready to try anything new
She wants to do what the big girls do
Ready to try anything new
She's going to show them all a thing or two
She wants to do what the big girls do
Ready to try anything new
She wants to do what the big girls do
