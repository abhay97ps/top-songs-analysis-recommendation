One day of your life
Is all I'm asking you
Just give me
One day of your life
And let me share your world
If you give me one little moment
I will make this moment last
I'll live the future
With the past
One day of your life
Can't mean that much to you
It's only one day of your life
But it would see me through
If I can't have you forever
If I can't have things my way
I'll be content with just one day
If I must build
A world of fantasy
Please let me build it
With a memory
One day of your life
Is all I'm asking you
Just give me
One day of your life
And let me share your world
If I can't have you forever
If I can't have things my way
I'll be content with just one day
One day of your life
Oh, oh, oh, oh
One day of your life
It's only one day of your life
