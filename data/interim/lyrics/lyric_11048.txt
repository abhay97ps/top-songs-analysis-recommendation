Breaking through I's of the mind
To clarify
Could be not realign with love
The twinkle in your eye is a sign
Connection
Rockets of desire stand clear to launch
So let it all go
The end no
It never does close
Always goes
Sipping on tears
Eating smiles
Whispering hugs
A feeling
Ubiquitous love
Breaking through the I's of the mind
With love
Could we not realign
With love
The twinkle in your eye is a sign
Of love
So let it all go
The end no
It never does close
Always goes
Sipping on tears
Eating smiles
Whispering hugs
A feeling
Ubiquitous love
