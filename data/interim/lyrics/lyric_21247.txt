La da da da...
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye... 
Hold up...
Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No I.D. on the track let the story begin...
Begin...
Begin
This is anti-Auto-Tune, death of the ringtone
This ain’t for iTunes, this ain't for sing-alongs
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song
Wrong, this ain't politically correct 
This might offend my political connects 
My raps don’t have melodies
This should make niggas wannna go and commit felonies 
Get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn 
I know we facing a recession
But the music y'all making gon' make it the Great Depression 
All your lack of aggression
Put your skirt back down, grow a set, men 
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of Auto-Tune, moment of silence
La da da da...
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye...
Only nigga to re-write history without a pen
No I.D. on the track let the story begin...
Begin...
Begin
Hold up...
This ain't a number one record 
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon 
I made this just for Flex and... Mister Cee
I want niggas to feel threatened 
Stop your bloodclot crying
The kid, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
You niggas' jeans too tight
Your colors too bright, your voice too light  
I might wear black for a year straight 
I might bring back Versace shades 
This ain’t for Z100
Ye told me to kill y'all to keep it 100 
This is for Hot 9-7
This shit for Clue, for Khaled, for we the bestin... 
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of Auto-Tune, moment of silence
La da da da...
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye...
Only nigga to re-write history without a pen
No I.D. on the track let the story begin...
Begin...
Begin
Hold up...
Hold up, this shit need a verse from Jeezy... Ay!
I might send this to the mixtape Weezy
Get somebody from BMF to talk on this
Get this to a Blood, let a Crip walk on it 
Get 3 Thou' to style on this
I just don’t need nobody to smile on this 
You niggas singin' too much
Get back to rap, you T-Pain'n too much 
I’m a multi-millionaire
So how is it I’m still the hardest nigga here 
I don’t be in the project hallway
Talkin' 'bout how I be in the projects all day 
That sound stupid to me
If you a gangsta, this is how you prove it to me 
Nigga, just get violent
This is death of Auto-Tune, moment of silence
La da da da...
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye...
