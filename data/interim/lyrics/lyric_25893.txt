Yes, I'm gonna stay with him tonight
I’ll see you in the mornin'
No, of course he won't drink and drive
Can you say bye to mom for me?
Oh, you’ll like him, he's really kind
And he's funny like you sometimes
And I found someone I really like
Maybe for the first time
No, I don't need a jacket
It's not that cold tonight
And you worry, I get it
But he's waitin' outside
I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I know you’ll stay up late just waitin’ for me
You held me so tight, now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me
Now you're driving to the airport
Not just me you pick up anymore
I’ve got eight days off comin' up
And I can only come home for four
Yeah, I just met his family
They're just like you and mom 
He makes me really happy
I think he might be the one, oh
I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I promise he loves me, he’d never hurt me
You held me so tight, now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me
Now you're on the driveway, faking a smile
You wish you could tell him he doesn't deserve me
So I had to stop the car and turn around
To tell you you were the first man that really loved me
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah
And before they open up the doors
I say, "I've never seen you cry before"
You say, "You've never looked so beautiful
You know you'll always be my little girl"
You're looking at me while walking down the aisle
With tears in your eyes, maybe he deserves me
You don't even know how much it means to me now
That you were the first man that really loved me
Oh, really loved me
Oh, you really love me
