Got a letter just this morning
It was postmarked Omaha
It was typed and neatly written
Offering me this better job
Better job with higher wages
Expenses paid and a car
But I'm on TV here locally
I can't quit, I'm a star
I come on the TV
Grinnin', wearing pistols and a hat
It's a kiddie show and I'm a hero
Of the younger set
I'm the number one attraction
In every supermarket parking lot
I'm the king of Kansas City
No thanks Omaha, thanks a lot
Kansas City Star
That's what I are
Yoodledy you aught to see my car
I drive a big old Cadillac with white wheels
I got rhinestones on my spokes
I've got credit down at the grocery store
And my barber tells me jokes
I'm the number one attraction
In every supermarket parking lot
I'm the king of Kansas City
No thanks Omaha, thanks a lot
Da da da da de da
Baa ba de baa ba ba bu
Baa ba bee
Baa Ba buu buu diddly
Ba da da da da da
Kansas City Star
That's what I are
Yoodledy you aught to see my car
I drive a big old Cadillac with wired wheels
I got rhinestones on my spokes
I've got credit down at my grocery store
And my barber tells me jokes
I'm the number one attraction
In every supermarket parking lot
I'm the king of Kansas City
No thanks Omaha, thanks a lot
Stay tuned we're going to have a Popeye cartoon in a minute
