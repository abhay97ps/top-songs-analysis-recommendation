She called me baby, baby all night long
Used to hold and kiss me 'til the dawn
Then one day I woke and she was gone
Now there's no more baby, baby all night long
She called me baby, baby all night long
Kissed my tears away when things went wrong
Oh what I'd give if she'd just come back home
And call me baby, baby all night long
She called me baby, baby all night long
Held me up so high and made me strong
Now each night in dreams just like a song
I still hear baby, baby
Baby, baby
Baby, baby all night long
