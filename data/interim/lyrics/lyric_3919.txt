Remember when you ran away
And I got on my knees
And begged you not to leave
Because I'd go berserk
Well, you left me anyhow
And then the days got worse and worse
And now you see I've gone
Completely out of my mind
And, they're coming to take me away ha-ha
They're coming to take me away ho ho hee hee ha ha
To the funny farm
Where life is beautiful all the time
And I'll be happy to see those nice young men
In their clean white coats
And they're coming to take me away ha ha
You thought it was a joke
And so you laughed
You laughed when I had said
That losing you would make me flip my lid
Right? You know you laughed
I heard you laugh, you laughed
You laughed and laughed and then you left
But now you know I'm utterly mad
And, they're coming to take me away ha ha
They're coming to take me away ho ho hee hee ha ha
To the happy home with trees and flowers and chirping birds
And basket weavers who sit and smile and twiddle their thumbs and toes
And they're coming to take me away ha ha
I cooked your food
I cleaned your house
And this is how you pay me back
For all my kind unselfish, loving deeds?
Huh? Well you just wait
They'll find you yet
And when they do, they'll put you in
The A.S.P.C.A.,
You mangy mutt!
And, they're coming to take me away ha ha
They're coming to take me away ho ho hee hee ha ha
To the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time
And I'll be happy to see those nice young men
In their clean white coats
And they're coming to take me away ha ha!
To the happy home with trees and flowers and chirping birds
And basket weavers who sit and smile and twiddle their thumbs and toes
And they're coming to take me away ha ha!
To the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time
And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats...
