Life is taking turns, falling flat on your chin
Trying to fly with the birds
Love sure is blind
'Cause it don’t see
It ain’t spent one night feelin’ sorry for me
There ain't too many times I felt like a king
Sitting here with you dear makes me wanna sing
Today the sun is shinin' on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ain't sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun, shinin' on me
Lady love, forgets me every time
I'm spending my days packin' nickels and dimes
But the man in the moon, yeah he's alright
He must've flipped on the switch when he left last night
'Cause I'm feelin' alright, feelin' alright
Today the sun is shinin' on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ain't sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun, shinin' on me
There ain't too many times I felt like a king
Sitting here with you dear makes me wanna sing
Today the sun is shinin' on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ain't sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun is shinin' on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ain't sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun is shinin' on
Shining on
Shining on
Shining on me
