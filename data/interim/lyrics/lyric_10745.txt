That's dangerous driving baby, The policeman said
I can smell the passion of another man on your breath
I could give you life, get you back for what I saw
That's vengeance he said, that's the law
You throw your misdemeanors right up in my face
The kind of man I am, I got to put you right in your lace
I should lock you up, getyou back for what I saw
That's vengeance he said, that's the law
That's vengeance, Oh that's vengeance
Yeah that's vengeance he said, that's the law
You've taken your half out of the middle
Time and time again
But now I'm damned if I'll give you and itch
Till I get even
She said: Just because you're stronger and you hold it over me
I'll put the pedal to the floor, and prove to you that I'm free
Though you've stopped me once again, It's not the end of the war
It's vengeance she said, that's the law
That's vengeance, that's vengeance she said
That's the law
