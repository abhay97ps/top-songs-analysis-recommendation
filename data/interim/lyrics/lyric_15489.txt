Unforgettable, that's what you are
Unforgettable, though near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more
Unforgettable in every way
And forevermore 
That's how you'll stay 
That's why darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too
No, never before has someone been more
Ooh unforgettable 
In every way 
And forevermore 
That's how you'll stay 
That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too
