Hello again, it's me
Your shoulder's where I sit
The half nobody sees
Of a silent partnership
I am here
Your helping hand
I'm never far away
A clear view from where I stand
I'll be there
If you need me
I am your helping hand
My words
You've heard them all before
It's only for the sake of love
It's gonna be a new day for you
A new day for you
The stars have played their part
The past is gone and done
Have more faith in love
The best is yet to come
So what is this I hear
You deserve a break
Take time to think it out
Don't make a new mistake
I am here
Your helping hand
It's gonna be a new day for you
A new day for you
A new day for you
A new day for you
The stars have played their part
The past is gone and done
Have more faith in love
The best is yet to come
My words
You've heard them all before
It's only for the sake of love
The stars have played their part
The past is gone and done
Have more faith in love
The best is
It's gonna be a new day for you
A new day for you
A new day for you
A new day for you
It's gonna be a new day for you
A new day for you
A new day for you
A new day for you
Hello again, it's me
