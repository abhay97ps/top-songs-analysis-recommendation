Oo oo oo ooo going on
When in the morning
I must arise
I look in the mirror
It couldn't be clearer
Something is gone from my eyes
Going on
Going on
Going on
I know what is missing
Because since you've been gone
My mind keeps on reeling 
My heart keeps on feeling 
Why is my love going on 
I love you
I miss you
Things won't be the same till I kiss you
I'm empty
Without you
My heart's full with my arms about you
Ooo ooo ooo ah ah ah
We said it was over
We're living apart
We couldn't quite make it 
But still I can't shake it 
Our love still lives on in my heart 
I love you
Forever
Love won't be the same again ever 
Without you 
I'm longing 
You gave me a sense of belonging
Oo oo oo oo oo going on
Why is my love going on 
I love you
I miss you
I'm sorry
Forgive me 
Believe me 
My lover 
There never could be any other
Ooo oooo oooo
Going on
Come be my
Redeemer
Awaken me beautiful dreamer 
I love you 
I miss you 
Things won't be the same till I'm with you
Ahhhhhhhhhhh
