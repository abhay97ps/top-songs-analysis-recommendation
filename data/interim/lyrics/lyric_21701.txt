Round and round
Round and round
Round and round
You see me standing there and act like you don't know me
But last night, you were calling me, saying you want me
Oh, why you always make me feel like I'm the one that's crazy?
You got my heart racing
My, my heart racing
Boy, I need you here with me
We can't go on this way
I'm falling hard for you
All I can say
We're going 'round and 'round
We're never gonna stop going
'Round and 'round
We'll never get where we're going
'Round and 'round
Well, you're gonna miss me, 'cause I'm getting dizzy
Going 'round and 'round and 'round
You try to pull me close and whisper in my ear
You always told me lies, I've cried out all my tears
I push my feelings to the side, but then you bring them back
Br-bring 'em back, now you got me singing
Boy, I need you here with me
We can't go on this way
I'm falling hard for you
All I can say
We're going 'round and 'round
We're never gonna stop going
'Round and 'round
We'll never get where we're going
'Round and 'round
Well, you're gonna miss me, 'cause I'm getting dizzy
Going 'round and 'round and 'round
Love me, or love me not
I'm staring at the clock
I pick them flower petals off
And then I watch them drop
Love me, or love me not
I'm staring at the clock
I pick them flower petals off
And then I watch them drop
Boy, I need you here with me
I can't go on this way
I'm falling hard for you
All I can say
â€˜Round and 'round
We're never gonna stop going
'Round and 'round
We'll never get where we're going
'Round and 'round
Well, you're gonna miss me, 'cause I'm getting dizzy
Going 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
We're going 'round and 'round
We're never gonna stop going
'Round and 'round
We'll never get where we're going
'Round and 'round
Well, you're gonna miss me, 'cause I'm getting dizzy
Going 'round and 'round and 'round
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa
