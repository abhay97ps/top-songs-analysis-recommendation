Don't you know?
So many things, they come and go
Like your words that once rang true
Just like the love I thought I found in you
And I remember the thunder
Talking about that fire in your eyes
But you walked away when I needed you most
And maybe, baby
Maybe, baby
I found someone
To take away the heartache
To take away the loneliness
I've been feeling since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
Dry your eyes
I never could bear to see you cry
Someday your love will shine through
And show you the feelings you never really knew
But don't you lose that thunder
Talking about that fire in your eyes
You're looking at me, but you still don't believe
And maybe, baby
Maybe, baby
I found someone
To take away the heartache
To take away the loneliness
I've been living with since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
Too long on the borderline
Wonderin' if your love was really mine
But you left me with open eyes
And now I realize
I found someone
To take away the heartache
To take away the loneliness
I've been feeling since you've been gone
Baby, I found someone
To take away the heartache
To take away the loneliness
I've been living with since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
