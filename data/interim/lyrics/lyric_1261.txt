Alright ch'all, I gotta expose this punk square
Sorry he was late gettin' to the circle he was finishin' his show upstairs
See, he spend his life time on the sidelines, watchin' Illmaculate battlin'
He would close his eyes tight and imagine that that was him
How times flies but my guy, this is actually happenin'!
Soak it up before the moment's up
Now, let me tell you what the fact is, understand this
I feel responsible for up to half of this bummy cat's wins
Think I'm lyin' then you frontin', you can suck a fat dick
But once Reverse Live got jerked, I ain't have them fuckin' judges back since
See, everything you spittin' lately, shows me that you're gettin' lazy
Switch it up, try somethin' different maybe
In terms he understands, there's more than one way to skin a baby
He's at the wrong end of the spectrum
You established, right? That's a common misconception
It's flashin' lights, just all a misdirection
By the looks of him, you can call him a reflection
Cause whenever I do somethin' he mirrors all of the expressions
Tryin' to battle on the scene where they callin' me a "veteran"
Same scene you ain't made a mark or an impression
I'm battlin' my alter ego with an altered gene code from an alternate dimension
Only we goin' in opposite directions
Face it, you racist, all that hate shit is disgustin'
Be honest, you preach violence, cause you reside at a safe distance from it
You ain't beefin' in the street, twistin' fingers into signs
You switch sides and rep whatever region is convenient at the time
There's no ignorin' that rumor
He's livin' in  sportin' Vancouver
He books a trip to New York and back and couldn't make it back to the store to grab a Portland hat sooner
And fuck your morbid ass humor
You prolly wish I'd get sunburned; survive
Only to watch my son burn; alive
All that hateful shit you say is just words that rhyme
I read the obituaries today and...not one person died
So instead of wishin' death on this dude
I let him live it
Your real life is a death sentence to you
And I'd rather get every affliction you've ever wished on everyone than live for a second as you
Fuck Police Brutality this guy respects the cops
You still sit in the backseat with child protected locks
You're so small you get drunk by your second shot
And The Saurus about to go into a diabetic shock
There was footage of me beatin' you I never thought it'd get deleted
Before he was president this politician cheated
I work full time in an office gettin' weeded
I remember you had $500 to your name then you lost it to Conceited
It's time that you and I collide
Give you a drink 151 and cyanide
He transformed his car like Ironhide
Cause this motherfucker has a baby seat...on the driver side
You should try and understand the supply and the demand
You stick your dick between your legs and deny that you're a man
Like Buffalo Bill in The Silence Of The Lambs
I basically raised you, be a man, live life
Had our ups and downs even had big fights
I beat his ass, keep the cash, leave a cracked windpipe
He's a Gremlin I ain't suppose to be feedin' past midnight
Your music is torture, your mom should've left you at the boarder
You got a human disorder
That makes you look like the smallest man on the planet except two inches shorter
Northwest ain't dead but there shouldn't be a deficit
No other names on the first flier, go online and read the evidence
You need to be impeached as president
And beat like a redheaded stepchild with a speech impediment
You don't wanna fight cause I'm landin' heavy hands
Fast and deadly, hope you have a steady cam'
His partner The Saurus is Greek, he's a fan of every man
Won the championships and got matchin' wedding bands
You won Scribble Jam then your confidence burned down
Tried to repeat then last to H-Bomb in the first round
I remember when Sound Gods was a crew
Left cause you're an asshole and overconfident too
Puffin' up your chest and askin' what they wanted to do
Bitch I punch babies that are stronger than you!
Your presidency should be put on the shelf
Cause this is the first match you got me in 11 months and you ended up bookin' yourself
It's Northwest all day, the heavyweight of the crew
Cause battles and friendships, I'm separating the two
He's insecure, he would never say that it's true
My album is called You'll Never Be Famous and it's dedicated to you
90 prolly thinks he's the streetest black rapper
He said he'd beat babies up that was smaller than me
Well just like this, that baby beat his ass after
See, now you throwin' shots, what could I ever say about that?
Let's just say I haven't been afraid of catchin' strays since you started livin' like a domesticated house cat
Go ahead, share with us your schedule
You ain't allowed to blow smoke that's in the air in your bedroom
Cause you share it with your girl, plus his parent's in the next room
Act like that's not yo' life, no wonder you're very homely
I bet y'all for a double date, Tuesday's taco night, and Thursday is karaoke
Dawg, if I was to air you out, I'd leave you embarrassed homie
All them times you broke down, "I feel like you barely know me!"
I talked about teamin' with Only
9D got bitter but he wouldn't budge
He sat there, didn't say shit, cause he couldn't of
Just stuck out his lower lip, lookin' like the only sibling at dinner that didn't get a pudding cup
See, ya homies told you this would be a giant obstacle
BG said that I would body you if it got psychological
But why? That is not something I would want to do
Cause I had fathered you so in a way, I'm responsible
At the time your mother was gettin' pregnant, we were separated
I neglected the paternity test, still kept it, raised it
Even made sure you were clothed, fed and educated
Now, I only have myself to blame for all the love that I never gave him
I hesitated, every time I went to give him attention, instead I saved it
Every day I would look at you and see someone else's face, I wish I was less abrasive
I guess it was my selfish way of expressing shame, even though I would never say were second favorite
Now, I know, I never gave you the help you need
Even though I knew you weren't a healthy teen
See I blame myself for things like low self esteem
And pushin' off your insecurities with yourself on me
But now I can't help but think, "My seeds finally becomin' famous."
He's humble natured, underrated
So I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
Then I turn away from OnlyOne, back to the other son I turned away from
The love has become a hatred
Like, why are you jealous of your brother? It's because he's younger, ain't it?
Bitch it looks like you stepped in grenades that severed your legs
Honestly I think you'd look better with AIDS
I don't care how legends are made, the competitive stage
Cause you're the one that always battles for money and never gets paid
While you're doin' 16 bar sets ups I'm twistin' another joint
Enough with the bullshit just get to the fuckin' point
You should hear the people 'Mac name drops
Like he been around the world lettin' champagne pop
On tour like you livin' in the fast lane, stop!
Cause bitch we ended up in the exact same spot
I'm blowin' up feel the blast of the bomb shell
You're livin' your life poor and gotta act like it's not Hell
You're just mad that your stock fell faster than a crash landin' at Roswell
His mom should've got an abortion but Greg is here
Had facial hair like mine, had to force him to shave his beard
I took this battle in Portland to make it clear
That objects on screen are shorter than they appear
And I don't give a fuck if you're Native American
If I could go back in time I would've traded you heroin
And fuck the Tribe Of Selects
I hope all you Indian motherfuckers die with regrets
After livin' your whole life with Tourettes
You're so broke you would think you didn't like money
It's a long time comin' and it's gettin' quite ugly
I hate Indians but this kid is my buddy
Your people are the only ones that can make genocide funny
Fuck a rap, I'd give respect if you rapped better
But at least you can rain dance, I'm impressed with the bad weather
We killed all you motherfuckers and instead of a grand gesture
On Thanksgiving we celebrate the death of your ancestors
See when I make a reservation it's a table for two
When my ancestors made reservations they gave 'em to you
When I'm drivin' I just got through at the bar
When you're drivin' we can't even see you in the car
The white man gutted your family like a Cuban cigar
Plus your grandpa's the Indian on the Tootsie Pop wrapper shootin' the star
Save it you're all talk, I'm a sports commentator the way that I call shots
Fuck the Selects Tribe, if y'all don't go back to the reservation that y'all got
Next Christmas you're gettin' a blanket with smallpox
And when it comes to death I'm no stranger
If your girl gets pregnant I'm the Lone Ranger
That'll give her an abortion with a boat anchor instead of a coat hanger
Hold on, he said, "abortion with a boat anchor or a coat hanger"
All them is empty threats, notice I'm in no danger
Cause you are no gangster
Now I got a story to tell
Listen close
It's 2004 he's on his way to Brainstorm
There's a battle in Seattle and he wished it paid more
But he knows he's gonna win, only problem is Illmaculate, I'm known to kill rappers quick
Cause I'm skilled at this shit
See I made it there safe, made it to the top 10
If it wasn't for me you prolly wouldn't even have got in
But you won two battles, then you lost to Iron Solomon
Back then you was pissed but now he tries givin' props to him
See all that shit is true
I told it to him on the phone, tryin' to lure an attack
Then I heard he at the studio and threw it on a track
Now, you don't believe it? Download his album titled, You'll Never Be Famous
Funny that message pertains more to the fella that made it
Now look, I'm the cocky spitter
I never thought I could picture this Nazi Hitler in body glitter
He thought he would get some shots in and only got bodied quicker
Prolly found by somebody fishin' once his body missin' like Bobby Fischer
I'm 'bout to smash this checkers player
And don't call this shit a "classic", I could've took this match up less prepared
At first he tried to mask it but he's mad I'm everywhere
So I'ma treat this battle like a questionnaire cause I feel like I have to check this square
Now I can tell I'm inside his head but this guy forgets this is my event
While he talkin' loud, your own people would stomp you out at my request
So fuck anything he might've said, now he caught up in the spiderweb
I see you tryin' to get personal like that's earnin' you the slightest edge
I mean, I could've guessed, that's the predictable move
His rhymin' is nothin' special cause 9D  is one dimensional
So why would I expect somethin' different from you?
You don't see the bigger picture do you?
As a rapper I hopped in the ring
As a general manager, I stop and I think
"What's best for business?" The fans are watchin' us beef
I can return cheap shots but that is not what he needs
Believe, I can make my top seed the laughing stock of the league
See what you gettin' is an image, while he's starin' and actin' one way
He's that kid, spits it before he lives it and swears it'll happen one day
That's why I don't respect nothin' that you write
Fans watchin' and thinkin', "How could you say that to someone you like?"
First week of preparin' he was hungry for this night
So he had 100 bars, funny part is he's never kept it 100 in his life
You sweet, you cake batter, you're livin' in a fantasy
You're a great rapper but you're a gimmick and it saddens me
Cause I've seen someone in your face faggot and you ain't say shit about AIDS, cancer, women in his family
None of that
I'm surprised you even showed up to your funeral
9D, alright, I got your back, you know what I would do for you
Even though you've never taken time to show me that it's mutual
And we can go there, but I won't expose you that's what you would do
Plus your body language showed that hit close to home cause we both know what I'm alluding to
Look, this cat forgets, I know he won't scrap, he'd rather keep it rap instead
But he'll wish death, talk about cancer spread
Make all them big threats like he blastin' lead or clap the FED
I'm not impressed cause actions speak louder than words and in that respect
You haven't said shit yet
Now he told me, "Alright, just don't diss my girl."
I guess y'all prolly need eachother
That thought never even crossed my mind
That just showed me how highly he thinks of her
I mean, I don't understand, who's he?
The same cat that ain't do shit to Anthony Galuchi?
The same rapper reppin' Vancouver like it's cool beans
After they gave PC two and a half for a QP
Man, if you gon' tell it, better tell it like it is
'05 I teamed with The Saurus, you got jealous like a bitch
See, at first we would practice, he was pushin' the team
Then he seen all the battles I put in with Pete
He couldn't help but feel cheated when he looked at the rings
Now the only thought he can think is, "That should've been me."
Time...beeotch
Him being here is something that I can't describe
Cause I swear to God, Hollow Da Don ate this man alive
I wish this faggot died when he crashed his ride
And when he called the song, Rap Giant he made me laugh inside
Fuck your Spanish pride, Latin vibe and your tribe
Cause of genocide, planet wide, kill 'em 'til I'm satisfied
We stole your land, cut down your family tree
Fuck being paid I would've done that for free
When your battle with Truth came out, that's what the fans could see
Cause that whole "kiss the bride, bitch inside, Crimson Tide" shit, THAT WAS ME!
Real shit
This ain't a battle believe me it's a war
You'll be broke even when your CD's in the store
You tried to one up me I'ma even the score
Punch you in the chest til you can't breathe anymore
You actin' like you weren't beefin' with the Sandpeople before
It was all good when you were leavin' on tour
Til they treated you like a bitch and made you sleep on the floor
Fuck your misshape head and the size of your hat
Switch the subject before you have time to react
If  were 1/4th of the Slaughterhouse arrived it was packed
Wanted a feature and he knew and he knew a guy with some stacks
There's OnlyOne reason you got Crooked I on a track
So why was he sayin' your name that night when he rapped?
You fuck over your homies there's no denyin' the fact
I bet OnlyOne can still feel the knife in his back
You think you're unbeatable? Stop actin' crazy
You're gonna make Conceited/Hollow/Madness angry
Lost your sail at South By Southwest, you think that that amazed me?
You've been losin' your phone as much as much as your battles lately
Crashed your new car, good thing that you don't have a baby
Dropped out of high school and forgot the traffic safety
I'm fat and lazy, pass the gravy, got a gun called "Whoopi Goldberg" that's a black .380
That'll have you walkin' around as a Ghost like you're Patrick Swayze
You'll get drop kicked to the stars, on a mission to Mars
Plus you always get the bitch seat when we have to fit in the car
I turn the radio up and you listen to Lars
Right before I pull your little immigrant visitor card
We all know I've been twisted before I get to the bar
So when I threw up in your hotel room you cleaned it up like the good little bitch that you are
And fuck kickin' you down, you'll get thrown up the stairs
You're undersized and I'm overprepared
I'll make you take your own life with the rope and the chair
Have you chokin' for air
I bet you could do it right now and...no one would care
You on Cool Nutz dick still broke in despair
He got you Joc and Fatboi, what you promotin' a freak show at the fair?
You're livin' day to day I got money to waste
Henny with 151 is a chase
We could go to the night of the Young Nate battle, nothin' is safe
You got in a fight right in front of the place
I could've done more you thought it was just a mistake
But everyone could relate when your friends get big headed, stubborn and fake
Sometimes they deserve to get punched in the face
I ain't losin' for Pete Sake, I'm shootin' your teammate
If this was a business trip I could fit you in a briefcase
I'm the future, your music's a week late
Like you fucked up and confused the release date
This a crime scene but cops will be using the Green Tape
Plus you'll end up with a girl that looks like Manik when he's doin' his mean face
I hope you're drunk and placin' your bets
That I'm the one the judges say is a threat
I'm a drunken rage in the flesh
Police Brutality? I wouldn't be surprised if you showed up and made an arrest
I'll punch and cave in your chest til you have trouble takin' a breath
You should've lost to Whashisface & Possessed
And that's an understatement at best
You're two time World Rap Champion, stop Greg
OnlyOne's album was better, he's mad that he's not played
I knew you'd talk about your accomplishments if you battled me offstage
And that shit would be tight if you actually got paid
He called me, when I answered I said, "'Mac eat a dick."
He said, "We should write on The Saurus/Mac Lethal tip."
But all that small talk don't distract me a bit
Especially when the next thing he said is, "I can't think of shit."
Actin' diesel like you're Optimus Prime
You should get shot in the spine
The way you left the Sound Gods is a crime
I don't care if you think of rebuttals at the drop of a dime
I'll run over the thought of your rhymes soon as it fuckin' crosses your mind
You went to Battle Of The Bay with eight dollars, what a celeb'
Leachin' off your homies tryin' to double your bread
BG and Only copped the room that must've fucked with your head
Cause they gave you three pillows and that was enough for a bed
People don't know your name when you go to the mall
How does it feel to live life? You're broke and you're small
You're fuckin' up the division I hope that you fall
Cause this is Northwest history and you didn't promote it all
You can ice grill and act like it won't melt
But on the inside you laughin' at yo'self
Bein' a World Rap Champion won't help
Especially when React told me you got jumped by two black dudes that whooped your ass with your own belt
And I said I wouldn't talk about your bitch and I lied
MC Goddess? You can eat a dick and then die
He was gonna name his album, The Heart, I said, "Give it a try
If you wanna look like a bitch that has a feminine side."
They say, "9D's gotta be an asshole to win."
Can't get me a match, get me someone else to handle it then
I've got a calm detour, I'm 'bout to travel again
What do a terrorist and an Indian have in common?
Neither of them are battlin' Jin 
You're a bitch and I didn't stutter
I bet you still go to the dentist and get a sucker
It's me versus The Indian In The Cubbard
So listen you midget fuck, you're the smallest person I know
How the hell do you have a little brother?
We used to freestyle and get drunk enough to spar
Now I'm rollin' up on you like an undercover car
I kick a five minute round like, "It's just 100 bars."
We used to shoot your herds just to watch you motherfucker's starve
Life is a movie, this scene's gonna get tragic
Bury him alive, still breathin' in his casket
You'll Never Be Famous, believe me the shit's classic
Check track #4, featurin' this faggot
When he's in the hospital I ain't showin' him love
Force feed him pills, he'll overdose on the drugs
Shit might pop off in New Jersey, I hope that it does
Ars' will have you jumped by Crips 'til you're throwin' up Blood
I'm down to hit a lick cause I know that crime pays
You almost drown every time you go to Wild Waves
You're gettin' smoked on Friday
And for the last five years, instead of growin' up you've been growin' sideways
See you're the worst when I'm at my best
The Reaper won't care if you're the last life left
You haven't learned how to act right yet
You're a Jackass like Steve-O drinkin' that fat guy's sweat
He always practice with me, couldn't find a doper rapper
I taught him how to free and what type of flow to master
He couldn't see the weed, get right to smokin' after
Cause secretly I hope that he be diagnosed with cancer
And who thought two of the best in the Northwest would collide?
I'm white, that's somethin' I'd never deny
But your Mexican side wants to kill you and the rest of your tribe
You're wanted dead or alive
I catch you as soon as you step in your ride
Turn Mini Me to Kennedy, shoot you in your head as you drive
And there's no cover ups on the reason that your president died
They say I'm too sick so I'ma be gross instead
Your girl's yeast infection's so bad the smell woke the dead
And if you added a fourth cup of flower you would have a loaf of bread
You wanna talk about a knife in the back? You  know it's irrelevent
Cause you told a story and embellished it
And even the moral of it was more of an insult to Only's intelligence
I don't think he's the sucker that you take him for, you snot nosed jerk
But I see the angle you were aimin' for and shit it almost worked
Talk about a knife in the back, that was some clever shit
Was it the same knife you use to slit wrists in every freestyle you ever spit?
Talkin' 'bout a knife in the back, he quiet, quit tryin' to rap
You lyin' and you actin' like you would scrap
I seen you in them situations and how many times did you act?
