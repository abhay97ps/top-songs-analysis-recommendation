I guess it's over now
I think we've seen the end
When our common dream
Faltered in the between
Though I've tried so hard to make it real
It doesn't matter now
I guess it never did
And it's alright alright alright with me
And it's alright if that's how you want it to be
I've learned through weakness
And through the web of your lies
That everyday i live
Another piece of me dies
And in the black and white
I found a need to move on
To find a road of gold
A throne to live upon
And it's alright alright alright with me
And it's alright if that's how you want it to be
If there's a reason for the pain
Then let me know
If I'm the reason for your pain
Then let me go
And it's alright alright alright with me
And it's alright if that's how you want it to be
