Somewhere deep in my body
I feel the magical blow
I'm in need of somebody
And I think you should know
You are my magical baby
Feed my magical soul
Let's find a field where a shade is
You can let your magic unfold
You are my baby
And I think you should know
That I'm feeling the glow
Somewhere deep in my body
I feel the magical blow
I'm in need of somebody
And I think you should know
I am your magical baby
Feed your magical soul
In a field with a shade yeah
You can let your magic unfold
