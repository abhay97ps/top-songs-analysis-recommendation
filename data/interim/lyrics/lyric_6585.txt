Sunset Strip
My soul trip
Sunset Strip
Some people say you're plastic
Well, I guess my soul's elastic
'Cause I bend with every curve in your sidewalk
Just groovin' along
Feeling right at home
Listening to the music of your children talk
Sunset Strip
Sunset Strip
My soul trip
Sunset Strip
Well, you see more friendly faces
Than any other places
And the warm glow of your night lights cast a spell on me
All the happy hearts are here
With their minds all free and clear
And the whole idea seems to fit so well on me
Sunset Strip
Sunset Strip
My soul trip
