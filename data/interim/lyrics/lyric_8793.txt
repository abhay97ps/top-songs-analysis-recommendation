Now if you feel that you can't go on
Because all of your hope is gone
And your life is filled with confusion
And happiness is just an illusion
And your world around is tumbling down
Darling, reach out
Reach out, reach out for me
I'll be there to love and comfort you
I'll be there with a love that will see you through
Now when you're lost and about to give up
'Cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold
And you're drifting out all on your own
And you need a hand to hold
Darling, reach out
Reach out, reach out for me
I'll be there to love and comfort you
I'll be there with a love that will see you through
I can tell the way you hang your head
You're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around
But there's no peace of mind to be found
I know what you're thinking
Without love, and now you're alone
Darling, reach out
Reach out, reach out for me
I'll be there to love and comfort you
I'll be there with a love that will see you through
