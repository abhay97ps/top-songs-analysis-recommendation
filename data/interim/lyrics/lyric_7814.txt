Write a letter, write another letter
Write a letter, write another letter
Write a letter
I'm sealing up this letter
I just finished signing your name
My friends would all be surprised if I knew I was playing this game
I'll pretend it's a special delivery
And just to give me a hint, I'll use your favorite color, smear it with your favorite scent
Huh, I know that you think I'm crazy, but I can't lose what I have left
So I've decided to write this letter and send it to myself
So to make my story short, in the mailbox I will place this letter that I wrote and it's stamped with your lovely face
When I'm alone and I need someone to talk to
I talk to your picture
Get me a pencil and paper 
And write all the things
Say all the things I've heard you say before
But with a little extra  sugar and spice
I guess it makes me feel kind of nice
I write a letter to myself.  
Oh, I write another letter to myself.  
I write a letter to myself.  
Oh, I write another letter to myself.  
What is a home when you're all alone?
It seems so full
It seems so full, but so empty
So I put on my coat, leave you a note
And go the places, places, places where we used to be
I pretend you are there, order dinner for two
Your every presence is all in the air
I write a letter to myself.  
I write another letter to myself.  
I write another letter to myself.  
Oh, I write another letter to myself.  
Mmmm, hmmm
I write another letter to myself.  
Write another letter to myself.  
I write another letter to myself.  
I write another letter to myself.  
Oh yeah
Write another letter to myself.  
Write another letter to myself.  
Write another letter to myself.  
Write another letter to myself.  
I write another letter to myself.  
Oh, I write another letter to myself.  
Mmmm, hmmm
Write another letter to myself.  
Write another letter to myself.  
I write another letter to myself.
