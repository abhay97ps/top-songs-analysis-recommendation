February 14, 1929, St. Valentines Day
In a warehouse on Chicago's south side
Members of the Al Calone gang
Disguised as policemen
Gunned down a dozen of Bugs Moron's boys
Three lived long enough to say 
Fearing for his life
Moron rushed to the South Street station
Where he was seen boarding a train heading for
At that very moment
Elliot Press and the Touchables
Out to uphold justice, were taking their oath
During the following weeks
Fifteen members of the Al Calone mob met violent deaths
Scar Melli Carpelli, Calone's top lieutenant were cornered by
Bugs Moron's boys and told
Meantime at the headquarters of Elliot Press and the Touchables
That same day
Little Annie Tourtoni
Carpelli's gun mal
Paid a surprise visit to the Touchables
Two day later
Cluched in her hand
The police found a note with just four words
The killing continued until Al Calone was taken into custody by Federal Agents
Following his conviction, Calone told an astonished court
His promise was never to be fulfilled
Their job done for them
Elliot Press and the Touchables
Turned to each other and said
Now retired and living on the palatial estate of the late Al Calone
They were asked how was this possible
