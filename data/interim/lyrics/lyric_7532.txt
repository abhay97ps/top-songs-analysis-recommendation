Friends are like music
Sometimes they're sad, sometimes they're lonely
And need to be told that they're loved
Everyone needs to be loved
Friends are like good wine
And I've had the best
I don't always show it
But no one knows better than I
So drink up
I'm a homesick old sailor
Who longs for the sound
Of my own front door
Tell me your stories, I'll teach you my songs
And we'll have one more
Isn't that what friends are for?
Isn't that what friends are for?
Friends are like warm clothes
In the night air, best when they're old
And we miss them the most when they're gone
Miss them the most when they're gone
Your friends love your good side
And live with your bad
But they want you and need you
When no one else knows you're alive
So drink up
I'm a homesick old sailor
Who longs for the sound
Of my own front door
Tell me your stories, I'll teach you my songs
And we'll have one more
Isn't that what friends are for?
Isn't that what friends are for?
So drink up
I'm a homesick old sailor
Who longs for the sound
Of my own front door
Tell me your stories, I'll teach you my songs
And we'll have one more
So drink up
I'm a homesick old sailor
Who longs for the sound
Of my own front door
Tell me your stories and I'll sing you all my songs
And we'll have one more
Isn't that what friends are for?
Isn't that what friends are for?
