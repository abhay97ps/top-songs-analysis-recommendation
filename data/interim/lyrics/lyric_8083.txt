First, you take my heart in the palm of your hands and you squeeze it
Then you take my mind and play with it all night
You take my pride and you throw it up against the wall
You take me in your arms, baby and bounce me like a rubber ball
I`m not complainin gwhat you`re doing, you see
'Cause this hurting feeling is, ooh, so good to me
Don`t you know that it 
Don`t you know that it 
You take my name scandalize it in the streets
Anything you wanna do or say is alright with me
Turn right around and make sweet love to me
Oooh wee, baby, you`re sure nuff good to me
'Cause, baby, these things youre doing to me
It hurts so bad but it`s worth all the misery
'Cause it 
Don`t you know that it 
Ooh, hoo, baby, ooh...
Ooh, boy please don`t ever take the hurt off me 
Cause it would hurt even worse if you would ever, ever leave
Even though sometimes it`s hard for me to beg
I make myself hold out 'cause if it kills me, I don`t care
'Cause, baby 
I don`t want you to ever quit
It ain`t no good until it hurts a little bit
Cause it 
Don`t you know that 
Oh, baby 
Don`t you ever, don`t you ever stop now, baby 
Give me some, baby 
It hurts so good
