City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
And you won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, its ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they got her kissing 'cause I don't get to sleep, no
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever, hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?
Laughin' gas, these hazmats, fast cats
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here 
Care Bear repping in harder this year 
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo' sound, you kill the Inc
So don't stop, get it, get it 
Until you're cheddar headed
And watch the way I navigate, hahahahaha

Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?
Don't stop, get it, get it, peep how your captain's in it
Steady, watch me navigate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Don't stop, get it, get it, peep how your captain's in it
Steady, watch me navigate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
