Come on, baby, let's sit down
We've been dancing all night long
Come on, baby , get close to me
We never danced to a love song.  
Disco music  is fine sometimes, yes it is
I wanna dance to a love song.  
I love music  no matter what the style
Oooh, I wanna get close to you, baby, for just a little while
And oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, baby
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, yeah, yeah
The party's almost over
Oooh, it won't be long
I wanna dance to a love song.  
 Cut the lights down low
Oooh, it's almost time to go.  
I wanna dance to a love song.  
What a lovely way
Oooh, what a lovely way to end the night
When I hold, when I hold my baby ever so tight.  Well, well
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
You.  Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Please Mr. DJ, slow the music down
I wanna dance to a love song.  
I wanna feel, 
Oooh, I wanna feel your body next to mine
I wanna dance to a love song.  
Come on and just dance, dance, dance, dance
Come on, come on and dance with me, girl, yeah
You know I wanna dance to a love song.  
You got to dance, dance, dance, dance
Come on, come on and dance with me, girl
You know I wanna dance to a love song.
