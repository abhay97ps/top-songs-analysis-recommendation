Oh my rose, my rose from New Mexico
Oh oh oh Mexico
 My Mexican rose
Si Si my gringo
I'll give you my ringo
Now in New Mexico
We'll Dance
To the spanish guitars
Making love underneath the stars
Tonight when the mission bells chime
I'm gonna make a you mine
Mexican rose in New Mexico
We'll dance
To Spanish Guitars
Making love underneath the stars
And tonight when the mission bells chime
I'm gonna make a you mine ya ya ine
 In New Mexico
