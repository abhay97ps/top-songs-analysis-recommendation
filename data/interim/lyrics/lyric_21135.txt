You're my baby, my lover, my lady
All night you make me want you, it drives me crazy
I feel like you were made just for me, babe
Tell me if you feel the same way
Cause it just feels so right, I don't wanna waste no time
If I had to choose, I know
I'm gon' always choose to be with you
Cause girl, don't you know
Girl, don't you know, you're so beautiful?
I wanna give all my love to you, girl
Not just a night but the rest of your life
I wanna be always here by your side
Girl, don't you know you're so beautiful
I wanna give all my love to you, girl
Not just a night but the rest of your life
I wanna be always here by your side
When you're not here, you don't know how much I miss you
The whole time on my mind is how much I'm gonna get
To make you feel so good like you know I could
Tell me if you feel the same way
Girl don't you know, you're so beautiful?
I wanna give all my love to you, girl
Not just tonight, but the rest of your life
I wanna be always here by your side
Girl don't you know, you're so beautiful?
I wanna give all my love to you, girl
Not just tonight, but the rest of your life
I wanna be always here by your side
Baby, don't you-- Baby, don't you know you're so beautiful? Beautiful
Baby, don't you know you're so beautiful?
Baby, don't you-- Baby, don't you know you're so beautiful? Beautiful
