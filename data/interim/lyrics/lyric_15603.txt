I saw you
With that ribbon in your hair
Think that I began to stare
Maybe I'll love you for awhile
A stranger
At a table in a place
And a really pretty face
I wonder what happens
When you smile
I might never be your hero
Never been one to fight
That don't mean that I can't be your valentine
I won't be your savior either
Couldn't even if I tried
But I think I could be someone you like
Someone you like
Reading
In a coffee shop we share
Hiding shy behind my hair
Watching our movie in my mind
I promise
Promise not to fly away
Make a story of today
Come on, give me a try
Now I might never stop your sorrow
Fix you up good as new
But that don't mean that I can't hold your hand in mine
I might never say I'm sorry
Even if I've done you wrong
But I think I could be someone you like
Someone you like
I might never be your hero
But I think I'd like to try
And the way you look at me is your reply
You got a lot to learn about me
Maybe you could start tonight
'Cause I think I could be someone you like
Someone you like
