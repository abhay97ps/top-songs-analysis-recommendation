Sometimes when
A woman's with a man
She loses control
Of her body and mind
She tries to hold on
To the morals that she knows
But nothing can hold back
That love desire
When we met
I thought you were cute
And obviously
You knew you were fine
Your arrogance
Just filled the air
I tried to hate you
I didn't have time
You know that you're always on my mind
I just can't control the way I feel about you
You're making me crazier day by day
This desire for love
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
It must have been
The confidence you had
That drew me near
And attracted me to you
You didn't seem to care
What anybody thought
So much ego
Just turned me on
I always can feel when you are near
Your presence alone can mesmerize me
You're making me burn down deep inside
My desire for love
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
Amor de mi vida
Te necesito
El cuerpo tuyo
Dame mas
Oh
When we first met
You thought I was arrogant
You know something, baby
That comes from experience
Lovable charming
Nah, wrong move
I make the ladies curious by playing it smooth
Take a look at yourself
In the palm of my hand
You're like a fly in the spiderweb
Woman, you can
Take my advice
So one day you'll learn
You put your hand near the fire and you're sure to get burned
Is it your love that's driving me mad
I just hate myself for falling for you
Something inside just can't let go
My desire for love
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
Love desire
