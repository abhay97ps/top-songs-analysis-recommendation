 Oh yes, wait a minute, mister Postman
 Wait, Mister Postman
 Oh yeaheaheah
 Please, please, mister Postman
 Oh yeah
There must be some word today
From my boyfriend, so far away
Please, mister Postman, look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me
I've been standin' here waitin', mister Postman
So patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Sayin' he's returning' home to me
Mister Postman , oh yeaheah
 Please, please, mister Postman
 Oh yeah
So many days you passed me by
See the tears standin' in my eyes
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leavin' me a card or a letter
Mister Postman , oh yeaheah
 Please, please, mister Postman
Why don't you check it and see one more time for me?
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Ooohooohooo, mister Postman 
Come on, deliver the letter, the sooner, the better
(Mister Postman
Aha)
