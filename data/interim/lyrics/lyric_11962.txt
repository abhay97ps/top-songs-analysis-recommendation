Fly away with me tonight
Take me on a one-way flight in your loving arms
And everything's going to be alright
You're the one who took my hand
When no one else could understand
You're the one who moves me
Like nobody else can
Take me down where I want to be
Turn around, this man who lives inside of me
Take me down and love me all night long
Hold me close and make me strong
Take me down, take me down tonight
In your eyes I see a light
It's your emotions glowing bright
So keep the fires burning
And let it warm me through the night
You can be a part of me
'Cause you're what love was meant to be
You and me, baby
We'll set this flame inside free
You don't have to stay forever
Let's just put our hearts together
Share another night in ecstasy
We know that it's feeling better
Every time we get together
Maybe love was meant for you and me
