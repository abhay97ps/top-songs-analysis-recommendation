Some people say I'm a no-count
Others say I'm no good
But I'm just a natural born travellin' man
Doin' what I think I should, oh yeah
Doin' what I think I should
And I don't give a damn about a Greenback a-dollar
Spend it fast as I can
For a wailing song and a good guitar
The only things that I understand, poor boy
The only things that I understand
When I was a little baby
My momma said, "Hey son
Travel where you will and grow to be a man
And sing what must be sung, poor boy
Sing what must be sung."
And I don't give a damn about a Greenback a-dollar
Spend it fast as I can
For a wailing song and a good guitar
The only things that I understand, poor boy
The only things that I understand
Now that I'm a grown man
I've travelled here and there
I've learned that a bottle of brandy and a song
The only ones who ever cared, poor boy
The only ones who ever cared
And I don't give a damn about a Greenback a-dollar
Spend it fast as I can
For a wailing song and a good guitar
The only things that I understand, poor boy
The only things that I understand
Some people say I'm a no-count
Others say I'm no good
But I'm just a natural born travellin' man
Doin' what I think I should, oh yeah
Doin' what I think I should
And I don't give a damn about a Greenback a-dollar
Spend it fast as I can
For a wailing song and a good guitar
The only things that I understand, poor boy
The only things that I understand
The only things that I understand, poor boy
The only things that I understand
