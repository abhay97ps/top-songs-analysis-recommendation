All the sun on the outside
Doesn't touch what I feel within
When I've got you beside me
I'm reachin' out for the rainbow's end
You get to me and give me a feelin' that's comin' on
Gettin' stronger and stronger
Glory bound to that everlastin' feelin'
Glory bound, Lord, I ain't never, never comin' down, oh no
It's five o'clock in the mornin'
I'm lookin' out on a sky of gray
I don't care, let the rains come
If I'm with you it's a sunny day
You make me feel so close to Heaven
Whenever I'm beside you
Glory bound to that everlastin' feelin'
Glory bound, Lord, I ain't never, never comin' down
I need the comfort I see in your smile
I need the touch of your hand 
Come on and bring out the best in me, girl
Don't you know that you can
I'm glory bound to that everlastin' feelin'
Glory bound, Lord, I ain't never,  never comin' down now
Glory bound  to that everlastin' feelin' 
Glory bound, Lord, I ain't never,  never comin' down now
Glory bound to that everlastin' feelin'
