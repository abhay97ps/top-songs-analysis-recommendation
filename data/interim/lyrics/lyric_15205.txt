That's word, we pray 
We got to pray just to make it today
I said we pray 
Oh yeah we pray 
We got to pray just to make it today
That's word, we pray
All my life I wanted to make it to the top
Some said I wouldn't, they told me no, but I didn't stop
Working hard, making those moves everyday
And on my knees, every night you know I pray
Now I just think that you can do whatever you want
I'm busting these rhymes making this money and I won't
Forget my people or my town or my ways
And on my knees every night I'm still gone pray
Time and time and time and time and time again
I kept on knocking, but these people wouldn't let me in
I tried and tried and tried and tried to make a way
But nothing happened 'til that day I prayed
Children dying, oh so fast from this and that
Need that money, working that dope, smoking that crack
Ten years old, stand outside, better look out
Dead and gone, never had a chance, what's it all about?
That's word, we pray 
We need to pray just to make it today
I said we pray 
Oh yeah we pray 
We need to pray just to make it today
That's word, we pray
That's word, we pray 
On a mission start to doubt, here we go
Kicking back, read these words we need to know
Living high, living good, living long
Take a minute, bust a prayer and you good to go
We're sending this one out to the Lord
And we thank you and we know we need to pray
Cause all the blessings that are good
They come from above
And once again we want to say "thank you" to the Lord
With all our love
We outta here
That's word, we pray
That's word, we pray
