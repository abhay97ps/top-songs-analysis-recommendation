I throw all of your stuff away
Then I clear you out of my head
I tear you out of my heart
And ignore all your messages
I tell everyone we are through
'Cause I'm so much better without you
But it's just another pretty lie
'Cause I break down every time you come around
Oh-oh, oh-oh
So how did you get here under my skin?
Swore that I'd never let you back in
Should've known better than trying to let you go
'Cause here we go, go, go again
Hard as I try, I know I can't quit
Something about you is so addictive
We're falling together
You think that by now I'd know
'Cause here we go, go, go again
You never know what you want
And you never say what you mean
But I start to go insane
Every time that you look at me
You only hear half of what I say
And you're always showing up too late
And I know that I should say goodbye, but it's no use
Can't be with or without you
Oh-oh, oh-oh
So how did you get here under my skin?
Swore that I'd never let you back in
Should've known better than trying to let you go
'Cause here we go, go, go again
Hard as I try, I know I can't quit 
Something about you is so addictive 
We're falling together
You think that by now I'd know
'Cause here we go, go, go again 
And again , and again , and again
I threw all of your stuff away
And I cleared you out of my head
And I tore you out of my heart
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
So how did you get here under my skin? 
Swore that I'd never let you back in 
Should've known better than trying to let you go
'Cause here we go, go, go again
Hard as I try, I know I can't quit 
Something about you is so addictive 
We're falling together
You think that by now I'd know
'Cause here we go, go
Here we go again
Here we go again 
Should've known better
Then trying to let you go
'Cause here we go, go, go again
Again 
Again
