Hey, okay lil mama, I know your kind and I like 'em grown
Do this, do that, never hold back, I think I'm ready, come on
Sh-shorty, I see ya thong, that body is what I want
I got it written in stone, let's start off sippin' Patron
However, whenever, whatever, this here what I'm all about
Spend cheddar, the weather get better
Put on, I'mma give you this crown
Forever and ever on schedule
Yeah, baby, I'ma take it to the top
I'ma take you to the spot
I'ma show you what I got
But you gotta make it drop
Get it poppin', never stop, hey
Cash ain't a problem, I really got dollars
So baby, get straight to the business
Poppin' them collars, I know if I holla
I'm lookin' for shorties with thickness
I'll be your personal fitness
Girl, I'mma get you addicted
So could you be my, would you be my, won't you be my
Can you be my...
Can you be my action?
'Cause from the way that you're dancin'
I know you got it goin' on tonight
Baby, you can be my action
And I'll turn on the lights and the cameras as soon as I can get you home tonight
Can you be my action?
Hey 
You can be my, you can be my - we shonin'
Baby, you can be my action
You can be my - whoa
We shonin'
You can be my action, plenty satisfaction
I really got a fetish, she bowlegged, that's my attraction
Set it off there, baby, with the blackberry that's my collection
What it do on everything that sexiness is my passion
Whatever you like, we turn off the lights
Go'head 'n show me your back strong
The end of the night, if you get me right
Got stacks to blow like a saxophone
Do ya thang, mama, keep killin' 'em
Dead presidents, I'm peelin' 'em
For the record, I'm feelin' ya, no contest, shorty, keep grillin' 'em
All the way, all day
Don't play, get straight to the point, raise the temperature
So hot, celebrate, girl
I just wanna give you this cake, let's get physical
Baddest in the club, how you do that, baby? You too much
Just my luck, let me touch, be director, let me cut
Can you be my action?
Cause from the way that you're dancin'
I know you got it goin' on tonight
Baby, you can be my action
And I'll turn on the lights and the cameras as soon as I can get you home tonight
Can you be my action?
Hey 
You can be my, you can be my - we shonin'
Baby, you can be my action
You can be my - whoa
We shonin'
I live in Hollywood, but I still be in the 'jects
Shawties wanna holla when they see what's on my neck
My money very long, I ain't gotta make it stretch
And when I say shone, I be talkin' 'bout sex
Say little mama you know I'mma make you holla
Walk in the club and we gon' toss a couple dollas
Pop a few bottles, make them hatas wanna follow
Ain't nothin' wrong, you grown, so baby, can you be my
Can you be my action?
'Cause from the way that you're dancin', I know you got it goin' on tonight
Baby, you can be my action
And I'll turn on the lights and the cameras as soon as I can get you home tonight
Can you be my action?
Hey 
You can be my, you can be my - we shonin'
Baby, you can be my action
You can be my - whoa
We shonin'
