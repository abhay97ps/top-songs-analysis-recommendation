Roc-A-Fella.. y'all know what this is
We givin' y'all five seconds to put your drink down
And report to the dance floor immediately
All the busters we givin' y'all five seconds to get close to a exit
It's about to get real ugly in here
Five seconds is up - let's go!
 uh, uh, uh
 niggas
 bitches
 busters
 hustlers
 hoes!
 boasters
 MACK!
You know how Mack come through on the club tip
E'rybody real deep on that thug shit
Cop Cris' spray the club on that thug shit
Cop frisks suits snub in the club quick
Told y'all real high, when I come you can try
If you want, you can die, if you want to
We hittin' whores on the floor, whole crew be wild
Bitch back that ass up like Juvenile 
When my peeps come to spend, a dime apiece
You know Mack come through with a line of freaks
Every bitch on the hip be a 9 at least
We gettin' head on the floor, while you grindin' freaks
Whole squad get it down like this
Whole squad buyin' rounds of Cris'
Whole squad got they crowns on wrist
Whole squad got a pound to twist
Whole squad got a pound to spit, in case a clown wanna flip
Mac never slip in the club
Told y'all niggas four-fifth in the club
If a nigga wanna draw then the blood it can drip in the club
You know how niggas get in the club
Shit you know how I be, all high in V.I.P
Rollin' up to B.I.G. 
Niggas be all liquored up, talkin' shit
'Til they man gotta come and pick 'em up
Got bitches in the back bouncin' to "Jigga What"
You got your hands up and I ain't even stick y'all up
E'rybody get it up 
E'rybody get it up 
12 AM on the way to the club 
1 AM DJ made it erupt 
2 AM now I'm gettin' with her 
3 AM now I'm splittin' with her 
4 AM at the waffle house 
5 AM now we at my house 
6 AM I be diggin' her out 
6:15 I be kickin' her out 
7 AM I'ma call my friends 
12AM we gon' do it again
We gon', we gon', we gon' do it again
By the way, yo..
How the fuck you gon' talk about MC's on our heel?
When we just cop them things homie, the chromey wheels
Both arms are chunky, the sleeves on chill
Any given times a hundred G's in your grill
Don't talk to me 'bout MC's got skills
"He's alright, but he's not real"
Jay-Z's that deal, with Sigs in the field
Love affair for war, hug, squeeze that steel
Fuck, you got a flow, that's cool with me
You got a little dough, that's cool with me
You got a little cars, little jewelries
But none of y'all muh'fuckers could fool with me
You know the wrist frostbit minus two degrees
'Bout as blue as the sea, the way I maneuver the V
Hat cocked can't see his eyes, who could it be?
With that new blue Yankee on, who but me?
Niggas shipped two million, then I blew to three
Then I skated to four, 'fore I went on tour
I came back and it's plain, y'all niggas ain't rappin' the same
Fuck the flow, y'all jackin' our slang
I seen the same shit happen to Kane
Three cuts in your eyebrows tryin' to wild out
The game is ours, we'll never foul out
Y'all just better hope we gracefully bow out
Throw yo' hands up - niggas, bitches, busters
Hustlers, fuck that! , c'mon
