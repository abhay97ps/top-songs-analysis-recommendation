You coax the blues right
Out of the horn, Mame
You charm the husk right
Off of the corn, Mame
You've got those
Banjoes strumming
And plunking out a tune
To beat the band
The whole plantation is humming
Since you brought Dixie
Back to Dixieland
Yes, you make the cotton
Easy to pick, Mame
You give my old
Mint Julep a kick, Mame
You make the
Old magnolia tree
Blossom at the mention
Of your name
You made us feel alive again
And giving us the drive again
To make the South
Revive again, Mame
Mame, Mame
Yes, you make your Satchmo
Feel like a king, Mame
You make the world
We're living in swing, Mame
You make the
Old magnolia tree
Blossom at the mention
Of your name
You've got those
Banjoes strumming
And plunking out a tune
To beat the band
The whole plantation is humming
Since you brought Dixie
Back to Dixieland
You make the cotton
Easy to pick, Mame
You give my old Mint Julep
A kick, kick, kick, Mame
You make the
Old magnolia tree
Blossom at the mention
Of your name
You're special, fascinational
Groove dooby inspirational
We think you're just
Sensational, Mame
