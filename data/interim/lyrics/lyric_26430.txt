You put me on a pedestal and tell me I'm the best
Raise me up into the sky until I'm short of breath 
Fill me up with confidence, I say what's in my chest
Spill my words and tear me down until there's nothin' left
Rearrange the pieces just to fit me with the rest, yeah
But what if I, what if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall?
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know
And what if I, what if I sin?
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah
Then am I the monster? Yeah
Just let me know, yeah
I was fifteen when the world put me on a pedestal
I had big dreams of doin' shows and making memories
Made some bad moves tryin' to act cool, upset by their jealousy, uh
Liftin' me up , liftin' me up 
And tearin' me down , tearin' me down 
I'll take responsibility for everything I've done 
Holdin' it against me like you're the holy one 
I had a chip on my shoulder, had to let it go
'Cause unforgiveness keeps them in control
I came in with good intentions, then I let it go
And now I really wanna know
What if I, what if I trip? 
What if I, what if I fall? 
Then am I the monster? 
Just let me know 
And what if I, what if I sin? 
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah 
Then am I the monster? 
Just let me know
