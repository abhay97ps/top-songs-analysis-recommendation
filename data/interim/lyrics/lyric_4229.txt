 One can have a dream, baby
 Two can make that dream so real
 One can talk about being in love
 Two can say how it really feels
 One can wish upon a star
 Two can make that wish come true, yeah
 One can stand alone in the dark
 Two can make the light shine through
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Me and you, just takes two
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
To make a dream come true, just takes two
 One can have a broken heart, living in misery
 Two can really ease the pain like a perfect remedy
 One can be alone in a car, on a night like these all alone
 Two can make just any place seem just like being at home
Just takes two, just takes two
 One can go out to a movie, looking for a special treat
 Two can make that single movie something really kind of sweet
 One can take a walk in the moonlight, thinking that it's really nice
 But two walking hand-in-hand is like adding just a pinch of spice
