Someone , someone 
Someone who really loves you 
When someone really loves you 
That's when your life begins
Once I was loved by no one
No one depended on me
I thought that I was truly happy
But, oh, how wrong can you be
Someone , someone 
Someone who really loves you 
When someone really loves you 
That's when your life begins
A heart can be easily broken
A heart can even stand still
A heart can be easily broken
But I know that mine never will
Once all the stars were shining
Now it's so easy to see
Once all the stars were shining
But now they're shining for me
Someone , someone 
Someone who really loves you 
When someone really loves you 
That's when your life begins
That's when your life begins
That's when your life begins
