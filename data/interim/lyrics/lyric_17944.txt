She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall
She's into new sensations
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night
She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life, but she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain, come on!
Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca 
Livin' la vida loca 
She's livin' la vida loca
Woke up in New York City
In a funky cheap hotel
She took my heart and she took my money
She must've slipped me a sleeping pill
She never drinks the water, makes you order French champagne
Once you've had a taste of her, you'll never be the same
Yeah, she'll make you go insane 
Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca 
She's livin' la vida loca 
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life, but she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain 
Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca 
Upside, inside out
She's livin la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca 
She's livin' la vida loca 
She's livin' la vida loca 
La vida loca
La vida loca
La vi
