When I leave, I'll be gone some time
Just remember that you're mine, all mine
Leave it where it belongs at night
Keep it tight
Well, I know your ways
And I know you're sly
But you know the night
It has a thousand eyes
And if you cheat, I'll find out, alright
Better keep it tight
Keep it tight
You say you won't
But I know you might
You're an angel now
But I'll be out of sight
They say out of sight is out of mind, yeah
So you gotta keep it tight
You keep it tight
I'll be travelin' soon
But before I go
There's some things you just gotta know
Keep it tight
Keep it tight
You gotta keep it tight
