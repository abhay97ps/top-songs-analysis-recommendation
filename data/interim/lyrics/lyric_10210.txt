Music, harmony and rhythm
The magical mystery of music, harmony and rhythm
That magical feeling
Oh, when the day to day gets me down
I go into my world and escape into the sounds
And it gives me strength so I can carry on
Even when I thought all the hope was gone
I could carry on, carry on, on and on into the
Music, harmony and rhythm
The magical mystery of music, harmony
Into a rhythm, get into it
Oh, my fantasies become reality
I believe that I can make a dream come true
And it feels like home and it feels secure
And I don't have to face the feelings that I did before
Anymore, anymore, no
Just more and more into the music, harmony and rhythm
The magical mystery of music, harmony
Into a rhythm, get into it
Get into the music, oh, oh, get into the music
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Music, harmony and rhythm
The magical mystery of music, harmony and rhythm
The magical mystery of music, harmony and rhythm
The magical mystery of music, harmony and rhythm
Oh, it sounds so sweet
Music, harmony and rhythm
The magical mystery of music, harmony and rhythm
Ooh, it's in me
