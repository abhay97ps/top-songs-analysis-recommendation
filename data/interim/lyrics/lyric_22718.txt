If you were the ocean and I was the sun
If the day made me heavy and gravity won
If I was the red and you were the blue
I could just fade into you
If you were a window and I was the rain
I’d pour myself out and wash off the pain
I’d fall like a tear so your light could shine through
Then I’d just fade into you
In your heart in your head in your
Arms in your bed under your skin
Til there’s no way to know where
You end and where I begin
If I was a shadow and you were a
Street
The cobblestone midnight is where
We first meet
Til the lights flickered out, we
Dance with the moon
Then I’d just fade into you
In your heart in your head in your
Arms in your bed under your skin
Til there’s no way to know where
You end and where I begin
I wanna melt in I wanna soak through
I only wanna move when you move
I wanna breathe out when you
Breathe in then I wanna fade into you
If I was just ashes and you were
The ground
And under your willow they laid me
Down
There’ll be no trace that one was
Once two
After I fade into you
Then I’d just fade into you
Then I'd just fade into you
Then I'd just fade into you
Then I'd just fade into you
