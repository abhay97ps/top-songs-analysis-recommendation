Sarah Beth is scared to death
To hear what the doctor will say
She hasn't been well
Since the day that she fell
And the bruise, it just won't go away
So she sits and she waits, with her mother and dad
And flips through an old magazine
Till a nurse with a smile
Stands at the door
And says, 'Will you please come with me?'
Sarah Beth is scared to death
'Cause the doctor just told her the news
Between the red cells and white
Something's not right
But we're gonna take care of you
Six chances in ten, it won't come back again
With the therapy we're gonna try
It's just been approved
It's the strongest there is
I think we caught it in time
Sarah Beth closes her eyes
She dreams she's dancing
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first love is holding her close
And the soft wind is blowing her hair
Sarah Beth is scared to death
As she sits, holding her mom
Says it would be a mistake
For someone to take
A girl with no hair to the prom
For just this morning, right there on her pillow
Was the cruelest of any surprise
And she cried when she gathered it all in her hands
The proof that she couldn't deny
Sarah Beth closes her eyes
She dreams she's dancing
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first love is holding her close
And the soft wind is blowing her hair
It's quarter to seven, that boy is at the door
Her Daddy ushers him in
When he takes off his cap, they all start to cry
'Cause this morning where his hair had been
Softly, she touches just skin
They go dancing
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first, true love is holding her close
And for a moment, she isn't scared
