Last night I was dreaming
I was locked in a prison cell
When I woke up I was screaming
Calling out your name 
And the judge and the jury
They all put the blame on me 
They wanna tell from my story
They want to hear my plea
Only you can set me free
'Cause I'm guilty 
Guilty as a girl can be
Come on baby, can't you see
I stand accused
Of love in the first degree
 Of love in the first degree
Someday I'm believing
You will come to my rescue
Unchain my heart, you'll keep him
Let me start a new 
The hours passed so slowly
Since they've thrown away the key 
Can't you see that I'm lonely
Won't you help me please
Only you can set me free
'Cause I'm guilty 
Guilty as a girl can be
Come on baby, can't you see
I stand accused
Of love in the first degree
 Of Love in the first degree
Of Love
Of Love in
 Of Love
 Of Love in
Of love in the first degree
And the judge and the jury
They all put the blame on me
They wanna tell from my story
They wanna hear my plea
Only you can set me free
'Cause I'm guilty 
As a girl can be
Come on baby, can't you see
I stand accused
Of love in the first degree
