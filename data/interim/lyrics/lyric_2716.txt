When I grow up to be a man
Will I dig the same things that turn me on as a kid?
Will I look back and say that I wish I hadn't done what I did?
Will I joke around and still dig those sounds
When I grow up to be a man?
Will I look for the same things in a woman that I dig in a girl?
Will I settle down fast or will I first wanna travel the world?
Now I'm young and free, but how will it be
When I grow up to be a man?
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh
Will my kids be proud or think their old man is really a square?
When they're out having fun, yeah
Will I still want to have my share?
Will I love my wife for the rest of my life 
When I grow up to be a man?
What will I be when I grow up to be a man?
Won't last forever
It's kind of sad
Won't last forever
It's kind of sad
Won't last forever
