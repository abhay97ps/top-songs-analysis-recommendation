In Memphis, B.B. King invented the concept of lead guitar, now standard in today's Rock bands. Bukka White , Leadbelly, and Son House, left Country Blues to create the sounds most of us think of today as traditional unamplified Blues. Arthur "Big Boy" Crudup, Wyonnie Harris, and Big Mama Thorton wrote and preformed the songs that would make a young Elvis Presley world renown. In the early nineteen-sixties, the urban bluesmen were "discovered" by young white American and European musicians.
