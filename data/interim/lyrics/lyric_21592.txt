Inflatable pool full of dad's hot air
I was three years old splashing everywhere
And so began my love affair
With water
On a river bank with all my friends
A big old rope tied to a limb
And you’re a big old wuss if you don't jump in
The water
Yeah, when that summer sun starts to beating down
And you don't know what to do
Grab your swimming trunks
Ice up that old Igloo
Drive until the map turns blue
Daytona Beach on spring break
Eighteen girls up on stage
White t-shirts about to be sprayed
With water
Oh let her go boys
Yeah, when that summer sun starts to beating down
And you don't know what to do
Just go and grab someone you want to see in a bathing suit
And drive until the map turns blue
You can stay right there when the daylights gone
Play truth or dare and it won’t take long
'Fore you and her got nothing on
But water
All you really need this time of year
Is a pair of shades and ice cold beer
And a place to sit somewhere near
Water
