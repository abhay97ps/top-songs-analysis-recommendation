Let's go
Let's go, yeah 
Stay so fresh, so clean, think they like me 
I wear more Supreme than a hypebeast 
Only blue, no, green don't excite me 
I could make a ho out your wifey 
Jeremy Scott up on my toes, act like Shockey 
Made her get down on the bottom and she top me 
Pull up extra icy, I'm not playin' hockey 
Niggas think I'm weird and they don't really like me 
'Cause I could fuck your bitch and fuck your mom and auntie 
Your girl's a five, but your mom is a dime piece 
And your auntie, her name is Miss Connie 
I got one Glock, his name Clyde, the other one named Bonnie 
These bitches, they think they dandy, but they be just lyin' 
That lil' bitch, can't throw it back, I swear that ho be tryin' 
When I fuck her from the front it sound like that bitch dyin' 
VVS, I need a vest, anemic my diamonds 
I swear these niggas talk shit but they really be hidin' 
Had that boy's bitch on my dick, that ho, she was just ridin' 
Diamonds on my neck so wet, that shit look like Poseidon 
I stand on my money, then my height, it turn to 9' 10" 
Yeah, these niggas be bitin' 
Grra-ta, I'm not really with the fightin' 
Yeah, me and her was vibin' 
Yeah, yeah 
Your bitch call me Myron 
Stay so fresh, so clean, think they like me 
I wear more Supreme than a hypebeast 
Only blue, no, green don't excite me 
I could make a ho out your wifey 
Jeremy Scott up on my toes, act like Shockey 
Made her get down on the bottom and she top me 
Pull up extra icy, I'm not playin' hockey 
Niggas think I'm weird and they don't really like me 
Ninety thousand, that's a light band,  yeah 
I can tell you, it's the real spill 
Yeah, fucked your bitch just for a light bill 
Yeah, banana clip, I won't slip on the peel
I can't slip, slip, slip, no, no, I can't miss
I got icebergs on my neck, I can sink a ship
Outer space swag, not regular, Titanic my whip
In the hood, I'm not regular, I just brung my stick, baby
Oh, you think I give a fuck because I'm rich, baby? 
Come on, baby, let's have sex and have a rich baby
She said, "I thought you ain't do that," well, you dismissed, baby 
Uh, young nigga, no, I ain't changed, Lil Uzi from the 6', baby 
Uh, I don't think they like me 
But when I drop this song, I know they'll get excited 
She was homie girl, but now that girl is my bitch 
I like them girls that do that scammin' and that swipin'
I just ran up all my bands, I just ran up all my bands
I just ran up all my bands, I just ran up all my bands
She give me head, that bit' migraine 
She give me head, that bit' migraine 
She give me head, that bit' migraine 
She give me head, that bit' migraine 
Got addicted to the road, got addicted to the stress
Got addicted to the foreigns, got addicted to the racks 
Man, these boys be doin' the most 
And I swear that is a fact 
Man, this girl wanna give me brain
Yeah, we call that bit' migraine
Yeah, we call that bit' migraine

Yeah, we call that bit' migraine
Pack all my shit then I might migrate
Anywhere you goin', know some niggas gon' hit
I don't run from shit but the damn police
All blue hunnids to wash my face, yeah
Stay so fresh, so clean, think they like me 
I wear more Supreme than a hypebeast 
Only blue, no, green don't excite me 
I could make a ho out your wifey 
Jeremy Scott up on my toes, act like Shockey
