This one you might know
Did you get my message?
The one I left while I was trying to condense everything
That I meant in a minute or less when I called to confess
And make all of my stresses go bye-bye?
Did you get my message?
You didn't, I guess
If you did, you would've called me with your sweet intent
And we could give it a rest
'Stead of beating my breast
Making all of the pressure go sky-high
Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send?
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
In a brand new sense, so completely unrelated to the one I sent?
Did you get my message? Oooh
Did you get my message?
Did you get my message? Yeah, oooh
Uh oh, where did it go?
Must have bypassed your phone
And flown right outta the window
Oh well, how can I tell?
Should I call the operator?
Or maybe she knows the info
On whether or not my message you got was too much or a lot to reply
Why not try this for a fact?
Should you ever call back?
I'd relax and be relieved of all my panic attacks
Ooh-ooh-aah...
Ooh...
Pick up the phone and call me back
Why? Cause I'm freaking out
Did you get my message? Oooh
Oh did you get my? Oh did you get my?
Oh did you did you did you did you did you now?
Oh did you get my message? Yeah, Oooh
Oh did you get my message?
The one I left while I was trying to condense everything that I meant
Now the moment is passed
Not much sand in the glass and I'm standing to lose my mind
Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send?
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
To the matter of our love's defense?
At least be sympathetic to the time I spent
Did you get my message? Oooh
Oh did you get my message? 
Did you get my message? yeah, oooh
Did you get my message?
Did you get my message?
Did you get my message?
Did you get my message? Ooh
Oh did you get my message?
That I wanna reconnect with you
Oh did you get my message?
I just wanna get back with you
Oh did you get my message?
That I wanna make out with you
Oh did you get my message?
Why don't you just answer the phone?
We're gonna
We're gonna mix that in 5.1 so you can sit in your living room in the exact place where you're staning tonight
And we live that experience
Sitting on the couch, turn the lights out
You're like "Oh my God that girl is so annoying"
Guy won't get out of my way
But the mix is great
Oh yeah that was awesome
It's like there's a cloud, a rain cloud over the town you know
It's crazy, the voice in my head's getting louder and louder
