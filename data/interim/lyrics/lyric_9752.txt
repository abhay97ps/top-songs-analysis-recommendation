You were sun, I was sky
And you gently moved into me
And your light came
Shining through me
To the darkness inside
You were touch, I was feel
And the love just eased between us
As though time had never seen us
When you're up that high
Then say goodbye
It ain't easy coming down
No, it ain't easy coming down
It was so easy to pretend
Our world would never end
But suddenly, I found
It's coming down
You were rain, I was earth
And I needed you for growing
And my life was overflowing
With the feeling of you
I was sand, you were sеa
And you made the tide movе faster
But the wind was still your master
Though you wanted me
You must be free
It ain't easy coming down
No, it ain't easy coming down
It was so easy to pretend
Our world would never end
But suddenly, I found
It's coming down
Down, down, down, down
It ain't easy coming down
No, it ain't easy coming down
No, it ain't easy coming down
No, it ain't easy coming down
