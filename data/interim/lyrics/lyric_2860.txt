Baby, I need your good lovin'
Got to have your love right now, baby
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile
Because I'm not livin', baby
I only exist
I'll never laugh, I'll never smile no more
I don't care if I stay like this, because
Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love, my dear, I'm like a motherless child
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile
When I feel that old hurt comin' on
I stop and cry like I'm cryin' 
People ask why would a grown man cry
I drop my head, and I sadly reply
Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love, my dear, oh, I'm like a motherless child
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile
Sometimes I feel like the wanderer
Searching for peace within
I need you, my darling
Like a lost soul needs a friend
So come and fill my empty arms
Ooh, and fill my empty life
Nobody knows the emptiness I feel
That I'm feelin'
Nobody knows the loneliness I feel
And I feel it 'cause
Without the one you love, oh, life ain't worthwhile
Without your love, my dear, oh, I'm like a motherless child
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile
Because without the one you love, oh, life is not worthwhile, no, no
Without the one you love, life ain't worthwhile
