Verse One :
I feel so selected, and still so neglected,  I looked in that mirror and still no reflection,  yo feminine energy giving me symmetry I swear to God I can feel yo protection,  I told her I'm focused on reaching my higher self,  She said baby please let me try & help,  I got the whole wide world up in my pants, she wanna take the galaxy off Orion's Belt, So I gave her permission, she ain't like these hoes her behavior is different,  hmmm, knew she was a boss when she said CEO when I asked what's her favorite position, ha, She after my heart but I'm all outta love so girl that’s a dangerous mission,  I'm setting a meeting with God just so I can tell him that one of his angels is missing, That's my lil baby, my chocolate coco puff, best believe I be properly stroking her,  Baby girl I swear you are a smoking gun look at how  you click clack lock and load it up,  She say Ian never gotta beg for the cookie, She give me a hall pass cause I'm not a rookie,  I'ma climb all the way to the top rope and hit a 5 star frog splash in that pussy
