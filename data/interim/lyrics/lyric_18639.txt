Winter sure was cold and miserable
Cooped up, shut down, baby it was pitiful
Anyhow, it's over now
We owe to ourselves to have a little fun
The pace car's pacin' now the green flag's wavin'
Uh, oh another six-pack summer comin'
Sing to me babe I'll be your dashboard drummer and
Let's turn the radio up as loud it can go
Got the ultra-ray wraparound sunglass vision
Got the sails up iced down a cool ambition
Just to relax and let the six-pack summer roll
We've got the sun block, a blanket and the best of Jimmy Buffet
T-bones for the grill, hey ain't it great to rough it
The party's on from dawn to dawn
24-7 'til they pull the plug
No more waitin' come on and kiss me baby
Uh, oh another six-pack summer comin'
Sing to me babe I'll be your dashboard drummer and
Let's turn the radio up as loud it can go
Got the ultra-ray wraparound sunglass vision
Got the sails up iced down a cool ambition
Just to relax and let the six-pack summer roll
Slow and steady, I'm so ready
Uh, oh another six-pack summer
