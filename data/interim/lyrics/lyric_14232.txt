Take him out of love
He's been there before
He knows the feeling it can give
Loss of memory
Lots of indecision
Doesn't know who to believe
Well
I know the merits of a motion
Directed to the man in me
I'll be as good as the next best boy
But you know what I really need:
All I need to get is stimulation
So get me up against the wall
You knew I needed stimulation
But I never thought you'd be that bold
Lucky guy
His world's on fire
He can get it up night and day
Oh
I wish I could get the feeling
And give the girls something to say:
All I need to get is stimulation
So get me up against the wall
Well
I know the merits of a motion
Directed to the man in me
I'll be as good as the next best boy
But you know what I really need:
All I need to get is stimulation
So get me up against the wall
All I need is stimulation
Do it and I lose contral
You knew I need.ed stimulation
But I never thought you'd be that bold
