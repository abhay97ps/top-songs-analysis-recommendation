You're off the hook
Unlike my past relations
You were into more than friendly datin', yeah
Well, you didn't have time for games, you were ready to stake your claim
And I felt just the same way about you
It started out with just one touch
But little did I know I'd get this much
Lovin' , kissin' , huggin' 
From just one man, you're
Off the hook and your love is unexplainable
Oh, baby, you're off the hook and your love is so untamable
Between us there's fire , my only desire 
Is being with you, boy, 'cause you know just what to do, oh, oh, oh, ooh
It really turns me on
How my man is so sensitive and warm, well, well, well
He knows what I want and need, at any cost he'll give it to me
And I'll do just the same for my man, oh, yeah
Never been so happy, boy, your love is off the hook
And why should I complain, baby
Crazy, insane, I lose my cool over you
Your lovin' , kissin' , huggin' , from just one man, you're
 Started with just a touch
 Mmm, mmm, mmm 
The kissin' , the huggin' , the lovin'
 Mmm, damn
 It's off the hook , yeah 
Off the hook and your love is unexplainable
Oh, baby, you're off the hook and your love is so untamable
We don't need no other , 'cause we got each other
And baby, it's all good, yeah, yeah, your love is off the hook, oh, boy you're
Off the hook  and your love is unexplainable 
Oh, baby , you're off the hook and your love is so  untamable
Between us there's fire , my only desire
'Cause baby, it's all good, yeah, yeah, your love is off the hook
