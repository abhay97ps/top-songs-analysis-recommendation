It's your chance take her hand to the floor
Fellas just the moment you've been waiting for
Girl if you see something you like then let them know
Ladies I know youâ€™re ready
Because you only got one chance, yeah yeah
For your first dance, you never forget about your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam
Tell them J.B., yeah, man
When I close my eyes, I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so long for this day to come
Now that it's here, let's make it special
I can't deny, there's so many thoughts in my mind
The D.J.'s playing my favorite song, ain't no chaperones
This could be the night of your dreams
Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
I couldn't ask for more
We're rocking back and forth under the disco ball
We're the only ones on the floor
I can't deny, there's so many thoughts in my mind
The D.J.'s playing my favorite song, now we're all alone
Here's the opportunity
Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
Everybody says that we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing close
I'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine
Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
It's your chance take her hand to the floor, to the floor
Girl, if you see something you like then let them know
Because you only got one chance, for your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam, yeah man
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
