Ou left me for a new love
You found out it wasn't a true love
Now that he is gone
Lets go steady one more time
Please don't cry
You've got to be strong, dear
I know he was wrong, dear
But now that he's gone
I know he was wrong to come to the dance
With another girl, the way that he did
I knew he was wrong when he took your love from me
After all, he was once my best friend
Thats all in the past
Let's forget you
He'll never hurt you
I won't let him
Now that he's gone
Let's go steady one more time
Yes he was wrong to come to the dance
With another girl, the way that he did
I knew he was wrong when he took your love from me
After all, he was once my best friend
Thats all in the past
Let's forget him
He'll never hurt you
I won't let him
Now that he's gone
Let's go steady one more time
