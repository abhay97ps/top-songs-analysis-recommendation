Not One Minute More
Della Reese
I'll only love you
As long as the sea
Rolls on endlessly
To the shore
I'll love you til then
Not one minute more
I'll only love you
Til there's only night
And the sun
The sun gives no light as before
I'm gonna love you til then
Not one minute more
I'm yours, heart and soul, I'm yours
And all that I'll ever possess
But if you should say to me
Will you always be
I'll just have to confess
I'll only love you
As long as the beat
The beat of my heart
Can repeat still once more
I'll love you til then
Not one minute more
I know I can love you til then
Not one minute more
