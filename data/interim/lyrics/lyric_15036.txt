 pick up the phone, 'cause I know that you're home
Too many words have not been said for us to be living alone
Now all of the fighting, and all of the tears
They don't matter now
Another night falls, dark and lonely
You're the only one that I can turn to
If I ever needed your arms to hold me
Baby, it's tonight
If I ever needed your eyes to heal me
Baby it's tonight
 come hold me close, and show me that you still care
Let's take it to where it all began and start again from there
'Cause there's no way out, as far as I can tell
I'm walking in a world of strangers
You're the only one that really knows me
 x2
Won't you please, please pick up the phone
Ooh...
Don't leave me to face this world all alone
 takes some time
 repeat to fade
