Are you a man who loves and cherishes and cares for me?
Are you a guard in a prison, maximum security?
Do we stay home all the time because you want me to yourself?
Or am I locked away, out of fear that I'll find someone else?
Well, I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Just because you think I might
Find somebody worthy 
No, I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Maybe if you treat me right
You won't have to worry
Is this a relationship fulfilling your needs as well as mine?
Or is this just my sentence? Am I doing time?
Oh, if this love, real real love, then I'm staying, no doubt
But if I'm just love's prisoner, then I'm bustin' out
Oh, baby, I don't like
Living under your spotlight 
Just because you think I might 
Find somebody worthy 
No, I don't like 
Living under your spotlight 
Maybe if you treat me right 
You won't have to worry 
Oh, you oughta be
Ashamed of yourself
What the hell do you think you're doing
Lovin' me, lovin' me?
So wrong
Baby, all I do is try 
To show you that you're my 
One and only guy 
No matter who may come along
Open your eyes, 'cause baby, I don't like
Hey, 'cause I don't like
Living under your spotlight 
Just because you think I might
Find somebody worthy 
No, I don't like
Living under your spotlight 
Maybe if you treat me right 
You won't have to worry 
I don't like
