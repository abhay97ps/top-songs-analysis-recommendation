All our times have come
Here, but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain
 Come on, baby
 Baby, take my hand
 We'll be able to fly
 Baby, I'm your man
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Valentine is done
Here, but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity 
40,000 men and women everyday 
40,000 men and women everyday 
Another 40,000 coming everyday
 Come on, baby
 Baby, take my hand
 We'll be able to fly
 Baby, I'm your man
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Love of two is one
Here, but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
The door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared
 Come on, baby
 And she ran to him
 They looked backward and said goodbye
 She had taken his hand
 Come on, baby
