It's nothing I can put my finger on
But it's there, I swear
It's not somethin' I'm imaginin'
Each time you call
I know I'll get your "working late routine" again
Is there someone I should know about?
Tell me why do I have this doubt?
I'm sure your alibis are water tight
And you're where you have to be tonight
Oh, but I know you're slipping away from me
I'm know your alibis are water tight
And you're where you say you are tonight
But honey, I can tell
I know the pattern much too well
I don't fool so easily
You're slippin' away from me
Your telephone service says you're out again
Somewhere out there
You've got another rendezvous
I know the way you work
You'll be someplace where no one can check up on you
You think you're in the clear
But don't forget
That's exactly the way we met
I'm sure your alibis are water tight
And you're where you have to be tonight
Oh, but I know you're slipping away from me
I'm know your alibis are water tight
And you're where you say you are tonight
But honey, I can tell
I know the pattern much too well
I don't fool so easily
You're slippin away from me
Is there someone I should know about?
Tell me why do I have this doubt?
I'm sure your alibis are water tight
And you're where you have to be tonight
Oh, but I know you're slipping away from me
I'm know your alibis are water tight
And you're where you say you are tonight
But honey, I can tell
I know the pattern much too well
I don't fool so easily
You're slippin away from me
I'm sure your alibis are water tight
And you're where you have to be tonight
Oh, but I know you're slipping away from me . .
