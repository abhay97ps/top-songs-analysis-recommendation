Because you're bad of the heart
How could you be so cruel?
You treat me like a fool
After all I did for you
You cut me like a blade
My trust is slowly fading
Now I don't know what to do
I thought that when you came along
My life would start to change
Instead I saw that I was wrong
My life was rearranged
How I wonder why
You just put my love aside
You threw me in the gutter
And you left me there to lie
Bad of the heart
You never wanted to start
'Cause you're just bad of the heart
You never played the game too smart
'Cause you know you're bad
When I was by your side
You kissed and told me lies
You hurt me each and every day
I made it through the night
Lying to myself
Why did it have to be this way?
I thought that when you came along
My life would start to change
Instead I saw that I was wrong
My life was rearranged
How I wonder why
You just put my love aside
You threw me in the gutter
And you left me there to lie
Bad of the heart
You never wanted to start
'Cause you're just bad of the heart
Girl, you're tearing me apart
Bad of the heart
You never wanted to start
'Cause you're just bad of the heart
You really didn't want me, baby, oh girl
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh girl
Oh girl
Bad, bad, ba-ba-ba-ba-bad
Ba- ba- ba-ba-ba-...
Bad of the heart
You didn't really want me, baby
You never wanted to start
You never really needed me
Bad of the heart
Yeah, yeah
'Cause you're just bad of the heart
Bad of the heart
You didn't really want me, baby
You never wanted to start
You never really needed me
Bad of the heart
Yeah, yeah
'Cause you're just bad of the heart
Bad of the heart
'Cause you're just bad of the heart
You never wanted to start
'Cause you're just bad of the heart
Bad of the heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
