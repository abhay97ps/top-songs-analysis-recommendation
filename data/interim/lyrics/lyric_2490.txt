Uh huh hmm hmm gonna get along without you now
Uh huh hmm hmm gonna get along without you now
You told me I was the dearest thing you even asked me to wear your ring
You ran around with every girl in town you didn't even care if it got me down
Uh huh hmm hmm gonna get along without you now
Mhm mhm hmm hmm gonna get along without you now
Got along without you before I met you gonna get along without you now
Gonna find somebody who is twice as cute cause you didn't like me anyhow
You told everybody that we were friends but this is where our friendship ends
Cause all that you said you change your tune
You haven't been around since way last June
Uh huh hmm hmm gonna get along without you now
Got along without you before I met you gonna get along without you now
So long my honey goodbye my friend gonna get along without you now
Uh huh hmm hmm gonna get along without you now
