Seems it was just a while ago
All of my friends and I
Went to each others weddings
And stood by each others side
And became brides
Talked to Kurt on the phone today
He said that he and Liz were through
And by the way that
Things have been going
You could that they were overdue
For every other married pair of us
That already split in two
Each of us turning our own lives alone
For sleeping with someone new
Ain't it true
These are hard times for lovers
Everyone wants to be free
Ain't these hard times for lovers
Everyone singing, I gotta be me
Without you
Now, honey, I'm supposed to tell you
I've got to live for today
And don't you know it is my lifetime
I've got to live it my own way
And lately, I can't help thinking
I reap what I sow
For all of my holy freedom
What have I got to show
I don't know
But lately, I can't help thinking
I reap what I sow
For all of my holy freedom
What have I got to show
I don't know
Ain't these hard times for lovers
Everyone wants to be free
Ain't these hard times for lovers
