Mmmh
Rrrrrr!
Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees
Baby, just get on your knees 
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please
Baby, just say pretty please 
Yo, I'll be back at eleven
You just act like a peasant
Got-got a bow on my panties
Because my ass is a present
Yeah-yeah, it's gooder than Meagan
You look good when you're beggin'
I-I be laughing when you beggin' me
To just put the head in
L-let me sit on your face
It's ok, you can play with it
When I'm bouncin' it, chill out
And don't you make a mistake with it
L-let me see what you're workin' with
If I'm ridin', I'm murkin' it
Slow grindin', I'm twerkin' it, yeah
I bagged him, I Birkin'd it
I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Ooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it
I wanna see you lookin' up
Baby, I'ma need you to beg for it
Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees
Baby, just get on your knees 
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please
Baby, just say pretty please 
G-g-g-g-gimme brain
Assume the position
Make-make-make me way smarter
Like you was a magician
Paid my dues and tuition
It's good for your nutrition
Get head like a beautician
Got me twitchin', finish your mission 
You make it come down
Y-y-y-you make it run down
I'ma need you to give these other dudes the rundown
You got that legendary
This shit is fake, scary
Got me seein' them fireworks, I'm on my Kate Perry
 I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Ooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it
I wanna see you lookin' up
Baby, I'ma need you to beg 
Beg, beg for it 
'Cause we are just animals 
Baby, it's primal 
I want you on all fours 
And before I let you walk
You gotta show me how you crawl
If you want it all 
It's non-negotiable
So do as I say 
If you wanna get the job
You better know who's the boss
Yeah
I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Ooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it 
I wanna see you lookin' up 
Baby, I'ma need you to beg for it
Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees
Baby, just get on your knees 
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please
Baby, just say pretty please
