I believe you
When you say that you will reach into the sky
And steal a star so you can put it on my finger
I believe you
Baby, I believe you
I believe you
When you say that every time that we make love
Will be the first time we've made love and every act of love
Will please you
Baby, I believe you
Blind faith makes me follow you
I'd live in a cave if you wanted to
Just ask me and I'll marry you
You don't have to sell me
‘Cause you overwhelm me
I've made up my mind
For a lifetime
I believe you
When you swear your love will keep on growing strong
And that forever isn't long enough to love me
Like you need to
Baby, I believe you
Baby, I believe you
Honey, I love you
Blind faith makes me follow you
I'd live in a cave if you wanted to
Just ask me and I'll marry you
You don't have to sell me
‘Cause you overwhelm me
I've made up my mind
For a lifetime
I believe you
When you say you'll fill my body with your soul
And love will grow into a freckled little girl
Who looks like we do
Baby, I believe you
Baby, I believe you
Honey, I love you
