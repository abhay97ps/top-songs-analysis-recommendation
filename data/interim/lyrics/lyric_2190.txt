Sue, why don't we go away
Sue, we could leave today
Sue, what would your daddy say
Sue, will he see things our way
Come on, baby, we'll fund us a preacher man
In time your daddy will understand
Sue, who cares what people say
Sue, let's leave today
I'll find us a secret hide-away
I'll get a job and I'll work everyday
Sue, you gotta be my baby
Sue, you gotta be mine
Sue, you gotta be my baby
