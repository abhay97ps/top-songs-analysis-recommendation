Be true to yourself
And you'll always be true to me
Be true to yourself
And you'll be the girl that I want you to be
Remember that if some other guy
Catches your eye just follow your heart
I know your heart won't lead you wrong
Our love is much too strong
I'm not afraid of losing you
I have faith in you, can't you see
Darling be true to yourself
And you'll always be true to me
