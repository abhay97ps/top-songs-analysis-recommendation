Heart in my mouth
But my head in the clouds; yeah
I can feel it rising
Bound to the earth
But we could ascend yeah; I'm realizing
I feel both feet lift off the ground
I can levitate
With every chord that plays
I close my eyes and levitate
I just know
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The air is electric
It heightens the senses
I can feel it charging
I'll never forget it
We're transcending
And I know it's starting
I feel both feet lift off the ground
I can levitate
With every jolt that leaves I close my eyes
And levitate
I levitate
Heart in my mouth, but my head in the clouds yeah
I can feel it rising
Bound to the Earth but, we could ascend yeah
Iâ€™m realizing
I feel both feet lift off the ground
I can levitate
With every jolt that leaves I close my eyes
And levitate
I just know
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I can levitate
I can levitate
I feel both feet lift off the ground
I can levitate
With every jolt that leaves I close my eyes
And levitate
I levitate
