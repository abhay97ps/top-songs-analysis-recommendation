It's a classic me mistake
Someone gives me love, and I throw it all away
Tell me, have I gone insane?
Talkin' to myself, but I don't know what to say
'Cause you let go
And now I'm holdin' on
I guess you don't know what you got
Until it's gone
Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody
Just to find out you really love someone
Oh, and I do, and I do, and I do, yeah
Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody
Just to find out you really love someone
Oh, yeah
Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody
So don't tell me it's too late
Hearts are made to bend
Baby, please don't let me break, yeah
I knew I should've stayed
'Cause now, you're movin' on
And I don't know what to say
'Cause you let go 
And now I'm holdin' on 
I guess you don't know what you got
Until it's gone
Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody
Just to find out you really love someone
Oh, and I do, and I do, and I do, yeah
Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody 
Just to find out you really love someone
Oh, yeah
Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody, yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody, yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody, yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody, yeah
Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody
Just to find out you really love someone
Oh, and I do, and I do, and I do, yeah
Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody 
Just to find out you really love someone
Oh, yeah
Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah

You gotta lose somebody
