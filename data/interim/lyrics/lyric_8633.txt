All night long, one night
I could not sleep for ringing in my ear
A melody began to sing
For at first
The words I could not make out clear
Then smog fields lifted away 
And this is what I heard them say
It said, "Without love , there's nothing you can do"
Yes, it did
It said, "Without love , you're not even you"
All night long, He spoke to me - the words of wisdom rang
Beneath His sweet, soft melody
Said, "Don't you know , yeah 
That a rich man can be poor if wealth is all he has?"
 Hey! I know
Yeah, without love , there's nothing you can do
 Do you know?
Without love , you're not even you
Can't you hear me talking to you? 
Without love, ha, there's so much you can do
 Yes, it is
Hey, without love 
Ooh, you're not even you 
Oh, yeah
Without love , there's really so much you can do
 Yes, it is 
Without love , you're not even you
Everybody sing now
Without love , there's so much you can do
 Yes, it is, yes, it is! 
Without love , you're not even you
Sing it, sing it, one more time
Without love , there's so much you can do
 Without love 
 Do you know you're not even you?
Hey, hey, without love , just so much you can do
