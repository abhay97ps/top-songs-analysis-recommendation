I don't see me
In your eyes anymore
Oh, why can't I
Make them shine like before?
I don't see you
Or your heart in your kiss
That you should say
That you're mine. You resist
There was a time
Life was fine
Love was ecstasy
But now I doubt
What the outcome will be
I pray you'll say
I'm the one you adore
Then I'll see me
In your eyes as before
I pray you'll say
I'm the one you adore
Then I'll see me
In your eyes as before
