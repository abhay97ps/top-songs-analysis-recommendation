Take me across the water cause I need some place to hide
I done the rancher's daughter and I sure did hurt his pride
Haha
Well, there's a hundred miles of desert lies between his hide and mine
I don't need no food and no water, Lord, cause I'm runnin' out of time
Fightin', killin', wine and women gonna put me to my grave
Runnin', hidin', losin', cryin', nothing left to save
But my life
Stood on a ridge and shunned religion, thinking the world was mine
I made my break and a big mistake, stealin' when I should have been buyin'
All that fightin', killin', wine and those women gonna put me to an early grave
Runnin', hidin', losin', cryin', nothing left to save
But my life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life
So I stood on a ridge and shunned religion, thinking the world was mine
I made my break and a big mistake, stealin' when I should have been buyin'
I was stealin' when I should have been buyin'
I was stealin' when I should have been buyin'
Stealin' when I should have been buyin'
Stealin' when I should have been buyin'
Stealin' when I should have been buyin'
Stealin' when I should have been buyin'
Stealin' woo
Stealin' hahaha, yeh
I was stealin' when I should have been buyin'
Stealin', oh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
Stealin', oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Stealin', rock'n'roll, all right
Stealin', rock'n'roll, all right
Stealin' babe, babe
Stealin', should, should, should have been buyin'
Stealin', should, should, should have been buyin'
Stealin', should have, should have, should have been buyin'
Stealin', buying, yeah
