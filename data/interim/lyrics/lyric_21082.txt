Remix!
You got to know the boy futuristic, ain't he? 
My work can make the J's do the jumpman, can't it? 
You got to know this the remix right here 
Grand Hustle, baby, it's the kings right here 
You got to know we guapin' , pockets extra sloppy 
Don't I love my vegetables? Extra cheese and broccoli 
Don't Yung LA like to kick it like karate? 
Don't I be with J-Money serving everybody? 
Ain't we up in Magic City throwing up the profit? 
Ain't me and Tip taking off like a rocket? 
Ain't my, ain't my, ain't my, ain't my, ain't my, money long?
Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I still putting on? 
Ain't I?  Ain't I? 
Ain't I?  Ain't I?
Ain't I smoking strong?  Ain't I putting on? 
Ain't I rocking yays?  Ain't my money long? 
Ain't I?  Ain't I? 
Ain't I?  Ain't I? 
Ain't I' in the 'Ville?  Ain't I on the hill? 
Ain't I on a pill? Ain't I, ain't I real?
Okay, my rims so big; I'm at the tip-top, ain't I? 
Choppers in the trunk'll make you do the "Macarena" 
Polo to the floor, yeah, motherfucker, ain't I? 
All-black coupe, I can buy it, bitch, can't I? 
Remix, Yung L-A and T.I, this a banger 
Dro be on that thing, you don't hear me, trick, ain't I? 
Big Rolls Royces , and I got 'em nauseous 
We be in Ferraris, the cars with the horses 
Ain't I on a pill?  Riding down Dill
Ice, 30 below, minus the wind chill 
Ain't I packing chrome?  And I'm blowing strong 
Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I got it going on? Young Dro!
Ain't I?  Ain't I? 
Ain't I?  Ain't I?
Ain't I smoking strong?  Ain't I putting on? 
Ain't I rocking yays?  Ain't my money long? 
Ain't I?  Ain't I? 
Ain't I?  Ain't I? 
Ain't I' in the 'Ville?  Ain't I on the hill? 
Ain't I on a pill?  Ain't I, ain't I real?
Ralph Lauren, Purple Label; ain't I fresh as I can be?
Made it through my situation; ain't I blessed as I can be?
Ain't I laughing at you haters tryna take a shot at me?
They don't know which way to go—I'll make it easy: Follow me
Honestly, ain't I insane? I think that's the way I gotta be
Ain't I so, so superfly? Boy, ain't nobody hot as me
Ain't T.I. all on TV when he wake up and go to sleep? 
Everywhere, they notice me—ayy, for yourself, just go and see
My community, I'm serving, though they hope I don't succeed
Hear me speak, they so intrigued—"Ayy, ain't he snitching?" No, indeed
You come with that common flow , your show, I have to commandeer
Since I see you can't take over, I'll just have to volunteer 
Ayy, ain't I your superior? Listen here, bruh: you not a peer
I'm so Zone 1 that it ain't funny, twice the G that I appear 
Rep Bankhead so loud and clear , gon' be gone for 'bout a year
So Paper Trail, you gotta hear, but ain't that "Ain't I" outta here? Ayy!
Ain't I?  Ain't I? 
Ain't I?  Ain't I?
Ain't I smoking strong?  Ain't I putting on? 
Ain't I rocking yays?  Ain't my money long? 
Ain't I?  Ain't I? 
Ain't I?  Ain't I?
Ain't I' in the 'Ville?  Ain't I on the hill? 
Ain't I on a pill?  Ain't I, ain't I real?
Oh!
Bow , bow, bow, bow
Ain't I , Ain't I 
Ain't I , Ain't I
Oh! Oh, le'ggo!
