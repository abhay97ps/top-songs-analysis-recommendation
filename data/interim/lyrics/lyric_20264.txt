Hehehe! Yeah, B!
Talk yo' shit! Hehe 
How you gon' upgrade me?
What's higher than number one?
You know I used to beat that block
Now I be's the block 
I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a leash though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me
Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?
You need a real woman in your life 
Taking care of home and still fly 
And I'mma help you build up your account
Believe me
When you're in them big meetings for the mills 
It take me just to compliment the deals 
And anything you cop, I'll split the bill
Believe me
Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels
Upgrade you  up,  up,  upgrade you
Partner, let me upgrade you, flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things and
Upgrade you  up,  up,  upgrade you
I can do for you, what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equals
Still play my part and let you take the lead role, believe me
I'll follow, this could be easy
I'll be the help, whenever you need me 
I see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you
You need a real woman in your life 
Taking care of home and still fly 
I can help you build up your account
Believe me
When you're in them big meetings for the mills 
It take me just to compliment the deals 
Anything you cop, I'll split the bill
Hey, believe me, I can upgrade you
Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you 
Switch your neck ties to purple labels 
Upgrade you  up,  up,  upgrade you
Partner, let me upgrade you, flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things and
 upgrade  you
 up, ,  up,   upgrade you
I be the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you 
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
Now you my project celebrity
I keep ya name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star, but unless you're flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me
Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels
Upgrade you  up,  up,  upgrade you
Partner, let me upgrade you, flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things, and
Upgrade you  up,  up,  upgrade you
Audemars Piguet watch, dimples in ya necktie
Hermes briefcase, Cartier tie clips
Silk-lined blazers, diamond creamed facials
VVS cuff links, six-star pent suites
Partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Let me, let me, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, partna, let me upgrade ya
