Super Saiyan
Wah
Pew pew pew
Huh, ha, woah, yeah, huh
Hahahah
Woah
Why don't I cry anymore
Probably cuz I been through too much
Used people, friends, lovers, dragged ‘em a whole bunch
Notes so sour, words so sore, everytime I fuck up my heart gets more
Solid, don’t mean strong, don't mean happy, only less vulnerable
Sensitivity is a superpower, and I'm scared to become deniable
A man for sure, wronged peers for too long the regrets start to grow
That’s that real evil, I fucking hate people
But I love ‘em, it's hard to cope
Sometimes I just wanna drive the easy road, dive into a bed of Coke-
-A Cola, let everything go, I get tired of waiting for the snow
Love takes time and is difficult, some might say love is a joke
I think that love is a rope, should never be a nope
So many souls dreaming of past times, cuz nowadays courage is a no
Misunderstood as some petty voice, raise your words, not your voice
Your life is your choice
Your life is your choice huh
Your life is your choice huh
Your life is your 
Choice
Your life is your choice
Your life is your choice huh
Your life is your 
Choice
And don't get me wrong I know, we all haven't been created to grow equal
Think about it though, if you feel alone, if you mad or unfaithful
I can do better, you can do better, we can do…
Better rushing into wars, no I can't do
If I keep my patience, no I can't lose
Hard to stand, harder to understand, know what to do
Matter of fact, yeah I always knew
Secrets that I never ever really grew
It's hard to face the truth when faith has lost the youth
When youth forgot the use and prefers the booze
Crying within the bruise, most think about the juice, the proof, bullet coupe
Most an ignorant motherfucker, let the motherfucker loose
Your life is your choice
And I get, I know it, it's hard to get out the depression
Red eyes in the darkness, always under pressure
Drowning into space, into your own dimension
You think you have dementia
You can’t even pace yeah, no one to mess with
The road takes some patience ahead of you, that’s only some tough shit
But keep dodging the targets
Your life is your choice
Your life is your choice
Your life is your choice
