This is dedicated to my favorite girl
You have given me the best of you
And you have made my dreams come true, yeah
And after all the things that you have done
Girl, it makes me say that you are more than a woman
So I'm...
Dedicating this one to my favorite girl 
She's the only woman in the whole wide world 
Dedicating this one to my favorite girl 
She's the only woman in the world for me
Never thought that love could be so kind
'Til you came and brought me peace of mind
I'll treasure every moment spent with you
â€˜Cause no one does the things for me you do
So I'm...
Dedicating this one to my favorite girl 
She's the only woman in the whole wide world 
Dedicating this one to my favorite girl 
She's the only woman in the world, world, woo
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
So I'm...
Dedicating this one to my favorite girl 
She's the only woman in the whole wide world 
Dedicating this one to my favorite girl 
The only one in the world, oh...
Dedicating this one to my favorite girl 
She's the only woman  in the whole wide world 
Dedicating this one  to my favorite girl 
Dedicating this one to my favorite girl 
She's the only woman in the whole wide world...
