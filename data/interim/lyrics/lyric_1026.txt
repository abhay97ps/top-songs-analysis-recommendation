Muskrat, muskrat, what makes your back so slick?
I've been livin' in the water all o' my life
It's wonder I ain't sick I ain't sick, I ain't sick, I ain't sick
Ground-hog, ground-hog, what makes your back so brown?
I've been livin' in the ground all o' my life
It's a wonder I'm around, I'm around, I'm around, I'm around
Jaybird, Jaybird, what makes you fly so high?
I've been eatin' these acorns all o' my life
It's a wonder I don't die, I don't die, I don't die, I don't die
Rooster, rooster, what makes your claws so hard?
I've been scratchin' in the barnyard all o' my life
It's a wonder I ain't tired, I ain't tired, I ain't tired, I ain't tired
Tomcat, tomcat, what makes your tail so long?
I've been prowling around all o' my life
It's a wonder I ain't gone, I ain't gone, I ain't gone, I ain't gone
