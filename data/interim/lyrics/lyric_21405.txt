I always knew you were the best
The coolest girl I know
So prettier than all the rest, the star of my show
So many times I wished you'd be the one for me
But never knew you'd get like this, girl
What'd you do to me?
You're who I'm thinking of
And girl, you ain't my runner-up
And no matter what, you're always number one
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl
You're used to going out your way to impress these Mr. Wrongs
But you can be yourself with me
I'll take you as you are
I know they said believe in love
It's a dream that canâ€™t be real
So girl, let's write a fairytale and show 'em how we feel
You're who I'm thinking of
And girl, you ain't my runner-up
And no matter what, you're always number one
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you
I want you
It's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite, girl
You take my breath away with everything you say
I just want to be with you, my baby, my baby
Oh-oh, promise I'll play no games
Treat you no other way than you deserve
'Cause you're the girl of my dreams
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you 
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady 
The one that makes me crazy 
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite
 My favorite, my favorite girl
 My favorite, girl
My favorite, my favorite
 My favorite, my favorite girl
 My favorite girl
Favorite girl
