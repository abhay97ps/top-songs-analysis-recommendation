Maybe life has got you rundown
I think it's time, girl, that we slow down
So take a look, it's almost sundown
So why don't you lay right here?
Let me just ease your mind
I'm givin' you all my time
I'm gonna keep on, keep on loving you
Strong and slow
The way that you want me to
Maybe my whole life through
I'm gonna keep on, keep on loving you
When that morning sun is dawning
Baby, both of us should call in
'Cause we got too much love to fall in
So why don't you lay right here?
Let me just ease your mind
I'm givin' you all my time
I'm gonna keep on, keep on loving you
Strong and slow
The way that you want me to
Maybe my whole life through
I'm gonna keep on, keep on loving you
Why don't you lay right here?
Let me just ease your mind
Give you all my time
I'm gonna keep on, keep on
Strong and slow
The way that you want me to
Maybe my whole life through, girl
I'm gonna keep on, keep on loving you
Soft and slow
The way you want me to
Maybe my whole life through
I'm gonna keep on, keep on, keep on loving you
I'm gonna keep on, keep on loving you
