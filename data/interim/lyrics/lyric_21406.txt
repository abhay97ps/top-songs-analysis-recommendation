Lil Jon, ah!
This one right here 
Is for all the ladies 
Ladies, who want to take it back 
Holler at 'em, Jay!
I've been thinking about you
And how we used to be, yeah
Back when, it didn't have to end
We can start again
There's nothing left to say
Don't waste another day
Just you and me tonight
Everything will be okay
If it's alright with you
Then it's alright with me
Baby let's take this time
Let's make new memories
Do you remember?

Bring it back to the time when you and me had just begun
When I was still your number one
Well it might seem far-fetched baby girl, but it can't be done
I've got this feeling fire blazing and it's hot just like the sun
Know you feel it too, my girl
Just freeze up, may the good vibes run
Girl take a sip of the champagne
Take a lil trip down my lane my girl
While you know every night you'll feel alright
Look, I tell you this girl atta my world
Don't change, I'mma not rearrange that girl
I'mma tell you straight this atta my world
How many years do you want? Come kiss this, I know you miss this
That's what I heard
That's what I heard 
That's what I heard
Word, girl 
There's nothing left to say
Don't waste another day  
Just you and me tonight 
Everything will be okay 
If it's alright with you 
Then it's alright with me 
Baby let's take this time 
Let's make new memories
