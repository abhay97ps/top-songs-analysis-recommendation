Hoo-wee, baby
Baby you`re so fine
Gotta have your loving any old time
Oooh, baby
Baby, baby
You`re so fine, fine, fine
Hoo-wee, baby
Remember last night?
You said you were leaving
We had a big fight
Oooh, baby
Baby, baby
You`re so fine, fine, fine
Remember the night I met you?
We danced until a quarter to two
You held my hands and you kissed my lips
Baby, what you trying a-do?
Woo-woo-woo
Hoo-wee, baby
Gotta let you know
What you reap, baby
You sure gotta sow
Oooh, baby
Baby, baby
You`re so fine, fine, fine
Hoo-wee, baby
Baby, you`re so fine
Gotta have your loving any old time
Oooh, baby
Baby, baby
You`re so fine, fine, fine
Oooh, baby
Like to make-a your all mine, mine, mine
Oooh, baby
Baby, baby
You`re so fine, fine, fine
Oooh, baby
