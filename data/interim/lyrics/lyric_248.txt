Well you heard the story of the hot rod race that fatal day
When a Ford and a Mercury went out to play
Well this is the inside story, and I'm here to say
I was the kid that was drivin' that Model A
It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got twelve cylinders; uses them all
With an overdrive, that just won't stall
Its got a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust
4.11 gears you can really get lost
It's got safety tubes, and I'm not scared
The brakes are good, and the tires are fair
We left San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright
Everything went fine up the Grapevine Hill
We was passing cars like they was standing still
All of a sudden like a flick of an eye
A Cadillac sedan had passed us by
The remark was made "Theres the car for me"
By then the taillight were all you could see
Now the fellas ribbed me for bein' behind
So I started to make that Lincoln unwind
I took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it on down into overdrive
Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
Twist the speedometer off at the end
I had my foot feed clear to the floor
Said that's all there is and there ain't no more
Went around a corner and I passed a truck
I whispered a prayer just for luck
Fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts
The guys beside me were white as a ghost
I guess that thought I'd lost my sense
The telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said, "Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots."
Smoke was rollin' out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass
When I did I'd be short on gas
Went arround a corner with the tires in the side
You could feel the tension, man what a ride
I said, "Hold on, I've got a license to fly"
And the Cadillac pulled over and let me by
And then all of the sudden a rod started knockin'
When down in the dips she started to rockin'
I look in my mirror; and a red light was blinkin'
Cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!
Well they arrested me and put me in jail
And called my pop to throw my bail
He said, "Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
You don't quit drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln!"
