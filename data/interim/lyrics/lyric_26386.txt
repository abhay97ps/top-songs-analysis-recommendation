Hmm
You might think I'm crazy
The way I've been cravin'
If I put it quite plainly
Just gimme them babies
So what you doin' tonight?
Better say, "Doin' you right" 
Watchin' movies, but we ain't seen a thing tonight 
I don't wanna keep you up 
But show me, can you keep it up? 
'Cause then I'll have to keep you up
Shit, maybe I'ma keep you up, boy
I've been drinkin' coffee 
And I've been eatin' healthy 
You know I keep it squeaky, yeah 
Savin' up my energy 
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five 
Can you stay up all night? 
Fuck m–µ 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five 
You drink it just like water 
You say it tastes like candy

Oh yeah, yeah
Baby, you might need a seatbelt when I ride it
I'ma leave it open like a door, come inside it
Even though I'm wifey, you can hit it like a side chick
Don't need no side dick, no
Got the neighbors yellin' "Earthquake!" 
4.5 when I make the bed shake
Put it down heavy even though it's lightweight 
Yeah, we started at midnight
Go 'til the sunrise 
Done at the same time 
But who's counting the time when we got it for life? 
I know all your favorite spots 
We can take it from the top 
You such a dream come true, true
Make a bitch wanna hit snooze, ooh
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight 
Thirty-four, thirty-five 
Can you stay up all night? 
Fuck me 'til the daylight 
Thirty-four, thirty-five 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Means I wanna "69" with you
No shit
