From the minute that I seen ya
I was sweatin' ya like a freshman does a senior
I couldn't even sleep
Waitin' for the next day
Just to see ya
Girl just to see ya
When you walked by, my heart
Skipped a beat Like a scratched cd
I was knee deep
And them four letters
L O V E sprung on spring love
Damn she got me
This that new millennium spring love
With Stevie B the originator
Pitbull the innovator
This for all the spring breakers out there
In cancun, cabo, rosarito beach, daytona beach
Panama city
This dedicated to ya'll
Go ahead and enjoy spring break, spring love
Stevie B holla at em
I remember when we first started
You came to me and you were broken hearted
I took you in and wiped all your tears away
I gave you loving more than any other gave
Don't you know I'm the one and I love you girl
I don't care what they say you know you are my world
Come back home to the one
Who loves you more and more
Soon you'll see that it was me you were searchin' for
Spring love, come back to me
Spring love, come back to me
I need you and I want you baby
I remember when I seen you in the club
In that dress in them heels
You was dressed to kill
With that? only got sex appeal
I was feeling like I was on X fa real
Those lips
Those eyes
Those hips
Those thighs
Got me hypnotized I'm sprung on spring love
Damn she got me
I can remember the first time we ever met
The sun was shining
Love was gleaming in the air
You caught my eye and the next thing that I knew
I was in love - I was so in love with you
We were so close for a season of my life
I wanted so much to have you for my wife
But something changed
Season came to an end
I had to leave you
And that's where my heartache began
Spring love, Come back to me
Spring love, Come back to me
I need you and I want you baby
So we finally met
Had a couplpe of shots at the bar
And from there we went 
To the dance floor spring break spring love
We were sprung and that's fo damn sho
It's the last night
So you know that I'm feeling like a bass head
With a glass pipe
Went back to the tel and beat it up
Damn I'm sprung on spring love
Spring love, Come back to me
Spring love, Come back to me
