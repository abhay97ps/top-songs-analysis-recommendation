Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, it's chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
Chains, well I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around, 'cause I'm not free
Whoa, oh, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah
Now believe me when I tell you
I think you're fine
I'd like to love you
But, darlin', I'm imprisoned by these
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Oh, oh, it's chains of love got a hold on me
I wanna tell you pretty baby
Your lips look sweet
I'd like to kiss them
But I can't break away from all of these
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, oh, it's chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
Chains, chains of love
Chains of love
Chains of love
