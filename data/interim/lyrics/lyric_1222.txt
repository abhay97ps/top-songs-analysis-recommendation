I've got Bonnie
Sweet sweet Bonnie
And all my lonely days are through
Now, now, now I've got Bonnie
Sweet sweet Bonnie
Made all my dreams come true
Once I used to cry
Nobody cared if I would live or die
But then one lucky day
I met a girl that heaven sent my way
Now I've got Bonnie
Sweet sweet Bonnie
And all my lonely days are through
Now, now, now I've got Bonnie
Sweet sweet Bonnie
Made all my dreams come true
I don't drive a car
I'll never be a famous movie star but
Still I wouldn't switch with someone else
If he was twice as rich
'cause I've got Bonnie
Sweet sweet Bonnie
And all my lonely days are through
Now, now, now I've got Bonnie
Sweet sweet Bonnie
Made
All my dreams come true
