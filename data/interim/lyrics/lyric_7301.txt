Could it be forever
Or is my mind just rambling on
Well I touched you once and I kissed you once
And now I feel like you're mine
Well I feel like you're mine and I see in your face
I'm not wrong to have these feelings
Well I feel like you're mine, I've never known a time before
That's had so many meanings
Could it be forever
Or am I just wasting time
Well I don't think so because you let me know
You make me feel like you're mine
Well I feel like you're mine and I can't remember
When the feelings have been stronger
And all I know is I can't let go
I wanna be with you I wanna be with you just a little while longer
All my feelings come together
All of me is here
Never know when I felt better
Cause I know this won't disappear
But
Could it be forever or is my mind just rambling on
Well maybe it is and if it is
Well then I'll be moving along
Well I feel like you're mine
And I see in your face I'm not wrong to have these feelings
Well I feel like you're mine and I've never known a time before
That's had so many meanings
