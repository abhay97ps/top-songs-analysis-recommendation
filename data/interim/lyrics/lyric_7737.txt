One last time let me love you one last time
All I need is one more chance to say goodbye
One last kiss then I swear I'll let you go baby
I need you, I've got to see you
One more night stay with me till tomorrow
Just tonight let's pretend that tomorrow will never come
One last time loving you before the end
I can't face never seeing you again
One last look in your eyes to know we're through baby
I need you I've got to see you
One more night stay with me till tomorrow
Just tonight let's pretend that tomorrow will never come
Baby I need you  I've got to see you 
Baby I need you  baby I need you 
Baby I want you  baby I want you 
Baby I want you  baby I want you
