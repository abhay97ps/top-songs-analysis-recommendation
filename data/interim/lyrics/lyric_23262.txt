You got your hair down
You got that look in your eye
That says come here and get me boy
Lay me down and love me just right, yeah
Ain’t goin no where
I got a bottle of wine
I got nothin’ but time on my hands
And I’m gonna be your man tonight, ah yes I am
I can’t imagine doin’ nothin but what I’m doin
Just layin’ round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippin’ on a little something
I need your lovin’
Just keep them kisses comin’
It’s been a long week
I’ve been missin’ me some you
All I wanna do is get your lips on mine
Girl if you only knew, hey
I can’t imagine doin’ nothin but what I’m doin
Just layin’ round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippin’ on a little something
I need your lovin’
Just keep them kisses comin’
Yeah keep ‘em comin’ all night
Don’t stop killin’ me baby
Don’t stop drivin’ me crazy
I swear there’s honey on your lips
Baby give me one more long slow kiss
I can’t imagine doin’ nothin but what I’m doin
Just layin’ round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippin’ on a little something
I need your lovin’
Just keep them kisses comin’
Oh keep ‘em comin’ all night, hey
