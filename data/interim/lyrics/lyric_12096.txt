Sometimes the morning coffee's way too strong
And sometimes what she says she says all wrong
Right or wrong, she's there beside me like only a friend would be
And that's close enough to perfect for me
Now she's been known to wear her pants too tight
And drinking puts her out just like a light
Heaven knows she's not an angel but she'd really like to be
And that's close enough to perfect for me
She kisses me each morning and smiles a sleepy smile
She don't have to say it, I can see it in her eyes
Don't you worry about my woman and what you think she ought to be
She's close enough to perfect for me
Sometimes she gets down and starts to cry
But then again a lady has a right
She's everything I've ever wanted, she's all I'll ever need
She's close enough to perfect for me
She kisses me each morning and smiles a sleepy smile
She don't have to say it, I can see it in her eyes
Don't you worry about my woman and what you think she ought to be
She's close enough to perfect for me
Woah, she's close enough to perfect for me
