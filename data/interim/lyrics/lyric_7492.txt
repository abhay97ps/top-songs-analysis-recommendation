Hey where did we go
Days when the rains came?
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughing and a running hey, hey skipping and a jumping
In the misty morning fog with our hearts a thumpin' and you
My brown eyed girl, you my brown eyed girl
Whatever happened to Tuesday and so slow
Going down the old mind with a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding all along the water fall, with you
My brown eyed girl, you my brown eyed girl
Do you remember when we used to sing
Ha la la la la la la dee da
Ha la la la la la la dee da
Laa dee da
Ha la la la la la la dee da?
So I had to find my way now that I'm on my own
I saw you the other day and my my my how you have grown
Cast my memory back there Lord hey sometime, sometime I'm overcome
Making love in the green grass behind the stadium with you
My brown eyed girl, you my brown eyed girl
Sha la la la la la la dee da
La dee da
Sha la la la la la la dee da
Sha la la la la la la dee da
La dee da
Sha la la la la la la dee da
