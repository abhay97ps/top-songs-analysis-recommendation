All of her days have gone soft and cloudy
All of her dreams have gone dry
All of her nights have gone sad and shady
She's gettin' ready to fly
Fly away 
Fly away 
Life in the city can make you crazy
The sounds of the sand and the sea 
Life in a highrise can make you hungry
The things that you can't even see
Fly away 
Fly away 
In this whole world there's nobody as lonely as she 
There's nowhere to go and there's nowhere that she'd rather be 
She's looking for lovers and children playing
She's looking for signs of the spring 
She listens for laughter and sounds of dancing
She listens for any old thing
Fly away 
Fly away 
In this whole world there's nobody as lonely as she 
There's nowhere to go and there's nowhere that she'd rather be 
All of her days have gone soft and cloudy
All of her dreams have gone dry 
All of her nights have gone sad and shady
She's gettin' ready to fly
Fly away 
Fly away 
Fly away
