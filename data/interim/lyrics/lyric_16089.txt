Ooh, ooh Ooh
Oh, hoo Yeah, yeah
If I could I'd protect you
From the sadness In your eyes
Give you courage
In a world Of compromise
Yes, I would
If I could
I would teach you all the things
I've never learned
And I'd help you cross the bridges
That I've burned
Yes, I would
Chorus:
If I could
I would try to shield
Your innocence From time
But the part of life
I gave you isn't mine
I'll watch you grow
So I can let you go
If I could
I would help you make it through
The hungry years
But I know that I can never
Cry your tears, babe
But I would if I could
If I could
In a time and place
Where you don't wanna be ahhhh
You don't have to walk along
This road with me
My yesterday won't have to be your way
If I knew
I'd try to change the world
I brought you to
Now there Isn't much more
That I can do
But I would If I could
If I could
