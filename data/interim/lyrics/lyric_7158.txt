Ain't it kinda funny now
Sometimes a fool never learns
Play with fire and it always burns
Don't it kinda get you now
You treat me worse than before
But I keep comin' back for more
'Cause you're a deceiver and I'm a believer
It's just a game, I know
But I can't seem to let go
So fool me, fool me one more time
You can fake just for old times' sake
Look in my eyes, tell me those lies
And just fool me, oh fool me one more time
Don't it make you wonder now
Why I'm playin' make-believe
You don't really think I'm that naive
Don't it make you sad now
I'm actin' like I've got it made
Even though it's just a masquerade
'Cause you're a deceiver and I'm a believer
It's just a game, I know
But I can't seem to let go
So fool me, fool me one more time
You can fake just for old times' sake
Look in my eyes, tell me those lies
And just fool me, oh fool me one more time
Baby, fool me one more time
Oh, fool me one more time
Fool me, fool me one more time
You can fake just for old times' sake
Look in my eyes, tell me those lies
And just fool me, oh fool me one more time
C'mon fool me one more time
Oh, fool me one more time
