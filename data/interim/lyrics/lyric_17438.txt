There's somethin' 'bout the way you talk to me, hahaha
Come on, So So Def
It's scary, I'm a subsidiary of So So Def 
Next to Jay D, this funkdafide, baby, keep 'em crazy
My mentality happen to be livin' lavish 
With formalities of havin' the fat shit 
My status is impeccable
We wreckin' your crew , the casualty is you 
Jagged Edge comin' through 
Remember who
Hit it, did it somethin' like a thousand times 
Can't stop, can't quit
Gotta, gotta get mine
Get yours
I catch you off guard, keep your dick hard 
Follow the yellow bitch to the road to riches 
And if the smoke thickens 
It's the B to B-R, detrimental to your brain
Chokin' off Mary Jane
A-T-Lanta insane
Came and kept it wetter than Niagra 
The main dame who maintain to stay platinum, yeah
Stay platinum, come on
We talkin', we touchin' you and your body 
We even talkin' 'bout you and your other guys
I like it when you tell me what you'd do if I was with you
I like it 'cause you have nothin' to hide
The way that you talk to me
The things that you say to me 
You got my body
Girl, have your way with me 
I'm tellin' you now
There's something about 
Girl, I can't live without 
The way you talk to me 
We talkin' 'bout dreams you have about you and I
You tell me things I did to you once I got up inside 
You make me look forward to the future
Wanna have a wife and kid
'Cause all the time that I been gettin' around
I never felt like this, yeah 
I know you know, baby , how much I love you 
I love you, you love me , and I know
Baby, I know
Woah-woah-woah 
Woah-woah-woah 
Yeah, when I call your name
It's all about the pu-punani-nani and more money
With me, pink bunny and the G, you just in the DJE era 
Chromed out carreras
Sex, booze and the non-stop flow with cheddar
Send me some Cristal, sippin' slow
You can send the Mo' back 
The type that walk up in the club screamin', "Where the hoes at?"
Tracks stay steamin', keepin' floors packed
Diamonds stay gleemin' and you're no match
For me and my faculty
Actually, all y'all whack to me
See we some some true playas with true rank
Don't give a damn what you think
Make a bet and I'll stop your bank, baby
You dress jiggy , body bomb-diggy 
Then it's a possiblity that you and I can get busy
What you wanna do? Shit
I got a pocket full of rubbers, and JE do too
The way that you talk to me 
The things that you say to me 
You got my body
Girl, have your way with me 
I'm tellin' you now
There's something about
Girl, I can't live without 
The way you talk to me 
Make you scream, "Papa," you the best, dada
Make you scream, "Papa," you the best, dada
Make you scream, "Papa," you the best, dada
