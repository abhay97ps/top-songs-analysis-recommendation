The same one you said you needed
The same one who needed you
That same one is lonely
Please mend the heart you've broken in two
The same one you played a game with
The same one who gave his all
That same one is begging
Completely at your beck and call
Although you're fickle-hearted
But darling, I will forgive
'Cause I knew the day we parted
Without you I could not live
The same one you played a game with
The same one who gave his all
That same one is waiting
Completely at your beck and call
The same one, the same one
The same one, the same one
I'm the same one
The same one, the same one
