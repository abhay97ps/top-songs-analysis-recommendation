The sun is out
The sky is blue
There's not a cloud to spoil the view
But it's raining
Raining in my heart
The weatherman says fine today
He doesn't know that you've gone away
And it's raining
Raining in my heart
Oh, oh misery
Oh misery
Oh what's gonna become of me? Oh oh
I tell myself
My blues won't show
But I know that soon all my tears will flow
Come a raining down
Raining in my heart
Oh, oh misery
Oh you misery
Oh what's gonna become of me? Oh
The sun is out
The sky is blue
There's not a cloud to spoil the view
But it's raining
Oh it's raining in my heart
