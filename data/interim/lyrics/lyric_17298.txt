Ooh
All of you ladies out there, turn up your radio
Girls, I'm about to tell you something, you may wanna know
You know things they're not always what they appear to be
And I don't want to happen to you, what happened to me
Listen
There are no words that can describe, what I felt inside
When I found out the man I loved, loved another guy
We were at a party, oh to have a little fun
But when I looked around my, my, my man was missing
I walked outside, I couldn't believe my eyes
He was in Bill's arms breathing hard and french kissing
I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill that was sleeping with my man
Bill has been to my house a thousand times
He and my man would go camping and fishing
Oh I tell you it never crossed my mind
Bill was a friend and he was god-uncle to my only son
Now it looks Uncle Billy wants to be his step-mom
Now you see I was ready for Mary, I was ready for Jane
How do a woman compete with a man for another man
I asked my man "Why didn't you tell me that you were gay?
When you knew, you knew I build my world around you"
And here's what he had to say
"I knew I had those feelings and I didn't want it to be
I thought by being with you, Girl I thought it would change me"
As tears came to my eyes, he says "I'm sorry I hurt you so
But I got to pack, Bill is waiting for me, and oh girl I've got to, I've got to go"
I was ready for Barbara, Kim, Betty and Jane
When all the time it was Bill that was sleeping with my man
I don't feel ashamed, oh and I don't take the blame
My man was just a queen, he was a queen that thought, that thought he was a king
He told before he left he said "I know you're hurt
Ooh, and oh I know, I know you're mad
But if that's not asking too much baby
Could you tell my son I love him and I'm still his dad"
I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill that was sleeping with my man
I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane 
When all the time it was Bill that was sleeping with my man
