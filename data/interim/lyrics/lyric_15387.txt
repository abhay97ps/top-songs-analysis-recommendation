You put me through pain
But the times are so good that its worth it
Its clear you've been giving your heart so gave you mine too
Yeah you've earned and deserved it
Yeah you been hella distant
I don't know if this is the time but i'm questioning if it's really me or him that you're missing
Fuck
It's hard cause I've been on the road
It's been kinda crazy I haven't been home
I must've been lazy but honestly it did not phase me when you didn't pick up the phone
You wanted more and more
You wanna hop on tour and more
You said my heart washed up on shore
You let me inside but my heart had to knock on the door Oh Well
You know that you're worth it
You're the queen of the of the Earth
I came to this bitch and I fucked up the crust, yeah I fucked up the surface
You my only girl and your body is perfect
But when I move cities, the distance too distant
The pics of your face being mixed with the bitches
You keep up with socials, you hear all the snippets
But how do I know if its me that you're missing
Fuck
It's a new type of feeling
I can't find the words
I can almost say freeing
You were never turned down
You so fucking different from all of the bitches I swerved
All of your time and your patients and courage
But all of the hoeing and crying and worries
I love you but honestly I cannot stand you
I don't know when to take you and kick to the curb Oh Well
You know that you're worth it
You're the queen of the of the Earth
I came to this bitch and I fucked up the crust, yeah I fucked up the surface
You my only girl and your body is perfect
But when I move cities, the distance too distant
The pics of your face being mixed with the bitches
You keep up with socials, you hear all the snippets
But how do I know if its me that you're missing
Fuck
We both know that since I got payed its been shaky
I don't have the time or the trust
And way too much distance for us to be faithfully dating
I definitely love you but don't have the time
I been stole your heart and you trynna steal mine
You don't have the life for the crime
You FaceTime me so I can look at your face
If its ringing ill only be looking at mine
You know that you're worth it
You're the queen of the of the Earth
I came to this bitch and I fucked up the crust, yeah I fucked up the surface
You my only girl and your body is perfect
But when I move cities, the distance too distant
The pics of your face being mixed with the bitches
You keep up with socials, you hear all the snippets
But how do I know if its me that you're missing
Fuck
