Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through
Someone's gonna pay for the things you do
How many hearts must break, how many is it gonna take
To satisfy you, just to satisfy you
Another love, another fool
To play your game
Another love, another fool
They're all the same
Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through
Someone's gonna pay for the things you do
You're gonna find when it's too late, a heart that just won't break
Just to satisfy you, just to satisfy you
How many hearts must break, how many will it take
To satisfy you, just to satisfy you
Just to satisfy you, satisfy you, to satisfy you
Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through
Someone's gonna pay for the things you do
Gonna find when it's too late, a heart that just won't break
To satisfy you, just to satisfy you
Just to satisfy you, satisfy you
To satisfy you
