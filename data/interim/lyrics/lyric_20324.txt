Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candyman, Candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Sweet sugar, Candyman
Hey, hey yeah, uh
I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really had me workin' up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothin' more dangerous than a boy with charm
He's a one-stop shop, makes the panties drop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman
Ooh yeah, yeah-eah
He took me to the Spider Club at Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise 
The gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline 
He's a one-stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman 
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman
Oh, shoo-bi-doo-dwee-da-bap
Shoo-bap, ba-doo-da-dwee-da-dum-bow, bow-bow
Hey hey yeah!
Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah, yeah!
Oh yeah, yeah, swee-dam-ba
He's a one-stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman 
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman
Oh whoa, yeah, yeah
Well, by now I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth, he really hit the spot
He had lips like sugar cane 
Good things come for boys who wait
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candyman, Candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Candyman, Candyman
He's a one-stop, gotcha hot, makin' all the panties drop
He's a one-stop, got me hot, making my  pop
He's a one-stop, get it while it's hot, baby, don't stop
He got those lips like sugar cane 
Good things come for boys who wait
He's a one-stop shop with a real big 
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman 
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman 
Sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman 
Sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman 
Candyman
Candyman
Candyman 
Candyman
Candyman, Candyman
Candyman, Candyman
Candyman, Candyman
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Jane lost her grip and a-down she fell
Squared herself away as she let out a yell
