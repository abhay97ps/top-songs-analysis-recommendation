There've been times in my life
I've been wondering why
Still, somehow I believed we'd always survive
Now, I'm not so sure you're waiting to hear
One good reason to try
But what more can I say
What's left to provide
You think that maybe it's over
Only if you want it to be
Are you gonna wait for a sign, your miracle?
Stand up and fight
 Make no mistake where you are
 Your back's to the corner
 Don't be a fool anymore
 The waiting is over
No room to run, no way to hide
No time for wonderin' why
It's here, the moment is now, about to decide
Let him believe
Leave him behind
But keep me near in your heart
Know whatever you do
I'm here by your side
You say that maybe it's over
Not if you don't want it to be
For once in your life
Here's your miracle
Stand up and fight
 Make no mistake where you are
 You're goin' no further
 Until it's over and done
Woah-oh-ho, woah-ahh
It's not up to me this time
Comes a day in every life
 Make no mistake where you are
 You're goin' no further
 Until it's over and done
 One way or another
 No one can tell what the future knows
 Your back's to the corner
 You make the choice of how it goes
 The waiting is over
 No one can tell what the future knows
 You're goin' no further
