Hey, little girl
I hear somebody broke your heart
I hear that he cheated and lied to you
Right from the start
But it's gonna be all right
Put on your red dress, tonight, yes
And I'll take you where the music's playing, baby
Take you where the lights are dim
Take you where the music's playing, baby
Little by little, I'm gonna help you forget about him
I've been your friend
But now is my opportunity
And I'm gonna show you
Just how good a friend can be
I know what he's put you through
But I'll make it all up to you, girl
And I'll take you where the music's playing, baby
Take you where the lights are dim
Take you where the music's playing, baby
Little by little, I'm gonna help you forget about him
They got red lights and green lights
Shining from the ceiling
I know, that you'll lose
That sad and lonely feeling
Oh, I'm gonna take you where the music's playing, baby
Take you where the lights are dim
Take you where the music's playing, baby
Little by little, I'm gonna help you forget about him
Take you where the music's playing, baby
Take you where the lights are dim
Take you where the music's playing, baby
