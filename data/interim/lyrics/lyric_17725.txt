Come on
Come and get this love 
So we can let it go 
Baby, you know - you can touch me with your love 
Let's go home and touch 
Miss your love so much 
Do anything - if you touch me with your love
Let me give you some sweet affection
Girl, ya know I hunger - for ya, for ya 
Don't be afraid of what you're feelin'
I can't say that I know - what you're - thinkin'
But one thing's for sure
Is when we're alone
It get's so damn inviting when you give me the night
You come for me
I came to you
It keeps me so inspired
'cuz I'll see you tonight - yeah
Come and get this love 
So we can let it go 
Baby, you know - you can touch me with your love 
Let's go home and touch 
Miss your love so much
Do anything - if you touch me with your love
To me you're somethin' kind of special
And girl ya got me dreamin' - I'm thinkin' - fienin' - for you
One smile from you, it takes my breath away
And I can't fight it - can't hide it - so excited
Like words to a song you're my sweet melody
Intoxicating and delighting - I'll be the comfort you need
If you feel the same
Then let me know
Girl, I just want you to understand that I'll never let you go
You and me 
Me and you 
And don't be afraid, no, no
Come and get this love
So we can let it go 
Baby, you know - you can touch me with your love
Let's go home and touch
Miss your love so much
Do anything - if you touch me with your love
Come and get this love 
So we can let it go 
Baby, you know - you can touch me with your love
Let's go home and touch 
Miss your love so much
Do anything - if you touch me with your love
Come and get this love
So we can let it go
Baby, you know - you can touch me with your love
Let's go home and touch
Miss your love so much
Do anything - if you touch me with your love 
Come and get this love
So we can let it go
Baby, you know - you can touch me with your love
