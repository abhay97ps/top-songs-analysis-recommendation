Hey there, lonely boy, lonely boy
Let me make your broken heart like new
Oh, my lonely boy, lonely boy
Don't you know this lonely girl loves you?
Every since she broke your heart
You seem so lost each time you pass my way
Oh, how I long to take your hand
And say "Don't cry, I'll kiss your tears away"
Hey there, lonely boy , lonely boy 
Let me make your broken heart like new
Oh, my lonely boy , lonely boy 
Don't you know this lonely girl loves you?
You think that only her two lips
Can kiss your lips and make your heart stand still
But once you're in my arms you'll see
No one can kiss your lips the way I will
Hey there, lonely boy , lonely boy 
Let me make your broken heart like new
Oh, my lonely boy , lonely boy 
Don't you know this lonely girl loves you?
Hey there, lonely boy 
Lonely boy 
Let me make your broken heart like new
Hey there, lonely boy 
Lonely boy 
Don't you know this lonely girl loves you?
Oh, my lonely boy , lonely boy 
Let me make your broken heart like new
My lonely boy , lonely boy
