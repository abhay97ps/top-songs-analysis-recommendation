I set to sea on a ship called Emptiness
Cast away on the Island of Loneliness
Lookin' for love
Ooh, and I was lookin' for love
I didn't think she could hear my S.O.S
But she appeared like an angel of tenderness
Sent from above
Oh, she was bringing me love
Oh, mama, she did it
Woh mama, she did it, yeah
Ooh, she did it
Woh mama, she did it, yeah
Looking back, making love was meaningless
Till she touched me with her warmth
And a gentleness I'd never known
Ooh, and she was guiding me home
Now I see all the things in life I missed
Till she opened up my eyes to the limitless
Wonder of love
Oh, and now I'm ready for love
Oh, mama, she did it
Woh mama, she did it, yeah
Ooh, she did it
Woh mama, she did it, yeah
I never knew what love was about
Till she came and stole away my heart
Now I'm alive and I know it
And all I ever wanna do is show it
Oh, mama, she did it
Woh mama, she did it, yeah
Ooh, she did it
Woh mama, she did it, yeah
