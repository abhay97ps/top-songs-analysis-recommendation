Okay, let's go, nigga
Wait a minute, who are you? 
I make it jump like, like crack in the '80s
Baby, these bitch ass niggas ain't crazy
Broke ass, ASCAP go straight to my baby
And I'll make my bitch talk to me when we fuckin' 
Big rocks on my wrist, I bust it 
Big Glock on my hip, I'm clutchin' 
Get lost on a bitch, ain't nothin'
She say I look good, bitch, I been doin' pushups
Play with Baby and Top, nigga, good luck
My lil' daughter two, but got six figures put up
Knock his head off his neck 'fore he look up
Ten toes in they chest for a check, bitch, I stood up 
I stood up on they neck for a check 
Now my head get 'em stressed, I'm a vet
I get 300K for a show, bitch, I'm blessed
Go to trippin' and buckin', them hoes get down
I spray it, I don't go no handles 
We be pullin' up back to back, play, we gon' handle that
I'ma walk in with Three and Montana
Go to buckin', won't wait for to touch him
He start it, you know he gon' get his shit canceled 
Put that stick to your face, screamin' out 4KTrey
From the north of Baton Rouge to Atlanta
Talk out his top, put them bands on him, bitch 
I be runnin' my city, the police don't like it
They know we be steppin' on shit 
Put that blick on your brother, you feelin' some way
Make him hot, tell him dig up the bitch 
Shoot two hundred, bet one, how you livin', lil' nigga?
You know I be havin' this shit 
Paranoid every day, I be feelin' some way
When you bring up the static and shit
Switch the channel, we fixin' that static 
Give a nigga a clip, he can have it
Get to hittin' so quick, they think it's automatic 
Nigga gon' try to hide in the house
Get his ass to come out, hit his bitch ass in traffic 
Made a song in ten minutes, went platinum
Know we still with the shits, send a hit, we get active 
Mention YB and Baby, the game in the padlock 
My lil' bitch got that ass with no waist, pretty face
A six-pack, niggas think she got ass shots
I hit her from the back 'til we pass out 
I Kurt Angle that ho, put her leg in the air, ankle lock
Hold that bitch 'til she tap out 
Be one deep on your street with that strap out 
Fuck a rapper, let's see what that rack 'bout
Got a brand new pistol, nigga
I make it jump like, like crack in the '80s
Baby, these bitch ass niggas ain't crazy
Broke ass, ASCAP go straight to my baby
And I'll make my bitch talk to me when we fuckin' 
Big rocks on my wrist, I bust it 
Big Glock on my hip, I'm clutchin' 
Get lost on a bitch, ain't nothin'
Mic check, one-two, check one, stretch two
When it come to murder, you know how we do
When I walk in this bitch, keep your hands to yourself
It go down, shoot it up, spin again in a coupe 
When you come to my house, you see everything new
You probably'll find a strap in every room
I went bought me a Rollie on top of this Patek
But, bitch, it ain't on, I'ma jump out with two
Shorty say she on me, yeah
We be on her ass soon as I walk in the room
Nigga don't know me, yeah, we be on his ass
Stalk him all through the day to the moon
Street nigga, I don't never pick and choose
I be totin' on somethin' make all them bitch niggas move 
Soon as we run down, we gon' dirt him
You know it ain't certain, we never be leavin' no clues, nigga
Hold on, I'm Lil Top, nigga, believe that
I make it jump like, like crack in the '80s
Baby, these bitch ass niggas ain't crazy
Broke ass, ASCAP go straight to my baby
And I'll make my bitch talk to me when we fuckin' 
Big rocks on my wrist, I bust it 
Big Glock on my hip, I'm clutchin' 
Get lost on a bitch, ain't nothin'
I make it jump like I'm Giannis 
Tryna see how it feel from behind her 
Know that lil' bitch ain't shit, don't deserve to suck dick
Make that bitch give me head with a condom 
Wanna gamble and crap out, let's get it
We put racks on his motherfuckin' cap like a fitted 
Baby pull up 2020, hop out like it's nothin'
That lil' nigga stuntin', he shittin' 
I get high by myself in the skybox 
I came out the house, two F&N's for the day 
Why you bring 'em both out? Nigga, why not? 
Let 'em go like a pro, let 'em try now 
I can't go like a ho, I'ma bond out 
Send my bro, up the score, let 'em find out 
Pick my boo up from school and we sign out 
Any ho that get rude gettin' timeout, talk to 'em, nigga
I make it jump like, like crack in the '80s
Baby, these bitch ass niggas ain't crazy
Broke ass, ASCAP go straight to my baby
And I'll make my bitch talk to me when we fuckin' 
Big rocks on my wrist, I bust it 
Big Glock on my hip, I'm clutchin' 
Get lost on a bitch, ain't nothin', bitch
Blame it on Baby, nigga, yeah
Blame it on motherfuckin' Baby, nigga, blame it on Baby, nigga
Blame it on Baby
Yeah, let's go
