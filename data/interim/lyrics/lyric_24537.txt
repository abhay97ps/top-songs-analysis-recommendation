Black shades , night clout

Strapped up but I'm iced down 
All white crib with the black tower

Four bad bitches on a white couch 
Last night, tried to pipe down 
Told her hol' up, let me put the pipe down 
Touchdown, I ain't even ate yet 
Serve it on a platter in a red dress 
Chinchilla, turn that bitch to Mona Lisa 
All she want to do is fuckin' hit the beach 
Sand from her toes out the Lambo 
Hit Turk Caicos for your sandals 
30 round clip for the wrong day 
Drivin' in the whip, up the wrong way
