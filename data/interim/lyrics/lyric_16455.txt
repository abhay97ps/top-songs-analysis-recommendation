I see him standing silhouetted in the lamplight
I cross the street and I quicken my pace
He cups his hands and he lights a cigarette
I find myself in the bones of his face
It's just the night in my veins
Oh, making me crawl in the dust again
It's just the night under my skin
Slipping it in
He's got his hands in my hair
And his lips everywhere
Oh yeah, it feels good, it's all right
Even if it's just the night in my veins
He's got me up against the back of a pick-up truck
Out of sight of the neon and glare
We might as well be on a beach under the moonlight
Love's language reads the same anywhere, yeah
It's just the night in my veins
Oh, making me crawl in the dust again
It's just the night under my skin
Slipping it in
He's got his chest on my back
Across a new Cadillac
Oh yeah, it feels good, it's all right
Even if it's just the night in my veins
Even if it's just the night in my veins, oh
I've got my head on the curb
And I can't produce a word
Oh yeah, it feels good, it's all right
Even if it's just the night in my veins
It feels good, it's all right
Even if it's just the night in my veins
Even if it's just the night in my veins
It feels good, it's all right
Even if it's just the night in my veins
Just the night in my veins
