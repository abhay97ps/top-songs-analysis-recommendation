Early in the mornin', up in Missoula
Was just about a quarter to four
Layin' on my bed, treatment in my head
There'd come a knock on my door
Before my eyes there was an angel
And I said "Won't you come inside? "
She said "I'm just seventeen" but she looked fine
"Just seventeen? Come on inside"
Way up in the mornin', up in Missoula
Wanna search for true on the floor
I was feelin' weak, 'bout to fall asleep
There'd come a knock on my door
Before my eyes there stood that angel
She said "Why don't you be mine? "
" 'Cause you're just seventeen" but she looks fine
"Just seventeen and that's a crime"
