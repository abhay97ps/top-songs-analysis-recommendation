Woke up this morning feelin' fine
There's something special on my mind
Last night I met a new girl in the neighborhood, whoa yeah
Something tells me I'm into something good
She's the kind of girl who's not too shy
And I can tell I'm her kind of guy
She danced close to me like I hoped she would
Something tells me I'm into something good
We only danced for a minute or two
But then she stuck close to me the whole night through
Can I be fallin' in love?
She's everything I've been dreamin' of
I walked her home and she held my hand
I knew it couldn't be just a one-night stand
So I asked to see her next week and she told me I could
Something tells me I'm into something good
I walked her home and she held my hand
I knew it couldn't be just a one-night stand
So I asked to see her next week and she told me I could
Something tells me I'm into something good
Something tells me I'm into something good
To something good, oh yeah, something good
To something good, something good, something good
