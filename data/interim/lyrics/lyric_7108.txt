Well, it's payday in America
Time to cut loose
Gonna cast that paycheck
Buy some liquor too
Hide out in some motel
I'm gonna get some drinkin' done
Well, it's payday in America
Knocking them back 'til Monday come
I'm so glad that it's Friday
Gonna hate my job
The last forty hours
Feels like I've been robbed
Go out and buy some reefers
Add a little spice to all this fun
Well, it's payday in America
Knocking them back 'til Monday come
All I need is a woman
Think I'll call up old Sue
You know I've had better
But way too few
Sure could use the company
And that girl likes to have fun
Well, it's payday in America
Knocking them back 'til Monday come
Come Monday I'm gonna wake up
All fuzzy in the head
It'll be check-out time
Gonna get sure out of that bed
Get myself together
Make it on time today all whole
Well, it's payday in America
Gonna get back to sellin' my soul
