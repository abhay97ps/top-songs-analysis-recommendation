It hurts to be in love when the only you love
Turns out to be someone who's not in love with you
It hurts to love and so when deep down inside you know
They will never want you no matter what you do
And so you cry a little bit 
Oh, I die a little bit 
Day and night, night and day, it hurts to be in love this way
How can long can I exist? Wanting lips I've never kissed?
You give all your kisses to everybody else
You think I'm just a friend, though it hurts I must pretend
The only way to keep you is keep you to myself
And so I cry a little bit 
Oh, I die a little bit 
Day and night, night and day, it hurts to be in love this way
And so I cry a little bit 
Oh, I die just a little bit 
Day and night, night and day, it hurts to be in love this way
It hurts to be in love, day and night, night and day
It hurts to be in love, night and day, day and night
It hurts to be in love, day and night, night and day
It hurts to be in love, day and night, night and day
