I think i’m in france
Money that stackin advance
I’m in Japan
The way that i shake up a can
She got a mans
Somehow she back here again
Somehow she back here again
Somehow she back here again
On a mission
Curvin bitches
They want mentions
Don’t grant wishes
Tell no difference
She on the hit list
I hit her once and i dip
Artichoke her out on this dick
She wanna gimme a kiss
She want my goddamn kids
Ooo nough of this shit
-need a city property on my wrist
-need a fire hydrant chain that gliss, gloss
Bitch i’m a boss
Don’t take a loss
-2 planks onna L das a cross
Shawty a fiend
I don't need you on the team
Don't mean to be mean
But I gotta get to the cheese
I'm gettin green
Promise it ain't what it seems
Was catchin a spark
But then it went dark
Cuz she was a hoe from the start
Was tryna go far
Said you off the bars
But you was out breakin a heart
But now I'm a star
I rock like guitars
And I stay on point like a dart
But I'm with the bro
We hot like a stove
We turnin the pain into art
Louis V supreme feel like I'm boolin
Very rare shawty know that I'm voolin
Pants foreign like Vladimir puton
I be gettin cake I'm gettin to it
Lyft cash but I swear I be zoomin
Best class sayin how do you do it ?
Got juice but I ain't feelin lucid
Gotta get it ain't no time to be losin
Livin in n out of cabs
Come in first you come in last
I'm just tryna get it fast
I hope that I never crash
Loser hit me with the pass
I don't got time gotta count my stacks
I be in the back with a mac mac with a dad cap wanna flex up in cruise down fax
Bitch I break shit like a rockstar
B-52s rock lobstar
V-22 Carry lost heart
Ship her ass out in a box cart
Want b-52s in the back yard
Fly yo ass out w a bomb charge
Snow bunny but it's not mericana
I be chillin on my own in cabana
