Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
And I'm not sorry 
It's human nature 
And I'm not sorry 
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me 
You wouldn't let me say the words I longed to say
You didn't want to see life through my eyes
You tried to shove me back inside your narrow room
And silence me with bitterness and lies
Did I say something wrong?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
Did I stay too long?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't speak my mind
And I'm not sorry 
It's human nature 
And I'm not sorry 
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me 
You punished me for telling you my fantasies
I'm breaking all the rules I didn't make
You took my words and made a trap for silly fools
You held me down and tried to make me break
Did I say something true?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
Did I have a point of view?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about you
And I'm not sorry 
It's human nature 
And I'm not sorry 
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me 
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Did I say something true?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
Did I have a point of view?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about you
And I'm not sorry 
It's human nature 
And I'm not sorry 
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me 
And I'm not sorry 
It's human nature 
And I'm not sorry 
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me 
And I'm not sorry 
It's human nature 
And I'm not sorry 
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me 
And I'm not sorry 
It's human nature 
And I'm not sorry 
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me
