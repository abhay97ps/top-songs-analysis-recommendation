Right on with the right on
You know mama
There's one thing everybody's got in common
Nobody wants to be alone
Because a man without a woman
Is just like lone ranger
Listen
Everybody
Needs some lovin
And everybody
Well babe
Wants some hugging
Someone to love you
And reassure you
When you're feeling bad
Well babe
A kind word will cure you
Nobody wants to be the lonely one
And I just want to be your one and only one
One and only one
One and only one
I don't want to be
No I don't
Like a lone ranger
Traveling through the world
Always a stranger
I don't need to be
Alone and blue
I just need to be
Real close to you
Nobody wants to be the lonely one
And I just want to be your one and only one
One and only one
One and only one
I don't want to be 
Like a lone ranger 
Traveling through the world 
Always a stranger 
I don't need to be 
Alone and blue 
I just need to be 
Close to you 
I am definitely not going to be no lone ranger baby
Riding out on no range with Tonto
Kimosabe, nothing
I am going to be close to you baby
