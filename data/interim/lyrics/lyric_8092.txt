Ooooooh...
My mind has been blown to bits
I was just about to call it quits
An everyday problem, I didn’t stand a prayer
And you came along, and hope was there
There have been times when I thought that I
Could tune right up and break down and cry
You gave me your hand, you made me stand
You said be a man, yes I know you can
And each and every day,  you never fail to say
With me always stay, please don’t go away
And in return you I never will, you know I never will
And yes I never will, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never, never let you go 
Never let oh, oh, oh 
Ne-ver! 
I’d count rain drops on a rainy day
Just to keep you girl from going away
I want you to understand I’d do whatever I can
Just to stay your man, I’m in love
‘Cause each and every day you never fail to say
With me always stay, please don’t go away
And in return you know I never will, you know I never will
You know I never, never, never, never, never, never
Never 
Never 
Never-never 
I’m gonna never, never, never, never-oooh 
Yeah-yeah
