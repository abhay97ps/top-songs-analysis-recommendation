Ooh baby
You couldn't have done a worse thing to me
If you'd have taken an arrow
And run it right through me, ooh
Ooh baby, a bird in the hand
Is worth two flying
But when it came to love
I knew you'd be lying
It could have been a finer fling
Would have been a major attraction
With no other thing
Offering a note of distraction
Come on, get up, get under way
And bring your love
Ooh baby
You wouldn't have found a more down hero
If you'd have started at nothing
And counted to zero
Ooh baby
You couldn't have done a worse thing to me
If you'd have taken an arrow
And run it right through me
It could have been a finer fling
Flying in a righter direction
With no other thing
Featuring but love and affection
Come on, get up, get under way
And bring your love
Ooh baby
You wouldn't have found a more down hero
If you'd have started at nothing
And counted to zero
