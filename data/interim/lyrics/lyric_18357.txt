I'm so sorry, I keep interrupting, what were you gonna say?
You caught him cheating, I don't blame you for walking away
I know where you're coming from, it sounds like where I've been
Oh, there I go interrupting your story once again
Go on, go on, you were saying how a fool can only fool you so long
It's true, it's so true when they do you like that
What else you can do but go on
Our conversation won't change nothing, but it's sure nice to talk
With somebody who's been cut out of the same ole' cloth
You know how you said happiness can't be found looking back
If you don't mind, maybe we can talk a little more about that
Go on, go on, you were saying how a fool can only fool you so long
It's true, it's so true when they do you like that
What else you can do but go on
Even when you see no reason to
Don't wait to live life 'cause it won't wait for you
Go on, go on, you were saying how a fool can only fool you so long
It's true, it's so true when they do you like that
What else you can do but go on
Just go on
Life goes on, and on
