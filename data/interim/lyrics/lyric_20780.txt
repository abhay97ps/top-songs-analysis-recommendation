The dance floor silly, the ladies gon' feel me
The fellas in the back and they twistin up a Phillie
Get silly  get silly  get silly  get silly 
Get silly  get silly  get silly  get silly 
[Chorus} * overlap
The dance floor silly, the ladies gon' feel me
The fellas in the back and they twistin up a Phillie
* Get silly  get silly  get silly  get silly 
The dance floor silly, the ladies gon' feel me
The fellas in the back and they twistin up a Phillie
* Get silly  get silly  get silly  get silly 
My chain too silly  my wrists too silly 
The girls throw me fish cause my rims Big Willie
My ride too silly  I ride too silly 
With four fantastic hoes cause I got a deal-ly
Cause now I'm worth a millie  forget a rubberband
Cause you can't put a rubberband around a bill-ion
I be wildin on a island somewhere just like Gilligan
Drillin hoes like a dentist then then then I fill her in
Ey back back back, I'm the man girlfriend
I'm the reason why you wanna lose your man girlfriend 
I'm calm like the sea  I'm blowed like the wind 
And now that I'm straight I'm 'bout to act a fool again
Get silly  get silly  get silly  get silly 
Get silly  get silly  get silly  get silly 
My shades too silly cause they made by cavalli
Jays so excited you can't find 'em lil' buddy
I'm not Nick Cannon but I'm "Wild'n Out" clubbin
Watchin everybody jockin while I'm poppin sum'n bubbly
Poppin sum'n bubbly, I'm tryin to do it big!
Da boy from the A, I'm tryin to represent!
Dem haters in my way, I play this game to win!
Watch me take it to the ally knock 'em all off like some pins
When I drop drop drop I'mma sell like silly
Cause everybody dancin and everybody feel me
With stacks in my jeans just like my name was billy
While I'm jockin on you haters just like I pop a wheelie
Get silly  get silly  get silly  get silly 
Get silly  get silly  get silly  get silly 
That's all y'all got! 
Y'all ain't even fightin back man
First Hurricane, then Soulja Boy
Then the African prince of Collipark, V.I.C. yup!
It's all over homey, Collipark homey
Soulja Boy! You snapped on the beat
You and Package Store snapped on the beat boy!
I'm tired of slappin these punks around
They bore me, ha ha
Yo yo yo
