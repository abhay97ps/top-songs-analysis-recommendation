I like it, I like it
To each his own
Give everybody a chance
To dig what they really want to
I know just the other day
I was telling my baby
About the things that I dig
I was saying
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout that la la la
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout that la la la
Crazy about that la la la
Yes, I can't do without that la la la
Well, it might mean fish and chips
May mean toast and jam
Mama, but you know what it means
And about what a fool I am 
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout that la la la
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout that la la la
Can't do without that la la la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Oh, well, no, now
It might be the way you kiss, uh
It turned me out like a hallway light
But you know what it means
And you know it makes me feel alright 
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, I'm
Crazy 'bout that la la la
Oh, baby, baby 
Crazy 'bout that la la
Can't do without that la la la la la la la la
I like it, I like it 
Oh, got a thing for that la la la, oh
Oh, got to have that la, la, la, yeah, yeah
Hoo, I need that la la la
Got to have it, baby
Hoo, got a thing for the la la la
My chance rings for the sha la la la
(Oh baby, I'm
Crazy 'bout that la la la)
Oh, now, baby, oh baby, now
(Oh baby, I'm
Crazy 'bout that la la la)
Oh, I got to have it
(Oh baby, I'm
Crazy 'bout that la la la)
Oh, baby, now, baby
(Oh baby, I'm
Crazy 'bout that la la la
Oh baby, I'm
Crazy 'bout that la la la
Oh baby, I'm
Crazy 'bout that la la la)
