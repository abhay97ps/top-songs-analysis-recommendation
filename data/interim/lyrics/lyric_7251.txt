These niggas ain't built to last 
You gotta be built for this
Born alone, die alone, you can't count on nobody but yourself
You're all you got out here, man
What proffered a man to gain the whole world?
It don't have control on his soul! Oh, God
You want to change from the way you've been livin'
It hasn't been easy for you
Prepare us, prepare us to walk the streets of Detroit
We don't need to go no place else
Oh, we can see you with the pots that ain't never seen the stove
If I don't scale this boat? If I sit on my bag
Then I'ma be flat broke
So I sit on my ass if I can get cashflow
So I be 'bout my bread, watchin' for task force
And SWAT on my Launchpad
And I'm back for more, Detroit's ambassador
Chancellor of the Ambassador Bridge
To Canada, in the back of that rig
Was some dust, cancerous enough to get us maximum bids
Lookin' at addin' a brig
I'm never satisfied, like my mammy, she said
"Jay, babe, just like your father, bold and cold"
It's Detroit, Michigan in December, sold my soul to the concrete
Devil in the blue dress got me doin' life in the ghetto so the music
That I write is for the ghetto-ous hoodlums
Tryna make a way out of no way
Down with heavyweight, tre four-way, John C. James' cousin
I pack pistols on that block boy tip
Boldy McNichols on some Lodge boy shit
Six Mile, Brick Mile, Southfield Freeway
I'm in that brick house on Archdale and PA
Across the street from that church
Across the street from where my work is
What do this cross mean on my Turkish? 
Why do I talk street with a slur?
Is it 'cause I'm from Detroit? Where you don't eat, you don't work
Got the fiends' mouths waterin' for a piece of dessert 
Beggin', "let me get a taste", you don't eat 'fore my thirst
Get quenched, 'til I clench tender, legal reserve 
Federal commissary notes 
Man, I'm tellin' you, I'm tired of sellin' dope
'Cause ain't shit worse than when you gotta sell this dope 
Gotta tote this mag 
If I don't scale this boat?
If I sit on my bag
Then I'ma be flat broke
So I sit on my ass
If I can get cashflow
So I be 'bout my bread
Watchin' for task force and SWAT on my Launchpad
'Cause I done got cash on all the blocks on the westside
Stood on every slab, caught a hot one and didn't die
Witnessed my mans get shot dead, and didn't cry 
Seen my folk get murdered, I was just eleven
They say it only get worse 'fore it get better
I pray it don't get worster than it been lately 
If it get any worse, dude, what's worse than crazy? 
Besides pistols when they shootin'
My street shit'll clink me in a mental institution
Been thinkin' how I think, man, I think I'm finna to lose it
Reachin' for my piece when I feel the slightest movements 
Or hear the slightest noise 
I'm off a Skittle and I'm 'noided
They got me 'noid but I ain't paranoid
Always feelin' like I'm bein' watched, paranoid
I can't sleep, I'm in the dope game, Nina Ross
Me and my girlfriend
I think these niggas and these bitches out to get me
Rise and fly, wanna leave me hangin' out to dry
Set me up for failure, just to let me down and die
When they need to dig deep down inside themselves, to find themselves
Instead of always tryna lose their lives, I read y'all
Negativity is what I feed off 
And relatively speaking, I think y'all niggas is a bunch of egotistical fake thugs with foolish pride
On McNichols, we crave blood
Can you rely on them goons that's with you? 
'Cause you and I, we can use them pistols
Will you survive? 'Cause I do's this shit, dude
You a lie, and the truth ain't in you
Get crucified, I'll shoot him and you
Mummify you like Snoop and Chris do
ConCreatures
Baby blocks 
King James
When I die, lay me face down in the fresh green grass
And tell the whole damn world to kiss my goddamn ass
