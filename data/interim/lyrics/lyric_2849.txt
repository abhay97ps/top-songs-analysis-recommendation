You by my side
That's how I see us
I close my eyes
And I can see us
We're on our way to say "I do-oo"
My secret dreams have all come true-oo
I see the church
I see the people
Your folks and mine happy but smiling
And I can hear sweet voices singing
Ave Maria
Oh my love, my love
This can really be
That some day you'll walk
Down the aisle with me
Let it be
Make it be
That I'm the one for you
I'll be yours
All yours
Now and forever
I see us now
Your hand in my hand
This is the hour
This is the moment
And I can hear sweet voices singing
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
