The ever winding stream
The ever blowing breeze
The ever shining stars
Over the ever growing trees
Those drifting clouds above us 
Never will outlive
Our everlasting love 
The ever whispering wind 
The ever rolling sea 
The shifting desert sand
Under the sun eternally
That endless sky high above 
Never will outlive
Our everlasting love 
My life was so wrong
Till you came along
And then with one kiss
You changed all the sadness
To joy and pleasure
So let the hands of time 
Keep ticking as they do 
They'll only find that I'm
That I'm still side by side with you
As long as there's a heaven above 
Never will outlive 
Our everlasting love 
Our everlasting love 
Our everlasting love
