I sat around much more today
I'm motivated but I really wanna stop
'Cause I know I'm full of my own shit
I'm hypocritical and I can't help it
I'm in a race and I keep on running
Didn't expect when I tripped on something
Burning and turning, living and learning
I didn't expect to feel
Anything even remotely real
Stretch and contracting, reflex reacting
What I put myself through
On the way to get to you, go!
I know there's not much more to say
I'll filibuster but I really wanna stop
'Cause I know I'm wasting my own breath
Much too lazy to fake my own death
So help me find out the easiest way
To waste away all the moments today
Burning and turning, living and learning
I didn't expect to feel
Anything even remotely real
Stretch and contracting, reflex reacting
What I put myself through
On the way to get to you
I always stumble on my own distractions
And the guest list says thirty plus one
Life goes on
Burning and turning, living and learning
I didn't expect to feel
Anything even remotely real
Stretch and contracting, reflex reacting
What I put myself through
On the way to get to you
What I put myself through
On the way to get to you
