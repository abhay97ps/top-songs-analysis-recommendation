Hah
Slide on it pimp game with my pinky ring
Lotta gang, lotta bitches, and a icy chain
Why you claim that you rich? That's a false claim
I be straight to the whip, no baggage claim
Whole lotta styles, can't even pronounce the name
You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram
I be rockin' it like it's fresh out the pan
Only when I'm takin' pics, I'm the middleman
Walk, talk it like a boss, I just lift a hand
Three million cash, call me Rain Man
Money like a shower, that's my rain dance
And we all in black, like it's Gangland
Say the wrong words, you be hangman
Watch me stick to your bitch like a spray tan
Aw, Mr. What-Kind-of-Car-He-In?

Yeah, that's cool, but he ain't like me
Lotta girls like me, niggas wanna fight me
Nigga, get your ass checked like a fuckin' Nike
Me not icy, that's unlikely
And she gon' suck me like a fuckin' Hi-C
Aw, chains on the neck for the whole team
And I feel like Gucci with the ice cream
And my bitch want the Fenty, not the Maybelline
I'm the black JB, the way these bitches scream
Make these bitches scream
Ah, pretty little thing
Like my nigga A.E.
Say, "Yadadadamean"

Diamond ice glacier, niggas imitate 
Ayy, ayy, feed me grapes, Maybach with the drake 
Slow pace in the Wraith, got this shit from bae 
Diamonds up to par , the cookie hittin' hard 
The 'Rari sit in park , on Addy on Mars 
Shotgun shells, we gon' always hit the target 
Popcorn, big shell poppin' out the cartridge 
3400 Nawfside, Charles Barkley 
4-8-8, Ferrari 
Make her get on top of me and ride me like a Harley 
She wanna keep me company and never wan' depart me, depart me 
Yeah, fishtail in the parking lot 
I don't kick it with these niggas 'cause they talk about ya 
Yeah, and I got the fire, don't make me spark it out ya 
Yeah, keep it in my back pocket like it's a wallet 
Like the way she suck it, suck it like a Jolly 
Stack it up and put it with the whole project 
And she got that Patek on water moccasin 
I'm rich in real life, I get that profit, copy
