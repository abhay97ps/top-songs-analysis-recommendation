Oh mammy
Oh mammy, mammy blue
Mammy blue
Oh mammy
Oh mammy, mammy blue
My mammy blue
Now maybe our forgotten son
Who wandered off at twenty one
It's sad to find myself at home
Why don't you, come on around now
If I could only hold your hand
And say I'm sorry yes I am
I'm sure you'd really understand
Oh where are you now, yeah
Oh mammy
Oh mammy, mammy blue
My mammy blue
Oh mammy
Oh mammy, mammy blue
My mammy blue, hey c'mon
Oh mammy
Oh mammy, mammy blue
My mammy blue
Oh mammy
Oh mammy, mammy blue
My mammy blue
The house we set up on the hill
It's life is standing standing still
And memories of my childhood
Left in my mind
I've been through all walks of life
I've seen, tired desert lonely nights 
And now without you by my side
How, will I survive
Oh mammy
Oh mammy, mammy blue
My mammy blue
Oh mammy
Oh mammy, mammy blue
My mammy blue
Woah yeah
Oh Yeah
Aw mammy blue
Oh Yeah
Woah yeah
Ah mammy blue. c'mon
Oh Yeah
Woah yeah
Oh mammy blue
Oh Yeah
Woah yeah yeah
Oh my mammy blue
A c'mon a blue a blue now
