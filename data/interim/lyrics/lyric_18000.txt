Can I play for you, baby?
Ayo Woody, help me out
Yeah, ayo Jazz, you chill for a minute
You like that?
Let me sing this song for you
Listen
Last night we had an argument
Afterwards I'm feeling pretty bent
Then I took a drink and I didn't think
What was in store for me
So I wrote a letter
Dropped it on the bedroom floor
I never felt this way before
So I grabbed my coat and closed the door
Baby, I'm sorry
 Oh yeah
Will you forgive me?
Oh yeah, and let me be your only one
'Cause you are
You are everything
I would give you anything
Sorry for what I've done
Wanna be your only one
Girl, I apologize
For all the tears I made you cry
Sorry for what I've done
Wanna be your only one
Girl, I apologize
For all the tears and all the lies
And if by chance, just one more chance
I swear I'll be the epitome of a good man
Baby, I'm sorry 
Sorry for what I've done 
Will you forgive me?
You are everything
I would give you anything
Sorry for what I've done
Wanna be your only one
Girl, I apologize
For all the tears I made you cry
Sorry for what I've done
Wanna be your only one
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
Girl, you're everything I do
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
Girl, you're everything I do
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
Girl, you're everything I do
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
Girl, you're everything I do
You are everything
I would give you anything
Sorry for what I've done
Wanna be your only one
Girl, I apologize
For all the tears I made you cry
Sorry for what I've done
Wanna be your only one
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
