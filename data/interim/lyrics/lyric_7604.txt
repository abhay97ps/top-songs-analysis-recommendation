Second Street and Broadway
Sitting in a door way
Head held in his hands
Looked to all the world
Like he was prayin', oh nah
Foot wrapped in an old rag
Bottle in a brown bag
I saw him try to stand
Then I heard the words
That he was sayin'
And he said come on Carrie
Carry me a little farther
Come on Carrie
Carry me one more mile
I don't know where it's leading to
But I know I can make it
If I lean on you, so
Come on Carrie
Carry me a little
I carried you
Now carry me a little
Come on Carrie
Carry me a little while
Well he struggled to his feet
And staggered down the street
To the window of the five-and-dime
He stood and laughed a while
At his reflection, yeah nah
And then I heard him shoutin'
Something about a mountain
He could surely climb
If she was only there to point
The right direction
But she ain't no
But she ain't no
He said come on Carrie
Carry me a little farther
Come on Carrie
Carry me one more mile
I don't know where it's leading to
But I know I can make it
If I lean on you
So come on Carrie
Carry me a little
I carried you
Now carry me a little
Come on Carrie
Carry me a little while
Ah yeah
Carry me Carrie
You got to carry me
Carry me!
Yes! oh
Ah yeah
Carry me Carrie
Carry, carry me
Carry me
Carry me, carry me
C-c-c-Carrie
C-c-c-carry me
I carried you
Carry me Carrie
You carry me
Carry me Carrie
Ah yeah
You got to carry me
C-c-Carrie
C-c-carry me!
