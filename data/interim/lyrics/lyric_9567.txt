So sad the song of
To end two lives
When that moment of truth
Suddenly arrives
And so sad the song
Of what might have been
You see a lifetime of dreams
Scattered in the wind
Together
We belong together
Never was that one lovely word
Easier to say
And so sad the song
Of just remembering when
Knowing the love of your our life
Will never come again
So sad the song
That says goodbye
Together
We belong together
And now that you are
Of that you can rely
So would it be wrong
To give our love
Just one more try
So sad the song
That says goodbye
That says goodbye
