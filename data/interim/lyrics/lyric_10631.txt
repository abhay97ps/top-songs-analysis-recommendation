INT. NIGHT. BURKE’S OFFICE
The silhouette of a woman marks the window of Arthur "Artie"
Burke’s office. It grows larger as she approaches. She opens
the door and enters the spacious room. The woman, Dominique,
faces Burke, who has just finished pouring the second of two
drinks on his desk. He glances up at her with a cool
expression
BURKE
You bring the snapshots?
DOMINIQUE
You bring the cash?
BURKE
That’s what I’ve always admired
about you, Dominique. Your candor.
It becomes you.
Dominique pulls up a chair in front of the desk and sets an
envelope upon the desk. He lights a cigarette and offers her
one. She takes it with a wry smile on her crimson lips.
DOMINIQUE
I wish I could say the same about
you, Artie.
Burke scoffs, half-serious.
BURKE
You wound me, baby. You have the
gumption to blackmail me with
incendiary photographs, and I
graciously choose to parley with
you rather than attract the
unwanted attention of the
authorities. I’ve even chosen to
extend the complementary courtesy
of offering you a glass of
Belvedere when I should be throwing
it in your face.
DOMINIQUE
You know I don’t like vodka, Artie.
And after all, no one forced you to
fuck a woman who wasn’t your wife.
BURKE
Such vulgarity.
CONTINUED: 2.
DOMINIQUE
Well you know the phrase, do unto
others...
BURKE
Yeah, yeah, save me the sermon.
Tell me, sweetheart, how did you,
my humble secretary for all these
years, manage to acquire the skills
necessary to capture these pics?
DOMINIQUE
I didn’t snap the shots. A good
friend of mine happens to be a
private detective and has been kind
enough to offer her services.
BURKE
"Her"? This dame got a name?
DOMINIQUE
Sure she does.
BURKE
Well?
DOMINIQUE
Oh, Artie, let’s not trouble
ourselves with the particulars. I
came here to collect, and then
we’ll both be out of each others’
hairs forever.
BURKE
All right, fair enough. But will
you at least treat me with a
modicum of respect by sharing a
drink with me?
DOMINIQUE
Why should I, Artie, when you’ve
treated me like nothing but your
little lap dog?
A tense silence descends for a moment.
DOMINIQUE
Oh, what the hell?
She reaches towards the glass that is nearest her. She
stands and walks towards the window, and he follows her.
They stand close together, barely a few inches from each
other.
CONTINUED: 3.
BURKE
I just hope we made some great
poses for those pictures of yours.
DOMINIQUE
Oh, Artie, you always had a
charming sense of humor.
BURKE
Only for the women nearest and
dearest to me. Cheers, sweetheart.
They raise their glasses. She pauses before putting the
glass to her lips, and Burke pauses in kind, staring
intently at her. Dominique smiles, then laughs softly. Burke
laughs as well, though with a touch of uncertainty. As she
continues laughing, Dominique proceeds to methodically pour
her drink onto Burke’s shoes. He recoils.
BURKE
Jesus! Do you know how much these
cost me, you--
DOMINIQUE
Oh, I’m so sorry! Poor, gullible
Artie. You think I didn’t see the
poison in your front pocket?
His rage is replaced by shock. She has a triumphant glean in
her eye.
DOMINIQUE
That’s why we’re incompatible,
baby. I’m quietly observant and
you’re too stupidly arrogant to
realize when somebody’s about to
take something you value and
destroy it. But it’s the least you
deserve, you weak, little pansy.
Burke is dumbfound for a moment, and looks down at his
shoes. Then he looks at Dominique and pulls out the bottle
of poison like a guilty kid who has smuggled candy into the
classroom. He walks towards her as he sets the bottle upon
his desk. He stands close to her once more.
BURKE
You always were a smart cookie,
Dominique. Then I’ll bet you know
exactly what’s in my other pocket.
In a flash he pulls out a previously concealed knife and
stabs her in the gut. She cries out, but he grasps her and

tries to drag her away from the window. She elbows him
harshly in the stomach and stumbles towards the blinds and
pulls them open. He rips her from the window and stabs her
twice more until she finally stops moving. He holds her in
his left arm and wields the knife in the other hand. He
drops her body like a sack of flour, breathing heavily, and
snatches the envelope she brought with her. He opens it,
only to find -- a tape recorder. He looks confused, then
presses the play button. Dominque’s voice emanates from the
machine.
DOMINIQUE
Say cheese, Artie.
He glances around, panicked, then looks out the window. The
image of him framed in the window transitions to a newspaper
headline: Tycoon caught in murderous act
