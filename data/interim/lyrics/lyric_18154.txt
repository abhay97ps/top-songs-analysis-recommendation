No more rain in this cloud
No more rain in this cloud
My sunshine has come and I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
My sunshine has come 
 And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud 
There's no hiding place
When someone has hurt you
It's written on your face and it reads
"Broken spirit, lost and confused
Empty, scared, used and abused, a fool, oh"
Ain't it funny that the way you feel shows on your face?
And the smile you used to wear
Seems a little bit out of place 
People, oh, hold on, in time
It gets a little better, oh yeah
My sunshine has come 
 And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
My sunshine has come and I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
So you want to live and to you I shall give
All the space that you requested
Hope you don't live to regret it
So you say you're in your prime
Baby, don't waste your time 
Remember my love 
It's only a thin line 
My sunshine has come 
 And I'm all cried out 
And there's no more rain in this cloud 
My sunshine has come 
And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
Spring has come and winter's gone, my love
But don't look around for me, child
I'll be gone, gone, gone, gone
 Not afraid 
Because the seasons have changed
I'm gonna count my blessings 
And just follow the sun 'cause you see
My sunshine has come
And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
My sunshine has come 
And I'm all cried out 
And there's no more rain in this cloud
Baby, don't want tear drops
Drying upon my pillow
Only room for raindrops 
Don't belong on my smile 
And there's no more rain in this cloud
Baby, don't want tear drops
Drying upon my pillow 
Only room for raindrops
Don't belong on my smile 
 And there's no more rain in this cloud
My sunshine has come 
 And I'm all cried out 
 And there's no more rain in this cloud
My sunshine has come 
 And I'm all cried out 
 And there's no more rain in this cloud
