Sit down awhile
My mother said one day
And this is what she had to say
What are you gonna do, child
With those tears in your eyes
 no use trying to tell yourself
 that you don't love the girl
Take it for what it's worth
Go to the end of the Earth
You can run, run, run but
Oh, you can't hide from love
What are you gonna say, child
When your heartaches won't go
 you can't tell love to go
 and come back another day
Try to leave it behind
Well, she's still on your mind
Run, run, run but you
Can't hide from love
Love is too wide
You can't get around it
It's too high
You can't get over it
Oh, no, you can't get over it
So what are you
Gonna do now, child
You still love her so
 what were you
Thinking of, little boy 
When you let the little girl go
You're gonna find out one day
There is no hiding place
Run, run, run but you
Can't hide from love
Oh, run 
But you can't hide
Love will be by your side
'Cause wherever you go
She will be there I know
