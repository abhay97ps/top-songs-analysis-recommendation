¿Cómo puede ser verdad?
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
Yo quiero estar donde el sol toca cielo
Cuando es hora de siesta tú los puedes ver pasar
Caras tan bellas, sin importar nada
Where a girl loves a boy
And a boy
Loves a girl 
The Spanish lullaby 
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro 
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita 
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring trough my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby 
A na na na na na na na 
Ooh
Yeah...
La la la la la la
Él dijo que te ama
Ay-yeah, yeah! 
La Isla Bonita
La Isla Bonita
Bonita, bonita
Your Spanish lullaby
