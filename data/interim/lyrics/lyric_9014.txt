Who who who
Who can fly my heart like a bamboo kite
Make it twirl and gyrate just like a gyro delight
Only you can oh oh oh oh oh only you
Who who who
Who can see as far as an eagle bird
See right through my head through my every word
Only you can oh oh oh oh oh only you
Only you have a right to me you oh oh oh
Only you come home every night every night
Eh heh yeah
Who can strum a tune by the light of the moon
Make me love like you do in the afternoon
Only you can oh oh oh oh oh only you
Who who who
Chick a tar mi daw ma taya chick a tar mi daw
Chick a tar mi daw ma taya chick a tar mi daw
Only you can oh oh oh oh oh only you
Only you have a right to me you oh oh oh
Only you come home every night every night
Eh heh yeah
Who can strum a tune by the light of the moon
Make me love like you do in the afternoon
Only you can oh oh oh oh oh only you
Only you can make me fly
Only you can make me sigh
Only you can make me swoon
Only you my sweet buffoon
Only you can make me cry
Only you can make me sigh
