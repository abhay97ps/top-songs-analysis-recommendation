Honey, I've been thinking about you
All that you do
Don't you think of me, too?
Baby, where you been for so long?
I don't mean you no harm
Had to write you this song
Well I long to be alone with you
And If I couldn't have you I don't know what I would do
Guess I would leave this world alone
Without you I'm just bones
Well, I dream of you so much
Love you so much
But thoughts aren't enough
Well, I speak only of you
So what else is new?
What am I to do?
Well I long to be alone with you
And If I couldn't have you I don't know what I would do
Guess I would leave this world alone
Without you I'm just bones
Days go more and more I see
That your love is all my soul needs
Nut you're gone and now I'm fallen'
Fallin' to my knees
Well, I long to be alone with you
And I I couldn't have you I don't know what I would do
Well I long to be alone with you
And If I couldn't have you I don't know what I would do
Guess I would leave this world alone
Without you I'm just bones
