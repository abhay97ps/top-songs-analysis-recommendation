Keep on running, keep on hiding
One fine day I'm gonna be the one
To make you understand
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be your man
Keep on running, running from my arms
One fine day I'm gonna be the one
To make you understand
Oh yeah, I'm gonna be your man
Hey, hey, hey
Everyone is talking about me
It makes me feel so bad
Hey, hey, hey
Everyone is laughing at me
It makes me feel so sad
So keep on running
Keep on running, running from my arms
One fine day I'm gonna be the one
To make you understand
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be your man
Hey, hey, hey
Everyone is talking about me
It makes me feel so sad
Hey, hey, hey
Everyone is laughing at me
It makes me feel so bad
So keep on running
Keep on running, running from my arms
One fine day I'm gonna be the one
To make you understand
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be your man
It makes me feel so good
I wanna be your man
Oh right cmon baby
I know you make me feel so good
You make me wanna show baby
