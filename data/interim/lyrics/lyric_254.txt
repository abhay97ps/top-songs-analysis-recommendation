When I first laid eyes on you
I got the urrrge to hold you
And the way you move your lips
I got the urrrge to kiss you
Every single little movement
Filled my heart with desire
Sends electric current through me
Like a forest fire
I got the urrrge, whoa, to love you
Now, baby, turn the lights down low
I got the urrrge to hug you
Snuggle tighter in my arms
I got the urrrge to squeeze you
Be my lovin' doll forever
Let me carry you home
'Cause I got a mind to marry you
And make you my own
I got the urrrge, whoa, to love you
Well, the way I feel for you 
Scares me half to death 
I have to count down
Just to catch my breath
I'm countin' ten 
Eight  six 
Four  two, one
 I got the urge
 I got the urge
 I got the urge
 I got the urrrge, whoa, to love you
Yeah, whoa
Well, the way I feel for you 
Scares me half to death 
I have to count down
Just to catch my breath
I'm countin' ten 
Eight  six 
Four  two, one
 I got the urge
 I got the urge
 I got the urge
 I got the urrrge, whoa, to love you
Yeah, move it
