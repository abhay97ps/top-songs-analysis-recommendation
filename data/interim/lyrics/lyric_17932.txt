You call and wake me up, the way you always do
Say you miss me and you're sorry, déjà vu
You push the button in the heart you know so well
The wall starts coming down then I remind myself
Everytime I think you might have changed
Put aside the anger and the blame
Make myself believe that there's a way to work it out
Everytime you say let's try again
Begging me to let you back in
Everytime I do, everytime you lie, everytime I cry
If only promises could just erase the past
I could open up my heart enough to take you back
But we've been down that road time and time again
I've learned the hard way how the story always ends
Everytime I think you might have changed
Put aside the anger and the blame
Make myself believe that there's a way to work it out
Everytime you say let's try again
Begging me to let you back in
Everytime I do, everytime you lie, everytime I cry
Everytime I think you might have changed
Put aside the anger and the blame
Make myself believe that there's a way to work it out
Everytime you say let's try again
Begging me to let you back in
Everytime I do, everytime you lie, everytime I cry
Everytime I do, everytime you lie, everytime I cry
