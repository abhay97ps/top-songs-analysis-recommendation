I can't stop loving you
I know you still feel it too
So now the question is what will we do
If you want suggestions I have a few
We could get back together
I think this time it would be better
But hold on let me check I the weather
Hell hasn't frozen over I though i was clever
I would avoid all the drama
So there'd be nothing bad to tell your mama
Just that when I sleep I don't wear pajamas
And that I want to take you to the fucking Bahamas's
Just can't keep hanging on
We used to be banging til dawn
She looks like she was drawn
Most think she's from Iran
Eric Hammer the don
Artistic phenomenon
I would keep an Eye on
Me you can rely on
Girl my bed you can lie on
Just don't spy on
Me she said right on
Magic carpet we fly on
Want a girl from Taiwan
That doesn't need a
Shoulder to cry on
And fucks with the light on
Every day's the right day to die on
This is a track you can vibe on
What's the best way
To change a life today
After you finish
They shouldn't know what to say
She said wait
I said hey
Chinese zodiac dog
But i don't stay
Taurus the bull
I don't play
Waiting for a girl
That's tells me to shave
To those type of things
I behave
Girl I'm just sayin
I'm here to answer your prayin
So just quit playin
My heart you're sprainin
Don't you dare think that I'm surprised
That I'm the number one person you despise
But there's one thing I need you to realize
I removed your disguise
Save me from myself
This problem won't fix itself
Only time will tell
That you felt what I felt
We would never yell
But I guess I wasn't good enough
Oh well
I make impressions you remember
I'll be stacking by December
Dunking on every defender
Exposing every pretender
To my friends I'm a lender
To you I'm a spender
At the end of the show I smash a fender
My bro said your hoes here I said send her
Inside
Ride or die
Look me in my eyes
And tell me why
I'm your guy
And why you're mine
Sun don't shine
When you lie
I gave you all of me
I wonder why personally
Because we weren't meant to be
I wish I could make you see
That we were the best
Montague to your capulet
The best is yet
To come that you can bet
My resume you can check
Girl I know I'm a wreck
But I got the flows on deck
Floors all swept
This place looks kept
I under slept
I'll always remember
The times she wept
My love she didn't accept
I can't stop loving you
I know you still feel it too
So now the question is what will we do
If you want suggestions I have a few
We could get back together
I think this time it would be better
But hold on let me check I the weather
Hell hasn't frozen over I though i was clever
