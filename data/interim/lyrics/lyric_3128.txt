Hear the happy feet dancing to the beat of the Freddie 
Put a guy in front make a line in back then you're ready 
Kick your feet up swing your arms up too
Move your head both ways like you see me do
Then jump three feet to the swinging beat
Do the Freddie  Do the Freddie 
It's an easy dance give yourself a chance
Dance the Freddie 
It's the thing to do kids will envy you
So do the Freddie  [high pitched maniacial laughter follows)
Kick your feet up swing your arms up too
Move your head both ways like you see me do
Then jump three feet to the swinging beat
Do the Freddie  Do the Freddie 
Wow! 
Kick your feet up swing your arms up too
Move your head both ways like you see me do
Then jump three feet to the swinging beat
Do the Freddie  Do the Freddie 
Dance the Freddie Dance the Freddie
