Turn around
And you'll find
The girl you left behind
Turn around
And I'll be there
Would it be such a crime
To love me one more time?
Baby, I, but I don't care
I always thought that
When I found you
That I would always be around you
I guess it goes to show
How wrong a girl can be
When you said goodbye to me
I will go anywhere with you
Call my name
And I'll be there
Say the word
And I'll pack my bags tonight
I'll go anywhere
If you are there
No, I'm not the kind
To try to change your mind
If I thought that I were wrong
I know that I could
Make you happy
And I know that you could love me, too
I know that I could find
A million reasons why
Just don't say goodbye to me
I will go anywhere with you
Call my name
And I'll be there
Say the word
And I'll pack my bags tonight
I'll go anywhere
If you are there
Turn around
I know that I could
Make you happy
And I know that you could love me, too
I know that I could find
A million reasons why
Just don't say goodbye to me
I will go anywhere with you
Call my name
And I'll be there
Say the word
And I'll pack my bags tonight
I'll go anywhere
If you are there
I will go anywhere with you
Call my name
And I'll be there
I will go anywhere with you
Call my name
And I'll be there
I will go anywhere with you
Call my name
And I'll be there
