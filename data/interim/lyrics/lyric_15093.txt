Bang bang!
It was a warm night on the south side of town
They said they'd seen you
You were sneakin' around with a stranger
Girl, these rumors are drivin' me mad
All my good friends turn their face to the wall
When they see me
What the hell's goin' on? Am I so blind
That I can't see when I'm being had?
I know it's silly, but, girl, I really
Thought we had a chance
I must've been crazy!
Chorus:
Bang bang, what's that sound?
I gave you my love and you shot me down
Bang bang, you're so cool
Playin' a game, someday you're gonna lose
Bang bang!
Girl, you told me you were not like the rest
Then you showed me, now you're failing your test
It was easy, just an urge in the heat of the night
I believed you, now that's all in the past
'Cause I made some mistakes, but I'm learnin' fast
Never put your heart on the line
Never put your heart on the line
I know it's silly, but, girl, I really
Thought we had a chance
I must've been crazy!
Bang bang, what's that sound?
I gave you my love and you shot me down
Bang bang, you're so cool
Playin' a game, someday you're gonna lose
Bang bang, what's that sound?
I gave you my love and you shot me down
Bang bang, you're so cool
Playin' a game, someday you're gonna lose
Bang bang, what's that sound?
I gave you my love and you shot me down
Bang bang, you're so cool
Playin' a game, someday you're gonna lose
Bang bang, what's that sound?
I gave you my love and you shot me down
Bang bang, you're so cool
Playin' a game, someday you're gonna lose
Bang bang!
You shot me down 
Bang bang!
Bang bang!
You shot me down 
Bang bang!
