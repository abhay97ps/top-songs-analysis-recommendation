Plus I am the wizard that gave you your heart so
I bust a few shots off all ya get still

Never wanted problems it wasn't necessary
But I'm a bury niggas quick fast in a hurry
These fuckers think I'm something sweet because I love the women
Ok these niggas want problems its problems that I'm giving
The crack started us off the hook and don't look for trouble
This lifestyle I live it we give it to you double

Watch how you talk, watch where you walk nigga
These jumps wear their steak suits so lets eat 'em up
They ain't worth it because I let our bitches beat 'em up
Fuck the star shit I'm up in the bar with
Cast a hustle of the prove we got muscle man
Before you haters out there that can't see me
Mad because your girlfriend bump my CD
Your read easy live with your corny stash
Or get gun up when we run up on your corny ass
Back up off us nigga you the softest
Actin like you sold crack with coppers and officers
Flash back shell-toe thick strings and jewelery
RIP to Freaky-Tah Mike and Cooly-B
I keeps a Yankee fitted on tracks is spitted on

Its never hate believe me its strictly fact yo
Your corny rap flow match your corny rap show
Shine ahead niggas time to get niggas
How y'all coming with that bullshit you spit niggas
Take a time out you really not moving nothing
Killing me with your fronting like your moving something
To them so called friends of mine that gayed out
You niggas played out I'm glad you niggas stayed out
Fuck the crab shit the best of friends is living well
I know you niggas see me doing me I'm giving hell
Pass the mic crew never did like you
Getting comfortable niggas ain't invite you
You lame niggas I'm as hot as a flame niggas
You know why I'm in this game niggas
This cowards walking with a complex here
We drop him so quick we from the crib to the film set
Ain't nothing new about the soul or new about your flow
If you want your stripes you got to earn them yo
This goes out to you and you and you
And if you feel it in your heart yo it must be true
Walk how you walk and do what you do
Live while you live we're the proof so we're supposed to
