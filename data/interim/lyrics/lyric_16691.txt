They call you mr personality because you so ugly
They call you mr personality because you so ugly
You so ugly
Mr personality, you so ugly
Mr personality, you so ugly
Mr personality, you so ugly
When i look at you i go outta my mind
Its like im lookin at someones behind
You make the children scream and babys cry
With your crusty teeth and your bloodshot eyes
You so ugly, your dad hadda tie a porkchop around your neck just to get the dog to play witcha
Ooh thats ugly
CHORUS
They call you mr personality because you so ugly...you so ugly
They call you mr personality because you so ugly...you so ugly
Mr personality, you so ugly
Mr personality, you so ugly
Mr personality, you so ugly
No matter what you wear, your face doesnt match
I dont think you were born, you hadda be hatched
Everyone you meet gets one hell of a stare
They can't fall asleep cause your a walking nightmare
You so ugly...i heard that when you were born, the dr slapped yo momma
Ooh man thats ugly
CHORUS
You make frankenstein look like johnny depp
And when you cross the street you cause a major car wreck
You asked my grandma if she needed help with her bags
Ive never seen an old lady run so fast
Geez look at those glasses...are those coke bottles or something?
Is that your face...or did your neck throw up something?
CHORUS
You so ugly
