You'll never lose me
I'll always be true
And I'll never stop wanting you
I'll stand beside you
When your dreams fall through
And I'll never stop wanting you
Your kiss will always thrill me
In the same old way
Your touch will mean as much
Tomorrow as it does today
So don't worry, baby
Whatever you do
'Cause I'll never stop wanting you
Your kiss will always thrill me
In the same old way
Your touch will mean as much
Tomorrow as it does today
So don't worry, baby
Whatever you do
'Cause I'll never stop
No, I'll never stop
No, I'll never stop wanting you
