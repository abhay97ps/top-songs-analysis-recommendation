All the things I felt and never shared
All the times she was lonely with me there
Tears I wouldn't let fall from my eyes
And how I let her go without a fight
The reasons I`m alone I know by heart
But I don`t want ti spend forever in the dark
I swear next time I`ll hang on for dear life
If love ever gives me another try
There is no changing things that we regret
The best that we can hope for is one more chance
If the hands of time could just move in reverse
I wouldn't make the same mistake again with her
The reasons I`m alone I know by heart
But I don`t want ti spend forever in the dark
I swear next time I`ll hang on for dear life
If love ever gives me another try
The reasons I`m alone I know by heart
But I don`t want ti spend forever in the dark
I swear next time I`ll hang on for dear life
If love ever gives me another try
Oh if love ever gives me another try
