With the child's Heart
Go face the worries of the day
With the child's heart
Turn each problem into play
No need to worry, no need to fear
Just being alive makes it all so very clear
With the child's heart
Nothing can ever get you down
With a child's heart
You've got no reason to frown
Love is as welcome
As a sunny, sunny day
No grown-up thoughts
To lead our hearts astray
Take life easy, so easy, nice and easy
Like a child, so gay and so carefree
Yeah
The whole world smiles with you
As you go your merry way
Oh with a child's heart
Nothing's gonna get me, nothing's gonna get
Nothing's gonna get me down
Oh with a child's heart
Nothing's gonna get me, nothing's gonna get
Nothing's gonna get me down
Oh with a child's heart
Sing nothing's gonna get me, nothing's gonna get
Nothing's gonna get me down
Oh with a child's heart
Sing nothing's gonna get me, nothing's gonna get
Nothing's gonna get me down
Oh with a child's heart
Sing nothing's gonna get me, nothing's gonna get
Nothing's gonna get me down
Oh with a child's heart
Sing nothing's gonna get me, nothing's gonna get
Nothing's gonna get me down
