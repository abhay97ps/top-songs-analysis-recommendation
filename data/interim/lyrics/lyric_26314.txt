Every night at 12 o'clock 
On the dot, it never fails, you call me up 
Talkin' 'bout you had a bad day, so you're pullin' up 
So I pour up a cup of just what you need
'Cause I know what you need
I love it when you wanna sleep at my place
I love it when we dancing down the hallway
But when you leave, it puts me in a bad place
Will you stay? Come on, please stay
You come around unannounced and you leave with the sunlight
Just when it's gettin' good, you hit me with the goodbye
Same thing every night, I can never get enough time
I want more of ya
I want more of that moonlight, that candlelight, that red wine
And you're sitting there with your fingertips, you're lingerin'
You ain't going nowhere
My t-shirt, you're still In it
Been on your phone for a minute
Baby, who you kiddin'?
Girl, we're runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' from the truth
I know you want me too, so why do you?
You come around unannounced and you leave with the sunlight
Just when it's gettin' good, you hit me with the goodbye
Same thing every night, I can never get enough time
I want more of ya
I want more of that moonlight, that candlelight, that red wine
Yeah, it's gone too soon
It's gone too soon
Girl, we're runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' from the truth
But we don’t have to, so you don’t have to
You come around unannounced and you leave with the sunlight
Just when it's gettin' good, you hit me with the goodbye
Same thing every night, I can never get enough time
I want more of ya
I want more of that moonlight, that candlelight, that red wine
Ooh yeah, it's gone too soon
Gone too soon
