I don't care if you're here
Or if you're not alone
I don't care, it's been too long
It's kinda like we didn't happen
The way that your lips move
The way you whisper slow
I don't care, it's good as gone 
I said I won't lose control, I don't want it 
I said I won't get too close, but I can't stop it 
Oh no, there you go, making me a liar
Got me begging you for more
Oh no, there I go, startin' up a fire
Oh no, no
Oh no, there you go, you're making me a liar
I kinda like it though
Oh no, there I go, startin' up a fire
Oh no, no 
You're watching, I feel it 
I know I shouldn't stay 
I picture your hands on me 
But what if you kiss me? 
And what if I like it?
And no one sees it
I said I won't lose control, I don't want it 
I said I won't get too close, but I can't stop it 
Oh no, there you go, making me a liar
Got me begging you for more
Oh no, there I go, startin' up a fire
Oh no, no 
Oh no, there you go, you're making me a liar
I kinda like it though
Oh no, there I go, startin' up a fire
Oh no, no
Oh no, no, no
Yeah, here comes trouble, no, no
Startin' up a fire
I don't believe myself when I
Say that I don't need you, oh
I don't believe myself when I say it
So, don't believe me
Oh no, there you go, you're making me a liar
Got me begging you for more
Oh no, there I go, startin' up a fire
Oh no, no 
Oh no, there you go, you're making me a liar
I kinda like it though
Oh no, there I go, startin' up a fire
Oh no, no
Yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah
Nah, yeah
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, you're making me a liar
'Cause my clothes are on the floor
Huh, huh, huh
Uh
Oh no, no, no
Another fire
