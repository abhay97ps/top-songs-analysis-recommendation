Watch them flee, watch them flee
Watch them flee, hip-hop heads
"And you do it like this"
 It's goin' down
 It's goin' down
 It's goin' down
 It's goin' down
It's goin' down, the rhythm projects 'round the next sound
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect, now
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down
The melting pot of a super future-esque style
The combination of a vocal caress
With lungs that gasp for breath from emotional stress
With special effects and a distorted collage
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage
It's goin' down, a logical progression on a timeline
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey, now
It's goin' down, a logical progression on a timeline
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey, now
It's goin' down, put it out for the world to see
LP and X-Men to the 10th degree
 Nobody in the world is safe
When we melt down the wax in your record crate
 Put it out for the world to see
LP and X-Men to the 10th degree
 Nobody in the world is safe
When we melt down the wax in your record crate
 "Put it on"
"I said it goes like this"
"And you do it like this"
It's goin' down
Once again it is
Composed sentences altogether venomous
The four elements of natural force
Projected daily, through the sound of the source
Everybody on board as we blend, the sword with the pen
The mightiest of weapons swinging right from the chin
To elevate mental states long gone with the wind
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends
It's goin' down, style assimilation, readily
Trekking through the weaponry of a pure pedigree
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me
Whatever the weather be, we're advancing steadily
It's going down sub-terrestrial high
A rhyme regiment that's calling the shots
Execution of collaborative plots
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop
It's goin' down, a logical progression on a timeline
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey, now
It's goin' down, put it out for the world to see
LP and X-Men to the 10th degree
 Nobody in the world is safe
When we melt down the wax in your record crate
 Put it out for the world to see
LP and X-Men to the 10th degree
 Nobody in the world is safe
When we melt down the wax in your record crate
"X-Men 'bout to blast off world wide"
"X-Men 'bout to blast off world wide"
"And you do it like this"
"'Bout to blast off world wide"
It's goin' down, put it out for the world to see
LP and X-Men to the 10th degree
 Nobody in the world is safe
When we melt down the wax in your record crate
 Put it out for the world to see
LP and X-Men to the 10th degree
 Nobody in the world is safe
When we melt down the wax in your record crate
 It's goin' down
 It's goin' down
 It's goin' down
"Put it on", "and it goes like this"
"And you do it like this"
"Put it on", "and it goes like this"
"And you do it like this"
"Like this"
