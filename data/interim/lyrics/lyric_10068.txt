After a while
I began wanting to be with you
Wanting to be seen with you
But why I just couldn't say
But after a while
You were my lady and lover
I didn't know what I'd discovered
Until today
And still the loving is fun
Just like it was when it all began
We started out simply two young friends
But look what we've become
And still the loving is fun
Count the years we've loved everyone
And since the first time we loved
The loving's been fun
The loving's been fun
The midnight sun shined all the ways
When I first held your hand
Our feet was slowly sinking into the sand
That ran between our toes
And I couldn't think of one
Single place any better than you
And after all these years
You're still the one
I want my love to know
And still the loving is fun
Just like it was when it all began
We started out simply two young friends
But look what we've become
And still the loving is fun
Count the years we've loved everyone
And since the first time we loved
The loving's been fun
The loving's been fun
The loving's been fun
Oh, oh, oh....
And still the loving's been fun
Just like it was when it all began
We started out simply two young friends
But look what we've become
And still the loving is fun....
