You are the summer
And I am the autumn
Don't wait too long
My songs go on
When yours has just begun
Don't wait too long
Fall is a lovely time of the year
When leaves turn to golden brown
But soon fall is ending
And winter is near
And the leaves start tumbling down
Why must the moments
Go by in such haste
Don't wait too long
Winter is coming
We've no time to waste
Don't wait too long
And while my heart's gay
And foolish and free and
Still can sing its song
Share every precious moment with me
Don't wait too long
So while my heart's gay
And foolish and free and
Still can sing its song
Share every precious moment with me
Don't wait too long
