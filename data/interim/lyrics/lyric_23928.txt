What if I rolled the dial to the right
And let that minor chord steer this night
What if I slid a match and lit the wick
What if I shut you up
With my lips on your lips
Let the gravel in my voice
Drown out all the noise
With a whisper tonight
These thoughts that
No one else should hear
Cut through my lips
Dance in your ear
Till light comes burning
Through that window pane
Your hair's painting that pillow case
Answer me baby
With nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way
Of talking naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls 
Hear what can start with a whisper
And what if that
Kitchen table gets wrecked
Yeah, plates crashing down
With my breath on your neck
What if that $75.94
You spent at the store
Takes the rest of the night off
As it slides to the floor
With a whisper tonight
These thoughts that
No one else should hear
Cut through my lips
Dance in your ear
Till light comes burning
Through that window pane
Your hair's painting that pillow case
Answer me baby
With nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way
Of talking naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls 
Hear what can start with a whisper
Oh, with a whisper, yeah
Let the gravel in my voice
Drown out all the noise
With a whisper tonight
These thoughts that
No one else should hear
Cut through my lips
Dance in your ear
Till light comes burning
Through that window pane
Your hair's painting that pillow case
Answer me baby
With nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way
Of talking naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls 
Hear what can start with a whisper
With a whisper, yeah
With a whisper
Yeah, hear what can start with a whisper
