It's been the lovers question
Ever since time began
How to keep good romance
From slipping through your hands
It ain't no trick to keep it
To hold on to what you got
The secret to the secret
Is to love and never stop
Got to keep holding on holding on
Holding on for dear love
You better try holding on holding on
Holding on for dear love
You've got to keep holding on holding on
Holding on for dear love
Holding on holding on
Don't you sometimes wonder
How a good love can go bad
Lovers crumble under
When they don't love the love they have
To break apart is tragic
And that is why I say
'Cause when you lose that magic
You lose everything
