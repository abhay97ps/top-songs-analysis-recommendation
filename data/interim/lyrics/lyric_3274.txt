This could be a brave beginning
Should you want to take it from the start
'Cause around the fire you are spinning
Straight into your heart
And there are days you find serenity
And days you want to lose control
You have it all, you have it all
The friend you need, the wicked blues
You have it all, the land to roll
The shores to run
The seas to cruise
You have it all to lose
In the skyline we are chasing
You always want to make your mark
Let aside the hours you are aching
Mostly in the dark
And there are days your love is endless
And days you want to save my soul
You have it all, you have it all
The friend you need, the wicked blues
You have it all, the land to roll
The shores to run
The seas to cruise
You have it all to lose
And there are days your love is endless
And days you want to save my soul
You have it all, you have it all
The friend you need, the wicked blues
You have it all, the land to roll
The shores to run
The seas to cruise
You have it all to lose
