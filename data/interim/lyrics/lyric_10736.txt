You still got that light in your eye
And our day is comin' by and by
I'm travelin' this long road to be with you
We still gotta long way, we still gotta long way to go
The first time I set eyes on you and I listened to you sing, yeah yeah
We didn't have to speak cause the words said everything
Yes you walked right into my life, and we were on our way, yeah
So long ago, but it feels like yesterday
And I just wanna tell you
You still got that light in your eye
And our day is comin' by and by
I'm travelin' this long road to be with you
We still gotta long way, we still gotta long way to go
Now some of my best memories are days I spent with you, yeah
Each time we hit the road it was always somethin' new
Spaced out rather drunk and singin' in the sun, yeah yeah
One more bottle dead and a new day just begun
I just wanna tell you
You still got that light in your eye
And our day is comin' by and by
I'm travelin' this long road to be with you
We still gotta long way, we still gotta long way to go
Shinin' light, shinin' bright on the days gone down
Shinin' light, shinin' bright on the days gone down
Shinin' light, shinin' bright on the days gone down
We won't forget the days gone down
They're written in our hearts, yeah yeah
And we're as much in tune as we were right at the start
It all seems so much harder now, it seemed so easy then, yeah yeah
Well someday just for fun we might do it all again
I just wanna tell you
You still got that light in your eye
And our day is comin' by and by
I'm travelin' this long road to be with you
We still gotta long way, we still gotta long way to go
Yeah yeah, still got that light in your eye
And our day is comin' by and by
I'm travelin', travelin'
We still gotta long way, we still gotta long way to go
