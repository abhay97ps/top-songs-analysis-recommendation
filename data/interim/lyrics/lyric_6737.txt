I just wanna be free 
I just wanna be free 
I wanna be free of all the hurt
I wanna be free of all the pain
I wanna just end these lonely hours
End these lonely days, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I just want to be free 
I just want to be free
I just want to be free 
I just want to be free 
I just want to be free
I just want to be free 
I just want to be free
