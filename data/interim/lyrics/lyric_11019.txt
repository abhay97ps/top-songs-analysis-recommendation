She was all of a lady, you were all of sixteen
You were king of the mountain, she was your queen
You played in the sunshine, you danced in the rain
It was so easy, when love was a game
But, everybody's
Chorus
Three times in love
Two times ain't enough, only one shines above
Everybody's three times in love
Lovers get older, summer goes away
You knew that it was over so you looked the other way
Suddenly before you, your second time around
Ah, you're older and wiser and you're covering a lot of ground
But, everybody's
Repeat Chorus
Now that you're ready, she comes along
Your ways are steady and your feelings are strong
She is all of your ladies, you are every man
You've both been waiting to find each other, now you understand
Why everybody's
Repeat Chorus until fade out
