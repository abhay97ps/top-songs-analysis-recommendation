I'm a lucky devil, lucky devil
To find a little angel like you!
The first time we touched I was floatin' on air
I knew I was in heaven though I never been there
On the level I'm a lucky devil
To find a little angel like you!
A sweet little angel like you
You don't play a harp and you haven't got wings
I knew you've got alot of other heavenly things
On the level I'm a lucky devil
To find a little angel like you!
A sweet little angel like you
Maybe I've got no pitchfork
Maybe I've got no horns
But as long as I've got you baby
I'm the luckiest devil that ever was born
Now your love is a treasure and I know what it's worth
'Cause I'm the only devil that's on heaven on earth
On the level I'm a lucky devil
To find a little angel like you!
Maybe I've got no pitchfork
Maybe I've got no horns
But as long as I've got you baby
I'm the luckiest devil that ever was born
Now your love is a treasure and I know what it's worth
I'm the only devil that's on heaven on earth
On the level I'm a lucky devil
To find a little angel like you!
A sweet little angel like you
A sweet little angel like you
