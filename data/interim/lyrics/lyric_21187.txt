Maybe you were right, maybe I could have changed
Sitting here alone tonight thinking 'bout a lot of things
What's a man to say when all the questions start
Hell I know deep down inside my broken heart
Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer
Dug down just a little bit deeper
Let the world revolve around you
And give you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway
I hate it when it's like this, baby it's like that now
Nothing I can say to you, you even care to talk about
How you going to dress it up, wrap it in a pretty bow
When it's gone, it's gone for good, baby at least I know
Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer
Dug down just a little bit deeper
Let the world revolve around you
And give you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway
Let the world revolve around you
And given you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway
