I made up my mind
What I'm gonna do
I'm gonna go out
And find somebody new
You ain't gonna do
What you did before
Cause I ain't gonna be
Around anymore
I wanna be a
Party, party girl
Have lots of fun
All around, around the world
I need a guy
Who would never lie
Tell me he's mine
Til the end of time
Party girl
She wants to be
A party, party girl
Have lots of fun
All around, around the world
I have cried once before
Now I'll cry, cry no more
Party girl
And it's Saturday night
And I'm having a ball
Dancing with the guys
At the old dance hall
Seems they all
Wanna dance with me
Now that they know
That I am free
I wanna be a
Party, party girl
Have lots of fun
All around, around the world
Staying up late
With a different date
Til the right guy
Comes my way
Party guy
I made up my mind
What I'm gonna do
I made up my mind
What I'm gonna do
I'm gonna go out
And find somebody new
You ain't gonna do
What you did before
Cause I ain't gonna be
Around anymore
I wanna be a
Party, party girl
Have lots of fun
All around, around the world
Find me a guy
Who would never lie....
