Jay Dee Tha 1 
Lord, watch over me and these lost souls
Step into the mic, let the story be told
Let it unfold, let 'em see the light
You think it's going good, but it ain't right
Pressure breaks pipes, but it creates a man
They worry about likes, they will never understand
The bigger plan, the plot and the bigger picture
Better open that book and get the reading scriptures
Cops killing kids and innocent people in these streets
Klan having rallies but they justifying the white sheets
Houston went under water, president give a fucc
His first message to them was tell 'em good lucc
I wish Malcolm and Martin was here 'cuz we really need 'em
Sit these niggas down, feed 'em and really teach 'em
The freedom, the laws, the cause and remember your actions
The storm's right in front of us, we blinded by distractions
Everyday it's hard, trying to walk a straight line when you're on a curve
Or trying to ride your own lane 'cuz succas wanna make you swerve
The game's dirty, every moments like you're getting served
I guess it's time to pull the mask down and purge
Because it's cold out here 
It's cold out here 
Homie, it's cold out here 
Hour after hour, month after month, year after year
2Gz 
Power to the people, to the people have the power
To overcome any obstacle we might encounter
Fucc the police, they ain't ever brought us peace
And fucc the president and his racist rhetoric
Ol' pumpis pricc, I still stand triumphant
And when my name's announced, you can hear the trumpets
2Gz in a buccet, fucc it
Pull up on the precinct and bucc it, fucc it
Look, it's cold out here
Bullets got names, John Doe's out here, freeze your bones out there
It's best to stay alert, 'cuz your so called friends
Going through your ladies purse, 'cuz they put the money first
With no respect, that same nigga from your set
He call collect, you'll be a fool if you except
So come correct, and watch real niggas connect
And I bet, first downs get met
Q. Allanz 
I done seen it all from selling pills to the cracc pipes
Staying in the streets everyday, living the fast life
Even got into a shout-out with some enemies last night
My world keeps getting darker, man, I'm down to my last light
Mentally, I'm trying to cure these unmarked scars
And keep a low profile around these unmarked cars
Nowadays, you can't tell who's around you wearing a wire
So I keep my lip stitched up, 'cuz the blocc is hot, they're trying to cause a fire
Hard to focus while I'm sippin' this Henny
I'm trying to keep my composure, but the bottle keeps getting empty
And how's 'Amerikka' gonna tell me I ain't got no manners
'Cuz I know the words to Cop Killer, but I don't know the star spangled banner
Fucc Uncle Sam, I ain't changing my grammar
And tell the judge he can drink piss with Lipton tea vefore he slams the hammer
It's hard to smile when your heart goes blacc
So, if I seem like a demon, the world did that
