I rise I fall with each lettle thing you do
You hurt I hurt I'm that much a part of you
And when you're happy baby I'm happy too
Since I'm that much a part of you
I rise I fall with each little breath you take
You cry I cry cause I feel the same heartache
And when you're smiling baby I'm smiling too
Since I'm that much a part of you
Your lips are my lips my heart is your heart
Never let us be further than just a breath apart
I rise I fall with each little thing you do
You hurt I hurt I'm that much a part of you
Every thing that you feel baby I feel it too
Since I'm that much a part of you
Since I'm that much a part of you
