Just an old-fashioned love song
Playin' on the radio
And wrapped around the music
Is the sound of someone promising they'll never go
You swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on
No need in bringin' 'em back
'Cause they're never really gone
To weave our dreams upon and listen
To each evening when the lights are low
To underscore our love affair with tenderness and feelings
That we've come to know
You swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on and on and...
No need in bringin' 'em back
'Cause they're never really gone
To weave our dreams upon and listen to a song
Just an old song, comin' down
Just an old song
Just an old song, comin' down
Just an old song 
 Just an old song, comin' down
 Just an old song
 Just an old song, comin' down
 Just an old song
