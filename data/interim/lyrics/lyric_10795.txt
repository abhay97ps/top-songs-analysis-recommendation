Ya, 11:55
Think about hittin' those hitting your phone line
I've been hella busy you just want them old times
Back before all the studio sessions and show times
Before it was lit, before everybody wanted a pic
When I was taking all them shots and bricked
I was very consistent, spoiled child, I see what I want and I get it
From Vallejo to Oakland, on Mission
My old bitch in my subconscious, still trippin'
Time and time again, you proved you something, she isn't
Hold a nigga down, you the walking law of physics
Little piece of heaven, little sweet candy kisses
Tell me what you need, love
You deserve anything you could think of
I can't say I'll be flawless, but at least I know what my flaw is, so
I just wanna open up more
That's something I'm working on
I don't wanna look back, and then look bad again
I've dealt with that hurt before
Why is this so new to me, you're like, you're my first love
Baby you are, and I just realized
This is love with no disguise, this is
Red and brown kisses
You're the only nigga on my wishlist
Love the way you finish every sentence
I've been on my mind now, I've been in my feelings
I'm tryna relax with you
I'm on the 5-80 heading back to you
My bitches say I'm crazy, I've been acting different lately
I had to tell'em hold up bitch, look I ain't asking you
If you were mine, all of the time
I'd be the love of your life forever
When we wake up, and then we go grind, and than we come back, and we shine together
Tell me what it's gonna be
Tell me that you'll always gonna stay true
And I'mma be, yeah I'mma be your inner peace
Really I could, really I could save you, yeah, yeah
But I need you to open up more
That's something I'm working on
I just wanna open up more
That's something I'm working on
I don't wanna look back, and then look bad again
I've dealt with that hurt before
There's nothing, no substance to it
You know, which makes it valued
Everything that valued got some kind of substance to it
