If it's love that you're running from, there's no hiding place
Love has problems I know but there problems, we'll just have to face
Oh yeah, yeah
If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
We're gonna walk and don't look back 
And don't look back , oh yeah, yeah
And don't look back, baby 
If your first lover broke your heart
There's something that can be done
Don't end your faith in love because of what he's done
So if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on walking, don't look back 
Forget about the past now
Don't look back, baby 
Keep on walking and don't look back, mmm 
Love can be a beautiful thing
Though your first love let you down
Oh yeah, yeah
'Cause I know we can make love bloom, baby
The second time around
Oh yeah, yeah
So if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on pushing and don't look back 
Now, what'd I say, we won't look back, girl 
Keep on walking and won't look back
Forget about the past now, baby 
And don't look back 
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't look back
