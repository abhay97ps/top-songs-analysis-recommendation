I don't mind you having a good time
Being free
But I don't like you tasting some new wine
Without me
For although I really love you
I still am a man
And my heart is breaking
From all I've been taking
Girl can't you see what you're doing to me
When the party is over
You might find you're alone
When the party is over
There might be no one at home
I find it hard not to be
Close to the door
And each night I find myself weak
I walk the floor
Baby
And though I've had time for thinking
I find I still care
My hear is breaking from what I've been taking
Oh, girl can't you see what you're doing to me
When the party is over
You might find you're alone
When the party is over
There might be no one at home
When the party is over
You might find you're alone
When the party is over
There might be no one at home
When the party is over
You might find you're alone
When the party is over
There might be no one at home
