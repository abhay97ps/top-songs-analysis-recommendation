You better look out
'Cause suspicious eyes are watching
Don't let them see us holding hands
I know that you and I
Should not be seen here talking
I kinda like the razor's edge
I always go for danger
I like to walk a tightrope
I do my show without a net
It never fails. I dive
Into the deepest ocean
Not knowing if I'll sink or swim
Oh, oh
Over my head
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Over my head
Oh, oh
We're always meeting in the dark
It's hard to see you
I'll feel my way
I'll take a chance
Risking exposure
Every time I come to meet you
I'm begging lady luck again
Oh, oh
Over my head
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Over my head
Oh, oh
I've got a feeling
This time I can't take it
You'll play the game
In a place for real
Although I'm falling
So fast already
I'm deeper than I should be
I'm over my head
Oh, oh
Over my head
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Over my head
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I'm over my head
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Over my head
Oh, oh
I'm over my head
Oh, oh
Over my head
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Over my head
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Over my head
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Over my head
Oh, oh
