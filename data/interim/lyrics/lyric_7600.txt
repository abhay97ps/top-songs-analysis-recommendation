Baby, don't fight it
I'm comin' baby
Do you know how long a tree lives
Or the reason it grows?
You may ask me all these questions
But darling, no one knows
It should be clear, I really love you
Don't ask me why, I just do
Do you ask the Lord who loves you
Why He paints the sky clear blue?
It's the way,  it's the way nature planned it
We were meant,  we were meant to stay together
It's just the way nature planned it, oh
Oh, don't ask me how long I'll love you
When you're gone, my heart aches
I'll never, never leave you
Girl, all my life, for you I'd wait cause it's the way
 It's the way nature planned it
We were meant,  we were meant to stay together
It's just the way nature planned it, girl
Don't fight it, baby
I'm coming, girl
It should be clear, I really love you
Don't ask me why, I just do 'cause it's the way
Mother Nature planned it
Like the stars and the sky and the beautiful heaven, ooh
It's the way nature planned it
Oh, yeah
Why does a flower grow?
Why does the river flow?
We were meant, we were meant
Ooh, why does it rain?
Why do I feel this way?
I love you, I love you, I love you, girl
