Hear the music playing, what makes it sound that way
Look who's now appearing and sharing his feelings in that roadside cafe
Though he won't find fortune or fame, he's not that kind
To him it's all the same
He's the melancholy music man, but he don't mind
I can hardly hear him, the laughter fills the air
They didn't come to see him, they'll never cheer him
Don't even know his name
But I don't care he's playing for me, and he'll play my favorite melody
He's the melancholy music man, but he don't mind
Just take you time, keep on playing
And back to the way
Just for me,  won't you please 
Won't you please  play for me 
Melancholy music man
Melancholy music man
