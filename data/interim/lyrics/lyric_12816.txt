Baby said, "You have to be a lover
One way or the other
Nobody wins without once giving in
So don't cry now
Don't cry now"
Love is just a game you play in high school
Girls know how to be cruel
Most of the time, girls are cruel to be kind
So don't cry now
Ooh, don't cry now
And we try to be cool as we dance in a crowded room
At the end of the day, making love to a paper moon
And she said
"Boys do fall in love
They make time
They get love on a Saturday night"
And she said
"Hearts beat as they dance in the street to a radio
Oh, oh, oh
B-b-b-boys fall in love"
Baby knows I like to get excited
No one wants to fight it
It's getting late, so I'll just demonstrate
Don't cry now
Ooh, don't cry now
And we try to be cool as we dance in a crowded room
At the end of the day, making love to a paper moon
And she said
"Boys do fall in love
They make time
They get love on a Saturday night"
And she said
"Hearts beat as they dance in the street to a radio"
Oh, oh, oh
Boys do fall in love
They make time 
They get love on a Saturday night
And she said
"Hearts beat as they dance in the street to a radio"
Oh, oh, oh
B-b-b-boys fall in love
B-b-b-b-boy, boys
B-b-b-b-boy, boys
Oh, oh, oh
Boys, boys, boys, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh
Boys, boys, boys, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh
Boys, boys, boys, oh-oh
Boy, boy, boy, boys
Boys  do  fall in love
They make time 
They get love on a Saturday night
And she said
"Hearts beat as they dance in the street to a radio"
Oh, oh, oh
Boys  do  fall in love
They make time 
They get love on a Saturday night
And she said
"Hearts beat as they dance in the street to a radio"
Oh, oh, oh
Boys  do  fall in love
They make time 
They get love on a Saturday night
And she said
"Hearts beat as they dance in the street to a radio"
Oh, oh, oh
