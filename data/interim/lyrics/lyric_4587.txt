Happy is the day I found you
Happy is the world around you
I'm never sad as long as we're together
My happiness is you
Happy is the way I love you
Happy is just thinkin' of you
I found a lifetime of pleasure, a hidden treasure
In the happiness of you
You're the girl I want to marry
You're the girl that makes 
Me happy 
Happy is our lives together
Happy is our love forever
What more in life could you give me?
Happy is livin' all my life with you
You're the girl I want to marry
You're the girl that makes 
Me happy 
Happy is our lives together
Happy is our love forever
What more in life could you give me?
Happy is livin' all my life with you
You
Ah
