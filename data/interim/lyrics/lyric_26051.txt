I want a boyfriend
But I just keep hitting dead ends
Try to take a shortcut, but I get cut again and again
I want a boyfriend
Tell me, are there any good ones left?
I keep finding wrong ones, but I want love again and again
I want a boyfriend
I been up all night
Pretty restlessly
Think I might know why 
I've been doing just fine
But baby, that don't mean
That I'm feeling anti you and me
There's a difference between a want and a need
Some nights, I just want more than me
I know that there's a fine line between
It's not what I need, but 
I want a boyfriend
But I just keep hitting dead ends
Try to take a shortcut, but I get cut again and again 
I want a boyfriend 
Tell me, are there any good ones left?
I keep finding wrong ones, but I want love again and again 
I want a boyfriend
I want a boyfriend
I could phone a friend, use a hotline or something
But that won't get the job done 
'Cause every time I try 
Every time they lie 
I get a little anti you and me
There's a difference between a want and a need
Some nights, I just want more than me
I know that there's a fine line between
It's not what I need, but 
I want a boyfriend
But I just keep hitting dead ends
Try to take a shortcut, but I get cut again and again 
I want a boyfriend 
Tell me, are there any good ones left?
I keep finding wrong ones, but I want love again and again
I want a boyfriend 
I want a boyfriend 
I want a 
I want a boyfriend 
I want a
