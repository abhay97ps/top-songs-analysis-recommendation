Children play in the park, they don't know
I'm alone in the dark, even though
Time and time again I see your face smiling inside-ide
I'm so happy 
That you love me 
Life is lovely 
When you're near me
Tell me, you will stay?
Make me smile
Living life is just a game, so they say, hey
All the games we used to play
Fade away, ooh
We may now enjoy those dreams we shared so long ago
Oh, my darling 
Got to have you 
Feel the magic 
When I hold you 
Cry sweet tears of joy
Touch the sky
Now I need you
More than ever
No more crying
We're together
Tell me, you will stay
Make me smile
