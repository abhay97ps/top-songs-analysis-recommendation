Boy, you're looking great
Yeah, you got what it takes alright
There's life outside your window, babe
Step into the moonlight
Babe, we're gonna ride far outta this town
Driving into the setting sun
To be there with you
Dancing to the sound of our hearts beating as one
Soul City
That's where we're heading
Dancing and singing 'til dawn
Soul City
That's where we're going
And we won't be back 'til the money's all gone
Man, this place is hopping
Dancing, singing, talking, rocking this town
Nobody down
Shake it with me, fake it with me
Don't ever take this feeling from my heart, just getting ready to start
Babe, I can see you don't ever wanna leave
Gonna do what's never been done
To be here with you
Dancing to the sound of our hearts beating as one
Soul City
That's where we're heading
Dancing and singing 'til dawn
Soul City
That's where we're going
And we won't be back 'til the money's all gone
Soul City
That's where we're heading
Dancing and singing 'til dawn
Soul City
That's where we're going
And we won't be back 'til the money's all gone
All of you who are looking for that rush tonight
Who are desperately searching for their heart
You wanna let go, there's one thing you'll know
That distant city is some place to start
Soul City
That's where we're heading
Dancing and singing 'til dawn
Soul City
That's where we're going
And we won't be back 'til the money's all gone
