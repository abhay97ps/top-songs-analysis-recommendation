You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, you'll find
You get what you need
You get what you need
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
Oh, I knew she was gonna meet her connection
At her feet was a footloose man
No, you can't 
Oh, no, no you can't 
What you want... 
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, well, you just might find
You get what you need 
You get what you need 
And I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singin', we're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't, we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse
Sing it to me now
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes, well, you just might find 
You get what you need 
You get what you need 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes, well, you just might find
You get what you need 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes, well, you just might find
You get what you need 
You get what you need
You can't always get what you want
You get what you need
Oh, yeah, what you need, yeah
Get... what... you... need!
