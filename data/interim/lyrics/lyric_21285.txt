Lipstick, pretty face
And maybe you’ll notice something
Different about me, different about me
Yeah, you talk talk all you want
You pour your heart out
But you never do see, you never do see me
I can’t wait forever for you
Sooner or later
You’re gonna come around
And you’ll be sorry
When you figure out
That I was always
Everything that you needed
Sooner or later
You’re gonna wish you had me
Yeah, you’re gonna wish you had me
Well, she don’t do
Nothing for you, but mess you up
Yeah, she messes you up
I’m your shoulder, I’m the quick drive over
Tryin' to fix your stuff
Well, I give up
You, you never see me standing right in front of you
Sooner or later
You’re gonna come around
And you’ll be sorry
When you figure out
That I was always
Everything that you needed
Sooner or later
You’re gonna wish you had me
Oh, you’re gonna wish me back so bad, so bad
Oh, but it’s a little too late for that
Lipstick, pretty face
And maybe you’ll notice something
Different about me, different about me
Sooner or later
You’re gonna come around
And you’ll be sorry
When you figure out
That I was always
Everything that you needed
Sooner or later, oh
Sooner or later
You’re gonna come around
And you’ll be sorry
When you figure out
That I was always
Everything that you needed
Sooner or later
You’re gonna wish you had me
 Oh, you’re gonna wish you had me
 Oh, you’re gonna wish you had me
 Oh, you’re gonna wish you had me
 Oh, you’re gonna wish you had me
