Walkin' in the sunshine, sing a little sunshine song
Put a smile upon your face as if there's nothing wrong
Think about a good time had a long time ago
Think about forgetting about your worries and your woes
Walkin' in the sunshine, sing a little sunshine song
La la la la la de ho
Whether the weather be rain or snow
Pretending can make it real
A snowy pasture, a green and grassy field
Walkin' in the sunshine, sing a little sunshine song
Put a smile upon your face as if there's nothing wrong
Think about a good time had a long time ago
Think about forgetting about your worries and your woes
Walkin' in the sunshine, sing a little sunshine song
La la la la la de ho
Whether the weather be rain or snow
Pretending can make it real
A snowy pasture, a green and grassy field
Walkin' in the sunshine, sing a little sunshine song
Put a smile upon your face as if there's nothing wrong
Think about a good time had a long time ago
Think about forgetting about your worries and your woes
Walkin' in the sunshine, sing a little sunshine song
Walkin' in the sunshine, singing a sunshine song
Put a smile upon your face as if there's nothing wrong
Think about forgetting about your worries and your woes
