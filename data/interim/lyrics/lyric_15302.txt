I heard it on the radio
Somebody reaching out tonight
Another soul that never sleeps
Until the shadows touch the morning lights
I know you well
I've been holding on
Weak and strong
But right or wrong
I had to call your number
I had to know for sure
Whoa-whoa-whoa
Do you really wanna fall in love
Take the chance again
Do you feel inside
The fire never dies
And it burns until the end
Do you really wanna give enough
Talk all night
Make love in the rain
If you really do
All I ask of you
Remember my name
Remember my name, oh
The moment that we said hello
I could almost see your face
Two voices on a midnight phone
With nothing but time to fill the space
I know you well
And I've been holding tight
Day and night
Wrong or right
I had to call your number
I had to know for sure
Whoa-whoa-whoa
Do you really wanna fall in love
Take the chance again
Do you feel inside
The fire never dies
And it burns until the end
Do you really wanna give enough
Talk all night
Make love in the rain
If you really do
All I ask of you
Remember my name
Remember my name
Do you really wanna fall in love
Talk all night
Make love in the rain
If you really do
All I ask of you
Remember my name
Remember my name
Yeah, yeah
Remember my name
Do you really
Do you really wanna fall
Talk all night
Make love in the rain
Do you wanna fall in love, yeah
Yeah, remember my name
Remember my name
