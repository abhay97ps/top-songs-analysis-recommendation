You wouldn't believe where I've been
The cities and towns I've been in
From Boston to Denver
And every town in between
The people they all look the same
Oh, only the names have been changed
But now that I'm home again
I'll tell you what I believe
It's a miracle 
A true blue spectacle
A miracle come true
We're together, baby
I was going crazy
Till the miracle came through
Now you're here and my arms are around you
And, baby, there'll be dancing in the street
For the miracle 
A true blue spectacle
The miracle is you
I never knew you looked so good
Oh, I never knew anyone could
I must have been crazy
To ever have gone away
I almost forgot what it's like
Oh, holding you near me at night
But now that I'm home again
You know that I'm home to stay
'Cause it's a miracle 
A true blue spectacle
A miracle come true
We're together, baby
I was going crazy
Till the miracle came through
Now you're here and I'm feeling so good
And, baby, there'll be dancing in the street
For the miracle 
A true blue spectacle
The miracle is you
Now you're here and my arms are around you
And, baby, there'll be dancing in the street
Ha, there's gonna be dancing in the street
Whoa ohh ohh ohh
Dancing in the street
Dancing, dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing, dancing
For the miracle 
A true blue spectacle
The miracle is you
Hey, the miracle is you
Whoa, the miracle is you
