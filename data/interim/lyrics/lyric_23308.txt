Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Well it's too long living in the same old lives 
I feel too cold to live, too young to die 
Will you walk the line, like it's there to choose? 
 Just forget the wit, it's the best to use
Oh lord
Oh lord
I said oh lord
Won't you follow me into the jungle 
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle 
Won't you follow me into the jungle 
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle 
Won't you follow me into the jungle
I lost my mind, in the city of lights 
In the backstreets buildings and the neon lights 
When I heard the thunder, I could feel the rain 
It's the same to me, just a different name
Oh lord
Oh lord
I said oh lord
Won't you follow me into the jungle 
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle 
Won't you follow me into the jungle 
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle 
Won't you follow me into the jungle
Oh, Lord
Yea, Oh, Lord
Oh, Lord
Oh, Lord child
Follow me
Won't you come and follow me
Come on follow me
Won't you follow me
Come on follow me
Come on won't follow me
See you follow me
Won't you come and follow me
Follow me into the jungle 
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle 
Won't you follow me into the jungle 
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle 
Won't you follow me into the jungle
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle 
Won't you follow me into the jungle 
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle 
Won't you follow me into the jungle
