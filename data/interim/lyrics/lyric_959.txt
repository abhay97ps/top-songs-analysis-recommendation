Romeo Romeo Romeo
Oh, Romeo oh Romeo
You're always havin' fun
You chase the girls all over town
And then you started to run
You're always flirting with the girls
There's anyone can see
But if you really love me, baby
Please don't flirt by me
'Cause someday your time will come
And your bachelor days will end
When the time is here
Who knows my  I must be just your friend
So Romeo, my Romeo, you'd better settle down
The boys want me will have to keep is two feet on the ground
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh
Yeah yeah yeah
Someday your time will come and your bachelor days will end
When the time is here who knows my 
I must be just your friend
So Romeo my Romeo you'd better settle down
The boys want me will have to keep is two feet on the ground
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
