Well, I couldn't tell you
Why she felt that way
She felt it every day
And I couldn't help her
I just watched her make
The same mistakes again
What's wrong, what's wrong now? 
Too many, too many problems 
Don't know where she belongs 
Where she belongs
She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside
Open your eyes 
And look outside
Find the reasons why
You've been rejected 
And now you can't find
What you've left behind
Be strong, be strong now 
Too many, too many problems 
Don't know where she belongs 
Where she belongs
She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside
Her feelings she hides
Her dreams she can't find
She's losin' her mind
She's fallin' behind
She can't find her place
She's losin' her faith
She's fallen from grace
She's all over the place
Yeah
She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside
She's lost inside, lost inside
Oh-oh
She's lost inside, lost inside
Oh-oh
Oh
