I don't believe a word they're saying
What they're saying isn't true
Everybody calls her bad girl 
Everybody put her down 
Why don't they take the time to understand
She's looking for a love she's never found?
And it's only 'cause she's lonely 
That's the way she got her name 
All she did was look for someone to love
And they put the girl to shame
Well you don't know her like I do
If you're gonna put her down, here's where our friendship ends
I don't hear a word you're saying 
She's the one I'm dreaming of 
So don't you ever call her bad girl again
'Cause she's a boy to love
All I see is just a pack of lies
I'm gonna listen to the rumors that you start
So don't you ever call her bad girl again
'Cause she's found a boy to love 
Oh yes, she's found a boy she loves 
Oh yes, she's found a boy to love 
Oh yes, she's found a boy to love 
I know the one she's dreaming of 
Oh yes, she's found a boy the one love 
I know the boy she's dreaming of 
Oh yes, she's found a boy to loves
