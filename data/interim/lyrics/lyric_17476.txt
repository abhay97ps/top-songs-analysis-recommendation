If you want it slowly don't knock on my door
'Cause I want it all and a little bit more
If you want to go anywhere just let me know when
'Cause I want to be there again and again
Now I know the time is right and I can't wait another night
Love will never turn back around
CHORUS:
Breaking all the rules when we get together
Anything at all are you ready to do
Breaking all the rules we can run away just me and you
Oh oh oh oh
Now that we're going, let's go all the way
Nobody can stop us I don't care what they say
I'll take you places that you've never known
Don't look behind you are you ready to go
Now I know the time is right and I can't wait another night
Love will never turn back around
CHORUS
I put my mind on the go because this feeling I know
Is never gonna'go away
And everybody around me has nothing to say
I'm just a runaway
CHORUS
