The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup
(By the time I get to Phoenix
She'll be rising)
I say a little prayer for you
(She'll find the note
I left hanging on her door)
While combing my hair now
(She'll laugh when she reads
The part that says I'm leaving)
And wondering what dress to wear now
I say a little prayer for you
('Cause I've left that girl
So many times before)
Forever and forever
(By the time I make Albuquerque
She'll be working)
You'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever
(She'll probably stop at lunch
And give me a call)
We never will part
And how I love you
Together, together
(But she'll just hear that
Phone keep on ringing)
That's how it must be
To live without you would
Only mean heartbreak for me
I run for the bus, dear
While riding, I think of us, dear
(By the time I make Oklahoma
She'll be sleeping)
I say a little prayer for you
(She'll turn softly and
Call my name out low)
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee break-time
I say a little prayer for you
(Though time and time
I've tried to tell her so)
I say a little prayer for you
(She just didn't know
I would really go)
No, she didn't know I'd go
