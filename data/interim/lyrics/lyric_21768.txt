My neighbor Carl, he lives next door
Pink flamingos on his porch
At night he teaches driving school
And he sits out by his plastic pool
He takes off his shirt he opens up a cold one
Old Carls he's a fool but it takes one to know one
Music is playing up and down the block
Mostly Christian blues, country folk and southern rock
It's our little piece of paradise way out here in the woods
There is always something going on down in the trailerhood
Across the street there is gambling Jane who is always got the poker game
If you care to try your luck you can buy a seat for 15 bucks
You can call to raise or you can check and fold them
I like five card stud but it is mostly Texas hold 'em
Music is playing up and down the block
Mostly Christian blues, country folk and southern rock
It's our little piece of paradise way out here in the woods
There is always something going on down in the trailerhood
My new tattoos and farmer tans, rodeo and nascar fans
Dallas Cowboy football on TV
When the storm starts getting bad, you hear the those sirens humming
Grab a six pack and a lawn chair there is a tornado coming
Music is playing up and down the block
Mostly Christian blues, country folk and southern rock
It's our little piece of paradise way out here in the woods
There is always something going on down in the trailerhood
I got her made in the shade with the moonshine lemonade
There is a party going on down in the trailerhood
