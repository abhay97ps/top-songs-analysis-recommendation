I want you
I want you so bad
I need you
It's driving me mad
I want you

I need you
It's driving me mad
You know that I want you tonight
That's all right with me
Baby, you're all I desire
My love is all that you need
Come in my world and, baby, you'll see
Paradise is waiting for just you and me
I've waited so long for someone like you
To make all my dreams and passions come true
I want you
I want you so bad
I need you
It's driving me mad
I want you
I want you so bad, boy
I need you
It's driving me mad
I want you
Babe, won't you give me your love?
There's no one better for me
Now honey, look what you've done
I'm under your spell, can't you see
Give me your love and, baby, you'll see
Paradise is waiting for just you and me
I've waited so long for someone like you
To make all my dreams and passions come true
I want you
I want you so bad
I need you
It's driving me mad

To make all my dreams and passions come true
