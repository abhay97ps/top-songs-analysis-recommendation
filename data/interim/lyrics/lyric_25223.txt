Alright, cool
Got it on smash
 Yeah
Talk to me, baby 
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby 
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor
I want you to talk to me, baby 
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby 
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor, oh
Talk to me, baby 
Work it, take the shift off for me, baby 
I drive the whip you bought for me, baby 
You know I got a lotta opps on me, baby
I whip around the corner in the whip 
Shout out Rafaello, man I love the drip, drip 
80 pointers on my wrist 
I'm hella rich and I love to talk shit, so
Talk to me, baby 
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby 
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor
I want you to talk to me, baby 
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby 
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor, oh
Let her go, go, go, go 
Go, go, go, go 
Girl, I'll race you to the floor, tell her go
Tell the crew, I got money, I'm the one you wanna know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can make that pussy talk back 
I can spoil you wit' these big racks 
She got good head  and she eat her cornbread 
The Wraith red, Ben Frank, my friends dead 
I don't wanna miss it, all of the money, I don't wanna kiss you
The pussy official, I fuck her one time and her face in a pillow
It's a one night ting, my diamonds fighting
This not no Breitling, that pussy biting
I tell her to talk to me 
The plug gon' walk with me 
Ooh, she bougie, she busy 
Fuck it, might buy her a Bentley 
Go , go to the floor and pick up 
She callin' my phone, might pick up 
She too bad, I might miss her 
Talk to me, baby 
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby 
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor
I want you to talk to me, baby 
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby 
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor, oh
Let her go, go, go, go 
Go, go, go, go
Girl, I'll race you to the floor, tell her go
Tell the crew, I got money, I'm the one you wanna know
