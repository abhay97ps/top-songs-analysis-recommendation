Sing a song of songs to me
Sing it like an old love song
Sing about it all day long
You can't go wrong
If you just sing
All those blues away
Oh sing it loud and sing it strong
A happy go lucky song
You can't go wrong
And when you're feeling down a song
Can make you happy again
It's just like a friend
You know you won't be sad very long
If you just sing
All your dreams come true
Oh sing out loud oh don't be shy
Cause if you reach out for the sky
Oh you're gonna get by
Play 'em the melody, go ahead
Let rainbows chase your clouds away
Don't turn your back on the sun
Get out and have fun
And let a smile lead you away
Come on and sing
All your dreams come true
Sing out loud now don't be shy
Cause if you reach out for the sky
You're gonna get by
Alright now everybody
Let's try it together come on
Sing
All your dreams come true
Sing out loud now don't be shy
Cause if you reach out for the sky
You're gonna get by
Let's try it again
If you just sing a song of songs
To me sing it like an old love song
Sing about it all day long
You can't go wrong
Come on and sing
All those blues away
Sing it loud and sing it strong
