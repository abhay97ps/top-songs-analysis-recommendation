Oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, ahhh
Oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo
Oooo, oooo, ahhh
There'll never be a better love
Since we are lying here, ah, for the first time, you and I
Show me what you'd do for me, and then will I
Don't try to hide your nature
No other girl could ever rate you
There'll never be a better love, love, love, love, love
I wanna hold you, squeeze you, hug you, kiss you
La, la, la, la, la, la
There'll never be, be, be. La, la, la, la, la, la
Oo-oooh, oh, ohhh. La, la, la, la
Oo-oooh, oh, ohhh. La, la, la, la, la, la
Oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo
Oooo, oooo, ahhh
There'll never be a better love, love, love, love, love
A better love
A better love
Please come over here and let me whisper in your ear
I'll say something good to you, you always wanted to hear
So real, I know you won't regret it
So good, I know you won't forget it
There'll never be a better love, love, love, love, love
I wanna hold you, squeeze you, hug you, kiss you
Never for you
La, la, la, la, la, la
There'll never be, be, be. La, la, la, la, la, la
Oo-oooh, oh, ohhh. La, la, la, la
Oo-oooh, oh, ohhh. La, la, la, la, la, la
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
There'll never be. La, la, la, la, la, la
A better love. La, la, la, la, la, la
No matter how he kiss you, how treats you
I know that there never will be a better love. La, la, la, la, la, la
A better love. La, la, la, la, la, la
