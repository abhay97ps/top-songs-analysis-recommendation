If niggas want war, bust slugs

Respect mines, to the day of my demise

Notice, niggas be hot, and more explosive
Focus, ready to rip 'em up with the dose, this
My life, niggas is frontin', and stuntin' for nothing
Better act right, fo' I spark and dim your lights?

To bitches, when in doubt, go for stealth, and clap the finish
Anything movin' rightfully hit for wrong doin'
