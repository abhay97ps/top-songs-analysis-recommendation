Little girl, where did you come from?
A-don't you know
That we could have a lot of fun?
You just moved into my neighborhood
But you oughta be in-a Hollywood
An I want this understood
You're lookin' go-oo-ood
You're lookin' good
You're not very tall
But you're stepping high
Eyeballs flashin'
As you walk by
The cats on the block
Wanna know your name
But I was here first
Ain't that a shame?
An I want this understood
You're lookin' go-oo-ood
You're lookin' good
Hey!
Two an two is four
One an one is two
Ev'ryone's got their eyes on you
Look at those measurements
Man alive!
34-24-35
An I want this understood
You're lookin' go-oo-ood
You're lookin' good
FADES-
You're lookin'
Go-ooo-oo
Ooo-oo-oh
Oh-ooo
