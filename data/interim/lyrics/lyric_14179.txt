Uneasy eyes rest on a clock
A nervous hand reveals a watch
A sudden glance, a painful smile
And minutes slip away
Unsettled heart would skip a beat
A tired heart can find no peace
A lonely sound, the clock ticks on
And hours slip away
Don't tell me the time
I don't want to know
Don't tell me the time
You spend with her
Can't hurt me, it does
Don't tell me the time
'Cause time can be cruel
Every moment that I'm away from you
Where did you go? Don't want to know
Why are you here is never clear?
Make love just once, you're gone again
And I'm alone with time
Don't tell me the time
I don't want to know
Don't tell me the time
You spend with her
Can't hurt me, it does
Don't tell me the time
'Cause time can be cruel
And I still can't believe how long
The night keeps me waiting here for you
Prisoner of time, no dream comes true
Waiting and watching, lost in forever without you
Don't tell me the time
I don't want to know
Don't tell me the time
You spend with her
Can't hurt me, it does
Don't tell me the time
'Cause time can be cruel
Every moment that I'm away from you
