Oh lonely , lonely goodbyes 
Oh lonely , lonely goodbyes 
As I sit here
Wondering what happened to me
Can't get away from the wind
All alone without me again
Wondering if I will always be a
Lonely drifter 
Lonely trickster 
Lonely drifter
Because I, I, I don't want to have to be a
Oh lonely , lonely goodbyes 
Oh lonely , lonely goodbyes 
And when we wait forever, forever ever and ever
Must I always 
Will tomorrow be like today
Wondering why I will always be a
Lonely drifter 
Lonely trickster 
Lonely drifter 
Lonely drifter 
Lonely drifter 
Lonely drifter 
Lonely drifter 
Lonely drifter
