My presence sweet and my aura bright
Diamonds good for my appetite
Guess it fuckin' just clicked one night
All them demons helped me see shit differently
So don't be sad for me
How you been spending your time? 
How you be using your tongue? 
You be so worried 'bout mine 
Can't even get yourself none
You know you sound so dumb 
You know you sound so dumb 
So maybe you should shut up, mmm
Yeah, maybe you should shut up
Said if only you would shut up 
Yeah, that's right, you should shut up 
I vibrate high and my circle lit
We ain't really with drugs and shit
Love the game so I ain't nevеr miss
Keep opinions muted for the hell of it
'Causе I like my shit 
How you been spending your time? 
How you be using your tongue? 
You be so worried 'bout mine 
Can't even get yourself none
You know you sound so dumb 
You know you sound so dumb 
So maybe you should shut up, mmm
Yeah, maybe you should shut up
Said if only you would shut up 
Yeah, that's right, you should shut up
