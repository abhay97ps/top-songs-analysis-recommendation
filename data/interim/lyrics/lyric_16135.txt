Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, bon-voyage
Yeah from the home of the Dodger Brooklyn squad
Wu-Tang killer bees on a swarm
Rain on your college-ass disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta put the one killer bee and he ain't gonna kill
Now chop that down, pass it all around
Lyrics get hard quick cement to the ground
For any emcee in any fifty-two states
I get psycho killer, Norman Bates
My producer slam my flow is like bam
Jump on stage ah then I dip down
"I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch" 
Yo, Check the mic line for wire-taps
We're under attack, man your stations, take aim, proceed
Fire back, all hands on deck: cadet, vets, insert cassettes
Tracks snap heads like berets; catch web-sites like internet
Chief, I detected vehicles approaching from the East
Pass the infrared binoculars, captain, so I can see
Sound the alarm; call for the suicidal-kamikaze ninjas with the bombs
Flashes of neon, all we saw was flying arms
Anytime I come by, alumni cut short their air supply
Send 'em back like George McFly
I, be holdin' this; travel ground like a motorist
Poisonous gas released from my track, its odorless and tasteless
Like Ghost is face-less
Which allowed the God to break backs, and beat a hundred cases
MCs heads weave like trees, in a breeze to rhymes like these
Underwater flow strike like torpedoes
You get plugged more than Del Rio; played short like De Vito
Split the fuck up like Mike-Jack and Tito
Sword cuts sharper than Concorde needles
Call my second private, tell 'em write this important message to Cypress
I heard Yacub's assistant on the island was Dr. Titus
And they just released a new deadly virus
To infiltrate the Western States
It's time to pump out more rap tapes
And use the Wu-Tang symbol to communicate
RZA, over and out...
Relax and take notes
While I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke; gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor
The rap slayer, the hooker layer
Motherfucker, say your prayers!
"Hail Mary, full of grace," smack the bitch in the face
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face off her back
Jab her if she act, funny with the money
Oh, you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho?
The head honcho, swift fist, like Camacho
I got so much style I should be down with the Stylistics
"Make up to break up" Niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit, just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor and me hittin' the clit
Sucking on the tits, had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rocked quick
I guess I was a combination
Of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was humpin' around and jumpin' around
Jacked her, then I asked her, "Who's the man?"
She said, "B-I-G," then I'd bust in her E-Y-E
I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged
Then writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
Behold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme; play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Six cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it; the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
