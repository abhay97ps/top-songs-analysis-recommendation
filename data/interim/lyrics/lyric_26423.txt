I just told Mean, "Yeah, we gon' be straight"
He saw me make a million off one damn play
I let him keep that money  'cause I know he keep it safe 
They ain't goin' runnin' out safe , we gon' put it right in they face 
Yeah, shoot it up, shoot it up, shoot it up 
Shoot it up, shoot it up, shoot it up 
Shoot it up, shoot it up, shoot it up 
Shoot it up, shoot it up, shoot it up 
FN's, Glocks and Dracos, no, we ain't got no Rugers tucked 
I don't even play with these niggas when I'm sober
So I'm on fuck shit when I'm bootin' up 
I'm stiff in the club, can't loosen up
Let my Glock in, motherfucker, got tool tucked
My niggas shoot shit, my niggas too cut
I'm in the cut gettin' sucked by two sluts
Pay for the hit, kill your favorite shooter
Then go on vacation, that's the power of the mula
Elliot diamonds all on the cougar
I still owe Elliot a little mula
You don't know Elliot? Bitch, that's my jeweler
Elliante, Fante, diamond cooler 
I got a lot whole lot of bands in my pants, they from France
My girl from Chicago, she said she don't like rappers
I told her, "Give me a chance"
This is a Range Rover, this not a Lamb'
Usin' a money counter, um, again

Niggas tried to go inside the safe, put the gun in they face
Shootin' my shot just like I'm Dr. J, billion-dollar play

Drinkin' on oil, I'm downin' my pill

My money got her stiffer than the Statue of Liberty
Bitches on bitches, I'm literally, some of them come from the Middle East
Drippin', I'm spending, yeah, I'm the epitome

Ridin' 'round with two lil' vibes and I got three Glocks on my side
