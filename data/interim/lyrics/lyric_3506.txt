Satin pillows to cry on
Satin pillows to cry on
You've got nothing else to rely on
You gave up the most precious thing in life
You turned from love to be a rich man's wife
The man you married is colder than all his gold
You're something he bought to keep from growing old
Now you've got satin pillows to cry on
Satin pillows tro cry on
You've got nothing else to rely on
And you've got fancy dresses and big cars
Diamonds that outshine the brightest stars
But diamonds can't replace the love we knew
They won't keep you warm like my arms used to
Now you've got satin pillows to cry on
Satin pillows to cry on
You've got nothing else to rely on
Satin pillows to cry on
Satin pillows to cry on
