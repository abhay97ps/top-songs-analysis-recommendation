There's two things I know for sure
She was sent here from Heaven and she's Daddy's little girl
As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes
And I thank God for all of the joy in my life
Oh but most of all
For butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
Walk beside the pony, Daddy, it's my first ride
I know the cake looks funny, Daddy, but I sure tried
Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must've done something right
To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses at night
Sweet sixteen today
Now she's lookin' like her momma a little more everyday
One part woman and the other part girl
From perfume and make-up from ribbons and curls
Trying her wings out in a great big world
But I remember...
Her butterfly kisses, after bedtime prayer
Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
You know how much I love you Daddy, but if you don't mind
I'm only going to kiss you on the cheek this time
Oh with all that I've done wrong I must've done something right
To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses at night
Oh, like the wind, the years go by
Spread your wings and fly
She'll change her name today
Oh and she'll make a promise and I'll give her away
Standing in the bride-room just starin' at her
She asked me what I'm thinkin' and I said I'm not sure
I just feel like I'm losin' my baby girl
And she leaned over
And gave me butterfly kisses with her momma there
Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
Walk me down the aisle Daddy, it's just about time
Does my wedding gown look pretty Daddy? Daddy don't cry
Oh with all that I've done wrong I must've done something right
To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses at night
This is what love is
Oh her love every morning and butterfly kisses at night
