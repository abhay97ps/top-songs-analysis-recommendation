Dark city streets
Twist and moan in the heat
As night descends
Two searching eyes
Cut their way into mine
Inviting me in
Dancing so close
We already know
How good it will be
We slip out
From the unseeing crowd
We find what we need
In the heart of the night
We run like bandits
Two hungry hearts under the gun
In the heart of the night
When we find each other
We're stealing love on the run
In the heart of the night
Heart of the night
The cool city moon
Lays its touch on the room
Your eyes reach to me
Two shadows fall
Saying nothing at all
We know what we need
In the release
Two prisoners are free
From all darkness
One more escape
Surviving the heartache
And madness
In the heart of the night
We run like bandits
Two hungry hearts under the gun
In the heart of the night
When we find each other
We're stealing love on the run
In the heart of the night
Heart of the night
In the heart of the night
When we find each other
We're stealing love on the run
In the heart of the night
Heart of the night
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
