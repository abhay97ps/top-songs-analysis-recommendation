You're back in my arms
Now you're back where you belong
But baby i still recall those crazy days
We found new ways of hurting each other
The magic was gone
Now it's come back just as strong
But now that we found ourselves a second chance
It doesn't mean that we'll have another
Please let's give a little more this time
Let's try to keep in mind our love is on the line
Darling please, let's give it all we got
This could be our last shot
It's so no matter what
Let's remember to be kind
Give a little more 
We had is a dream
And we let it get away
Somebody up there look at us and knew
That me and you should still be together
Know what love means
And Im learning day by day
No matter how good the feelings feels improves
We gotta work and make it better
Please let's give a little more this time
Let's try to keep in mind our love is on the line
Darling please, let's give it all we got
This could be our last shot
It's so no matter what
Let's remember to be kind
Give a little more, give a little more this time
Let's try this time to be the best that we could be
Let's try to make same old moments stays that we make
And make it work
Baby let's give a little more, give a little more this
Time
