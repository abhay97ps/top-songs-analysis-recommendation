Let's pony again
I'm gonna get on my pony and ride
Ride
Ride
I'm gonna get on my pony and ride
'Til you're by my side
Now, you can shake, shout, stop and smile
And you can run the quarter horse
Or ride
'Til you're by my side
Well, get it
Pony, baby
Shake it, baby
Come on and pony with me
I'm gonna get on my pony and ride
Ride
Ride
I'm gonna swing me a lasso and ride
'Til you're roped and tied
Now, you can shake, shout, stop and smile
And you can jump, thump, all in stride
Or ride
'Til you're by my side
Well, get it
Pony, baby
Shake it, baby
Come on and pony with me
Pony with me
Well, get it
Pony, baby
Shake it, baby
Come on and pony with me
I'm gonna get on my pony and ride
Ride
Ride
I'm gonna get on my pony and ride
'Til you're by my side
Now, you can shake, shout, stop and smile
And you can run the quarter horse
Or ride
'Til you're by my side
Come on and get it
Pony, baby
Shake it, baby
Come on and pony with me
