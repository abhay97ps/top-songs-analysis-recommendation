We're leaving together, but still, it's farewell
And maybe, we'll come back to Earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground 
Will things ever be the same again?
It's the final countdown
The final countdown, oh
We're heading for Venus 
And still, we stand tall
'Cause maybe they've seen us
And welcome us all, yeah
With so many lightyears to go
And things to be found 
I'm sure that we'll all miss her, so
It's the final countdown
The final countdown
The final countdown , oh
The final countdown
Oh, it's the final countdown
The final countdown
The final countdown 
Oh, it's the final countdown
We're leaving together 
We'll all miss her so
It's the final countdown 
Oh, it's the final countdown
Yeah
