The Young Rascals
(written by Felix Cavaliere & Eddie Brigati
I don't know what it's all about
But I feel I"ll soon find out; I'm sure, never felt this secure
It's nothin' like I ever thought it would be
Someone opened up a door for me
A girl like, 
Girl like you. 
Must be you that caused this feelin' in me. 
You that fills me confidently, 
You that brings out the best in me
You....Uhhhhhh......Nobody but you
-----------
I don't know what it's all about
I can't begin to figure out what to do so I leave it to you
Only know that when you're away from me
Nothin' satisfies the need in me
For a girl like 
A girl like you. 
Must be you that caused this feelin' in me. 
You that fills me confidently, 
You that brings out the best in me
You.... Nobody, nobody, Oh, Yeah!
------------
Every time I'm holdin' you close to me
Trouble's gone, it's gone, I'm in ecstasy
With a girl 
A girl like you. 
Someone to love me, H'yeah 
Girl like you 
Someone, someone to understand. 
'Xactly like you, hon 
Girl, girl, girl 
Girl, girl, girl 
Girl, girl........
