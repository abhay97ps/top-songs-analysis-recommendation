Ooh
Can you feel me when I think about you?
With every breath I take every minute
No matter what I do
My world is an empty place
Like I've been wandering the desert for a thousand days 
Don't know if it's a mirage, but I always see your face, baby
I'm missin' you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh
Whoa, whoa
The stars are burning
I hear your voice in my mind 
Can't you hear me calling?
My heart is yearning like the ocean that's running dry
Catch me, I'm falling
It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Won't you save me?
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me
Oh, baby
I'm missin' you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side 
Don't know how I'll survive 
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh
Whoa, whoa
So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
I'm so glad you found me
Stick around me, baby, baby, baby, ooh
It's a world of wonder with you in my life
So hurry, baby, don't waste no more time
And I need you here, I can't explain
But a day without you is like a year without rain, oh
I'm missin' you so much 
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side 
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh
Whoa, whoa, ooh
Ooh
Ooh
