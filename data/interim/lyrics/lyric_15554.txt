Young girl looking to take a ride
Gonna get to love you
If it takes all night
Oh, yeah
Next to you
She`s got what I want
I got what she needs
Me and my baby
And the mirror makes three
Heaven in the backseat
Heaven in the backseat
You can`t turn it down
You won`t turn me round
I know you like it
I love what I see
I got your number
Your number is me
Oh, baby
Start me up
I`ll drive you crazy
With my backseat love
Come on
Fire me up
You`ll be in Heaven
In my backseat, baby
Come on
Start me up
You got to fire me up
Oh, oh
Television off
Radio on
Shook my magic
Have a little fun
I smile like a private eye
I`m looking for the woman
With the perfect plan
Heaven in the backseat
You can`t turn me down
You won`t turn me round
I know you like it
I love what I see
I got your number
Your number is me
Oh, baby
Come on
Start me up
I`ll drive you crazy
With my backseat love
Come on
Fire me up
You`ll be in Heaven
In my backseat, baby
Come on and start me up
Got to fire me up
Oh, oh
Don`t stop me
The body rocking
You gotta love it
Oh, yeah
Hit the spot
Your love is hot
Blood pressure going up
Exploding
Whoa, oh
You can`t turn me down
You won`t turn me round
I know you like it
I love what I see
I got your number
Your number is me
Oh, baby
Come on and start me up
I`ll drive you crazy
With my backseat love
Come on and fire me up
You`ll be in Heaven
With my backseat love
Come on
Start me up
Come on
Fire me up
Come on
Start me up
Oooh, oh, come on
You`ll be in Heaven
Heaven in the backseat
