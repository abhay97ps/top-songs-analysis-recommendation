Day after day
More people come to L.A
Shhh! Don't you tell anybody
The whole place slippin' away
Where can we go
When there's no San Francisco?
Shhh! Better get ready
To tie up the boat in Idaho
Do you know the swim?
You better learn quick, Jim
Those who don't know the swim
Better sing the hymn
Tuna at the bowl
Find fillet of much sole
Ooh ooh, what can you do
With a bushel of wet gold?
Day after day
More people come to L.A
Shhh! Don't you tell anybody
The wholе place shakin' away
Where can wе go
When there's no San Francisco?
Shhh! Better get ready
To tie up the boat in Idaho
Where can we go
When there's no San Diego?
Shhh! Better get ready
To tie up the boat in Idaho
Do you know the swim?
You better learn quick, Jim
Those who don't know the swim
Better sing the hymn
Tuna at the bowl
Find fillet of much sole
Ooh ooh, what can you do
With a bushel of wet gold?
