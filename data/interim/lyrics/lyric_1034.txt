Watch out!
Heart-aches
Heart-aches
Heart-aches
Heart-aches
My loving you meant only heartaches
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me
I can't believe it's just a burning memory
Heartaches
Heartaches
What does it matter how my heart breaks?
I should be happy with someone new
But my heart aches for you
Heart-aches
Heart-aches
Heart-aches
You know, my loving you meant only heartaches
I can't believe it's just a burning memory
