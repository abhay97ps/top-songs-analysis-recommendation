One day you are loving
Like we'll never part
Then you say it's over
Such a change of heart
I go round and round
On the roundabout of love
Sometimes you are gentle
Sometimes very kind
Then without a warning
You can change your mind
I go round and round
On the roundabout of love
I'm going round in circles
What can I do
My love is getting nowhere fast
With you
Even though you promised
To love me evermore
Will I go on waiting
Like I have before
Always going round
Ten feet off the ground
On the roundabout of love with you
I go round and round
On the roundabout of love
I'm going round in circles
What can I do
My love is getting nowhere fast
With you
Even though you promised
To love me evermore
Will I go on waiting
Like I have before
Always going round
Ten feet off the ground
On the roundabout of love with you
La da da da da...
