Well, you admit you like the game but you're not gonna play
You're just ignorin' what you're body's tryin' to say
I get the feelin' that you're playin' and we're both gonna win
I think this angel's about to sin
I get excited just thinkin' what you might be like
I get excited, there's heaven in your eyes tonight
The fire's ignited, down below it's burnin' bright
Oh baby, stay; we got all night, all night
Baby please, I can't please if I'm on my knees tonight
No, baby you don't look that nervous when you bite your lip
You keep 'em open when we kiss, you're a hypocrite
You got my body dancin' tengo in three-four time
This angel's gonna spread her wings tonight
I get excited just thinkin' what you might be like
I get excited, there's heaven in your eyes tonight
The fire's ignited, down below it's burnin' bright
Oh baby, stay; we got all night, all night
We got all night, all night
Baby please, I can't please, if I'm on my knees tonight
Tonight...
Baby, I can feel your heartbeat; can't you feel the heat?
Baby's got cold feet, fire below
Oh baby, stay; we got...
Oh baby, stay; we got all night, all night
We got all night, all night
Baby please, I can't please if I'm on my knees
All night, all night
We got all night, all night
Baby please, I can't please if I'm on my knees tonight
Tonight!
