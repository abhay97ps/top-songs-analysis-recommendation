Every day my imagination anticipates
Ways I can show you how much I love you
Candy, flowers, priceless pearls
Romantic trips around the world, baby, just think
You and me floating on the Caribbean sea
So exotic, I just can just feel heat
And there?s candlelight with the moon so high
Hangin? in a Spanish sky but before right or wrong, hoo, girl
You?ve got to let me know
Just how far to let this go
Help me
Show me
You?ve got to take my hand
Show me that you?ll understand
Help me
Show me
And if time won?t allow for such an affair, darling, I don?t care
We don?t have to go anywhere
We?ll stay at home, turn the lights down low, play our favorite video
Or better still make our own private show
And we?ll love so deeply, I feel your arms completely
With love that only we can share
I?ll taste your sweet lips, caress your fingertips
But before I go on, hoo, ooh, ooh
You?ve got to let me know
Just how far to let this go
Help me
Show me
You?ve got to take my hand
Show me that you?ll understand
Help me, show me
Baby, please, please let me know
How to be everything for you
Just show me what to do, oh, baby
I?ll make sweet love to you all night long
I?m holding on to the words of this love song, baby
Hoo
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Show me, show me
Oh, girl
Hey, ey
You?ve got to let me know
Just how far to let this go
Help me
Show me
You?ve got to take my hand
Show me that you?ll understand
Help me
Show me
You?ve got to let me know
Just how far to let this go
Help me
Show me
You?ve got to take my hand
Show me that you?ll understand
Help me
Show me
You?ve got to let me know
Just how far to let this go
Help me
Show me
You?ve got to take my hand
Show me that you?ll understand
Help me
Show me
