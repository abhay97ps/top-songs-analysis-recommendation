Ah-ah
Ah-ah
I came here tonight to get sh- out of my mind
I'm gonna take what I find, uh-oh, yeah
So open the box, don't need no key, I'm unlocked
And I won't tell you to stop, uh-oh, yeah
Hey boy! I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you in, no need for talkin'
Hey boy! So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walkin'
All I wanna do is love your body
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
All I wanna do is love your body
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's true what you heard, I am a freak, I'm disturbed
So come on and give me your worst, uh-oh, yeah, haha
We're moving faster than slow, if you don't know where to go
I'll finish off on my own, oh-oh, yeah, yeah
Hey boy! I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you in, no need for talkin'
Hey boy! So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walkin', say, say, hey!
All I wanna do is love your body
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
All I wanna do is love your body
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
I think you already know my name
I think you already know my name!
Hey, hey, yeah! Ha, alright, say!
I think you already know my name
All I wanna do is love your body 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
All I wanna do is love your body
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
