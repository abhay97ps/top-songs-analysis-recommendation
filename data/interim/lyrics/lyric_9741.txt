Kate wasn't into moderation
That's what led to her frustration
And the state of her crumbling heart
She said "I'm not a girl for temperance
Though I know its at my hearts expense
But a downward spiral has to have a rock bottom"
She paints the walls blue and green
Singing about her lovers and dreams
And explains her helpless desperation
Take off your shoes
Unravel your blues
This place is full of beggars and choosers
But the consequence of her liberty was bad
My heart wants to go one way
My mind don't agree
Cause they
They have fallen out recently
"Know thy self"
She said as she guided me round the land of the dead
Introducing her friends stuck in the same mess
Ships might be built for sailing my love
And easels made for painting
But you ain't no sailor and I'll never be camera shy
My heart wants to go one way
My mind don't agree
Cause they
They have fallen out recently
She said
"Will I praise again?
Oh will I praise again?"
So my heart wants to go one way
My mind don't agree
They
They have fallen out recently

She said
"Oh will I praise again?
Oh will I praise again?"
"Will I
Will I sing again?
Will I praise again?"
