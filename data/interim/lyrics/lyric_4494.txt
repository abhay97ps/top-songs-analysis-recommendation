I hear a new girl moved into town
And now your baby ain't no where around
And now you think you're in despair
You feel the still the cold night
Clinging in the air
Love's a game, you're in it
And you were so proud of it
Someone you can't depend on
Someone you can't rely on
No matter what you say he won't come
Running back to your arms
It's all over baby and it won't do no good to cry
How you think I felt when you
You left me then
You never said a word except that we're thru'
And you didn't fight it all the way
I don't care
You just don't mean that much to me this way
Love's a game, you're in it
And you were so proud of it
Someone you can't depend on
Someone you can't rely on
No matter what you say he won't come
Running back to your arms
It's all over baby and it won't do no good to cry
Love's a game, you're in it
And you were so proud of it
Someone you can't depend on
Someone you can't rely on
No matter what you say he won't come
Running back to your arms
It's all over baby and it won't do no good to cry
