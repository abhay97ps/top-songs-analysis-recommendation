If tomorow all the things were gone
You worked for all your life
And you had to start again
With just your children and your wife
You'd thank your lucky stars to be living here today
Coz the flag don't stand for freedom
And they can't take that away
And i'm proud to be an american
Where at least i know i'm free
And i won't forget the man who died
Who gave that right to me
And i gladly stand up next to you
And defend here still today
Cause there ain't no doubt i love this land
God bless the usa
From the lakes of metastoda
To the hills of tenasea
Across the planes of texas
From sea to shining sea
From deatroit down to huston
And new york to LA
Well theres pride in every american heart
And its time we stand as say
And i'm proud to be an american
Where at least i know i'm free
And i won't forget the man who died
Who gave that right to me
And i gladly stand up
Next to you
And defend here still today
Cause there ain't no doubt i love this land
God bless the usa
And i'm proud to be an american
Where at least i know i'm free
And i won't forget the man who died
Who gave that right to me
And i gladly stand up
Next to you and defend here still today
Cause there ain't no doubt i love this land
God bless the usa
