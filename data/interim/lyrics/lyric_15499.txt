Lets jam, let's jam 
Lets jam, let's jam 
Lets jam, let's jam 
When your body gets this feeling and you don't know what it is
Got you moving, got you grooving, got you rapping with a few
And you know that you were grooving cause you feel it in your soul
When the Latin turns us flowing cause the power takes control
It's that Latin.... Activity
Lets Jam Lets Jam 
It's that Latin.... Activity 
Lets Jam Lets Jam 
Roll the track, step back and let me activate
A lighter sound provided by Jammin' James
On a flex, guess what's coming next
A dope rhyme by the D, double T-X
On the mic to engage in a row
Pump the grounds and will act like an active flow
Just for you and your crew so you can taste
The rhythm from this Latin race
As it takes control of your body and soul
Feel the physical change and you'll be sold
You can't stop what start to takes to take place
Your body starts to grove to the digital base
That's what happens as you can see
Now let the crew explain the Latin activity
Latin Activity
Its that Latin... Activity 
Lets Jam Lets Jam 
Teardrop put the others in a sickness
A Latin female dope to get witness
Hype after track with a lyrical concept
A brown queen known to break it down in one step
So legit, the microphone just pass it
Right to me, the one that's chosen to grasp it
Just drop the mic that you were holding
Cause if a Lighter Shade of Brown is how I'm rolling
Latina taking over the microphone and rocking the place
With a little bit of soul and treble of bass
As I rock, hip-hop, non-stop and make you dance
And have a question are you still in the trance
En ingles o español, come quieran el ritmo
Muevan sus pies y bailen al ritmo
Asemos bailar es me misión
Y Latin active es la canción
Latin Activity
It's that Latin Activity 
Lets Jam Lets Jam 
I get Latin active when I grab my microphone
Browning on my tip, begging me to come home
I know they want more, screaming from an encore
Fellas get jealous so they try to ignore
The O, to the D, to the M-I-M
We rock the lyrics and before you know it, bam
We got you dancing to our song
With the Lighter Shade of Brown, well hey its on
Once again my friend, you got to have this soul
Get on the dance floor, lose control
When I lose control, I get sort of active
My mind starts banging form of Latin
Yo tengo derecho de ser una estrella
Porque mi primas son marivellas
Im a one dope Latino mi languaje mas fino
Porque soy Latino activo
Its that Latin... Activity 
Lets Jam Lets Jam 
Its that Latin... Activity 
Lets Jam Lets Jam 
Latin, Latin, Latin
