I wanna go home where I belong
'Cause now I'm just a lonely teenager
When I was sixteen, ran away all alone on a stray
What can I do, what can I say
I'm a lonely teenager
Now I'm seventeen, still alone
Wondering if I should go home
Or maybe stay out of my own
I'm a lonely teenager
I'd love to go back home where I belong
I know I'll be alright
If I just stay out of sight
I wanna go home where I belong
'Cause now I'm just a lonely teenager
I'd love to go back home where I belong
I know I'll be alright
If I stay out of sight
I wanna go home where I belong
'Cause now I'm just a lonely teenager, lonely teenager
