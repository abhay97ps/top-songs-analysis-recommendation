Ah-hah
Ah-hah-ooo. Ooooooooo....
Pray God you can cope
I'll stand outside
This woman's work
This woman's world
Ooooh it's hard on a man
Now his part is over
Now starts the craft of the Father
I know you've got a little life in you left
I know you've got a lot of strength left
I know you've got a little life in you yet
I know you've got a lot of strength left
I should be crying but I just can't let it show
I should be hoping but I can't stop thinking
All the things we should've said that I never said
All the things we should have done that we never did
All the things we should have given but I didn't
Oh darling make it go
Make it go away
Give me these moments
Give them back to me
Give me that little kiss
Give me your talking hands
Give me your hand baby
Give me your pretty hand
Ooooh oooh oooh
You're loved child
Whatever you need baby
Give me your hand
Give me your hand
Oh I should be crying but I just can't let it go
I should be hoping but I can't stop
Thinking and thinking and thinking
Of all the things we should've said that we never said
And all the things we should have done that we never did
All the things that you wanted from me
All the things that you needed from me
All the things I should have given but I didn't
Oh darling make it go
Just make it go away
