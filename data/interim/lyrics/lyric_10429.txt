Why, this car could be systematic
Hydromatic, ultramatic
Why, it could be Greased Lightnin'!
Greased Lightnin'
We'll get some overhead lifters and four-barrel quads, oh yeah
Keep talking, whoa, keep talking
Fuel injection cutoffs and chrome-plated rods, oh yeah
We'll get her ready, I'll kill to get her ready
With a four-speed on the floor, they'll be waiting at the door
You know that ain't no shit
We'll be getting lots of tit in Greased Lightnin'
 Go Greased Lightnin', you're burning up the quarter-mile
 Go Greased Lightnin', you're coasting through the heat lap trials
You are supreme, the chicks'll scream
For Greased Lightnin'
Purple fringe tail lights and 30-inch fins, oh yeah 
A Palomino dashboard and duel muffler twins, oh yeah 
With new pistons, plugs, and shocks, I can get off my rocks
You know that I ain't bragging, she's a real pussy wagon
Greased Lightnin'
 Go Greased Lightnin', you're burning up the quarter-mile
 Go Greased Lightnin', you're coasting through the heat lap trials
You are supreme, the chicks'll scream
For Greased Lightnin'
 Go Greased Lightnin', you're burning up the quarter-mile
 Go Greased Lightnin', you're coasting through the heat lap trials
You are supreme, the chicks'll cream
For Greased Lightnin'
Lightnin', lightnin', lightnin'
Lightnin', lightnin', lightnin', lightnin', lightnin'
