Something inside of me is
Taking it hard each day
Something inside of me is
Making me feel this way
Whenever you're near me
You've got me thinking of you
Something about your eyes
Won't let me look away
Something about your smile
That's making it hard to say
Whenever you're near me
You've got me thinking of you
You know, you've got me
Singing a song
Whenever you're around me
I just want to belong
To you, I would
Give all of my love
I wish that I could tell you
All what I'm thinking of
You know, you've got me
Singing a song
Whenever you're around me
I just want to belong
To you, I would
Give all of my love
I wish that I could tell you
All what I'm thinking of
Something inside of me
Won't let me begin the day
Something inside of me
Is making it hard to say
Whenever you're near me
You've got me thinking of you
Whenever you're near me
You've got me thinking of you
Whenever you`re near me
You've got me thinking of you
