Stone
Hear that whistle, it's ten o'clock
Come on baby, it's time to rock
I'm so happy I got you here
Keeps me grinnin' from ear to ear
CHORUS:
Oooooh-weeee, this feelin's killin' me
Aaaaaah-shucks, well
I wouldn't stop it for a million bucks
I love you so
Just hold me tight and don't let go
Thunder, lightnin', wind and rain
Love is hummin' inside my brain
I'm so eager I'm nearly dyin
You been keepin' your lips from mine
CHORUS
Hound dog barkin' upside the hill
Love is draggin' him through the mill
If it wasn't for havin' you
I'd be barkin' and hollerin' too
CHORUS
One day baby, you'll cook me yet
I'll be hollerin', and soaken' wet
One thing baby, I'll never stand
Your lips kissin' some other man
CHORUS
Just hold me tight
Just hold me tight
Just hold me tight
