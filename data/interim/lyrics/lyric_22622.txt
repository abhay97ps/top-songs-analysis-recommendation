Don't give up, I know you can see
All the world and the mess that we're making
Can't give up and hope God will intercede
Come on back
Imagine that we could get it together
Stand up for what we need to be
Because crying won't save or feed a hungry child
Can't lay down and wait for a miracle to change things
So lift up your eyes, lift up your heart
Singing
Mercy, will we overcome this?
Oh, one by one, could we turn it around?
Maybe carry on just a little bit longer?
And I'll try to give you what you need
Me and you and you and you
We just want to be free, yeah yeah
But you see
All the world is just as we've made it
And until we've got a new world
I got to say that
Love is not a whisper or a weakness
No, love is strong
Now we got to get together, yeah
We gotta get, got to get, got to get
Until there is no reason to fight
Mercy, will we overcome this?
Yeah, one by one, could we turn it around?
Baby, carry on just a little bit longer?
And I'll try to give you what you need
Yeah
Oh, mercy, will we overcome this?
Oh, have we come too far to turn it around?
Oh, is it ask too much to be a little bit stronger?
'Cause I wanna give you what you need
Mercy, what will become of us?
One by one, could we turn it around?
Maybe carry on just a little bit longer?
And I'll try to give you what you need
