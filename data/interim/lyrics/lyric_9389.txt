Do you live on a lonely island?
Do you live on a lonely hill?
Are you perched in a pot in the dry dry air
On a lonely window sill?
Have you finally found that you're an only child?
Do you stare at the ground where the flowers grow wild?
Or have you taken root, don't plan to move
Till the sunlight don't come round?
Da da da da, da da da da da da da da
Do you think about the future?
Do you think about the past?
Does your time drag along like the pace of this song?
Do you dream of it draggin' fast?
Have you suddenly seen that you're a single seed?
Do your brothers and your sisters give you woe like the weeds?
Or are you scared of the sun, don't plan to run
Til the rain starts coming down?
Oh, down in the valley, in the soil of your soul is your family. 
Don't dilly-dally, don't boil up a bowl, it's your family. 
And when you think that you've thought about all that you got
Just remember that thinkin' that is thinkin' a thought
And the voices in your head think you’re better off dead
But they're the only company you got, yeah, the only company you got!
Da da da da, da da da da da da da da
Do you need somebody to want for?
Do you want somebody to need?
Or have you learned how to live out of lonesome love?
Like a low-life, I call me?
Perhaps you believe there is no need to grieve
You are all that you need to be alone and free
Or are you scared to run — don’t plan to run —
Til the fool's gold has been found?
And the sunlight don't come round?
And the rain keeps comin'
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
