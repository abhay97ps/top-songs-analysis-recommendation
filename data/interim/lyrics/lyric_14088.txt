Is she here?
When she gets here send her up to my room
You got it?
Cherry
Tina
Cherry
Her real name is Tina
Tina, Tina
But she plays a trick every day
It won't seem like it when you need her
But she has some nasty names
She works, and works
Her hips, her thighs
She works, and works
Her lips, her eyes
She works, and works
Her hair, her clothes
She works it
Ohh la la
Very hard, Tina
Very hard, Tina
Tina, Tina
Tina, Tina, Cherry
Tina, Tina
Tina, Tina, Cherry
Ohh la la
You got it?
She says her daddy is Creole 
And her mom is Latin
All the guys flip out when they see her
To me she's not happening
She works, and works
Me and the wrong guy
She works, and works
She tries to be a lie
She works, and works
All of my friends
She works it
Ohh la la
Tina, Tina
Tina, Tina, Cherry
Tina Cherry here's a message to you
I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do
Tina tell me what you want to be
I already know that you're easy
Tina baby don't make it hard
We're almost there let me park my car
I want a chocolate shake and a raspberry cake
To top it off I want your cherry to go
