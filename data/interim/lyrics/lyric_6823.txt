I went and bought a new perfume
So this summer wouldn't smell like you
Started living in those shorts you didn't like
'Cause they got me attention from other guys
Turns out they still do
Remembered I love Motown
Stopped finding reasons not to go out
Made friends that I don't have to share
They don't know you, so they don't care
What I say about you
You'd hardly recognize me
With my rose colored glasses gone
And you might find it surprising
I stopped taking shit from anyone
I got a new tattoo so you don't know what I look like
When my clothes are off
And now it's strawberry blonde
Sometimes I still get wasted
To stop thinking about the time I wasted
I started taking long walks again
And I started talking to God again
You'd hardly recognize me
With my rose colored glasses gone
And you might find it surprising
I stopped taking shit from anyone
I got a new tattoo so you don't know what I look like
When my clothes are off
And now it's strawberry blonde
Now it's strawberry blonde
If I ran into you now might take a minute for you to know it was me
I don't look like the girl in all of our pictures
But now I'm the one you would never let me be
You'd hardly recognize me
With my rose colored glasses gone
And you might find it surprising
That you can't turn people into who you want
I got a new tattoo so you don't know what I look like
When my clothes are off
And now it's strawberry blonde
Now it's strawberry blonde
