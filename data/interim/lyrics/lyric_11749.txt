Chorus 1]
Wrack my brain, wrack my brain
Till my head's filled with pain
Wrack my brain
All dried up, i'm all dried up
All i have's this empty cup
All dried up
What i have, you don't want
What you want, i can't give
I got out of touch with you and yours
The way that you live
I try to do my best for you
While the sky pours down the rain
Wrack my brain
With a will there's a way
But there's no way i can see
Coming up with something you'd enjoy
As much as Tv
All the same, i play the game
Up and down old memory lane
