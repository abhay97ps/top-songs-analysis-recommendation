I've been all over this country
I've been halfway 'round the world
I've been traveling so dog gone much
That I haven't got a steady girl
Somebody to love 
Somebody to love 
Somebody to call me turtledove
Somebody to love
Yes, I guess I've been lucky
I've had me fortune and fame
But I would give up my rovin' days
Just to change some girlie's name
Somebody to love 
Somebody to love 
Somebody to call me turtledove
Somebody to love
I've been hurtin' 
Such a long, long time 
I've been searchin' 
Where's that girl of mine?
Won't you hear me now
If there's somebody listenin'
Won't you answer my plea?
Won't you send me a good, good girl
Just to spend her life with me?
Somebody to love 
Somebody to love 
Somebody to call me turtledove
Somebody to love
I've been hurtin' 
Such a long, long time 
And I've been searchin' 
Where's that girl of mine
Won't you hear me now
If there's somebody listenin'
Won't you answer my plea?
Won't you send me a good, good girl
Just to spend her life with me
Somebody to love 
Somebody to love 
Somebody to call me turtledove
Somebody to love
Somebody to love 
Somebody to love 
Somebody to call me turtledove
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Need someone to love
I need me your love
