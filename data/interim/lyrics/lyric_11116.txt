Runnin' from the feelin'
Can't disguise
Findin' all your reasons
Were alibis
You can say your breezin'
It's not that way at all...
Youre headed for a fall
Lookin' for excuses
To hide your shame
But all your little loose ends
Don't change a thing
You're the one who loses
By runnin' from it all
Backs against the wall
Youre headed for a fall
For a fall
Starin' out your window
At the pourin' rain
Tryin' to hide your sorrow
In your sweet champagne
You can't lose your troubles
In the bubbles of your wine
Only makes them easier to find
Easier to find
All your wasted chances
How do they feel
All your sweet romances
Were never real
Cause you're the one who dances
Got to pay the piper's call
Backs against the wall
You're headed for a fall
You're headed for a fall
You're headed for a fall
For a fall
You're headed for a fall
You're headed for a fall
You're fallin', I see you fallin'
For a fall
You're fallin', I see you fallin'
You're headed for a fall...
