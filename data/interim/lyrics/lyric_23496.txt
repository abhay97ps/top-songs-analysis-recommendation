She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
I like you talking dirty, I like your filthy love
You like the way I hold you when we are falling in love
 In love
 If it's love
Then I don't want to come back up
Girl I know you're a handful 'cause you know what you like
You might be hard to handle but I'ma show you tonight
 Tonight
 What it's like
 When you're
Stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop, once ain't enough
Better lock this down, better box it up
Gotta work me out, make it real
Gotta make it count, get stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop, once ain't enough
Better lock this down, better box it up
Gotta work me out, make it real
Gotta make it count, get stuck on a feeling
Stuck on a feeling
Check it out
Let's go hide out in private
Won't you show me your place? 
A little peace and quiet 
Where we can both misbehave 
Misbehave 
It's okay  when you're
Stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop, once ain't enough
Better lock this down, better box it up
Gotta work me out, make it real
Gotta make it count, get stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop, once ain't enough
Better lock this down, better box it up
Gotta work me out, make it real
Gotta make it count, get stuck on a feeling
What, what, what, what, what?
Stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a, she got me, she got, she got
Wheelin' and dealin, appealin, I'm realin'
Ya still in love with me, all green
I'm at it, romantic, no panic, organic
Slide right next to me, in ecstasy
Now who could ever make you feel like I felt
You're laying on your bed, just playing with yourself
You're moaning and groaning, you're squirming and squealing
Guess it's true, I left you
Stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop, once ain't enough
Better lock this down, better box it up 
Gotta work me out, make it real 
Gotta make it count, get stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop, once ain't enough 
Better lock this down, better box it up 
Gotta work me out, make it real 
Gotta make it count, get stuck on a feeling 
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
Stuck on a, stuck on a feeling
She got me
Yeah, yeah, she got me, she got me
Yeah, yeah, she got me, she got me
Stuck on a, stuck on a, stuck on a, stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
