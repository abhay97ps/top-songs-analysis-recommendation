See, there comes a time in every man's life when he's got to fall in love
And he's got to find the right woman and I think I found it in you
Oh, oh
Woke up this morning to breakfast in bed
The coffee was hot and the eggs I got was right, so right
Girl, I gotta tell you that you're just too good for me
Oh, the things that you do makes it easy loving you
Even a blind man could see.  Oh, oh
Every night, I get down on my knees
And give thanks for you for the things that you do
'Cause only a fool would let go of you.  
Loving you  is so easy for me  to do
Said it's like ABC.  
Simple as 123
Said that I'm loving you, girl, 
Oooh, keep loving me
It's a shame that I, I love you, baby
Said it's like ABC  and it's like 123.  
Said that I'm loving you, girl
Oh.   Oh, baby, baby
Driving in my car
I see something that'll look good on you.  Oh
Said I can't ignore it, but hell, I can't afford it
What's a simple man like me to do
If you should ever leave me, I'll go out of my mind
'Cause I want you  and I need you.  
And I don't wanna be wasting my time.   No, no
Every night, I get down on my knees 
And give thanks for you,  the things that you do
'Cause only a fool would let go of you.  
 Ohhhhhhh, baby
Said it's like, it's like ABC, 
123.   
I'm loving you.  
Keep loving me.  
 If you need me
You can call me on the pho-o-o-o-one
It's like ABC, simple as 123
Heh, heh.  
Oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh
Said I feel some love coming on.  
Said I can feel it way down deep in my bones
And I wanna shout it on out  from the mountaintops
Said I gotta, gotta, gotta let you know that I'm never gonna let you go
I'm gonna keep loving you,  'cause that's all I want
La, la, la, la, deedle, deedle, deedle dee
 Together
 Together
 Oh, baby
Said I love you, baby.  
Said I wanna keep on saying I don't wanna beg
Said I wanna keep on saying I love you, I love you
Said I don't ever wanna lose you
 Wanna give you my love, wanna give you my time
Then I wanna keep coming, I'm gonna make you mine
 Hey, baby
 Yeah.   Baby, yeah.  
Baby, baby, yeah.   Baby, yeah.  
Don't ever wanna stop loving you, that's all I wanna do
