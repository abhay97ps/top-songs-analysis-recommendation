I don't need friends
They don't wanna see someone like me doin' better than them
Still can't believe it, I really got rich
Tell a bitch or a hater to suck on my dick 
Never give focus on hate I receive 
I could achieve more than they could dream 
I know they ain't tough enough to be me 
Makin' money like magic, got tricks up my sleeve
Too many vibes, I brought sand to the beach
Tеst drive 'em all, but I don't wanna keep
Pop me an X 'causе I gotta get geeked
Talkin' 'bout sleep, I get two days a week
They say they drippin', I'm kissin' my teeth
They burnin' it out, ain't no chrome left for me
When I was broke, I was feelin' uneasy
Now I get paid and I'm feelin' relieved
Call up a thottie, I hit when I please
Whatever it take, might just pay her to leave
My bitch Latina, my choppa is Russian
Wheezy on beats, that's expensive percussion
Can't get no Act', so we sippin' on red
Can't talk to my bro 'cause he still in the feds
Can't get these demons up outta my head
Can't slide on the opps 'cause they already dead
What I can do 
I can go get some money
Whole pool heated up and it cost a hundred thousand 'Cause I left this shit runnin' 
I can turn nothin' to somethin'
Book me a show and I fly out the country 
I eat at Nobu when I get the munchies 
Drivin' in bucket seats, had to serve buckets
I put the top down and I let her suck it 
They don't wanna see someone like me doin' better than them
Still can't believe it, I really got rich
Tell a bitch or a hater to suck on my dick 
Never give focus on hate I receive 
I could achieve more than they could dream 
I know they ain't tough enough to be me 
Makin' money like magic, got tricks up my sleeve
Too many vibes, I brought sand to the beach
Test drive 'em all, but I don't wanna keep
Pop me an X 'cause I gotta get geeked
Talkin' 'bout sleep, I get two days a week
They say they drippin', I'm kissin' my teeth
They burnin' it out, ain't no chrome left for me
When I was broke, I was feelin' uneasy
Now I get paid and I'm feelin' relieved
I gave a round of applause to myself
I put the baddest lil' bitch on the shelf
I went '21 wagon and sat it on F's
I don't gotta brag, this shit speak for itself
I got stripes in my hood, run the game, I'm the ref
I keep the firearm under my belt
And I run with some real ones who bang to the left
Marchin' band, baby, I know how to step
I can't speak on the business, it's quiet as kept
Look like a diva, I know how to treat her
I know how to keep her, she fine as hell
I spend a quarter milli' on a Richard Mille
I keep quiet, I never gon' tell
I put my life savings in a brown box
I was gettin' that shit in the mail
I keep a mill' cash for the best lawyer
I ain't worried 'bout goin' to jail
I just spent 80K on some Hermès bags
50K more on Chanel
I got the ball now, ain't gon' ball-hog
I'ma pass it to bro for the lay up
I just went Prada T-shirt with the Prada jacket
You can tell I'm a motherfuckin' player, yeah, Baby
I don't need friends
They don't wanna see someone like me doin' better than them
Still can't believe it, I really got rich
Tell a bitch or a hater to suck on my dick 
Never give focus on hate I receive 
I could achieve more than they could dream 
I know they ain't tough enough to be me 
Makin' money like magic, got tricks up my sleeve
Too many vibes, I brought sand to the beach
Test drive 'em all, but I don't wanna keep
Pop me an X 'cause I gotta get geeked
Talkin' 'bout sleep, I get two days a week
They say they drippin', I'm kissin' my teeth
They burnin' it out, ain't no chrome left for me
When I was broke, I was feelin' uneasy
Now I get paid and I'm feelin' relieved
