When we first met
On the rooftop of that hotel
Everyone around us could see, we got on well
So we took the elevator straight up to forty second floor
When we kissed in your doorway, it's like we never kissed before
I was in love again, and I knew that you were too
We spent every night together, nothing was kaboom
And early in the morning the sunlight in your hair
I knew we stick together, you were the answer to my prays
How could I be so wrong?  For so long 
How could I be so wrong?  For so long 
How could I  be so wrong?  For so long 
All the time we spent together so close and true
Living for each other together thru the blue 
Two stars like lovers beneath the Tennessee moon
We near as we could be
Johnny Cash and June
How could I be so wrong?  For so long 
How could I be so wrong?  For so long
How could I  be so wrong?  for so long 
For so long 
For so long
Then I heard a rumor, from an old friend of mine
He been seeing someone else, I never saw the signs
I hope he make she happy, and that he is happy too
And just like all the others, I'll get over you
But how could I be so wrong?  For so long 
How could I be so wrong?  For so long 
How could I  be so wrong?  For so long 
How could Iâ€¦ be so wrong? For so Long
