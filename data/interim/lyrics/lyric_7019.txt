Wear this ring with love forever
Wear this ring with love
This ring means I love you
And this ring means you love me too
It's a ring to seal our love together
You for me
Me always for you
And you be my woman
And, baby
I'll be your man
If you just wear this ring with love forever
This ring will tell a story
Think of all the good things we got to
Settle down and have two little children
A boy for me and a sweet little girl for you
How sweet it is for a man to love his woman
And, baby, for a woman to love her man
Please, wear this ring with love
Forever
Forever
Forever 
And more
Wear this ring with love
Wear this ring with love
Now just put this ring on your finger
And we will be on a ship of love
You and me having lots of fun together
Making real
All the things we dream of
How sweet it is for a man to love his woman
And, baby, for a woman to love her man
Please, wear this ring with love
Wear this ring with love
Wear this ring with love
Wear this ring with love
