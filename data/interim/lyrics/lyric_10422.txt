Flyin' high on a feelin'
Flyin' high
Flyin' high on a good thing
Flyin' high on your love
I knew we could make it from the beginning
The first time I saw you passing by, whoa
To me it was much more than a notion
It was the fire in your eyes
Flyin' high on a feelin'
Flyin' high
Flyin' high on a good thing
Flyin' high on your love
Your face has a glow, girl, like a sunrise
You speak in a whisper like the wind, whoa
And when I touch you, I see clearly
That we can be more than just friends
Ooh, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Flyin' high on a feelin'
Flyin' high
Flyin' high on a good thing
Flyin' high on your love
On your love
On your love
On your love, yeah
Oh, oh, sweet darling
Oh, wanna say
Your love takes me higher, oh
Say it again, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Say it again
Oh, sweet lady, hey hey, oh
