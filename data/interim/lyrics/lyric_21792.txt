Hello, hello, baby, you called
I can't hear a thing
I have got no service
In the club, you say, say
Wha-wha-what did you say?
Are you breakin' up on me
Sorry I cannot hear you I'm kinda busy
K-Kinda busy, k-kinda busy
Sorry I cannot hear you I'm kinda busy
Just a second
It's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me
I'm kinda busy
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna think anymore
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna talk anymore
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh 
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh 
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh 
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh 
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone 
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone! 
Call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone 
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Boy, the way you blowing up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster
Leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home
'Cause this is a disaster
Calling like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer
Not that I don't like you
I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in grand central station
Dancin' 
Dancin' 
Tonight I'm dancin' 
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh 
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh 
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh {Stop telephonin' me}
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
