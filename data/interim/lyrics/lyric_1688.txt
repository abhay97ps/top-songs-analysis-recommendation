Well, they're dancing all over, yeah
They're dancing everywhere I go
You know I see 'em on the TV
And I hear it on the radio
Gonna twist, gonna stomp with you
Do the wobble and the watusi too
Locomotion here we come
Gonna have some kinda' fun
Well, they're moving and a grooving, yeah
They're dancing with all they got
I see them shimmy waddle waddle
And they're stomping like I don't know what
Gonna twist, gonna stomp with you
Do the wobble and the watusi too
Locomotion here we come
Gonna have some kinda' fun
Work out
Oh, yeah
Well, they're dancing all over, yeah
They're dancing everywhere I go
You know I see 'em on the TV
And I hear it on the radio
Gonna twist, gonna stomp with you
Do the wobble and the watusi too
Locomotion here we come
Gonna have some kinda' fun
Well, they're moving and a grooving, yeah
They're dancing with all they got
I see them shimmy waddle waddle
And they're stomping like I don't know what
Gonna twist, gonna stomp with you
Do the wobble and the watusi too
Locomotion here we come
Gonna have some kinda' fun
