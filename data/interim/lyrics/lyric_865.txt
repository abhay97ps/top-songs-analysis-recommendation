Live colossal, hollows will make you sing the gospel
Hostile with any fossil who think they stopping my rise slow
Live life apostle, twistin' pasta in Ferragamo
Gamma ray radiating, my rage inflated as Pacs was
The flaming gospel, gotchu, snatch the lame out you
Brain on the A-train, my nuts banging her tonsils
And i could give a fuck if she militant
A 9 to 5 bitch, or a hoodrat ho who don't give a shit
Hopped out, R. Kelly goggles on from 96'
Real grimy nigga, but he still tote a shiny grip
Every 6 months, that nigga Johnny in Dubai and shit
Better than these niggas and it's obvious
Niggas throwing shots but I ain't ducking em cuz eX don't duck shit
When I see em, Imma snuff every effin one of them
Effortless flow, niggas tried and make me kind and shit
But I like violence I like wildin' nigga that's my kind of shit
Dollars spent like an economist on Wali moccasins, Versace hour like Big Poppa on a yacht inside of it
Time is it, jump inside me dick until your mind repent for thinking that these wild vagina kids could ever rhyme with him
Flow is tight as rusty plier grips
A time bomb ticking bout to blow, like invader zim
Fuck this whole shit up, fuck this whole system
Youse an asshole a mental midget, i should uppercut your scrawny ass right through the ceiling, nigga
No, I don't feel these niggas, yup imma kill these niggas
Understand the truth, there can never be no split decisions, ho
So when you think about the best you say me
Hold guns and terrorize, cock back and sterilize
Flip, making cheddar rise, pitch living better lives
Snitch then we sever ties, I don't respect that
Queens in my bloodstream, word to my Mets hat
Silk over shoulders cashmere coats, we fresh black 
I been totin' niggas, fall back and move graciously
Fuck being stuck in a box, I think spaciously 
Cartier, cocaine, cardiology
I ain't gone chill if there's beef, you gotta body me 
Cherry red beamer, fried shrimp from El Tina
Official with them buster niggas, wish I was their leader 
But I could never fuck with an imposter
I'd rather play alone than have broke niggas on my roster
Dolo doing donuts in the star playing Who Shot Ya 
My niggas moving crazy flour, your little chain look like you stole it at a baby shower
And your shawty think I'm super cool, she wasn't shit I sent that bitch home in an uber pool
She made seventeen and a half stops, she lives 3.6 miles away and it took her 14 hours. Fuck that bitch.
