Tell me, tell me, baby
Tell me, tell me, baby
Cause I got to know
I really got to know
I can't go on unless
You tell me so
Said it wasn't you, girl
That I saw last night
Dancing and carrying on
With my best friend
Til the early bright
Tell me you were home in bed
Tell me you were
Down with the flu
Tell me anything, baby
But don't let me find out
That you been untrue
Tell me, tell me, baby
Tell me, tell me, baby
Cause I got to know
I really got to know
I can't go on unless
You tell me so
Let me dry these
Tears in my eyes
And have some
Peace in my heart
Tell me the girl
They thought was you
Was a mistake on their part
Tell me you still love me
You do love me
Don't you, baby
Don't you know
Don't you know
I wanna believe in you
Cause I got to know
I really got to know
I can't go on unless
You tell me so
Tell me it wasn't you
That they saw last night
Dancing and carrying on
With my best friend
Til the early bright
Tell me you were home in bed
Tell me you were
Down with the flu
Tell me anything, baby
But don't let me find out
That you been untrue
Tell me, tell me, baby
Tell me, baby
Cause I got to know
I really got to know
I can't go on unless
You tell me so
Tell me, tell me, baby
Tell me, tell me, baby
