Yeah, all right, baby!
I can see her body
Pushing at her clothes
Dancing up a sweat now
And I wonder if she knows
That I want her so bad I'm in physical pain
My imagination taking over again
Started out dancing
Ended up making love
That's what I'm thinking of
Started out dancing
Ended up making love
Working to the rhythm
Looking in her eyes
Trying to send a message
Getting some replies
Feels like she's looking into my soul
Gotta look away just to keep control
Started out dancing
Ended up making love
That's what I'm thinking of
Started out dancing
Ended up making love
I wonder
Did she come alone
I wonder
Could I take her home
I wonder if she's looking for
Just a dance or a little bit more
Two us alone now
Doing what we feel
Dancing close together
I can't believe it's real
'Cause you were wanting me
While I was wanting you
It's sure good luck when a dream comes true
Started out dancing
Ended up making love
I can't get enough
Started out dancing
Ended up making love
Yeah, feels so good now, baby
Just a little bit more
I want her so bad
My imagination
Taking over again
Started out dancing
Ended up making love
Started out dancing
Ended up making love
