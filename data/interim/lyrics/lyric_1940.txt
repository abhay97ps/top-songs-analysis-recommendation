On top of Old Smokey
It was quiet before
But since they learned the Loco-motion
It ain't quiet no more
Well everybody you see there
Has a smile on his face
Cause since they learned the Loco-motion
It's a real swingin' place
Well every Friday night now
They have a record hop
And it ain't til Monday morning
That the dancin' stop
 On top of Old Smokey
 He was quiet before
But since they learned the Loco-motion
 He ain't quiet no more
 They threw away them fiddles
 And their honky guitars
 Now they even have fan clubs
 At all the record stores
 On top of Old Smokey baby
 Well do you hear what I say
 And let me tell you Old Smokey
 It ain't a honky no more
 On top of Old Smokey
 Oh hear what I say
 And let me tell you Old Smokey
 And that's a natural fact
 On top of Old Smokey
 He was a honky before
 Oh yeah baby
 He ain't a honky no more
