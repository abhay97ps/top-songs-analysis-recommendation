Have you ever felt the night
Felt the wind around you
Have you read a book or two
Or have books been reading you
Do clothes affect your mental health
Are your boots reheeled
Could you lead a life of wealth
Delivered wrapped and sealed
Questions all around me
Questions bring me down
Questions all around me
Questions bring me down
Must you be a superstar
To find your means of living
Does it matter who you are
Can't you stomach giving
La la la la la la la la la la la la
Questions all abound me
Questions bring me down
Questions all around me
Questions bring me down
