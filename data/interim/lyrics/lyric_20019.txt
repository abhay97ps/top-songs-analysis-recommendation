Fresh off the jet to the 'jects where the G's at

See me in your city, sitting pretty, know I'm shining dog 
Riding with a couple Latin broads and a China doll 
And you know how we ball , riding in shiny cars 
Walk in designer malls , buy everything we saw
You know about me, dog , don't talk about me, dog 
And if you doubt me, dog , you better out me, dog 
I'm throwed off slightly, bruh, don't wanna fight me, bruh 
I'm fast as lightning, bruh 
You better use your Nikes, bruh 
Know you don't like me 'cause 
Your bitch most likely does 
She see me on them dubs 
In front of every club

Gave every ho a hug

'Cause you don't know me, cuz

Candy on the six-four, leather guts, fishbowl 
Fifty on a pinky ring just to make my fist glow 
Young bitches get low  because I get dough 
So what I'm rich, ho?  I still will pull a kick-door
What you talking shit for and gotta run and get folks?
Got you all yelling, I thought you'd pull out a gun and hit four
But you's a scary dude, believed by very few 
Just keep it very cool  or we will bury you 
See, all that attitude?  Unnecessary, dude 
You never carry tools, not even square, he cube 
You got these people fooled 
Who see me on the tube 
Whatever, try the crew

Fresh off the jet to the block
Burning rubber with the top popped 
My partners busting shots

Your label got got  'cause you are not hot 
I got the top spot , and it will not stop 
Hey, video or not, Doc, we'll bust it 'til the Glock stop
Drag you out that Bentley Coupe
And take it to the chop shop 
Partner, we not y'all , if it may pop off
I'll answer the question 
"Will I get your block knocked off?" 
This what it is, bruh 
Look, I will kill, bruh

Somebody better get bruh 'fore he get sent for
