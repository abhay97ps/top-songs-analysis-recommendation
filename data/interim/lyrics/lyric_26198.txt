Take me on up to Detroit City
Jails are full, the factories empty
Mama's crying, young boys dying
Under that red, white, and blue still flying
Drop me off in Baltimore
Where every other window's got a plywood board
Where dreams become drugs and guns
The only way out is to shoot or run
Stick that in your country song, yeah
Take that one to number one, yeah
And get the whole world singing along, yeah
Stick that in your country song, yeah 
Sing about the man coming back from war
A 23 going on 54
He lost a friend, his sight, his hands
Baby girl he'll never see again
Stick that in your country song, yeah
Take that one to number one, yeah
And get the whole world singing along, man
Stick that in your country song, yeah 
I light the arrow, pull the bow
Shoot that fire right through my soul
Hit my pride, fist up high
I wanna feel the rush, I wanna feel alive
Oh, come on I want to pound the dash
Stomp the gas, drive too fast
Rock me hard, stop my heart
And blow the speakers right out of this car
Stick that in your country song, yeah
And take that one to number one, yeah 
And get the whole world singing along, man
Stick that in your country song
Stick that in your country song
Take that one to number one
I can sing this all night long, yeah
Stick that in your country song, yeah 
Gimme one about the teacher who
Tryna change a life or two
She'll be rocking out all night with you
Tomorrow, she'll be back in a red-brick school
Where kids are climbing off the walls
And it's scary walking down the hall
She's underpaid, she's overworked
Come on, man, shout one out to her
Stick that in your country song, come on
Take that one to number one, yeah
And get the whole world singing along
Stick that in your country song
Stick that in your country song
Take that one to number one, yeah 
And get the whole world singing along, yeah
Stick that in your country song, yeah 
Stick that in your country song, yeah 
Get the whole world singing along 
Stick that in a country song
