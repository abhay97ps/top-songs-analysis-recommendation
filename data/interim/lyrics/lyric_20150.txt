We've got barefoot ladies and tricked out mercedes
And people getting crazy on the boulevard
We've got classic colas and ice cold corona's
And big pool parties in the backyard
I said hey, that's the way we do it
New friends and blue skies that never end
Hey, that's the way we like it
Good times, sunshine and summertime
You'll see straw sombreros and T-Top Camero's
And stereos blasting in the parking lot
You'll see rock hard bodies and bikini hotties
And everybody's got it going on and showing what they've got
I said hey, that's the way we do it
New friends and blue skies that never end
Hey, that's the way we like it
Good times, sunshine and summertime
I said hey everybody, can't you feel the rhythm now?
Hey everybody, don't you wanna party?
Hey everybody, can't you feel the rhythm now?
Hey everybody, don't you wanna party?
I said hey, that's the way we do it
New friends and blue skies that never end
Hey, that's the way we like it
Good times, sunshine and summertime
Hey, that's the way we do it
New friends and blue skies that never end
Hey, that's the way we like it
Good times, sunshine and summertime
Good times, sunshine and summertime
Good times, sunshine and summertime
