Pegs of people line the street
A ball and chain around their feet
Waitin' for a weekend treat
But Easy Rider's got 'em all beat 'cause
Easy rider, he's a glider
 Freedom, every day
 Easy rider, easy glider
Lettin' the wind pay the way
Freedom!
Freedom!
Puts a rocket in his pocket
At the dawn of day
Needs a goodbye kiss in the mornin', mist
You know the man can't stay
Easy rider, he's a glider
 Freedom, every day
 Easy rider, easy glider
Lettin' the wind pay the way
Easy, easy, easy rider
Easy, easy, easy rider
Goin' easy, where you goin'
Gettin' tired of being all alone
Oh, the roads are taking you
Back to where you belong
Oh, ride on!
Talkin' bout easy
