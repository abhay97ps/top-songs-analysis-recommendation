Say you love
Say I'm the one your eyes see
Tell me you need me, need me
Deep down inside, like I need you
You see, I need you to see me through
I wanna hear you say
"Darling, darling, darling, darling, I love you"
Through the rain and through the cold
Together we will never grow old
Sometime the going will get a little tough
And I must admit, living with me can be rough
But I need you to see me through
I get off when you say
"Baby, baby, baby, baby, I love you"
So say 
Say 
You love me 
Would you say... 
Say, say 
You love me 
Let me be, mm, let me be your man
Together I believe we could stand
Let me take your tremblin' hand
Somewhere in God's country
We'll settle on a piece of land
I need you to see me through
I just shake when you say, oh, "I love you"
Keep on sayin' 
Say, oh... 
You love me 
Say you love me, mm...
Say  say, say
Say... 
You love me 
Let me say this again
Let me be, I wanna be your man
Together, together, together we can stand
Oh, let me take you by the hand
Somewhere in God's country
We'll settle on a piece of land
Because I need you to see me through
I wanna hear you say "Darling, darling, I love you"
Keep on sayin' 
Say, oh... 
Oh, you love me 
Oh, say you love me...
Could you say 
Say, say, say... 
You love me 
Say you love me, say you love me
Say, say, say... 
Say you love me, say you love me, say you love me
Say, say... 
Say you love me, say you love me, say you love me
I'll stand by your side 
Promise to be your guide 
If you say you love me 
Say you love me, say you love me, say you love me...
Oh, say...! 
Keep on sayin' 
You love me 
Say you love me, say you love me, say you love me...
