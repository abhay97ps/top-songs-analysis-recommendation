Let's begin with the day I met her
And how fast this good ole boy's world got better
Sky got bluer, the grass got greener
Just the first few seconds after I'd first seen her
Like my favorite song on a new set of speakers
My best old jeans and my broke-in sneakers
A home run pitch floatin' right down the middle
The sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
And when it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
She's right on the money
She's no red lights when I've overslept
She's a three point jump shot that's nothing but net
A hand full of aces, when the dealer's done dealin'
I'm forever on a roll, that's how she's got me feeling
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
And when it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
She's right on the money
She's the best cook that's ever melted cheese
I ain't much around the house, but I aim to please
There's absolutely no reason to doubt her
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
And when it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
She's
Ohhhh, right on the money
She goes directly to my heart
And when it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
She's
 right on the money
Oh, yeah
