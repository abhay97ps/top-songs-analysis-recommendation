There's no need in denying
I know the girls will be crying
Got to bid goodbye
Even though it hurts my pride
You know the fellas
Are jealous, you see
Cause all the girls
Are sweet on me
Here's what they'll be saying
There goes the lover
They're talking bout me
Can't you hear them saying
The girls are broken hearted
For me, they poor grieve
Happy, the guys
Cause they know I'm gonna leave
All the fellas
Know my games uptight
And with the women
I'm right, right, right
Here's what they'll be saying
Talking bout the lover
Can't you hear them saying
They're talking bout me
The guys say I think I'm neat
But when they say it?
The girls know that I'll be gone
And there's no one around
To take my throne
And they need me
And they need me
Here's what they'll be saying
Talking bout the lover
Talking bout me
Yeah, talking bout...
