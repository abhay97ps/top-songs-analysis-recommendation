I'm out here walkin' and talkin' to myself for about 4 hours now...
Heh, love is really a hurting thing
Hey brother, what's going on? Alright
He's got his woman with him
But mine's at home
What time is it...? Damn, almost 12:45
I think Im'ma walk up here and see what's going on, in this discotheque
There's always something going on in there
What becomes of a broken hearted...
Albeit... mm, this looks like the place
Everybody's going in, lemme step on up here, heh
One ticket please
Lord have mercy, everybody's here
Hey, what's going on, man?
Yeah, she's at home
Yeah, she's at home... yeah, she's at home
Let the music play
I just wanna dance the night away
Yeah right here, right here, where I'm gonna stay
All night long
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-wee!
Let the music play on
Just until I feel this misery is gone
Movin', kickin', groovin'
Keep the music strong
On and on and on, and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on, and on and on and on...
I'm out here dancing, and still - huh!
I can't erase the things I feel
The tender love we used to share
Seems it like it's no longer there
I, I've got to hide what's killing me inside
Let the music play
I just want to dance the night away
Yeah right here, right here is where I'm gonna stay
All night long
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Let the music play on
Just until I feel this misery is gone
Oh, movin', kickin', groovin'
Keep the music strong
Oh, let it play on, play it on
Let it play on, play it on
And on, play it on, play it on
And on and on and on...
I think I'm gonna be alright - ha ha ha
If I can make it through the night, oh Lord
I'll just pretend she's here with me
I'll close my eyes, her face I'll see
I know it's make believe, but it's the only hope for me
Let the music play
Oh, I just wanna dance the night away
Here, right here, right here is where I'm gonna stay
All night long
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-wee!
Let the music play on
Just until I feel this misery is gone
Oh, movin', kickin', groovin'
Keep the music strong
Oh, let it play...
Baby, you want to see me laugh
And then you know, that it's only you that I love
I'm not out here looking for a one-night affair
It is just that I'mâ€“ that I'm so hurt inside
That all I wanna do is just dance, dance, dance...
Let the music play
I just wanna dance the night away
Oh, here, right here is where I'm gonna stay
All night long
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-wee!
Let the music play on
Just until I feel this misery is gone
Movin', kickin', groovin'
Keep the music strong
Let it play on, let it play on
Let it play on, please let it play on
Let it play on...
