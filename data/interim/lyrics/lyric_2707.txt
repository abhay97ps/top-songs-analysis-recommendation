One lump of sugar don't compare
To the sweetness of my baby's love and care
She's candy to me, ooh ooh, sweet candy to me
She's sugar, she's spice, everything that's nice
Ooh ooh, sweet candy to me, ooh
She's got a lotta lovin' just for me
Honeydrippin' kisses that sting like a bee
Oh, candy to me, my baby's sweet candy to me
Sweeter than anything I know
You can believe I'll never let her go
'Cause she's sweet candy
Sugar plum, here I come
Sugar plum, here I come
Ooh, baby, candy to me
She's sugar, she's spice, everything that's nice
Ooh, sweet candy to me
Never use sugar in my coffee cup
One of her kisses, woo, is sweet enough
Oh, candy to me, sweet, sweet candy to me
Sweeter to me than sugar cane
In my heart, she'll always remain
Ooh ooh, she's candy to me, my baby's sweet candy to me
Ooh ooh wee, sugar plum
Mmm, mmm, mmm, sugar plum
Mmm, mmm, mmm, sugar plum
