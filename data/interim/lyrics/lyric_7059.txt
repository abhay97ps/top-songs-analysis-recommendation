I remember back a long time ago, in the days of my childhood
In the evenin' when the sun was sinkin' low, walkin' in the wildwood
Skippin' and flippin' through the flowers, we'd go hand-in-hand
Lookin' back on all the happy hours, anyone one could understand
You and me, babe, sure 'nough got to be, babe
Birds of a feather, na na na na na na na na
We should be together like
Birds of a feather, na na na na na na na na
Got to be together like birds of a feather
You and I didn't have a lot of friends, didn't have too much to say
So they never would let us join in all the games they used to play
Seems like it was only yesterday, all the thinkin's you and I
I remember what the kids used to say as we'd go strollin' by
You and me, babe, sure 'nough got to be, babe
Birds of a feather, na na na na na na na na
We should be together like
Birds of a feather, na na na na na na na na
Got to be together like birds of a feather
Time goes rollin' by, and they say that you and I
Must go our separate ways
But birds of a feather will always be together
Your folks didn't want me hangin' 'round, said that I was bad for you
So we'd meet on the other side of town, down a long dark avenue
But they can't keep the 2 of us apart long as you really love me
I got a feelin' way down in my heart, that's the way it's gonna be
Birds of a feather, na na na na na na na na
We should be together like
