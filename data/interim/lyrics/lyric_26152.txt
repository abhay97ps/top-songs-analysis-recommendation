Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, money on the way 
All I see is hundreds all day 
Top chef, fish sautéed
Condo in L.A. , president Rollie with the date 
Pullin' out the foreigns, we can race 
In and out of state 
Nah, we can not relate 
And, I gotta stay laced 
She want us to date 
I see she keepin' faith 
Ah, I'ma make her wait 
Niggas pillowtalk, I really set talk, we'll shoot the whole place
We ain't takin' losses, double M, drove boss
In the six-star loft cookin' fish parquet 
Ice, no skates 
Get it out the pot 
Speed on the cops 
Feelin' like I'm Jigga on a yacht 
People wanna watch 
Milli' on the watch 
It's a Richard Millie on a watch 
Ma ain't gotta cry, GunWunna made it out alive 
Seen a lot of real niggas die 
Look him in the eye, you bad, let me see catch a fly 
The cash got these niggas wildin' out 
Rockstar, open up the circle, make a moshpit 
Swervin' on the Perkys made me car sick 
Brothers don't cuff 'em, this is all our bitch 
Grew up in the trenches, we squabblin'
Make me quick to grab a choppa, start a World War 6 
Gunna got some millions and I barely feel rich 
They been here knockin', ringin' and I don't know who it is 
Ayy, money on the way 
All I see is hundreds all day

Ah, I'ma make her wait 
Remember I served, I was standin' on the curb with a bomb full of nicks 
It's my word , I done capped off bird
I done seen a nigga jump from a slab to a brick 
Cute pink toe, I bit her on the toes
I fuck her like a ho, I make a whole flick 
Proud of baby girl, she can take a whole dick 
She told me she was thirsty, started drinkin' my spit 
Ooh , you ain't never heard this 
I been droppin' hits like bird shit 
They been sendin' threats, but don't worry 
We hoppin' in a rental with a dirty stick 
They ain't give me my money, I'ma murder this bitch 
I'ma murder this bitch 
Rental off the Rollie, just went way in the ditch 
Young Gunna not no playa 'bout these chips 
We really used to struggle now we paid, filthy rich 
A hundred K to hit your VIP 
R.I.P. to Nipsey, paved the way for the Crips 
Plus, I'm smokin' cookie, blow Biscotti by the zip
I got it on my hip
Ayy, money on the way
