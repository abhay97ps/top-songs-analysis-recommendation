I'm just chillin out mane
And I'm watching Charles funny ass on NBA on TNT
And someone hit me up
I tell em I'm just loungin
Yo what chu doin nigga
I'm just loungin
What chu want my nigga
I'm just loungin
Yo what chu doin nigga
Eyy what you want my nigga
I'm just loungin
Yo what in on be like a mixture of things
You couldn't cope wit the kinetic in yo wildest dreams
So take a minute or a second
Second just keep it steppin
You rockin a jesus necklace
Inpersonating a G- OD
Off a dose of this pure
Had you chombed out on the floor
Now you can't come back to moore
N tomorrow them hollow tips gon hit the brain
N you gon wish that you just missed out on the train
Thats why im loungin, coolin, laxin, chillin
Brew freshly cracked feet tuh - towards the ceilin
Uh - im like a villain huh
Gettin my scrilla duh, eskimo toes in a dry ice chinchilla bruh
Im feelin pimpish - alaska her name
N put a mansion igloo on it she gon give it to me mayn
Grab the number next the slumber for the easy follow up
N use a magnum rubber beanie when im loungin wit a slut, nigga what
Yo what chu doin nigga
I'm just loungin
Eyy What chu want my nigga
I'm just loungin
Yo what chu doin nigga
Eyy what you want my nigga
I'm just loungin
Hey yo I think so much that my brain get sore
I pray so much that my jeans get torn
So I blaze that shit up. Lounge more than minimal
Holla at Allah while puffin on a miracle
Massagin my thoughts
Post lost in my sauce
Hoes shoutin out bless you and I ain't even cough
So I'm shoutin out thank you I'm gettin that a lot
My god
They really on my jock
I got her stoned like Oliver with the weed I twist
She kinda look Chinese
You shoulda seen that shit
Why you be tryn be Lyin?
Is these hoes from mulan?
I'll pull a presidential koo
To get the pu with a rhyme
Sudam. Bomb
And that a little no need
If she wanna get wet with a little dick weed
Shouts to de uno
Broads thawin in the oven
I'm worried bout my business while they worried bout my stuffin
Forgive me I'm just a lil nigga rhyming for the sake of life
And you can really do it twice if you do it right
So resurrect me Loungin
Countin money everyday no more public housin
Yo what chu doin nigga
I'm just loungin
What chu want my nigga
I'm just loungin
Yo what chu doin nigga
Eyy what you want my nigga
I'm just loungin
Proceed to part two like cartoons on sunday mornin
Cold as the carton of milk in this bowl that im pourin
Niggas is snorin if they think that I lack
Copacetic and balance - due diligent talent when i rap
Got a frosty keg for chicken heads when ever I tap
Platinum bubba in my blunt whenever I need a nap
Cuz real hustlas don't sleep 
We in da jeep, four deep, bellin like its circa '93
N its no need for no heat from pigs or guns
I got pussy on my mind and holdin hunds
But put the second one first and now you gettin the point
I'll flip a elbow while slappin bones n smokin a joint
Type of nigga know im livin like a laid back life
I'm sick of hopping over fences, worried if he got a knife or a strap
Got me paranoid n I ain't tryna live like that
I want the roley cold chillin wit the benz all black
Location,Location,Location,Location,... ya know
Y'all out here but we been here
Yo what chu doin nigga
I'm just loungin
What chu want my nigga
I'm just loungin
Yo what chu doin nigga
Eyy what you want my nigga
I'm just loungin
