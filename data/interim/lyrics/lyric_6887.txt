As you’ve always known
Beard like a hobo, mood up and down like a yo-yo
Sadder than a clown, call me Bobo
Can’t see the space but they recognise the logo
I think we makin’ moves, but it’s happenin’ in slow-mo
Confessions of a manic workaholic
Rap fanatic with a habit of achievin’ what he wanted, just a
Grandson of two survivors of the Holocaust
The crimes against my bloodline that drive me to want it more
Lonely troubadour, Rapaport the crackpot
No matter what the scenery, I’m clashin’ with the backdrop
Attached to my laptop, hookin’ up the packshot
Head full of tracks for that last order backed off
Can someone tell me what that shit means?
Am I gettin’ to deep for a posse sixteen?
Too bad, if it is, you won’t get no apology
What you see is what I be, ain’t nobody stoppin’ me
I don’t know, maybe, just maybe, Aus wasn’t ready yet
Nice to be part of a movement that I actually fit
Upload still tellin’ me there’s ten years left
While middle age is creepin’ on my cousin of death
I mean, everything’s premeditated, ain’t it ‘til I die?
Conformist little pacifist drone circlin’ high
Middle class reformist sippin’ socialist hype
With no real mission to show stripes, the system I align, right?
‘Til my words are worth weight, mate, I listen
Couple quick suggestions to that canyonous distance
Two corny broadcasts guardin’ sides of the pitch
Slight lesser of two hypocrites still burnin’ a witch
Still lightin’ the state flame, same bundle of sticks
Still pokin’ at life gains with the tip of his prick
Still actual psychopath, divide the pack, sniffin’ out the weaker links
Peddlin’ myth to meet the cause of 
Question on my motives when I outline shit
I don’t know, too busy askin’ what your scapegoats think
Wink, wink
Mistaken for Jamaican Rastifarian
But I’m Australian Zimbabwean and came to make the party grin
I’m up for partyin’, so when the summer starts again
Throw a beach, Rizlas, some beer, and a barbie in
I wouldn’t say I’m partisan, when I see who’s in charge again
I throw my hands up, get up and stand up and march again
Patience growin’ thinner so I’m studyin’ the art of Zen
Sketch what’s in my heart with pens and advancin’ my art for them
Gotta shine bright when the times are gettin’ darker
Dumb it down to make it smarter, use the web like Peter Parker
Start a fire, light the city up, cross the planet, plane landed
And I’m straight to work and never take granted seeds planted
Coast to coast we got the Village team, the illest fiends
Killing scenes, people say we are the one like Billy Jean
Find us on the grind, a reminder of what we’re givin’ up
To make a sound and spread it round, to get you down to live it up
I don’t have an online social presence
I am an offline, part-time, social menace
I get pissed on the town with some local fellas
They don’t hold Berettas, they eat bowls of lettuce
They’re still gangsters, runnin’ amok
Around Newtown, who’s found someone to fuck
These damn emotions, man, I thought I bottled ‘em shut
But these dumb motherfuckers keep bubblin’ up
Now I’m stuck in a rut, it’s fuckin’ Groundhog Day
There’s a new white rap kid around your way
Pessimistic outlook, the clouds all grey
Hedonistic tendencies, this is our forte
I doubt you’re made of the same shit as us
Cocaine and some snuff to my brain for the rush
I’m a stoner, I’m not makin’ a fuss
Just writin’ this shit as I wait for the bus
It’s lucky I like my lemons, this life gave me so many
Now I bite their funky flesh with my fangs, and suck ‘em ‘til they’re empty
Allow the juice to fill me up and make me stronger
Provin’ I’m not a prude, I’m facin’ fearless to conquer debasing
Many fakers and haters that have taken advantage
Right in the present, like lightnin’ doin’ damage
No more sufferin’ scars, no more livin’ the lie of
Gettin’ high to cover up the fact I’m slowly dyin’ inside
Now I’m the sickest cunt I know so sue me, call me cocky
I’ll never cut your grass or fuck your arse like Joe Hockey
I ain’t a rookie no more, eat all the cookies in the bag
Even when I’m baked, I’m never shady, lad
I’ll never steal your lady, mate, or pull a move on your man
So call me up and beg this pretty preacherette for her hand
I’m the Giant Peach, the unicorn, more hype than Rainbow Brite
This village wench is a wrench, forever keepin’ it tight
Uh
Ayo, my crew stays sucker-free, luckily
Puffin’ on that hubbly bubbly with my cup of tea
I’m livin’ lovely, sometimes strugglin’
Shufflin’ schedules around and tryna keep above the sea
So fuck with me or don’t fuck with me
I’m too old to give a fuck about that fuckery, I’m fumblin’ through life
I’m tryna live it right, it’s quite humblin’
Stumblin’ around sounds, tryna find the one for me
Unbeknownst to most I’m a host of my own private game show
Live to air every night, inside of my brain though
A scapegoat, interview multiple personalities
I get a lot of quotables, and nobody knows that it’s me
It’s Saturday Night Live sketch shows in my headphones
Dead close to puttin’ out a best of
And I only got one album out and a couple of guest spots, so I guess not
Many people are gonna be interested in my press shots
Uh, here today, gone the next, on a quest to get props
Tell the respected heads to f off, L.S. got style for days
Still I’d rather hibernate inside my quiet place
While I’m safe like “Fuck the entire race”
Swimmin’ in beautiful women, feminine, yes, I’m with ‘em
They can’t believe there’s no Charlie Sheen the way my team winnin’
I’m not flippin’ no key, I’m just flippin’ those keys
Out a sample to make an incredible beat, and it’s fittin’ with ease
Every day though since I came out of the cradle
I’ve moulded my style like Play-Doh and spin your head like it was a Dreidel
My fatal sentences, swap the sword for my penmanship
Witness the evidence, is how I do this
Never paid no mind to excrement, fresher than peppermint, every time I’m gettin’ it
My only prerequisite is to be excellent
Bustin’ like a semiautomatic, I let ‘em have it, they panic
You’d think they were paraplegic, they can’t stand it
I saw my chance and grabbed it, now we’re not lookin’ backwards until we have it
And we celebrate like Messi scored a hat trick, yeah
I’m dedicated to music like it was everything
Married to the beat as if every track was a weddin’ ring
Swingin’ a B.V. battle axe, challengin’ hacks, carryin’ gats
Gettin’ pat on the back for amateur raps, as a
Matter of fact, we’re burnin’ the habitat
Determined to take the world on a journey like Kerouac
Yo, Jack, my saddle’s packed, so I’m gettin’ the fuck on the road
Settin’ a precedent and I’m embeddin’ it ‘til it’s stuck in your dome
These cockroaches, I’m kickin’ to squash the posers
Stickin’ it to the man that’s tryna own us, so hard to focus
Soakin’ inside this hopelessness, hopin’ I’ll get over it
Soon as I’m copin’ it all goes kaboom
Then another tribulation, capitulation, the situation’s
Devastatin’, stressin’, the separation, emotional desolation
I can’t speak
So I pick up the pen and get boss on a large beat
Better bring your heaters and cyphers, whole world’s gonna stand beside us
Positive , reppin’ B.V. to the day I die and that’s it
