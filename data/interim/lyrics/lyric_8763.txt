I started to write this song about you
And then I decided that I would write it all about love
And it appeared to me
That you wasn't happy
And that's for sure, positively
That's what the world is made of
So give me more L-O-V-E, love 
Love is a walk down Main street 
Love is an apple that is so sweet 
Love is something that can't be beat 
L-O-V-E is strange to me, Lord
I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
It's all in the heavens, can't you see
You can always depend on me
To give you love 
Love is a flower in my soul 
Love is a story that just can't be told 
Can't you feel it burning more and more? 
Stop and look at the big wheel roll
I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
I would give my life for the glory
Just to be able to tell the story
About love
I didn't mean to make you mad
A sweet story, I thought I had
But maybe time will bring us together
And I can be such a happy fella
About love
Love is something that is so divine 
Love is a feeling that's a friend of mine 
It can't be measured by no sign 
In your heart or even in your mind, you gotta 
About love, Love is as bright as the morning sun 
Where it is, I don't how far, no
