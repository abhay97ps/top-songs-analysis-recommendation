In paradise
I've got a feeling that something is wrong
That look is telling me you're not happy
We never listen to our favorite songs
Do you remember the way you held me?
No, I won't let you work this love away
There was a time when you held me tight
Think about the dreams of yesterday
Forget the heartache that you feel inside
You are the sun, I am the sky
Together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive
In paradise
So many times I look into your eyes
I see an image, a man who's crying
You try to tell me, but I realize
It's had to make it, we'll keep on trying
Open up your heart, let's get away
Just take my hand, it will be all right
Leave it all behind, come out and play
We'll find the answer deep into the night
You are the sun, I am the sky
Together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive
In paradise
You are the sun, I am the sky
Together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive
In paradise
Memories of you and me
Falling in love
Tell me I will always be
In paradise
You are the sun, I am the sky
Together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive
You are the sun, I am the sky
Together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive
You are the sun, I am the sky
Together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive
In paradise
