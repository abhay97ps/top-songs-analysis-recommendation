I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your world
I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your world
I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your world
I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your world
I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your world
Boy, I think you should know
I wanna be your world
And if I was your girl
You would always be my world
Boy, I won't let you go
Boy, from the first moment I saw you
I knew my heart would only be for you
Remembering the first time that you looked my way
That smile on your face just took me away
It's a dreamland, boy
You got to understand
I only wish one day that I could hold your hand
As we stroll through the park where the bluebirds sing
Or when you're walking me home after the school bell rings
It doesn't matter to me
Just as long as you're there
Whispering sweet nothings in my ear
Saying that you care about the times we share
As you run your fingers through my hair
Yeah, you are the only one
And the way I feel can't be undone
Because if I could be anything in this world
Boy, I'm gonna be your girl
I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your world
Boy, I think you should know
And if I was your girl
You would always be my world
Boy, I won't let you go
I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your world
I wanna make your love unfurl
Dreaming of the time I'll be one day telling you
How I feel and the things I like to do
You seem like my kind and if you ask me why
It's because you take me on a natural high
Higher than the skies way up above
I don't wanna come down, boy
Because I'm in love
With the way you walk
I love the way you talk
The happiness you bring it just can't be bought
It's a given I love you
And I'll never stop lovin'
Because I'm ready and I'm able and in the long run
I'll do all the things it takes to make it work out
And that I'll do without a doubt
Because if I could be anything in this world
Boy, I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your world
Boy, you think you should know
And if I was your girl
You would always be my world
Boy, I won't let you go
I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your world
Boy, I think you should know
And if I was your girl
You would always be my world
Boy, I won't let you go
I wanna be your world
Thinking while I'm looking out the window
As time passes on my feelings grow
But I don't know what to say or do
All I know is that I want to get next to you
So you can hold me close
And maybe squeeze me tight
Cause being in your arms, boy would be just right
Me and you
One on one till the end of time
I'll be all yours you'll be all mine
Cause loving you is what I do best
And yes, I confess
It'll bring me happiness
And now that you know just how I'm feeling
I think it's time that we start dealing
With the situation that's been created
My love for you can't be mistaken
Because if I could be anything in this world
Boy, I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your world
Boy, I think you should know
And if I was your girl
You would always be my world
Boy, I won't let you go
I wanna be your world
I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your world
I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your world
I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your world
Boy, I think you should know
And if I was your girl
You would always be my world
Boy, I won't let you go
