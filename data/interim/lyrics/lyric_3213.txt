It seems like only yesterday
I'd meet her in that small cafe
And dance with my Cherie
We'd kiss by flickering candlelight
I'd whisper as I held her tight
I love you, sweet Cherie
But now she's just a memory
A million miles away from me
Alone in old Paree
But if I live forever
I'll always be in love
In love with my Cherie
It seems like only yesterday
I'd meet her in that small cafe
And dance with my Cherie
We'd kiss by flickering candlelight
I'd whisper as I hеld her tight
I love you, sweet Cheriе
But now she's just a memory
A million miles away from me
Alone in old Paree
But if I live forever
I'll always be in love
In love with my Cherie
