Did I tell you how much I miss
Your sweet kiss?
Did I tell you I didn't cry?
Well I lied
I lie-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie-lied
Over, really over
When I nearly hit the face I loved
So tired of packaging the anger
Always pushing you away
Did I tell you you're wonderful?
I miss you, yes I do
Did I tell you that I was wrong?
I was wrong
'Cause you're wonderful, yeah
Did I tell you how much I miss
Your smile?
Did I tell you I was okay?
Well, no way
No way, way, way
Over, really over
When I nearly hit the face I loved
So tired of packaging the anger
Always pushing you away
Did I tell you you're wonderful?
I miss you, yes I do
Did I tell you that I was wrong?
I was wrong
'Cause you're wonderful, yeah yeah
You're wonderful, yeah yeah
And now now n-now each and every day
I realize the price I have to pay
You, you're wonderful
And now for your information
I'm walking around like an arm decoration
You, you're wonderful
So high I can't get over it
So deep I can't get under it
You, you're wonderful, yeah
You're wonderful, yeah yeah
You're wonderful, yeah yeah
You're wonderful, yeah yeah
Wonderful
Did I tell you you're wonderful?
I miss you, yes I do 
Did I tell you that I was wrong?
I was wrong
For so long long long
Did I tell you you're wonderful?
I miss you, yes I do
Did I tell you that I was wrong?
I was wrong
For so long long long
Did I tell you you're wonderful?
