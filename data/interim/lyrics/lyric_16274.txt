Tonight I came home early
'Cause I just couldn't wait to see you
You were on my mind
Lately I've been thinkin', baby 
Of all the ways I can make you happy
And tonight I'm gonna try
So just unwind 
Relax your mind 
Leave your cares behind 
Let's make love 
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
Slow and easy
As we lay we can
Just explore each other's treasures
They're not hard to find
We know the secret 
Of how to make each other happy
I know yours and you know mine
So just unwind 
Relax your mind 
Leave your cares behind 
Let's make love 
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
Slow and easy 
Come to me, baby
No, no, no there's no need to worry
The kids are all asleep, yeah yeah yeah
I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
I can see it in your eyes, oh
Just unwind 
Relax your mind 
Leave your cares behind 
Let's make love 
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
Slow and easy 
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight
Slow and easy 
Slow and easy 
Slow and easy 
Slow and easy 
Slow and easy
