Oh here I am 
On my knees again 
I'll do anything 
Just to make it right 
Say you understand 
Oh I know you can 
C'mon Marianne, uh-hmm
Don't matter what the people say 
It didn't happen that way 
She was a passing fling 
Not a permanent thing 
Say you understand 
Oh I know you can 
C'mon Marianne 
C'mon Marianne 
C'mon Marianne 
Say you can understand
My Marianne, Marianne, Marianne, Marianne
Well your big brown eyes 
Are all full of tears 
From the bitterness 
Of those lonely years 
So I hang my head 
Wish that I were dead 
C'mon Marianne 
C'mon Marianne 
C'mon Marianne 
Say you can understand
My Marianne 
C'mon Marianne 
C'mon Marianne , oh
Marianne, Marianne, Marianne, oh Marianne
