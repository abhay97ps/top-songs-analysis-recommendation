I turn sideways to the sun
Keep my thoughts from everyone
It's a jungle, I'm a freak
Hear me talk, but never speak
So, I'm stepping out of time
Because breaking is a crime
And it may all be too late
But I've no passion for this hate
That's the price of love 
Can you feel it? 
If we could buy it now 
How long will it last? 
And when this building is on fire
These flames can't burn any higher
I turn sideways to the Sun
And in a moment I am gone
That's the price of love 
Can you feel it? 
If we could buy it now 
How long will it last? 
That's the price of love 
Can you feel it? 
If we could buy it now 
How long will it last? 
That's the price of love 
Can you feel it? 
If we could buy it now 
How long will it last? 
That's the price of love 
If we could buy it now 
How long will it last? 
That's the price of love 
If we could buy it now
How long will it last?
If we could buy it now
How long will it last? 
If we could buy it now
How long will it last? 
If we could buy it now
How long will it last? 
If we could buy it now
How long will it last?
