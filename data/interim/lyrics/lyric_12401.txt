I used to play that pinball
I used to go outside
I had to spend my money
Get on your bus and ride
I used to go out dancing
Put on my high-heeled shoes
Get in my short block chevy
Go on a downtown cruise
I feel a little bit mixed up
Maybe I'm obsolete
All us pinball pool sharks
We just can't compete
Space age whiz kids, kids
Leaders in the field
Pioneers in research
Space age whiz kids
Arcade mothership monsters
Laserbeam blastshield eyes
Full on space age madness
Make-believe satellite skies
Alien ships approaching
There's trouble in sector five
Left hand on the joystick
Right hand hyperspace drive
Space age whiz kids kids, Space age whiz kids
Space age whiz kids kids, Space age whiz kids
Space age whiz kids
Space age whiz kids
Space age whiz kids
Space age whiz kids
They got nothing to do
Put another quarter in
Pay those space age dues
Donkey Kong high score
Pac Man's on a roll
Klingons on the warpath
Whiz kids on patrol
Space age whiz kids, Space age whiz kids
Space age whiz kids, Space age whiz kids
Space age whiz kids, Space age whiz kids
Space age whiz kids, Space age whiz kids
Kind of a young thing
I like space age whiz kids
I like...I like...I like...I need quarters...quarters!
Give me quarters! I like quarters!
