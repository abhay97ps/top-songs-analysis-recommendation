So here you are now, nowhere to turn
It's just the same old yesterday
And you made a promise to yourself
That you were never going to be this way
And the only thing that you've ever known is to run
So you keep on driving faster into the sun
But everybody needs somebody sometimes
Yeah, everybody needs somebody sometimes
You don't have to find your own way out
You've got to voice, let it be heard
Just when it feels you're on a dead end road
There's always somewhere left to turn
So don't give up now 
You're so close to a brand new day
Yes, you are
And if you just can bear to be alone, then I'll stay
'Cause everybody needs somebody sometimes
Yeah, everybody needs somebody sometimes
Well, maybe I've been too caught up
To see what you've been going through
And all that I can say is that I'm here now
Ooh
Ohh, yeah
And everybody needs somebody sometimes
You know they do
Yeah, everybody needs somebody sometimes
Everybody needs somebody sometimes
There's just a little left to save
Everybody needs somebody sometimes
Ohh, ooh
Yeah, yeah
Gotta have someone beside you
Gotta have someone beside you
Yes you do, yes you do
Everybody, everybody needs somebody sometimes
