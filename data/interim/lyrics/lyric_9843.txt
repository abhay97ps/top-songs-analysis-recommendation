I see you standin' over there
Just checkin' me out
What'cha lookin' for honey?
What'cha comin' on strong about?
I might be too much for ya honey
Do ya know what I mean?
I'm just a dancin' fool
And I'm lookin' for a struttin' queen
One thing you got to learn
If you can move is
Don't say you're hot when you're not
I'm looking for some help
To shoot my shot
I guess I'm just just too too hot to trot 
You better step aside, baby
This ain't your scene
I'm coming for you on on my feet
So you better hang on to your genie
You better leave me alone
Because I need to spend 'em on the floor
You're taking one hell of a chance
Just hanging out in store for more
One thing you got to learn
If you can move is
Don't say you're hot when you're not
I'm looking for some help
To shoot my shot
I guess I'm just just too too hot to trot
When you're hot, you're hot, you're hot to trot
When you're hot, you're hot, you're hot to trot
When you're hot, you're hot, you're hot to trot
You ain't got no style
You're no match for me
You're just a lead foot mama
It's so easy to see
You know you just can't dance
Hear what I say
Until you learn how to do it
Better come back another day
One thing you got to learn
If you can move is
Don't say you're hot when you're not
I'm looking for some help
To shoot my shot
I guess I'm just just too too hot to trot
Bye Bye
Hey Cherry Brothers, tell them one more time
When you're hot, you're hot, you're hot to trot
When you're hot, you're hot, you're hot to trot
When you're hot, you're hot, you're hot to trot
