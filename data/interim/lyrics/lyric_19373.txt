Let's go back, back to the beginning
Back to when the Earth, the Sun, the stars all aligned
'Cause perfect didn't feel so perfect
Trying to fit a square into a circle was no life
I defy
Let the rain fall down and wake my dreams
Let it wash away my sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder, I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean, oh
I'm shedding, shedding every color
Tryna find a pigment of truth beneath my skin, oh
'Cause different doesn't feel so different
And going out is better than always staying in
Feel the wind
Let the rain fall down and wake my dreams
Let it wash away my sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder, I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean 
 I'm coming clean
 Hey yeah
Let the rain fall
Let the rain fall, I'm coming
Let the rain fall down and wake my dreams
Let it wash away my sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder, I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean 
Oh, I'm coming clean 
Oh, I'm coming clean 
Let the rain fall, let the rain fall, let the rain fall 
I'm coming clean 
Hmm, oh-oh
Let's go back, back to the beginning
