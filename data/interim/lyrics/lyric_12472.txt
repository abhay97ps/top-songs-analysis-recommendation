Who looks at her life in the palm of her hand
Rain`s on the roof
There`s tears in the land of heartbreak
She has made up her mind
She won`t turn back again
She writes a note
But words just won`t say
Turns off the TV
Pulls down the shade
She`s leaving
No, she won`t change her mind
To leave it all behind
Just one more story from a lonely road
A twist of fate
And then a spot of gold
Out on the rainbow`s end
Just one more chapter in a sad hotel
Another penny to the wishing well
Out on the rainbow`s end
Don`t you turn back again
Who`s playing cards from midnight `til dawn
Lives in a waste
And yesterday`s gone forever
He`s made up his mind to leave it all behind
So he says to himself
As he folds up his hand
Ooh
Will all my friends will understand where I`m going?
To find my own way
I won`t turn back again
Just one more story from a lonely road
A twist of fate
And then a start of gold
Out on the rainbow`s end
Just one more chapter in a set of ten
Another penny to the wishing well
Out on the rainbow`s end
Don`t you turn back again
I have a dream that I hold in my heart
And I won`t let go
Welcome, tomorrow
I`m on my way
So goodbye, yesterday
Goodbye, yesterday
Just one more story from a lonely road
A twist of fate
And then a spot of gold
Found on a rainbow`s end
Just one more chapter in a set of ten
Another penny to the wishing well
Out on the rainbow`s end
Don`t you turn back again
