Oh
Remember those walls I built
Well, baby they're tumbling down
They didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace 
You're everything I need and more 
It's written all over your face 
Baby I can feel your halo 
I can feel your halo  {Halo!}
I can see your halo  {Halo!}
I can feel your halo  {Ha-a-a-alo} 
I can see your halo  
And don't it feel good!
I used to think maybe you loved me
Now baby I'm sure
And I just can't wait 'till the day
When you knock on my door 
I'm walking on sunshine, woah!
I'm walking on sunshine, woah!
I'm walking on sunshine, woah oh oh!
And don't it feel good!
I can feel your halo  halo {Halo!} halo 
I can see your halo  halo halo 
I can feel your halo  halo halo {Halo-oo!}
I can see your halo  halo halo 
I can feel your halo halo
I can see your halo
Halo!
