It's been three years and seven days
Since I first gave my all to you
Stuck up in love so wrong
I can't see nothin' else but me and you
A sudden change has come about
The way you treat me, I need you
Can't stop the rain from comin' down
Until you see it's true that
No one's gonna love you 
Late at night, baby 
I get up early in the mornin' , oh, yeah, yeah
And make sure that you're satisfied
 All I have for you
 Love you like I do
It's been to me a time alone
'Cause I've been more than there for you
Don't want to leave, can't bear the thought
Of what goes on, we are through
Too may reasons we should stay
We built a world between us two
But if you need to go away
Then, baby, you will see that
No one's gonna love you , oh
Late at night, baby 
I get up early in the mornin' 
And make sure that you're satisfied
 Don't run away
 All I have for you
 Don't turn away
 Oh, no, it's all I can do
 Oh
 It's all I have for you
 Don't turn away
 Love you like I do
Late at night, baby 
I get up early in the mornin' , hey
And make sure that you're satisfied
 Don't run away, no, no, no
 Oh, it's all I have for you, boy
 Don't turn away
 No one will love you like I do
 No, like I do, not like I do, baby
 It's all I have for you
 No, no, oh, no
 No one will love you like I do
 Don't turn away
 Baby, it's all I have for you
 No one will love you like I do
