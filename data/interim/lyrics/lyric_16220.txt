Move it up 
Move it up 
Come on
Seven's always in control, you know what I'm sayin'
I slam the door 
When I come into the bedroom 
'Cause I'm the King of the castle 
Turn me on turn me loose 
Try to hit it, it's a hassle
Come get some of this, don't forget the innuendo
Play me like Nintendo, never ever let go
Keep it so loud, you'll be hittin' the crescendo
Come baby come baby baby come come
When you gotta give me lovin' then you gotta give me some
Come baby come baby baby come come
When you gotta give me lovin' then you gotta give me some
Come down
Well, I can hear the 
The telephone goes ring 
But we're still gettin' busy
 Now you're gettin' busy
I can slow it down so you can pump it 
Better move it fast so you can pump it 
Two balls and a bat , a pitcher with a hat 
Slidin' into home base, tryin' to hit a home run
Swing batta batta batta batta batta swing!
Break it down, break it down, come on
 Move it all around,  move it all around, bounce
 Pump it up and down,  pump it up and down, bounce
 Move it all around,  move it all around, bounce
 Pump it up and down,  bounce, bounce
Tell me do you like it? 
Do you want a little more? 
Now tell me do you love it? 
Come on! 
I can feel it , come on 
Let it go , come on 
Give it to me , come on 
Give it to me
