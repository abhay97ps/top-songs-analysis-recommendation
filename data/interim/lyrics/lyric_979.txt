Fights over promises, yours to the end
Dignities impurities got slowly dragged down
Digging the pit and saying that you dug it is your right in this town
Fights over promises
Hey, know what?  When you go fucking nuts you just grab ahold of it and blow a big fit
Sit, sit down in the throne, no telephone rings, ‘cause I’m the king
Just think about the power of hydraulics
The power of hydraulics, crush the mind’s mental nuts
This thing is so unreal, and it feels like thunder pounding steel, what a big deal
Yes, I have the key and now it’s part of me
The power in my hands defies sanity
Fighting over yours and mine, no time for fighting over poisoned wine off the bitter vine
Dignity’s in part of me got wicked dragged down
It dug the pit, and now you don’t dig it, you’re the scourge of this town
Fighting over poisoned wine
Hey, know what?  When you go fucking nuts you just grab ahould of it and blow a big fit
Sit, sit down in the throne, no telephone rings, ‘cause I’m the king
Just think about the power of hydraulics
The power of hydraulics, crush the mind’s mental nuts
Don’t pay to work it out, just shout
Sit behind the wheel, a big deal, crush steel...the power of hydraulics
20,000 GPM ain’t no big deal, the pressure up beside your head could kill the man of steel
What a day, oh what a day
100,000 PSI and then you die with a steel rod jammed in your eye, that’s just fine
Oh what a day
20,000 GPM ain’t no big deal
Oh what a day
This place, I can admit I really like it, destroy, and turn it in, I’m such a big shit
Yes, I’m on a roll, I like the feel of it, the power in my hands, a dual stick shift
Oh what a day!
