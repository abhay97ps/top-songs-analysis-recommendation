Are you ready boots?
Start walkin'
Let's go
Yee Haw
Come on
Let's go
You keep sayin you got somethin for me
Well officer I don't mind to say you do
Now your lookin right where I thought you'd be looking
Legs come handy when law's in front of you
These boots are made for walkin
That's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
You believe you've stopped me for a reason 
Now I'm pretending my bendings just for fun
You keep playin where I got you playin 
These double - D initals work to run
These boots are made for walkin
And that's just what they'll do
One of theses days these boots are gonna walk all over you
I'm the girl with the good ol' boys who don't mean you no harm
Just got my way with hazzard county charm
There ain't no crime in havin little fun
Swerve my stride
Bat my sexy eyes
Where my boots at?
Strut ya stuff, come on
Hey ya'll
Wanna come and see something 
Can't touch, can I get a hand clap
For the way I work my back 
Tick tock all around the clock
Drop it
Push ya tush, just like that
Can I get a sooey?
Can I get a yehaw?
You keep thinkin' what you shouldn't be thinkin'
Another two buttons down til you kissin' the ground
I'm a gonna send you back home as you crying 
But uncle Jesse, he sure is gonna be proud
These boots are made for walkin
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
These boots are made for walkin
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk.... all... o...ver...you
Come on boots
Start walking
Come on ladies
Hey ya'll
Wanna come and see something 
Can't touch, can I get a hand clap
For the way I work my back 
Tick tock all around the clock drop it
Push ya tush, just like that
Can I get a sooey 
Can I get a yehaw 
Yehaw
Willie Nelson everybody 
Let's go home now
