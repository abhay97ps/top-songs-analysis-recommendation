Midnight Sky, the moon is a quarter
Layin' low and south of the border, yeah
I know that when I awaken
I've taken more than moon beams home in a jar
Oh baby, morning and there you are right next to me
Can you feel it?
Break of day and I'm feeling hazy
And she's feeling good
Milky Way is all in my mind, well
I have no sense of direction when loving you
I lose conception of time
Ah honey, under the midnight sky, baby, get next to me
Can you feel it?
The greatest pleasure, too great no measure
After the day is done
An invitation to find temptation
Under the midnight sun
Under the midnight sky, baby, get next to me
Under the  midnight
 Midnight sky
Under the  midnight
Ah  midnight sky
 Stay with me
 Lay with me, under the
 Ah, midnight
