I'm learning 'bout love
Got the book by my side
I got the moon and the stars
There to be my guide
Yes if you just walk  talk 
In a loving way baby
Love until the break of day
I'm learning 'bout love
Put hand your in mine
We'll learn about love
Till the end of time
Yes if you just walk  talk 
In a loving way baby
Love until the break of day
 Hold me tight
 Lips stay close to mine
 Study as you go
 You'll be mine
I'm learning 'bout love
Got the book by my side
I got the moon and the stars
There to be my guide
Yes if you just walk  talk 
In a loving way baby
Love until the break of day
 Hold me tight
 Lips stay close to mine
 Study as you go
 You'll be mine
I'm learning 'bout love
Got the book by my side
I got the moon and the stars
There to be my guide
Yes if you just walk  talk 
In a loving way baby
Love until the break of day
Oh give me love, love, love
Yeah love, love, love
I said love, love, love
