I want to show you the picture I drew
When I was on the phone talking to you
I made a heart and I colored it red
'Cause I want you here
On my side of the bed
Oh woe, oh woe
Oh woe, oh woe
I've been dreaming since I was born
And in my dreams I see eyes like yours
I'll be the pillow where you lay your head, lay your head
If you'll come and sleep
On my side of the bed
Lay down
The sheets are white like the moon, my love
Dream with me in my room
Lay down
Lay down
The sheets are white like the moon, my love
Dream with me in my room
Lay down
I know you hurt, I feel the pain
Take my hand and come out of the rain
We all need to be comforted
You can get yours
On my side of the bed
On my side of the bed
Lay down on my side of the bed
Come lay down
Tra-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Lay down  lay down
Sha-la-la-la-la 
Sha-la-la-la-la 
Lay down  lay down
Sha-la-la-la-la 
Sha-la-la-la-la 
Lay down  lay down
Sha-la-la-la-la 
Sha-la-la-la-la 
Lay down  lay down
Sha-la-la-la-la 
Sha-la-la-la-la 
Lay down  lay down
Sha-la-la-la-la 
Sha-la-la-la-la 
Lay down, lay down
