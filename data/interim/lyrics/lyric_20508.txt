Don't call me, leave me alone
Not gonna answer my phone
'Cause I don't, no, I won't see you
I'm out to have a good time
To get you off of my mind
'Cause I don't and I won't need you
 Send out a 9-1-1
 We're gonna have some fun
 Hey boy, you know you better run
'Cause it's a girls night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out, without you
You better hold tight
This girls night's without you
 Let's go, G.N.O
 Let's go, G.N.O
 Let's go, G.N.O, let's go
It's a girls night
I'll dance with somebody new
Won't have to think about you
And who knows what let go will lead to
 You'll hear from everyone
 You'll get the 4-1-1
 Hey boy, you knew this day would come
'Cause it's a girls night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out, without you
 Let's go, G.N.O
 Let's go, G.N.O
 Let's go, G.N.O, let's go
Hey, boy
Don't you wish you could've been a good boy?
Try to find another girl like me, boy
Feel me when I tell you
I'm fine and it's time for me to draw the line
I said, hey, boy
Don't you wish you could've been a good boy?
Try to find another girl like me, boy
Feel me when I tell you
I'm fine and it's time for me to draw the line
'Cause it's a girls night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out, without you
You better hold tight
This girls night's without you
 Let's go, G.N.O
 Let's go, G.N.O
 Let's go, G.N.O, let's go
It's a girls night
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
