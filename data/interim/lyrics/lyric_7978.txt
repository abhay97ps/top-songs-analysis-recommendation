Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play
Or the little songs they sing?
Last night, dressed up in high-heel shoes
And wearing my old hat
My four-year-old said, "I want a divorce"
Now where did she hear that?
Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play
Or the little songs they sing?
Last night, as I watched TV
One rushed through the door
"Mommy, Daddy's telling someone on the phone
'Don't you call me here no more'"
Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play
Or the little songs they sing?
Bet my daddy can whip your daddy
But Daddy's never home
And I think Mommy's worried 'bout him
'Cause she cried all night long
Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play
Or the little songs they sing?
You never know what they learn at school
Or what they're thinking of
My first grader just said a four-letter word
And it sure wasn't love
Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play
Or the little songs they sing?
