It's been a long time since I came around
It's been a long time but I'm back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you
Uhh...
Just you and I
Sharing our love together
And I know in time
We'll build the dreams we treasure
We'll be alright just you and I 
Something, something about this place
Just you and, just you and I
Something 'bout  and my lipstick on your face
Just you and I
Something  my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, something about, baby, you and I
Just you and I 
Sharing our love together
And I know in time 
We'll build the dreams we treasure
And we'll be all right, just you and I
Something, something about  
 'bout lonely nights  
, something about  
Yeah, something about, baby, you and I
Oh, you and I remember our first embrace
That smile that was on your face
The promises that we made
And now your love is my reward
And I love you even more
Than I ever did before
 this place 
Something 'bout  and my lipstick on your face 
Something,  my cool  Nebraska guy 
, for Nebraska
, for Nebraska, Nebraska, I
Love you
You and I You, you and I Baby! 
I rather die, Without you and I
We made it you and I
