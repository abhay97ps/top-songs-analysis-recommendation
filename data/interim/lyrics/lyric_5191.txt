I feel good sensation
And I been lifted child by your soul creation
Don't you stop just to look away
I want you to listen, child, to what I say
Don't you drift away too far
Out of sad times, just exactly where you are
It's just too much the way I feel
I just can't believe that I'm not real
Don't you drift away too far
From our good times, just exactly where you are
It's just too much, can't be real
I want you to know just how I feel
You have a strange desire
When you walk across the ground
Then you set the world on fire
I feel good sensation
And I been lifted child by your sole creation
Don't you stop just to look away
I want you to listen, child, to what I say
C'mon, c'mon, won't you please, just a little, Yow!
Won't you please, just a little bit closer
C'mon, c'mon, yow! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Just a little bit closer, c'mon, c'mon just a little
C'mon, c'mon just a little, Yow! Just a little bit closer
C'mon, c'mon just a little, c'mon, c'mon just a little bit closer
C'mon, c'mon, yow! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon just a little
C'mon, c'mon just a little bit, c'mon, c'mon
OOOWW! OW!
