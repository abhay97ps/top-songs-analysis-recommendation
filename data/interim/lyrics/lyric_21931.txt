There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
And you played it to the beat 
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
 The scars of your love remind me of us
 They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
 The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
 I can't help feeling
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
And you played it to the beat 
Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door 
Count your blessings to find what you look for 
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold 
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow
We could've had it all 
We could've had it all, yeah 
It all, it all, it all 
We could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
And you played it to the beat 
Could've had it all 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat
