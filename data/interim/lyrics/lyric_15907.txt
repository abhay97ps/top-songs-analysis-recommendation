CADILLAC
Got that
Yeah my...
CADILLAC
Got got that
Yo it's a shame, and also very funny
I can have a decent girl, cause it's all about that money
When I drive my Cadillac she wants to ride in it to death
If I walk I don't start talking cause it's wasting my breath
I remember the times I had to put up with the fakin'
But now things have changed cause it's records I'm makin'
Flashing hundred dollar bills  and manilas
Chalking girls I just met and taking 'em to the La Quinta
Cause my...
CADILLAC
Got that
You know my...

Got got that
Yeah my...
CADILLAC

When I see other Caddys, I just laugh and shine
Cause they don't have the boom, that I have hooked in mine
My Caddy is so loud, some neighborhoods ban me
But it just makes it easier for me to get in panties
I wash it everyday, and then I go get crazy
With the hats over our eyes we step, then we go get ladies
Freaky Freddie's in the ride, my number one ace
Chilling hard in the back of the car with major bass
Cause it's my....
Bass...drive!
Bass...drive!
Bass...drive!
Bass...drive!
Bass...drive!
Bass...drive!
10 E-B 12's, yeah holmes it's a winner
10 E-B 12's, rag top and five stars
10 E-B 12's, with the boom in the trunk
10 E-B 12's, so you know I raise Hell
My Brougham's real deep, yeah holmes it's a winner
Cause when a girl sees it, I just chalk and go up in her
And all night long, she's trying to treat me at the bar
I don't know if it's my crush, rag top, or five stars
With the boom in the trunk, I'll take out any punk
Who are scared and won't admit, they could never get with
The bass hitting hard, it put you in a spell
10 E-B 12's, so you know I raise hell
In my...
