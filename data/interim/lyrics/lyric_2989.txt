You get up in the mornin', you hear the ding dong ring
Now you look up on the table, you see the same darn thing
You find no food upon the table and no pork up in the pan
But if you say a thing about it, you be in trouble with the man
Ah, let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
Oh, let the Midnight Special shine its everlovin' light on me
Now if you're ever in Houston, oh, you better walk right
Aw, you better not gamble boy, I say you better not fight
Or the sheriff he will grab you, and the boys will pull you down
And then before you know it, you're penitentary bound
Ah, let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special shine its everlovin' light on me
Here comes Miss Lucy, how in the world did you know?
I can tell by her apron and by the clothes she wore
An umbrella on her shoulder, she got a paper in her hand
She come to see the warden to try to free her man
So, let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
Ah, let the Midnight Special shine its everlovin' light on me
I said, let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
Ah, let the Midnight Special shine its everlovin' light on me
