Hey, hey, hey
Well there's a lone wolf out on the prowl tonight
Lurkin' in the shadows, always out of sight
I said, little girl, don't you hesitate, cause you're usin' live bait
Senorita, solitaire, you got a certain kind of savoir-faire
Cause you're notorious , everything you want
Everything you need
Cause you're notorious , every mother's nightmare
Every schoolboy's dream
Everybody by name, every trick in the book
Everywhere that she goes she gets those dirty looks
I said, little girl, don't you hesitate, cause you're usin' live bait
Senorita, solitaire, you got a certain kind of savoir-faire
Cause you're notorious , everything you want
Everything you need
Cause you're notorious , every mother's nightmare
Every schoolboy's dream
Lock me up, I want to be your prisoner
Lock me up, I want to be your slave
I said, little girl, don't you hesitate cause you're usin' live bait
Senorita, solitaire, you got a certain kind of savoir-faire
Cause you're notorious , everything you want
Everything you need
Cause you're notorious , every mother's nightmare
Every schoolboy's dream
Cause you're notorious , everything I want
Everything I need
Cause you're notorious , every mother's nightmare
Every schoolboy's dream
Every schoolboy's dream, oh yeah
Lock me up
