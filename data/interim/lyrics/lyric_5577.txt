Gimme a ticket for an airplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone
I'm a-goin' home
My baby wrote me a letter
Ah
I don't care how much I gotta spend
Gotta get back to my baby again
Lonely days are gone
I'm a-goin' home
My baby wrote me a letter
Well, she wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen, mister, can't you see
I've gotta get back to my baby once more?
Wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen, mister, can't you see
I gotta get back to my baby once more?
