I paid all my dues so I picked up my shoes
I got up and walked away
Oh, I was just a boy
I didn't know how to play
Worked hard and failed
Now all I can say is
I threw it all away
Oh, I was just a boy
Giving it all away...
Sail away, sail away
Ooh, I know better now, I know better now
Giving it all away
Ooh, I know better now, I know better now
I've given it all away...
Went out in the world too much for my nerves
Only myself to blame
Oh, I was just a boy
Nobody else to blame...
I've done all I can, now it's out of my hands
Stand on my head and say
Oh, I was just a boy
Giving it all away...
Sail away, sail away
Ooh, I know better now, I know better now
Giving it all away
Ooh, I know better now, I know better now
Given it all away...
Just a boy, giving it all away
Just a boy, giving it all away
I was just a boy, giving it all away
Just a boy...
