Come on
Baby, baby, tell me what's up?
Can you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up?
Huh? Huh?
Baby, baby, tell me what's up?
Can you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up?
Huh? What?
Baby, baby, tell me what's up?
Can you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up?
Huh? Huh?
Baby, baby, tell me what's up?
Can you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up?
Huh? Huh? What?
Boy, this evening, was it only me?
Feeling completely down to be open
Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't wanna say yes, afraid of your reaction
I knew it was wrong for feelin' this way
Especially the thought of gettin' in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night, I had to decide
I was thinkin'
I should make a move but I won't 
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowin' if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move, but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowin' if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night
We were chillin', watching your TV
I thought you was coming close as you got to me
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And somehow, in one night, discover I love you
Felt so right, but it felt so wrong
And look how we are carryin' on
Tryin' to say things to get me to stay
But my watch tells me it's gettin' too late
I'm thinkin'
I should make a move, but I won't 
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong 
Knowin' if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night 
I should make a move, but I won't
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong
Knowin' if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night
 If you want me
You got to know me 
And if you want my love 
You gotta win my love
Hey, baby
That's the way it's got to be, yeah
Get to know me 
So we can do this
I should make a move
I know you're probably thinkin' 
Knowin' if I do 
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move, but I won't 
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong 
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night
I should make a move, but I won't 
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right 
I don't get down on the first night 
I should make a move, but I won't 
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong 
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night 
I should make a move, but I won't 
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right 
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move, but I won't
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night
