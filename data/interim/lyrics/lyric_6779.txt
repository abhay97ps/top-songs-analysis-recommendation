Babe...
Come closer...
Why are you so far away?
I'm cold...
Prophecy fulfilled
An addiction to the thrill was overshadowed by my constant inability to feel
Had a convo with my conscience that’s been eating me alive since
Tell me I’m too young to die, but you and I know that I will
For real...
Probably thought it was only music
Even when I had a heart, I worked hard with no time to use it
I told y'all a storm was coming
Oh, you ain't heard how these wolves turn chattel and kindness, they abuse it
If best friends really make great for enemies
You'd better heed warnings if that's what it's finna be
In this uphill battle we call life
Lately, perspective isn't worth much, but that's alright
Cause even though I rarely saw light, never lost sight of my goals
Like never mind Rina, who's next up on the polls
Hold up
I missed out on plenty beautiful souls on this road to recovery, wait
Brittany, Tanisha, whoever
Just know I hope this planet loves you today
Who would have thought my downfall would set me up to be great
I spent years trying to fix myself and kept quiet
Watched friends start dropping like flies, but kept trying
Cause when life gave lemons, she kept it pushing despite them
Only for her to end up hanging, just like them
For years, tried to find a way to cope with her leaving
Like, maybe Rina killed herself because she thought she was dreaming
Though whatever keeps you alive will probably be your demise
But with all these lows, who thought our last high would be our goodbye
Cause they say money makes the world go round, I LOL at that
ILY though I know she won't ever text it back
When the sun goes down, tell me what you live for
Because I don’t see change round here
To be honest, I just see a lot a chains round here
Gold nooses, love ain’t a thing round here, whoa
I don’t have a lot of time left
Being afraid to love is childish
You know we’re all blessed
You’ll be leaking here for nothing, so love yours
Cause if it’s your last hour, then you know we’re bout to stress so hard
They say money makes the world go round, I LOL at that
IMY though I know she won't ever text it back
If I spit it, you'd better believe it's real
I make the type of records even a paraplegic feels
All perspective
I've seen dudes do less with more, fail to realize what they're blessed with
Before you know it, they go from the hardest person you've ever met in your life to a pessimistic mess on the floor that was destined to flourish
Dawg, it gets deep
No matter how popping these waves are
Cause ain't no better flow than me as far all these so called peers can see
Ain't even on my radar
Girls getting preyed on so much, they forget their knees were used to pray on
I just hope Aaliyah gets spared for her well being
I'm well aware my mind state is still healthy enough to feed her food for thought
I just hope she's still eating
With Kels at odds with herself, we'll never feel even
I was exhausted, lost in my thoughts
Making our moments bittersweet, thinking what did they cost
Could move mountains with this brain of mine, but couldn’t kill my doubt yet
These vocal chords are here for a reason, in need of outlets
Had to find some inner peace, leave me lone a couple years
Let me get back on my feet to fight my demons, not my tears
Feared the loss of my girls, through your minor point of views
Till I grew, and realized they were never mine to lose
When the sun goes down, tell me what you live for
Because I don’t see change round here
To be honest, I just see a lot a chains round here
Gold nooses, love ain’t a thing round here, whoa
I don’t have a lot of time left
Being afraid to love is childish
You know we’re all blessed
You’ll be leaking here for nothing, so love yours
Cause if it’s your last hour, then you know we’re bout to stress so hard
Back in the day, I used to hope I never crossed the line
End up crucified, these bullet will make you dolphin dive
I made a promise I’m down to keep till my dying day
Know it ain’t your time when even depression will stand in line to wait
Dudes I used to ball with are now spree killers
Best mistake was always being myself at the right time and place
I told y’all, it’s like three of me when I’m on my one, two
And I burn bridges, so where are my haters going to run to
Now you would think these memories trigger resentment
Negative energy seeping out of my pores like liquor
You hear the screeching of the tires, see the car smoke
But all you really see is black and white, Winnie Harlow
I don’t see the logic in it
Everybody under pressure cause whatever you say, everybody and their mom’s offended
Had to explain to Kelsey why I was done living
Everything I needed to do for me, I’m done with it
Need I reiterate that we’re rebels
I was fighting for years, till I found a way to dodge these devils
So many sacrifices had to be made
I’d rather not feel anything than ever have to be caged
Ain’t no more hopscotch where we stay
All they know is blood splatter, sirens, and police tape
Ironic how me dying early on allowed me to live longer
I’ll be fine knowing my soul has finally been granted a release date
When the sun goes down, tell me what you live for
Because I don’t see change round here
To be honest, I just see a lot a chains round here
Gold nooses, love ain’t a thing round here, whoa
I don’t have a lot of time left
Being afraid to love is childish
You know we’re all blessed
You’ll be leaking here for nothing, so love yours
Cause if it’s your last hour, then you know we’re bout to stress so hard
So as I was saying, the ramblings of a mad man can be very dangerous; especially for those that listen
