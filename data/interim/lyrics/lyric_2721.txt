Gottmik, was born a girl, baby
Was told that I can't do drag
Knew I had something to prove
Now you're gonna lose
Kandy Muse is in town, triple threat on the prowl
Bitches, bow down to the queen
I'm getting my crown, come on, Ru, pass it down
New York City gave birth to me
I'm ready to attack, it's a massive attack
You hoes better beware of thee
Sitting alone in the VIP
You could never compare to me
Ha-ha-ha, bitch
Condragulations, you're number one
I wanna thank you for a job well done
Condragulations, you're so much fun
Now let me tell you all the prizes you have won
Condragulations
LaLa Ri, the saint of drag
Flеw from the A to snatch the bag
Thesе girls will know I ain't no joke
Watch my runways gag their throats
Dance, twirl, make Momma proud
The next supreme to the crown
Now let me tell you what y'all should do
Make room for the queen of 13, boo
They call me Liv
Satin, velvet, and glitz
The new queen ready to shine
You see me play on the keys, Jersey to NYC
Lux is the one to beat, oh-oh-oh!
Condragulations, you're number one
I wanna thank you for a job well done
Condragulations, you're so much fun
Now let me tell you all the prizes you have won

The name's Symone and I'm here for the throne
Beat face and I'm Arkansas grown
The Ebony Enchantress is me
Legs up to my waist, talent you can't replace
Tina Burner on fire like the Hunger Games
Too hot to handle, getting burnt by these flames
Manhattan monster with a heart of gold
This joker's wild, these queens better fold
Death drops, splits may be some girls' choice
Stand up, act up, time to use your voice
The truth hurts, but I'll tell it to your face
And I'll smile real big waving from first place
Condragulations, you're number one
I wanna thank you for a job well done
Condragulations, you're so much fun
Now let me tell you all the prizes you have won

My hair is snatched, you looking ratch'
Compared to me, there ain't no match
Brightest one up in the batch
When it comes to fish, I'm the biggest catch
Underdog, that's what it took
Changing the game, rewrote the book
All you queens better take a look
My name is Elliott, why, you shook?
Condragulations, you're number one
I wanna thank you for a job well done 
Condragulations, you're so much fun 
Now let me tell you all the prizes you have won
