I don't know what you got
But it's getting to me
It makes my cold nights hot
Hot chills just run right through me
But all the power
Baby, is in your hands
You got me humming
'Cause you got me humming
I wake up early at night
I can't go back to sleep
Even when I try to talk
Tied tongue when I try to speak
When I try to walk
My feet start running
You got me humming
'Cause you got me humming
I don't know what you got
But it's getting to me
It makes my cold nights hot
Hot chills just run right through me
When I try to walk
My feet start running
You got me humming
'Cause you got me humming
Ohh, yeah
You got me humming
You make me feel
Lord, you make me feel so good
Uh huh, uh huh
Don't you know you got me
Don't you know you got me
Oh, baby, you know
You got me humming
I can't stand it
Lord, I can't stand it
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
You know you make me feel all right
You know you make me feel so good
Uh huh, uh huh, oh, ho
You know you make me feel all right
You know you make me feel all right
You know you make me feel all right
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
So good, so good, so good
You know you make me feel so good
Oh, yeah
