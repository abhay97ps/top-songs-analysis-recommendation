You don't know what you do to me
You changed around the scenery
And now everything is new to me
But it looks just right,yeah it looks just right
Whoa,it's strange but it's beautiful
Yeah,and I know where I am
Oh,I never been here before
I've never been loved like this
Never been tumblin',stumblin' over the words that get tangled inside of me
I've never been moved this way
Nobody's ever made me say
I'm 99.9% sure I've never been here before
I'm walkin' in a wonderland
Gone ever since it all began
And I don't even want to understand
'Cause it feels that good,yeah it feels that good
It's a state that ain't on a map
Yet I know where I'm at
Oh,I've never been here before
I've never been loved like this
Never been tumblin',stumblin' over words that get tangled inside of me
I've never been moved this way
Nobody's ever made me say
99.9% sure I've never been here before
Ninety-nine point,ninety-nine point
Na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na
Ninety-nine point,ninety-nine point
Na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na
It's a state that ain't on a map
Yet I know where I'm at
Oh,I never been here before
I've never been loved like this
Never been tumblin',stumblin' over the words that get tangled inside of me
I've never been moved this way
Nobody's ever made me say
I'm 99.9% sure I've never been here before
I've never been here before
I've never been loved this this
Never been tumblin,stumblin' over the words that get tangled inside of me
I've never been moved this way
Nobody's ever made me say
99.9% sure I've never been here before
No,I've never been here before
I've never been here before 
I've never been here before
99.9% sure I've never been here before
