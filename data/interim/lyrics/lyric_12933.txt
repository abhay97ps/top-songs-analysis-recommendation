Blue Jean, I just met me a girl named Blue Jean
Blue Jean, she got a camouflaged face and no money
Remember they always let you down when you need 'em
Oh, Blue Jean, is heaven any sweeter than Blue Jean
She got a police bike
She got a turned up nose
Sometimes I feel like
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
Blue Jean can send me
Somebody send me
One day I'm gonna write a poem in a letter
One day I'm gonna get that faculty together
Remember like everybody has to wait in line
Oh, Blue Jean, look out world, oh you know I've got mine
She got Latin roots
She got everything
Sometimes I feel like
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
Blue Jean can tempt me
Somebody sent me
{Hook}
Sometimes I feel like
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
Blue Jean can tempt me
Somebody sent me
Somebody, somebody
Somebody send me
