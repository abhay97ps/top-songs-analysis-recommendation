Everyday, it's a gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
Hey, hey, everyday, it's a gettin' faster
Everyone said go ahead and ask her
Love like yours will surely come my way
Hey, hey, hey, everyday, seems a little longer
And every way, love's a little stronger
Come what may, do you ever long for true love from me
Everyday, it's a gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
Hey, hey, hey
Everyday, seems a little longer
And every way, a love's a little stronger
Come what may, do you ever long for true love from me
Oh, everyday, it's a gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
Hey, hey, hey
Love like ours will sure be here to stay
