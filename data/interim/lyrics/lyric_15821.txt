I'll never be more loved than I am right now
Wasn't holding You up
So, there's nothing I can do to let You down
It doesn't take a trophy
To make You proud
I'll never be more loved than I am right now, oh
Going through a storm, but I won't go down
I hear Your voice carried
In the rhythm of the wind to call me out
You would cross an ocean so I wouldn't drown
You've never been closer than You are right now
Let's sing it out y'all
You are Jireh, You are enough
Jireh, You are enough
And I will be content 
In every circumstance
 Jireh,  You are Ðµnough
Forever enough, always enough
More than enough
Forever enough, always enough
More than enough
I don't wanna forget how I feel right now
On the mountaintop
I can see so clear what it's all about
So stay by my side when the sun goes down
Don't wanna forget how I feel right now
 Jireh,  You are enough
 Jireh,  You are enough
 I will be content
 In every circumstance
 Jireh,  You are enough
He's forever enough, always enough
Oh, He's more than enough
He is, sing: He is
Forever enough 
Always enough 
More than enough 
Mm, I'm already loved
I'm already chosen
I know who I am
I know what You've spoken
I'm already loved
More than I could imagine
And that is enough, oh
I'm already loved 
I'm already chosen 
I know who I am 
I know what You've spoken 
I'm already loved 
More than I could imagine 
That is enough 
It's enough for me, oh
I'm already loved 
I'm already chosen 
I know who I am 
I know, I know what You've spoken 
I'm already loved 
More than I could even fathom 
And that is enough 
Yes it is
Yes, He knows
Yes, He knows
And that is enough 
What His truth says is better than anything
That is enough 
What He's declared over us, it's true
That is enough 
That is enough 
That is enough 
Jehovah, You are 
El Shaddai, You are 
When I have You, I have everything 
When I have Jesus, I have everything 
That is enough 
'Cause You are enough 
You're my portion 
You're my portion 
More than enough for me 
Sing: "You are enough for me" 
So I am enough 
You are enough 
So I am enough 
 Jireh, You are enough
 Jireh,  You are enough
 That I will be content
 In every circumstance
 Jireh,  You are enough
If He dresses the lilies
With beauty and splendor
How much more will He clothe you
How much more will He clothe you
If He watches over
Every sparrow
How much more does He love you
How much more does He love you
If He dresses the lilies
With beauty and splendor 
How much more will He clothe you 
How much more will He clothe you 
If He watches over 
Every sparrow 
How much more does He love you 
How much more does He love you 
Oh, if He dresses the lilies 
Oh, with beauty and splendor 
How much more will He clothe you 
Our God is provider 
So don't you worry 
No, don't you worry 
I'm falling in Love's love 
I'm falling in Love's love 
How much more 
How much more 
How much more 
Our Father loves you 
How much more does He love you 
It's more than you ask, think or imagine 
According to His power working in us
It's more than enough
It's more than you ask, think or imagine, oh yeah
According to His power working in us 
It's more than enough
Let's go, y'all, say: 
It's more than you ask, think or imagine
