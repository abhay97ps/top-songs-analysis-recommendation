She was aware of her insecurities
As she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there
That she'd be discovered someday
So she belted it, she hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh she melted them, as she brought them to their feet
She was a big star at Banana Joe's bar where
She sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star
She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place
She signed autographs like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath, that small-time town was hers
She doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends cut her down
They only thought she entertains is
Where they are and where she is now
All her old neighbors swear they're certain
She slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you are going
Unless you got something they have not got
So she sings tonight to twenty thousand plus
And the young girls scream out loud
Man, that could be us
She's a big star as she eats caviar
Just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She's a big star
She's a big star
