Face-to-face and heart-to-heart
We're so close, yet so far apart
I close my eyes, I look away
That's just because I'm not okay
But I hold on, I stay strong
Wondering if we still belong
Will we ever say the words we're feeling
Reach down underneath and tear down all the walls?
Will we ever have a happy ending
Or will we forever only be pretending?
Will we a-ah, a-ah-lways, a-ah, a-ah-lways, a-ah, a-ah-lways be pretending?
How long do I fantasize
Make believe that it's still alive
Imagine that I am good enough
And we can choose the ones we love?
But I hold on, I stay strong
Wondering if we still belong
Will we ever say the words we're feeling
Reach down underneath and tear down all the walls?
Will we ever have a happy ending
Or will we forever only be pretending?
Will we a-ah, a-ah-lways, a-ah, a-ah-lways, a-ah, a-ah-lways be...
Keeping secrets safe
Every move we make
Seems like no one's left to know
And it's such a shame
'Cause if you feel the same
How am I supposed to know?
Will we ever say the words we're feeling
Reach down underneath and tear down all the walls?
Will we ever have a happy ending
Or will we forever only be pretending?
Will we a-ah, a-ah-lways, a-ah, a-ah-lways, a-ah, a-ah-lways be...
Will we a-ah, a-ah-lways, a-ah, a-ah-lways, a-ah, a-ah-lways be...
Will we a-ah, a-ah-lways, a-ah, a-ah-lways, a-ah, a-ah-lways be pretending?
