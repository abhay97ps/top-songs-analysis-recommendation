Think I might get lucky tonight
Let my hair down get a little crazy, yeah
My reflection's doing alright
It don't take nothing to introduce suggestion
Everbody's got one thing on their mind
A set of wheels and a cranked up radio
In this town there might be nowhere to hide
In this town there might be nowhere to go but
On my left - to my right
This is my paradise
You can call it what you like - I know
This is my paradise
I might get lucky again
I got a deal I know won't break me yeah
If I can afford what money can't buy
There's nothing better than a small town lady
I'm no different to the boy next door
A good time's the same for everyone
I don't need another chance to be sure
Since the day I was born I've always felt secure 'cos
On my left - to my right
This is my paradise
You can call it what you like - I know
This is my paradise
Reputation's got a price of its own
But not too many people want to pay for it
Everybody needs a place to come from
Everybody needs a place where they belong
Everybody - this is my paradise
On my left - to my right
This is my paradise
You can call it what you like - I know
This is my paradise
