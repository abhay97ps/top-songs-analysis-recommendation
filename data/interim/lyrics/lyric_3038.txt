I said na na na na ...
You gotta know how to pony
Like Bonie Maronie
You gotta know how to twist
I said, it just like this
I said mashed potato
Do the alligator
I said, Billy, get your yo-yo
Come on and let's go
I said clap your hands 
I said clap your hands 
And then move your feet 
Get into that beat 
I said na na na na...
Everybody, come on now
Na na na na...
Yes, a one more time
Na na na na...
You gotta know how to jerk 
Come on, baby, work
You gotta know how to jangle
Make you do the tango
I said, do the Watusi
Coeme on and do the Watusi
Ooh, ooh, ooh...
Ooo ooh ooh
I said, goodbye Lucy
I said, goodbye child
I said, wa-watusi...
