Usually in the morning
I'm filled with sweet belonging
And everything is beautiful to see
Even when it's raining
The sound of heaven singing
Is simply joyful music to me
Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you
So many different places
A million smiling faces
Life is so incredible to me
Especially to be near you
And how it is to touch you
Oh, paradise was made for you and me
Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you
I know that life goes on just perfectly
Everything is just the way that it should be
Still there are times when my heart feel like breaking
And anywhere is where I'd rather be
Oh, and in the nighttime
I know that it's the right time
To hold you close and say "I love you so"
To have someone to share with
And someone I can care with
And that is why I wanted you to know
Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you
Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you
Without you
