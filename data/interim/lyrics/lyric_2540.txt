Number one
Was just a small town hick
Number two
Was my best friend named Dick
Number three
She called him Doc, that's me
Hickory, Dick and Doc she called us
We chased her around the clock
Night and day, Hickory, Dick and Doc
Thought she loved us until we heard her say
They're just like three blind mice
Three blind mice, see how they run after me
Hickory, Dick and Doc around the clock
See how they run after me
Number one
Well, I never cared much for him
Number two
Well, he's no longer my best friend
Number three
I've gotta keep her love from them
Hickory, Dick and Doc she called us
We chased her around the clock
Night and day, Hickory, Dick and Doc
Thought she loved us until we heard her say
They're just like three blind mice
Three blind mice, see how they run after me
Hickory, Dick and Doc around the clock
See how they run after me
Three blind mice, three blind mice
See how they run, see how they run
Three blind mice
Three blind mice
