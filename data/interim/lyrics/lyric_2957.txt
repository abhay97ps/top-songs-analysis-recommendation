Break away, break away
Break away from that boy, he's not your kind
Break away, break away
Break away from his arms and come to mine
It hurts me so to see you
When you're crying
All he's doing, doing, doing
Doing's handing you a line
You better break away
Break away, break away
Break away, break away
Break away from that boy, he's not your kind
I'm the guy who sees
He will lead you to believe
That you're the only
Love in his life
He'll put stardust in your eyes
And build castles in your skies
And he's out with a
New girl every night
You better break away, break away
Break away from that boy, he's not your kind
Break away, break away
Break away from his arms and come to mine
It hurts me so to see you
When you're crying
All he's doing, doing, doing
Doing's handing you a line
You better break away
Break away, break away
Break away, break away
Break away from that boy, he's not your kind
You better break away
Break away, break away
Break away, break away
Break away from that boy, he's not your kind
