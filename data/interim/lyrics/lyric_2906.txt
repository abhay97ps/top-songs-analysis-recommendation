 Come on, children
 Hey!
Can you do the jerk?
Come on, let's work
Move your shoulders up and down
Your feet don't leave the ground
Anyone can do it
Friends, there's nothing to it
If you're young or old
All it takes is soul
But I just wanna know can you jerk like me
Come on, children 
Hey, come on children now 
Hey, baby
I just wanna know 
Hey, baby
Now you're right back in the groove
Like I said if you're feet don't move
Ah, get hump up in your back
Ah, take care of all the slack
Ah, come on, let's work
Snap your fingers, make your backbone work
Now you've got that feeling
'Cause the music's got you reeling
And I just wanna know 
Come on, children 
Hey, baby 
Hey, come on, children now
I just wanna know 
Hey, baby, ow, it's alright
I just wanna know 
Hey, baby
Now you're right in the groove
Like I said, if your feet don't move
Come on, baby, let's work
Just snap your fingers, make your backbone jerk
Now, you've got that feeling
When the music's got you reeling
Now you know how it goes
I just wanna know 
Hey, baby 
Come on, children 
Hey, baby 
Come on now, children, now 
Oh, baby
