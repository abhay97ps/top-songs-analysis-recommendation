Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said, "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black
But when I come back
You'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time 
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
But I won't go, go, go
I'd rather be at home with Ray 
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing 
Nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn  from Mr. Hathaway
Yeah, yeah
I didn't get a lot in class {Whoah, oh, woah}
But I know it don't come 
In a shot glass
They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said, "No, no, no" 
Yes I've been black
But when I come back
You'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time 
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
They tried to make me go to rehab
But I won't go, go, go 
The man said
"Why do you think you here?"
"Why do you think you here?"
I said, "I got no idea." 
"I'm gonna 
Gonna"
"Lose my baby." 
"So, I always keep a bottle near."
He said, "I just think your depressed."  {Depressed!}
This me , "Yeah, baby, and the rest." {And the rest!}
They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said, "No,  no,  no."
Yes, I've been black
But when I come back
You'll know,  know,  know
I don't never wanna drink again 
I just, ooh, I  {I need a friend}
I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
I'm not gonna spend it
Have everyone think I'm on the mend 
It's not just my pride 
It's just 'till these
Tears have dried
They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said, "No, no, no" {Oh, no}
Yes I've been black
But when I come back
You'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time {Time}
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine {Daddy thinks I'm fine}
They tried to make me go to rehab
But I won't go, go, go
