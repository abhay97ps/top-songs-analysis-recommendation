Is there any chance that you and I
Can start all over
Will you say you'll try
Is there any chance that you may be
Still a little bit in love with me
Do I feel it when we say hello
Or is it just because I'm hoping so
Do you still have faith in our romance
Will you tell me
Is there any chance
Is there any chance your heart may try
To trust again the heart that made you cry
Is there any chance you might forgive
Oh, you must, or how else can I live
Is there any chance that you and I
Can start all over
Will you say you'll try
Is there any chance that you may be
Still a little bit in love with me
