Ma!
Ma, he's making eyes at me
Ma, he's awfully nice to me
Ma, he's almost breaking my heart
He's beside me
Mercy!
Let my conscience guide me!
Ma, he wants to marry me
Oh, be my honey bee
Every minute he gets bolder
Now he's leaning on my shoulder
Ma, he's kissing me
Ma, he's making eyes at me
Ma, he's awfully nice to me
Ma, he's almost breakin' my heart
He's beside me
Mercy!
Let my conscience guide me!
Ma, he wants to marry me
Be my honey bee
Every minute he gets bolder
Now he's leaning on my shoulder
Ma, he's kissing me
Ma, he's kissing me
