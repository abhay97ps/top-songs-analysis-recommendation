I was so lonely until I met you
Told myself I'd get by without love
Drownin' my sorrows, avoiding tomorrows
Kind of felt that I just had enough
You light up my face with your jokes and your smiles
And the way that you came here tonight
Don't know what you got, but I'm sure glad I found you
Could be wrong but it sure feels right
And here I am
I'm back on my feet again
Here I am
I'm back on my feet again
Surprised at myself for the way that I feel
So happy that you're here with me
Some women I've known, have left me with nothing
But I guess that was just meant to be
And here I am
I'm back on my feet again
Here I am
I'm back on my feet again
I was down for the count
I was down, I was beat, I was cryin'
I was cornered and hurt
I was hidin' my face, sittin' there cryin'
I was so lonely until I met you
Told myself I'd get by without love
Drowning my sorrows, avoiding tomorrows
Kind of felt that I just had enough
And here I am
I'm back on my feet again
Here I am
I'm back on my feet again
Yeah, here I am
I'm back on my feet again
Here I am
I'm back on my feet again
Ooh yeah, here I am
I'm back on my feet again
Here I am
I'm back on my feet again
Here I am, yeah
I'm back on my feet again
Here I am
I'm back on my feet again
