I haven't gotten used to it yet
Not feeling you here in the night
But there are a few who have been trying to help
And I have been doing alright
I didn't think I'd see you at John-John's
Might have gone somewhere else instead
It's really amazing how you still can work your way back inside of my head
You say since we're both together
And it's lonesome out tonight
Maybe we can help each other
If you hold me very tight
Love me one more time just for old time's sake
Love me one more time there's no more pride at stake
Love me one more time we can erase all the lonely days
One more time one more time one more time
I wish that I could find the strength
To walk out the door with my pride
But memories of our faded love
Keep pushing the judgment aside
I wish that you would lay down beside me
If only to buffer the pain
There's no one else waiting to fill up my night
And I like a familiar terrain
Yes since we're both together
And it's lonesome out tonight
Maybe we can help each other
If you hold me very tight
Love me one more time just for old time's sake
Love me one more time there's no more pride at stake
Love me one more time we can erase all the lonely days
One more time one more time one more time
I said love me one more time just for old time's sake
Love me one more time there's no more pride at stake
Love me one more time we can erase all the lonely days
One more time one more time one more time
I said love me one more time just for old time's sake
Love me one more time there's no more pride at stake
Love me one more time we can erase all the lonely days
One more time one more time one more time
