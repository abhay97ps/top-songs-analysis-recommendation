Album : For God's Sake Give More Power To The People 
There's something that I want to give you
I'm gonna give you a five pound box of love
With a million dollar bill on top 
Diamonds on every corner
And a big black pearl for a lock
Use my heart for a key
I want to pay you back 
I want to pay you back for loving me
Pay you back for loving me
Gonna give you a cloud of love to sleep on 
A determined man to rely on
Love around every corner 
Or wherever you might be
Hold you tight, but tenderly 
I want to pay you back 
I want to pay you back for loving me, me, me, me
What's the use in denying it, baby
What's the use in us fighting it, baby
What's the use in turning away
When we could be happy each and every day, day, day, day
I want to pay you back
Oh, I see heaven when we look into the mirror
And an angel when you're asleep
Bright sunshine in the morning 
Though it may be raining in the street
And now I'm gonna even the score
I want to pay you back 
I want to pay you back for loving me
Pay you back for loving me
I want to pay you back
I want to pay you back for loving me
I want to pay you back
I want to pay you back for loving me, me
I want to pay you back 
I want to pay you back for loving me
I want to pay you back 
I want to pay you back for loving me, me
I want to pay you back 
I want to pay you back for loving me
I want to pay you back 
I want to pay you back for loving me, me, me, me
I want to pay you back  
I want to pay you back
