People try to put us d-down 
Just because we get around 
Things they do look awful c-c-cold 
I hope I die before I get old 
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
Why don't you all f-fade away 
And don't try to dig what we all s-s-say 
I'm not trying to cause a big s-s-sensation 
I'm just talkin' 'bout my g-g-g-generation 
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
Why don't you all f-fade away 
And don't try to d-dig what we all s-s-say 
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation 
I'm just talkin' 'bout my g-generation 
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
My, my, my generation
My, my, my generation
People try to put us d-down 
Just because we g-g-get around 
Things they do look awful c-c-cold 
I hope I die before I get old 
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
My, my, my generation
 My generation
 My generation
 This is my generation, baby
 This is my generation
 This is my generation
 This is my generation
 This is my generation
