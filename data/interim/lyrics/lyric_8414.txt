Too late
Am I too late?
Too late
Am I too late?
Pain is my best friend
Makin' me think of you again
Wakin' me up and sayin'
"Fool, you've been careless and blind, unkind"
Tears I made you shed
Me, I made this bad
I'm the man whose jones
Can't be brought into line
Am I too late to get in your door?
Am I too late? Have you locked the store?
Am I too late to sweep up the floor?
No, no, no, no
Eyes that could not see
Arms that could not be
Lips that would not say
What you waited to hear, my dear
I'm the one to blame
That and so ashamed
Girl, I'm comin' home
It's you I wanna be near
Am I too late to get in your door?
Am I too late? Have you locked the store?
Am I too late to sweep up the floor?
Too late
Am I too late?
Too late
Am I too late?
Too late, too late
Too late, too late
Too late, can I get in your door?
Too late, wanna love you some more
Too late, can't you see that I'm here?
Too late, got us love that is real
Girl, I would do anything just for you
If you tell me it isn't too late
Am I too late to get in your door?
Am I too late? Have you locked the store?
Am I too late to sweep up the floor?
Girl, I would do anything just for you
If you tell me
Am I too late to get in your door?
Am I too late? Have you locked the store?
Am I too late to sweep up the floor?
Girl, I was wrong, this is where I belong
Am I too late to get in your door?
