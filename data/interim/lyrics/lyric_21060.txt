I am confident, but I still have my moments
Baby, that's just me
I'm not a supermodel, I still eat McDonald's
Baby, that's just me
Well, some may say I need to be afraid of losing everything
Because of where I had my start and where I made my name
Well, everything's the same in the la la land machine
Machine, machine
Who said I can't wear my Converse with my dress?
Well, baby, that's just me
Who said I can't be single and have to go out and mingle?
Baby, that's not me
No, no
Well, some may say I need to be afraid of losing everything
Because of where I had my start and where I made my name
Well, everything's the same in the la la land
Tell me, do you feel the way I feel?
'Cause nothing else is real in the la la land appeal
Some may say I need to be afraid of losing everything
Because of where I had my start and where I made my name
Well, everything's the same in the la la land machine
Well, I'm not gonna change in the la la land machine
I will stay the same in the la la land...
Machine
Machine, machine
I won't change anything in my life
I'm staying myself tonight
