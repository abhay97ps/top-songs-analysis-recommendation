Loving you is wonderful
Something like a miracle
Rest assured I feel the same way you do
Needing you, it isn't hard
With you, I can let down my guard
Stay secure that's all I'm asking from you
I wish I had words to tell 
This feeling that I know so well
But I don't, I don't
All that I can say
All that I can say
All that I can say
All that I can say
I've always been curious
Meeting someone serious
Looking for someone who loves like me
But the day I stopped my search
It seemed that you were put on Earth
To show me everything I could not see
I wish I could find a way
To tell you how I felt that day
But I can't 
I can't
All that I can say
All that I can say
All that I can say
All that I can say
Knowing him, loving him
Showing him that I'm all in
Living and, forgiving and
I would do it all again
Genuine, seraphim
Sweeter than cinnamon
Heaven-sent gentleman
Synonyms for loving him
All that I can say
All that I can say
All that I can say
All that I can say
You're all...
All that I can say
All I can say
All that I can say
He's all that I'll ever need
He's got a hold on me
I love you
Oh, I don't wanna live without you
You're all that I can say, hey
Loving you is wonderful
All that I can say
All that I can say
All that I...
All I can say
Loving you is wonderful
