LD, AKA The Independent Variable
Trap God, and we servin' out the hallway
Ayy, where the gold at, baby? 
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby? 
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow dat, baby
Ayy, we gon' save that money 
Ayy, we gon' save that money 
Ayy, we gon' save that money
What we doin'? We gon' save dat money
The rap game got it all wrong
We ain't 'bout to go and spend money just to flex on 'em
We ain't really got it like y'all 
I'm a type of motherfucker that'll check the check
Do the math, I ain't never gettin' robbed 
Those margaritas not goin' on my card 
I ain't 'bout to split a damn thing for convenience sake
I'm at the restaurant workin' that waitress
Hold up
You ain't heard of Lil Dave, Yung L the Jew biz major? 
Fuck you know about the world he raised in? 
I've been savin' money since a motherfucker 13
I wear the same pair of jeans every day 
Free sandwiches, homie, two stamps away 
Book flight December but I leave in May 
Drugs are generic but still work the same
I get logins for Netflix from my cousin Greg
Thanks, Greg!
Ayy, where the gold at, baby? 
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby? 
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby
Ayy, we gon' save that money 
Ayy, we gon' save that money 
Ayy, we gon' save that money

All of my luggage is Louis V, I swear to God, nigga
All of my bitches be scared of me, I put that rod in 'em
All of them bitches actin' thoughtless, I disregardin' them
All of them bitches actin' holy, ain't got no God in 'em
I can teach a lil' nigga somethin' like a preacher
I can take his ass to church fresh as hell, no Easter
I can make his ass burp like a baby without no hiccup
I could...
Quan what's this have to do with saving money though?
You know what a full verse would have been too expensive anyways
I think
Trap, trap, trap
I ain't parkin' that unless the meter green, homie 
Hair cut several months in-between, homie 
Hit the mafuckin' lights when I leave, homie 
Single ply TP, ass bleed
Airbnb the motherfuckin' lease, I'm never there
I'm out in Cali, why the fuck my company in Delaware?
At happy hour takin' out the chicken, I don't even care
And that applies to both dating and wings
Peep matinees, phone bill got the motherfuckin' fam on it 
401K, rollin' over bands on it 
Coppin' sweaters in the summer when the sale on 'em 
The fuck you rappers bragging 'bout? You overpaying for it
Ayy, where the gold at, baby? 
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby? 
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby
Ayy, we gon' save that money 
Ayy, we gon' save that money 
Ayy, we gon' save that money 
What we do? We gon' save that money
I ain't never hit a bar with a cover 
Low thread count, hard with the covers 
Free trial memberships, though
I never join the shiz though 
Fuck you think this is though?
Frequent flying like a motherfuckin' finch though 
General Tso, half a dozen on the stick
Just so I can whet the appetite a bit
Whatchu talkin' 'bout?
My AC never doing nothing, blow fans though 
Walgreens card shoppin' all the off brands, though 
Boy go hard when collecting, got Venmo 
Save every motherfuckin' roach, tryna smoke 
Check the clothes in my drawers, I ain't playin' around
It's LD, lil boy, Mr. Hand-me-down
My dirty drawers gettin' worn, can you blame me now?
You think I got $4.50 up in quarters on me, well I fuckin' don't!
Ayy, where the gold at, baby? 
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby? 
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby
Ayy, we gon' save that money 
Ayy, we gon' save that money 
Ayy, we gon' save that money 
What we do? We gon' save that money
Every time these niggas tryna play
And lately, I've been stackin' up crazy
Stackin' up 'cause all about the bands, baby
800K underneath the bed baby, ayy
If you at a restaurant and got a iced coffee
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see he double charged ya
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem, sing along like
Ohh, don't double charge me for that
Don't double charge me, we like
Ohh, don't double charge me for that
Don't do it to yourself
'Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
What the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be 
So think about it, take a minute, let it breathe, B
But think about it, bruh, you saw me get the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger
Versus the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter tryna tell me something different
I'ma get on Yelp in a minute and review
This piece of shit place like only a kike know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...
Oh, it was just an accident?
You didn't even mean that
You didn't even... that was... that's... I'm so embarrassed
