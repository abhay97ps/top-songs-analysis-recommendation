Pick it up
This'll get you out of your head
China's hanging out by the railings
Of the motorshed
She goes with a real hit biker
He's a metalhead
She looks me up and down
Talking dirty eyes
Sweet saying boy baby
I could lick ya any time
Keep it up
That's right...here we go again
Bit later I'm going to run
Into her round the back
While other guys break heads
In the Sugar Shack
Don't give me drink I don't want to
Get too stoned
Then we're going to see who's going to
Take who home
The violence of summer
A love's taking over
It starts with desire
Ends up under cover
Those lips will make me rise
You may look down but don't think twice
Slow death is on the way
So what man I still want to play
One, two
This'll get you out of your mind
This'll get you up...let's go
Maybe take a ride going south
Where her mother writes
Before bad news catches up
We still got a little time
We'll leave it all so far away
One thing is sure we shouldn't stay
I take it all little Chine going to
Get the runaround a run... a runaround
China... na china...nanana
China... na china...nanana
China... na china...nanana
China... na china...nana
