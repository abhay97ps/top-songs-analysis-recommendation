I ain't gonna marry in the fall
And I ain't gonna marry in the spring
For I'm in love with a pretty little girl
Who wears a diamond ring
Oh, uh, oh
I'm just a country boy
Money have I none
But I've got silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun
And gold in the morning sun
Never gonna kiss those ruby red lips
Of the prettiest girl in town
Never gonna ask her if she'd marry me
'cause I know she'd turn me down
'cau-au-au-use
I'm just a country boy
Money, money have I none
But I've got silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun
And gold in the morning sun
Never could afford a store-bought ring
With a sparkling diamond stone
All I could afford was a loving heart
The only one I own
'cau-au-au-au-au-ause
I'm just a country boy
Money, money have I none
But I've got silver, silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun
And gold .all in the morning sun
