Completely, wanna give my love, completely
I'd rather be alone than be in love just half a way
I want to find someone that I can trust
Completely, wanna give my heart, completely
To someone who'll completely give their heart to only me
And than I find that one that's when I'll fall in love
Completely, not half but whole with heart and soul
Completely, not in between but everything, completely
That's the way it's got to be
The way I want someone to fall in love with me
Forever, wanna feel the word forever
And know there'll be somebody there forever by my side
And when that feeling comes, that's when I'll give my love
Completely, not half but whole with heart and soul
Completely, not in between but everything, completely
That's the way it's got to be
The way I want someone to fall in love with me
It's all or nothing at all for this heart of mine
And I won't give up this heart until the day I find
Somebody who can be someone who loves me
Completely, not half but whole with heart and soul
Completely, not in between but everything, completely
That's the way it's got to be
The way I want someone to fall in love with me
The way I need someone to fall in love with me, oooh oooh
