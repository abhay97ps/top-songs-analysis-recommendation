I reached out my arms and I touched you
With soft words I whispered your name
I held you right on the tip of my fingers
But that was as close as I came
My eyes had vision of sweet lips
Yielding beneath my command
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands
But I let it slip right through my hands
Somebody took you when I wasn't looking
And I should have known from the start
It's a long, long way from the tip of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart
To the love hidden deep in your heart
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands
Yes, I let it slip right through my hands...
