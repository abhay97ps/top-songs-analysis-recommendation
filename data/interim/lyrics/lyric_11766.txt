Let's go out in a blaze of glory
All good things must end
Like two heroes in a story
Let's go out like we came in
In a blaze of glory
Here we are, broken-hearted
We thought our love would never end
We fell hard when we got started
Fallin' out like we fell in
Let's go out in a blaze of glory
All good things must end
Like two heroes in a story
Let's go out like we came in
In a blaze of glory
Let's don't lie and hurt each other
That would be our worst mistake
Once again let's act like lovers
One more time for old-time's sake
Let's go out in a blaze of glory
All good things must end
Like two heroes in a story
Let's go out like we came in
In a blaze of glory
Let's go out 
In a blaze of glory 
All good things must end
Like two heroes  in a story 
Let's go out  like we came in 
In a blaze of glory
