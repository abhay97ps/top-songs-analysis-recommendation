Yeah, yeah
Wait a minute, who are you? 
Let's go 
Yeah, I took the cash route
I put in more time, more grind, no lyin'
I didn't take the fast route 
Suck it up, no cryin', no cryin', no cryin'
I didn't ask for handouts 
Go to work, no grind, no shine, no shine
And that's how you stand out 
Yeah, that's how I stand out 
Yeah, I took the cash route
I put in more time, more grind, no lyin' 
I didn't take the fast route
Suck it up, no cryin', no cryin', no cryin'
I didn't ask for handouts 
Go to work, no grind, no shine, no shine 
And that's how you stand out
Yeah, that's how I stand out 
Yeah, I took the cash route
I did it and did it again 
I started at one and I went up to ten
Came back, now I'm winning again 
We pull up behind tints, which one he gon' hop out? 
They don't know what whip that he in 
Put in hours of practice and that's how it happened
I don't even pick up a pen
Nah, I'm comin' straight up off the top with it 
Ain't a power forward, he ain't a center, but he was on the block with me
Shootin' in the gym, we really got it in, he put up the shots with me 
Now we breakin' bread, everybody playin', he hold up a knot with me 
We took the cash route 
Yeah, I'm talkin' mula, fetty 
We grew up off of noodles, spaghetti
Used to be peanut butter and jelly 
Now the Chevy gon' come when it's ready 
What you know 'bout the lights off, candles? 
I provide with the mic off dancin' 
I'm a star and I'm moonwalkin'
Now I got the whole room talkin'
Yeah, I'm talkin' trophies
I got everybody talkin' down, actin' like they know me
I'm a champion like LeBron, ballin' with my homies
I'm better than the old me
R.I.P. to Kobe, yeah
Yeah, I took the cash route 
Put in more time, more grind, no lyin'
I didn't take the fast route 
Suck it up, no cryin', no cryin', no cryin'
I didn't ask for handouts 
Go to work, no grind, no shine, no shine
And that's how you stand out 
Yeah, that's how I stand out 
Yeah, I took the cash route 
I put in more time, more grind, no lyin'
I didn't take the fast route 
Suck it up, no cryin', no cryin', no cryin'
I didn't ask for handouts 
Go to work, no grind, no shine, no shine 
And that's how you stand out 
Yeah, that's how I stand out 
Yeah
Yeah
Uh-huh
