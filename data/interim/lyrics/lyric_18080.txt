You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop
'Cause you a bug a boo
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You're buggin' me, and don't you see it ain't cool?
It's not hot
That you be callin' me, stressin' me, pagin' my beeper
You're just non-stop
And it's not hot
That you be leavin' me messages every 10 minutes
And then you stop by
When I first met you, you were cool
But it was game you had me fooled
'Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number
You already had my mailbox full
So, what - you bought a pair of shoes
What, now I guess you think I owe you?
You don't have to call as much as you do
I'd give 'em back to be through with you
And so, what? My mama likes you
What, now I guess you think I will too?
Even if the Pope said he liked you too
I don't really care, 'cause you're a bug a boo
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window 
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo 
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop 
'Cause you a bug a boo
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You're buggin' me, and don't you see it ain't cool?
It's not hot
That when I'm blockin' your phone number
You call me over your best friend's house
And it's not hot
That I can't even go out with my girlfriends
Without you trackin' me down
You need to chill out with that mess
'Cause you can't keep havin' me stressed
'Cause every time my phone rings, it seems to be you
And I'm prayin' that it is someone else
So, what - you bought a pair of shoes
What, now I guess you think I owe you? 
You don't have to call as much as you do
I'd give 'em back to be through with you
And so, what?  My mama likes you
What, now I guess you think I will too? 
Even if the Pope said he liked you too
I don't give a damn, 'cause you're a bug a boo
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles 
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo 
I wanna put your number on the call block 
Have AOL make my emails stop 
'Cause you a bug a boo
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You're buggin' me, and don't you see it ain't cool?
When you call me on the phone, you're buggin' me
When you follow me around, you're buggin' me
Everything you do be bugging me
You're buggin' me, you're buggin' me
When you show up at my door, you're buggin' me
When you open up your mouth, you're buggin' me
Every time I see your face, you're buggin' me
You're buggin' me, you're buggin' me
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window 
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles 
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug a boo , a bug a boo 
I wanna put your number on the call block 
Have AOL make my emails stop 
'Cause you a bug a boo 
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You're buggin' me, and don't you see it ain't cool?
