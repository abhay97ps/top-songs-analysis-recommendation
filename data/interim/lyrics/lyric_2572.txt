Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A boy to hold in my arms
And know the magic of his charms
Because I want a boy to call my own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone
Dream lover, where are you
With a love, oh, so true
And a hand that I can hold
To feel you near when I grow old?
Because I want a boy to call my own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone
Someday, I don't know how
I hope he'll hear my plea
Some way, I don't know how
He'll bring his love to me
Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Until my lover's dreams come true
Because I want a boy to call my own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone
