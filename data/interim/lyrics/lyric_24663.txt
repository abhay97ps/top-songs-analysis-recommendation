Yah, ya dig? 
Uncle Jim 
Ayy 
Nigga please, you ain't got as much guap as me
You don't wanna go dollar for dollar
You don't wanna go bottle for bottle
You don't wanna go bitch for bitch
'Cause all I ever fuck with is models 
I'm a motherfucking player, my nigga 
If she bad, I'ma slay her my nigga, yeah
Stunting ain't nothin' to me 
Pimping ain't nothin' to me 
Balling ain't nothin' to me 
Popping bottles, that ain't nothing to me 
Driving foreign cars ain't nothin' to me
That ain't nothin' to me 
Stunting ain't nothin' to me
Look at this shit, it ain't nothin' to me 
You don't even know what I'ma do
When I'm in the zoo looking at the zebras 
All these hoes, they some fucking cheetahs 
Uh-huh, they some fucking cheetahs 
Throwed off, nigga on the reefah
I've been drinking, drinking, drinking, drinking, drinking 
Hennesy going all through my system
Don't let your bitch be a victim
These niggas looking sad 
I'm running round with bags 
I'm into popping tags 
I ainâ€™t even got your brand 
Money talk for me
I'ma do the money walk down the street
I'ma do the money walk down Hollywood
Leave my name on Hollywood, nigga 
Your pockets looking brittle 
You a rat, Stuart Little 
Ten thousand dollar outfit
She can tell I'm a rich nigga 
Came out my momma like a boss
Got these hoes singing Diana Ross 
Making big moves constantly
EA need to sponsor me 
Swagged up, can't take it off of me
EarDrummers, we a damn monopoly
I remember I ain't have a pot to pee
Nowadays I'm everywhere the guala be 
When I follow bitch you gotta swallow me 
I ain't tricking bitch, it ain't Halloween 
We can't kick it bitch ain't no soccer team
I don't wanna talk, I ain't Socrates
Nigga please, you ain't got as much guap as me
You don't wanna go dollar for dollar
You don't wanna go bottle for bottle
You don't wanna go bitch for bitch
'Cause all I ever fuck with is models 
I'm a motherfucking player, my nigga 
If she bad, I'ma slay her my nigga, yeah
Stunting ain't nothin' to me 
Pimping ain't nothin' to me 
Balling ain't nothin' to me 
Popping bottles, that ain't nothing to me 
Driving foreign cars ain't nothin' to me
That ain't nothin' to me 
Stunting ain't nothin' to me
Look at this shit, it ain't nothin' to me 
 Stuntin' ain't really nothing
I walk like a jack in a box, I hop out the drop
Don't leave it to Beaver, just leave it to me
Gucci Mane making two million a week
Gucci earrings two hundred a pop
I cop when I shop, I don't know how to lease
Running like I don't even know how to sleep
You remind me of my Bentley GT
On Magic on Monday, I throw up the money
I'm a man crush every day of the week
I'ma ball hard like it's Super Bowl Sunday
A fool with the chewing, she chewing the D
What in the hell is she doing to me?
SWV got me weak in the knees
Give her the trophy, the throat of the week
Gucci the GOAT, got my foot on a throat
And my feet on the wood like I play in the league
Criss-crossing the country like crossing the skreet
And I feel like the Pope, all these crosses on me
If you still selling dope then I'm giving you hope
'Cause ain't none of them getting more money than me
I'ma keep giving them something to see
Honestly, none of them fucking with me
Nigga please, you ain't got as much guap as me
You don't wanna go dollar for dollar
You don't wanna go bottle for bottle
You don't wanna go bitch for bitch
'Cause all I ever fuck with is models 
I'm a motherfucking player, my nigga 
If she bad, I'ma slay her my nigga, yeah
Stunting ain't nothin' to me 
Pimping ain't nothin' to me 
Balling ain't nothin' to me 
Popping bottles, that ain't nothing to me 
Driving foreign cars ain't nothin' to me
That ain't nothin' to me 
Stunting ain't nothin' to me
Look at this shit, it ain't nothin' to me 
Nah, that ain't nothing to me
Boy, I get money in my sleep
Buy a new car every week
Get a new bitch everyday, ayy
Fuck what you heard, fuck what you say
Send them hitters where you stay
You don't wanna go shooter for shooter
You don't wanna go million for million
You don't wanna go bitch for bitch
I got bitches in Hawaii 
I got bitches down in Houston
Some millionaires and some boosting
Might call your bitch to make a movie
And you know it's X rated
Like you know my weed strong
And this Sprite I'm drinking medicated
Break out the dice, let's shoot 
I'm selfish, I only buy coupes 
Told a bitch to bring one friend
Hardheaded ass bitch brought two
Look one of them in the eye, said
"I already fucked you, why she brought you?"
I'm a player, these bitches, they love me
In the club passing out bubbly 
Bitch, I'm the shit like Ruffin 
Can't a nigga tell me nothing 
I'm out in Hollywood drugging 
Young nigga paid and thugging 
Dolce Gabbana tuxedo 
Trap nigga like Nino 
Just had a bad bitch trio
One Mexican and one Creole 
Nigga please, you ain't got as much guap as me
You don't wanna go dollar for dollar
You don't wanna go bottle for bottle
You don't wanna go bitch for bitch
'Cause all I ever fuck with is models 
I'm a motherfucking player, my nigga 
If she bad, I'ma slay her my nigga, yeah
Stunting ain't nothin' to me 
Pimping ain't nothin' to me 
Balling ain't nothin' to me 
Popping bottles, that ain't nothing to me 
Driving foreign cars ain't nothin' to me
That ain't nothin' to me 
Stunting ain't nothin' to me
Look at this shit, it ain't nothin' to me
