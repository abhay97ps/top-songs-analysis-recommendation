The Sun came pouring upon my face
I heard the silence of empty space
It took my passion, my dream of life
Left me too weak to fight
Please don't say it
I won't take it anymore
Why should I run and hide?
CHORUS
We are what we are
Oh, we're just like anybody else
We are what we are
Oh, we only want to be ourselves
Look above me, look all around
Imagination is what I've found
I never asked you to go away
Didn't want to cause you pain
Please don't say it
I won't take it anymore
Why should I run and hide?
CHORUS
Ourselves
Ourselves
CHORUS
CHORUS
CHORUS
CHORUS
