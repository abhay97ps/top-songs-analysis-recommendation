I've got another heartbreaker on my hands
Girl, I can't stand up to you and be a normal man
My heart can't take it, I'm fallin' in love with you
You'll trap me into doin' things I wouldn't ordinarily do
You're dynamite, you've got me uptight
The way you sock it to me, girl, you're outta sight
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker
She's a heartbreaker and all my buddies know
She makes me feel like a king behind closed doors
When we're out on a date and none of it shows
She makes me feel like the lowest man on the totem pole
She's dynamite, she's got me uptight
The way you sock it to me, girl, you're outta sight
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker
What a heartbreaker, the devil on wheels
Whatever you got, you sure make me feel real
I'll keep on hangin' out, hangin' in as long as I can
I can't help myself, here I go again
You're dynamite, you've got me uptight
The way you sock it to me, girl, you're outta sight
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker
My heartbreaker, heartbreaker
Oh heartbreaker, heartbreaker
