Father come home
Father come home
When I was young you helped me face
The child was all alone
But it's closing in father, come on home
When I was young you turned to me
Seemed like a friend I know
But now it scares me father, come on home
Come on home, to light the light
You can show the way
Come on home
Deliver us
From paths that we have strayed
Your solemn voice lies heavy on
The Strange land that we rule
Please father come on home
Father, come home
When we were young we worked the land
Sow across the 
Need your help in gathering
Come on home
The promised land you gave to us
The weeds have overgrown
Your words would help to clear them
Come on home
Come on home, to light the light
You can show the way
Come on home
Deliver us
From paths that we have strayed
Your solemn voice lies heavy on
The Strange land that we rule
Please father come on home
Father, come home
Come on home, to light the light
You can show the way
Come on home
Deliver us
From paths that we have strayed
Come on 
Come on 
Come on 
Come on
Come on 
Come on 
Come on 
Come on
