Yo, what up, this Wyclef with Mary J
I serenade the girls with my acoustic guitar
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, fellas havin' problems with the chicks?
I want you right now to turn the lights down low
Pull your girl up next to you
I want you to sing this to her
If death comes for me tonight, girl
I want you to know that I love you
And no matter how tough, I wouldn't dare
Only to you I would reveal my tears
See, tell the police I ain't home tonight
Messin' around with you is gonna get me life
But when I look into your eyes
You're worth that sacrifice
If this is the kind of love that my mom used to warn me about
Man, I'm in trouble
I'm in real big trouble
If this is the kind of love that the old folks used to warn me about
Man, I'm in trouble
I'm in real big trouble
I need y'all to do me a favor
Someone please call 911 
Tell them I just been shot down
And the bullet's in my heart
And it's piercin' through my soul 
Feel my body gettin' cold
Someone please call 911 
The alleged assailant is five foot one
And she shot me through my soul
Feel my body gettin' cold
So cold, so cold
Sometimes I feel like I'm a prisoner
I think I'm trapped here for a while, yeah, yeah 
And every breath I fight to take
Is as hard as these four walls I wanna break 
I told the cops you wasn't here tonight
Messin' around with me is gonna get you life
Oh yeah, yeah 
But every time I look into your eyes
Man, it's worth the sacrifice, ooh
If this is the kind of love that your mom used to warn you about
Mary, you're in trouble 
You're in real big trouble 
If this is the kind of love that the old folks used to warn me about 
I'm in trouble 
I'm in real big trouble 
You got anything to say, girl?
Someone please call 911, yeah yeah 
Tell them I just got shot down, tell them I just got shot down
And it's piercin' through my soul 
Feel my body gettin' cold, oh, so cold
Someone please call 911 
The alleged assailant was five foot one
And she shot me through my soul 
Feel my body gettin' cold
Wyclef and Mary J. Blige
I'm feelin' you, girl
I understand
And you're doin', what you're doin', would you do it
And do it and do it and do it for me
