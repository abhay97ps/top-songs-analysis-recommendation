Let the time flow
Let the love grow
Let the rain shower
Let the rose flower
Love it seeks, and love it finds
Love it conquers, love it binds
We come to each other from different worlds
Drawn to each other by the love inside of us
We give to each other our different worlds
As long as we can do it
Life is gonna breeze right through it
Let the time flow
Let the love grow
Let the rain shower
Let the rose flower
Love it seeks, and love it finds
Love it conquers, love it binds
We reach for each other from different worlds
With love for each other that will stand the test of time
We're up to the challenge of different worlds
With this love inside us
There is none that can divide us
Let the time flow
Let the love grow
Let the rain shower
Let the rose flower
Love it seeks, and love it finds
Love it conquers, love it binds
Love it seeks and love it finds
Love it conquers, love it binds
Ahhhhhhh, ahhhhhhh
Love it seeks, love it finds
Love it conquers, love it binds
