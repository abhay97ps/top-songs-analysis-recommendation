Ah
I'm goin' back to the South
I'm goin' back, back, back, back
Where my roots ain't watered down
Growin', growin' like a Baobab tree
Of life on fertile ground, my ancestors put me on game
Ankh charm on gold chains, with my Oshun energy, oh
Drip all on me, woo, Ankara Dashiki print
Hol' up, don't I smell like such a nag champa incense?
Yeah, pure ice , ice , buss down
Uh, flooded , flooded , on my wrist, out
Ooh, goin' up, goin' up, motherland, motherland drip on me
Ooh, melanin, melanin, my drip is skin deep, like
Ooh, motherland, motherland, motherland, motherland drip on me
Ooh, yeah, I can't forget my history is her-story, yeah
Being black, maybe that's the reason why
They always mad, yeah, they always mad, yeah
Been past 'em, I know that's the reason why
They all big mad and they always have been
Honey, come around my way, around my hive
Whenever mama say so, mama say
Here I come on my throne, sittin' high
Follow my parade, oh, my parade
Talkin' slick to my folk , nip that lip like lipo 
You hear them swarmin', right? Bees is known to bite
Now here we come on our thrones, sittin' high
Follow my parade, oh, my parade
Yeah, yeah, I'm for us, all black
All chrome , black-owned 
Black tints , matte black 
Roll by, my window down, let 'em see who in it
Crack a big smile 
Go figure, me and Jigga, fifty 'leven children
They like, "Chick, how?"
I charge my crystals in a full moon
You could send them missiles, I'ma send my goons
Baby sister reppin' Yemaya 
Trust me, they gon' need an army 
Rubber bullets bouncin' off me 
Made a picket sign off your picket fence 
Take it as a warning 
Waist beads from Yoruba 
Four hunnid billi', Mansa Musa 
Stroll line to the barbeque
Put us any-damn-where, we gon' make it look cute
Pandemic fly on the runway, in my hazmat
Children' runnin' through the house to my art, all black
Ancestors on the wall, let the ghosts chit-chat
Hold my hands, we gon' pray together
Lay down, face down in the gravel
Woo, wearin' all attire white to the funeral
Black love, we gon' stay together
Curtis Mayfield on the speaker 
Lil' Malcolm, Martin mixed with mama Tina 
Need another march, lemme call Tamika 
Need peace and reparation for my people 
Fuck these laid edges, I'ma let it shrivel up 
Fuck this fade and waves, I'ma let it dread all up 
Put your fist up in the air, show black love 
Motherland drip on me, motherland, motherland drip on me
