Huh? , okay
Look 
You know I ain't never had shit 
Now I'm somewhere in a meeting getting my ass kissed 
By a white man 'cause his daughter fuck with my ad-libs 
I done dropped dick in her friend, I'm like, "My bad, sis" 
That nigga act like he too good, even for a bad bitch 
I'm a buy a Lambo 'fore this album hit the fans, bitch
Tell the valet park my shit at the front, I'ma hit the gas bitch 
I just did five shows, three days, came out with the bag, bitch 
Pockets swole, 45K and a four-five, so I sag, bitch
If a fat bitch know how to get some money, I'll fuck a fat bitch 
Gotta show coming up in London and got London on da Track, bitch 
I give a fan a high five in the airport, she did a backflip 
I just went Platinum and I'm coming back like
Huh? Okay
Looking for me?
Huh? Okay
Looking for me?
Here I go
Man, fuck Baby
That little nigga in there 
She really selling pussy, she act like she selling swimwear 
A couple thousand to your name, act like a millionaire
But I don't knock your hustle, get it out the mud, I been there 
Man, I'm so tired of a nigga talking 'bout who broke like we ain't all came up from the bottom 
We came up, I give 'em hope
And way before a nigga signed, I made a rhyme, I was providing for my side 
No, I had them low, and they had them high
You shop with me, you ain't gotta lie 
Now a nigga legit, huh
Fifty thousand just to walk through and do my one-two on yo bitch, huh
And bougie hoes, they wanna fuck with me, now I got 'em all on my dick now
Like Lil Baby, four pockets all full of money, can't fit now
Man, I pull up, niggas howlin'
Huh? Okay
Looking for me?
Huh? Okay
Looking for me?
Here I go
You know I ain't never had shit, okay
Now I'm somewhere in a meeting getting my ass kissed 
By a white man 'cause his daughter fuck with my ad-libs 
I done dropped dick in her friend, I'm like, "My bad, sis" 
That nigga act like he too good, even for a bad bitch
