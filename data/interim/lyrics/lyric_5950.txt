How did it feel to be out there on your own
I  want to know
How  did it feel
Just for a bit of excitement
Girl you strayed away from home
I  want to know
Well,  how did it feel
Was it worth all the pain that you caused me
Was  it worth all the heartache that it brought me
How did it feel
When he held you in his arms
I want to know
How  did it feel
Well, well, well
Was it good to you 
Was it good to you 
Was it good to you 
Was it good to you 
Tell me face to face
Is somebody taking my place
Stepping in my shoes
I don't want to lose
Tell me how did it feel to be out there on your own
I want to know
How did it feel
Just for a bit of excitement
Girl you strayed away from home
I want to know
How did it feel
Honey, was it worth all the pain that you caused me
Was it worth all the heartache that you brought me
How did it feel when he took you in his arms
I want to know
Honey how did it feel
Was it good 
Was it good to you 
I want to know 
Was it good to you 
Don't be ashamed to tell me 
Was it good to you 
I won't blame you baby 
If it was good to you 
Was it good to you 
Was it good to you 
Was it good to you 
Was it good to you
