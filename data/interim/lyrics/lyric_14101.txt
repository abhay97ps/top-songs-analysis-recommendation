Err, in the lamp light check the scene
In the day my life is a dream
Do you know who you're talking to
Again I'm so glad baby that I'm not like you
Fire in your head, river in your bed
Two hundred dollar, see his face go red
Lost in a world where nothin' is nothin'
Burnt pretty bad, can't get another hit-ah
Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, this oughta be, burnin' up, breakin' down
Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, ever want to be, burnin' up, breakin' down
In the lamp light, break the seal
Dream of a place, make it rea-eal
Desire can take you anywhere-ere, hah
But it only lets you down, and there ain't nobody there
Fire in your head, river in your bed
Two hundred dollar, see his face go red
Apollo knows what you do today-ay
Fake it if you like, break it if you can't
Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, this oughta be, burnin' up, breakin' down
Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, ever want to be, burnin' up, breakin' down
Na-nah, na-na-nah, na-nah, na-na-nah, yeah
Oh my love, let it take you higher
Everyday meant to take you higher
I only see a memory of what used to be-ee-ee-ee, ooh
Oh-oh, mm-mm-mmm
Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, this oughta be, burnin' up, breakin' down
Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, ever want to be, burnin' up, breakin' down
Ah-ah, oh love, mm-mm, yeah, oh-hoh-hoh-hoh
Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, this oughta be, na-nah, na-na-nah
Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, ever want to be, na-nah, na-na-nah
Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh...
