Play I some music 
Roots, rock, reggae 
Roots, rock, reggae 
Hey Mr Music, you sure sound good to me
I can't refuse it, what do we got to be?
Feel like dancing, dance cause we are free
Feel like dancing, come dance with me

Play I some music 
Play I some music 
Play I on the R&B, want all my people to see
We're bubbling on the top one hundred, just like a mighty dread
