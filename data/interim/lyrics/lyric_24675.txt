I get big high
This a big guy, yeah
Firk, got you
Woo 
We don't ever stop at red lights at night, nigga 
We don't ever stop at red lights at night, nigga 
Two letters, a P and a J, for all my flights, nigga 
Two letters, a P and a J, for all my flights, nigga 
I'm drinking a fifth a day, now I'm rocking my ice, nigga
You see my plain Patek , cost Jerry Rice, nigga 
I spent over eighty K, just last night, nigga 
Death can't get in my way 
Don't believe the hype, nigga 
Made myself impeccable, and I'm so precise, nigga 
It can be in the day time 
Won't stop at the light, nigga 
When I woke up at noon 
I had went past the moon 
Got a seven car garage 
I done ran out of room 
Everything over a quarter 
Audemar on my daughter 
She rocking her third Rollie 
I can't help but spoil her 
I was avoidin' the drug task 
When her mom gave birth 
I used to show up in class 
On Tues' and Thursdays 
Go check my profile, I beat the verdict 
I'ma kick it in overdrive, for Seth Firkins 
My diamonds certified, my trigger workin' 
Got it out the mud, baby, that's why my cups dirty
Yeah, yeah
And everything I do for my gang gang 
Even though I made it on the Forbes, ain't a thing changed 
I got more money than I ever had, I can take some more pain 
You got booked for a controlled substance, I want more drank 
It's like a funeral when they see me, 'cause these hoes faint 
I done got used to dead homies, I stay in the bank 
Ain't got one more tear to shed on me, all my sons straight 
I put Casino in my will, nigga, I'ma die with this cake 
I take the plastic off the seal, a trillion miles away 
I know every nigga with me gon' kill, so I stay out the way 
I ain't gotta walk around with my steel 'cause the streets made me
I still keep a chopper at arm's reach, 'cause I stay faded 
Them Percocets got my homie arm itching, I'ma still take 'em 
I can finesse 'em without pulling out my gun, how he gon' still hate me? 
I'm a nine figure nigga, we ain't never worried about murder cases 
My Slime nigga, buy him a Bugatti on your birthday 
Every time we plead, we plead not guilty in the first place 
I look my demon in the face, I'm booted up the worst way 
She want my semen, so she can run with it and take it to the bank 
I can't grieve, 'cause ain't none of my grandma bills late 
I bought my mom a mansion and it came with a lake 
I'm so real, my day one got every code to my safe 
I told all my ex hoes, "Can't nobody take my place" 
I know I'm a rockstar and that's on everything
And everything I do for my gang gang 
Even though I made it on the Forbes, ain't a thing changed 
I got more money than I ever had, I can take some more pain 
You got booked for a controlled substance, I want more drank 
It's like a funeral when they see me, 'cause these hoes faint 
I done got used to dead homies, I stay in the bank 
Ain't got one more tear to shed on me, all my sons straight 
I put Casino in my will, nigga, I'ma die with this cake
