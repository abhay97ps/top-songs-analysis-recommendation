I'm a honky-tonk man, and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl, to the music of an old jukebox
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone
Callin' hey hey mama, can your daddy come home?
I'm livin' fast and dangerously, but I've got plenty of company
When the moon comes up and the sun goes down
That's when I wanna see the lights of town
'cause I'm a honky-tonk man, and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl, to the music of an old jukebox
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone
Callin' hey hey mama, can your daddy come home?
I'm a honky-tonk man, and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl, to the music of an old jukebox
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone
Callin' hey hey mama, can your daddy come home?
It takes a purty little gal and a jug of wine
That's what it takes to make a honky-tonk mind
With the jukebox a moanin', a honky-tonk sound
That's when I wanna lay my money down
I'm a honky-tonk man, and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl, to the music of an old jukebox
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone
Callin' hey hey mama, can your daddy come home?
