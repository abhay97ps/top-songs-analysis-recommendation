Blueface, baby
Yeah, aight
I'm her daddy, I don't even know her mama
Ooh
She call me daddy, I don't even know her mama 
She gon' do it for some Dolce Gabbana
Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada 
With no strings attached like Balenciaga 
She call me daddy, I don't even know her mama 
She gon' do it for some Dolce Gabbana
Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada 
With no strings attached like Balenciaga 
Ooh, look at all these hoes I'm attractin'
She blew me, so I blew a bag on her fashion
Sexual relations with no strings attached 
I just got her new Fendis, with no strings attached 
Baby gave me mad face without the attitude 
She gon' do it all for Chanel and Jimmy Choo 
I'm the type to spend a bag on a handbag 
Doesn't mean that we involved, she just gotta brag
You can't make me cum, then you can't come back 
I can crack a bitch, and I ain't got no fuckin' crack
I just want some mouth without the conversation 
This ain't no waitin' room, baby, ain't no room for waitin'
I can't even tell the time, this AP decoration
Baby, make it clap like a celebration
She call me daddy, I don't even know her mama 
She gon' do it for some Dolce Gabbana
Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada 
With no strings attached like Balenciaga 
She call me daddy, I don't even know her mama 
She gon' do it for some Dolce Gabbana
Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada 
With no strings attached like Balenciaga 
She call me daddy, I don't even know her mama 
She wanna fuck, but I ain't even got a condom 
Yeah, aight, gimme top 'til the end of night 
You might get Chanel, you gon' be aight
Louis, Fendi , Balenciaga 
If the head trash, I can't give a bitch a dollar
How the fuck she call me daddy? I ain't met her mama 
How the fuck I got the Bentley? I ain't had a Honda 
Bust down for the gang
Eliantte bust down on the chain
For the Dolce Gabbana, she clappin'
The pussy too wet, get a napkin 
She call me daddy, I don't even know her mama 
She gon' do it for some Dolce Gabbana
Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada 
With no strings attached like Balenciaga 
She call me daddy, I don't even know her mama
