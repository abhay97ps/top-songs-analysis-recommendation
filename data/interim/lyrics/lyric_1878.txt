Alone from night to night you'll find me
Thank you
Too weak to break these chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisoner
Don't let me be a prisoner
For one command I stand and wait now, no no no
From one who's master of my fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner
Don't let me be a prisoner
What's the good of my caring
If someone is sharing those arms
But not with me?
Although she has another
And I can't have another for I'm, I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping, no no no
Upon my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life, my life, is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner
Don't let me be a prisoner
You made me a prisoner
You made me love you
Said the night time was the right time
To be with the one you love
You made me a blind man
And I can't see, baby
You said you loved nobody, no no
And that is true to me
But oh no, no
NO
NO
NO
Prisoner of love
My face is wet
So wet with tears
You know I want you
I need you down through the years
My face is wet
So wet, you know
You got to hurt me, kiss me
And never, never never let me go
My face is wet
So wet with sweat
The way I love you
Do you know you never will forget?
My face is wet
My face is wet
My face is wet
My face is wet
Baby
Darling
Baby
NO
No
NO
No
NO
NO, NO, NO
Oh darling
Prisoner of love
Prisoner of love
Prisoner of love
Prisoner of love
Talk to me
Talk to me
Tell me, ooh
You love me so
Talk to me
Baby, can't you see?
Darling, I
Darling, I
Darling, I
Darling, I
Oh, I
Darling, I
Darling, I
I love you so
Let them talk
If they want to
You know that I talk
I know, don't bother me
I know the gossip
Come from the devil's workshop
Do you know what I'm talking about?
Do you know what I'm talking about?
Do you know what I'm talking about?
They call it Stormy Monday
But Tuesday's just as bad
Wednesday's worse
And Thursdays are so sad
I never know
How much I love you
I never know
Just how much I care
When you put your arms around me
When you put your arms around me
When you put your arms around me
OH...NO!
