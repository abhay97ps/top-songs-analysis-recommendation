I was born in a bunk
Mama died and my daddy, my daddy got drunk
He left me here to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road
I was raised in a rusty shack
All I had was a hangin' on my back
Only lord knows how I loathe
This place called Tobacco Road
But it's my home, yes it is people
The only life, the only life I've ever known, yes it is
Only lord knows that I loathe
My, my Tobacco Road
Get that box of dynamite, people, and a big ol' crane
I'm gonna blow it up and start it up all over again
Gonna build myself a town, people, be proud to show
Keep the name Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road
Don't you know, I said I was born there
And then I say I'm gonna die there
Tobacco Road
One more time, Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road...
