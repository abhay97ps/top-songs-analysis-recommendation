This was never the way I planned 
I got so brave, drink in hand 
It's not what 
Just wanna try you on 
Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I kissed a girl just to try it
{I hope my boyfriend don't mind it}
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
No I don't even know your name 
You're my experimental game 
It's not what good girls do 
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I kissed a girl just to try it
{I hope my boyfriend don't mind it}
It felt so wrong; it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl, and I liked it
I liked it
Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal;
It's innocent
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I kissed a girl just to try it
{I hope my boyfriend don't mind it}
It felt so wrong; it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl, and I liked it
I liked it
