It never fails when I'm with you
I just freeze up inside
And you're waiting there with your arms open wide
My bashful feelin' just won't let me hide
You look as if you're surprised at me
I know its not the way it's supposed to be
But didn't you know by now
Girl, I'm just too shy
Did you know by now
Girl, I'm just too shy
I love to hold your hand
Tell you you're mine
But I just can't seem to make that move or to say those words
Somethin' inside me just holds me back
I want to save so much fun with you
I'm lost for words, I just can't begin
Baby, didn't you know it
Girl, I just don't show it
But I'm just too shy
Did you know by now
Girl, I'm just too shy
Maybe time will bring a change in me
Loving is you is not as easy as I thought it would be
Ooh
You look as if you're surprised at me
Didn't you should know by now
Girl, I'm just too shy
But did you know by now
Girl, I'm just too shy
Girl, I want to hug you
Girl, I want to love you
But I'm just too shy
Even wanna kiss you
Tell you I do miss you
But I'm just too shy
Ooh, ooh
Girl, I'm just too shy
But did you know by now
Girl, I'm just too shy
Did you know by now
Girl, I'm just too shy
Did you know by now
Girl, I'm just too shy
