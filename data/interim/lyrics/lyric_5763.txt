Look over yonder
What do you see?
The sun is a-rising
Most definitely
A new day is coming 
People are changing
Ain't it beautiful? 
Crystal Blue Persuasion
Better get ready
Gonna see the light
Love, love is the answer 
And that's alright
So don't you give up now 
So easy to find
Just look to your soul 
And open your mind
Crystal Blue Persuasion, Mm-hmm
It's a new vibration
Crystal Blue Persuasion, Crystal
Blue Persuasion
Maybe tomorrow
When he looks down
In every green field 
And every town
All of his children
In every nation
There'll be, Peace and Good
Brotherhood
Crystal Blue Persuasion, Yeah
Crystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!
Crystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!
Crystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!
Oh!
Crystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!
Crystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!
Crystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!
Crystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!
