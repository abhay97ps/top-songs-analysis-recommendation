There's too much talking
And not enough said
Too many do’s and dont's
Messin' my head
Pretty pretty little girl
You know what I need
(Pretty pretty little girl
You know what I need)
Pretty pretty little girl
I need me some...
Beautiful in my day, yes
Some tenderness in my night
I need me some wonderful in my world, girl
I need me some you in my life
There’s too much motion
And not enough space
People are everywhere
Can't find a place
Pretty pretty little girl
You know what I need
(Pretty pretty little girl
You know what I need)
Pretty pretty little girl
I need me some...
Beautiful in my day, yes
Some tenderness in my night
I need me some wonderful in my world, girl
I need me some you in my life
Well I need... 
I need me some... 
I need me some you, yes I do
Need me some sunshine in my view
Honey, shadows have been my view
I need me some you
I need some
Beautiful in my day, yes
Some tenderness in my night
I need me some wonderful in my world, girl
I need me some you in my life
I need some
Beautiful in my day, yes
Some tenderness in my night
I need me some wonderful in my world, girl
I need me some you in my life
