Ooh yeah
Ask any girl
In this lonely world
Ask any girl
She'll say, 'Make it last forever'
I'm holding out my hand
I finally understand
So turn out the lights, oh yeah
We'll make it last forever
I've been down the streets of desire
Sometimes I was so uninspired
You found what was locked up inside of me
This could be the night
The night to remember
We'll make it last forever
This could be the night, oh, to end all nights
I've always been the one
Lovin' on the run
And that's when you come undone
Why do you wait for me?
Out on the borderline
Between the hurtin' lies
And the true emotions
That makes it last forever
This could be the night
The night to remember
We'll make it last forever
This could be the night, oh, to end all nights
I've been down the streets of desire
Sometimes I was so uninspired
You found what was locked up inside of me
I'm talkin' about love
This could be the night
The night to remember
We'll make it last forever
This could be the night, oh, to end all nights
This could be the night
The night to remember
We'll make it last forever
This could be the night, oh, to end all nights
Oh yeah, yeah
Tonight, to end all nights
