Machines
They're the end to our means
A means of a state of life
But in the end how can we survive
Machines
Hear them rumble and roar
Life was peaceful before
Now we're reproducing more and more
Machines
We're becoming their slaves
Machines
They're going to dig us our graves
Kill yourself to pay the rent
For steel and cement
Of the cages that you're leasing
Machines keep increasing
Machines keep on hauling
We're all becoming
Machines
Parts of bigger machines
Running down to our heart
Finding no 
Machines
Machines
We're becoming their slaves
Machines
They're going to dig us our graves
Kill yourself to pay the rent
For the steel and cement
Of the cages they you're leasing
Machines keep increasing
Machines keep on hauling
We're all becoming
Machines
They're the end to our means
I mean the state of life
In the end how can we survive
Machines
