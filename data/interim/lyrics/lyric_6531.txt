Sick minds, sad sights
Neverending sleepless nights have been accepted as an everyday thing
Wiretapping, kidnapping
I tell you, people, our thoughts and values have got to change
They say love is the strongest force on this earth
Uh, but to me, peace among people surpasses love in worth
People jobs don`t come no bigger than the one we`ve got to do
If we don`t give peace a chance, what do you think is gonna happen to me and you?
That`s why I am reaching out my hand to be your friend
This unrest between races has got to come to an end
Don`t let the color of my skin confuse you
I swear on a stack of Bibles I won`t misuse you
So put your hand in mine
Huh, we're gonna form a human chain, mightier than a hurricane
And walk this land, hand in hand, day and night, black and white
We gotta unite the world
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Come on and sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it
We got to unite the world
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Come on and sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it with me
We got to unite the world
Walk this land, day and night, ahnd in hand, black and white
God almighty, sing it, sing it, sing it
Ah, unite the world
Come on, come on, come on, ah
Oh, ding-dong-ding let the freedom bell ring
The good Lord made you and me, what he wanted us to be
Free all those people you got chained up in your mind
Now there`s truth in what I`m saying
We gotta stop the games we`re playing
Two wrongs ain`t never made a right 
Hung up, tripped out, whatever you may be
Now is the time to set yourself free
Put your hand in mine, huh, come on
Oh, and let`s walk
Oh, we gonna...
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Sing it with me now
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Raise your voices and sing along
Come on, we gonna unite the world
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
We gonna put an end to this insanity
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
We gonna unite the world
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it
Aw, come on, come on, come on, come on
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
