Oh, breakin' up is so very hard to do
If you really love him
And there's nothing I can do
Don't try to spare my feelings
Just tell me that we're through
And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
'Cause breakin' up is so very hard to do
And if the way I hold you
Can't compare to his caress
No words of consolation
Will make me miss you less
My darling, if this is goodbye
I just know I'm gonna cry
So run to him
Before you start cryin' too
And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
'Cause breakin' up is so very hard to do
Oh, baby, it's so hard to do
So make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
'Cause breakin' up is so very hard to do
