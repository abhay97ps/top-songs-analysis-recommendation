Play hide and seek with the Wolves among sheep
Shape shift my face and match their speech
I creep in between like Siamese thieves
Sight the weak
You're blind
I release that trigger
Now the mode of torture is a thousand cuts quicker
Than my dick in butts
Sicker than what's on his tongue
If I own it bet it was stolen and I can't get enough
The fact is that what I get is fish and what you get is snuff
But
You're too pussy to give it back face to face so Face it bruh
Maybe then
You can feel it
Keep it on the up and up
Into your brain before I steal it
Whats Your name?
Nobody hears it
Whos Your crew?
Nobody fears em
Make em move
Into the clearing
My name
Makes em wonder
My child
Kills mother
My birth
By omen
My words
By knowing
Let go
Of going
One rule
Truth only
One noose
Can't hold him
Damn that's cold bitch
All this from the jaw, of god, that does mumble
The last of the devils bible I trust in
Young Knot
Him still runs from nothing
Hes Still the beast
Who does the hunting?x2
Hes got the the teeth that look like glass
He's got the eyes that pour like sand
Treats life like a chore and time like a plan
That can't carry on cus the end's at hand x2
