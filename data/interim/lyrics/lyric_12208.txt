I pushed her tense face away from me
I pushed her tense face away from me
The hard smile, the voice going on
Like a razor blade on glass
All touch but no contact
It hit me like, it hit me like, it hit me like a slap
All, all touch
All touch and all touch and no contact
Challenging eyes above the rim of a cocktail glass
Hoping I'd react
All touch and all touch and no contact
I pushed his hand away from me
I pushed his hand away from me
Splintering fragments of conversation never got down
To cold hard facts
All touch but no contact
It stabbed me like, it stabbed me like a knife in the back
All, all touch
All touch and all touch and no contact
Tense my body for the final attack
All, all touch
All touch and all touch and no contact
I pushed her tense face away from me
I pushed her tense face away from me
The hard smile, the voice going on
Like a razor blade on glass
All touch but no contact
It hit me like, it hit me like, it hit me like a slap
All, all touch
All touch and all touch and no contact
Challenging eyes above the rim of a cocktail glass
Hoping I'd react
All touch and all touch and no contact
Stabbed me like, it stabbed me like a knife in the back
All, all touch
All touch and all touch and no contact
Tense my body for the final attack
All, all touch
All touch and all touch and no contact
