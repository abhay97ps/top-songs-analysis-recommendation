There's an overtone I keep feelin'
When you're near me, that's so appealin'
You're always makin' my imagination
Think about you in fascination
Don't wanna be alone and thinkin' 'bout the two of us
You've got to tell me if this tendency is amorous
Magnetic fields are pullin' me in your direction
And if you take me there, I'll make you no objection
Don't hesitate if you feel it, if you feel it
My love can't wait if you feel it, if you feel it
Just let it be if you feel it, if you feel it
Take all of me if you feel it, if you feel it
When we're together, something radiates
My heart will skip a beat and then accelerate
It must be something to do with fusion
But I'll let you draw your own conclusion
We're wasting time if you insist on being so shy
And you should know by now I only wanna satisfy
I don't know any way for you to miss my meanin'
There ain't no question anymore which way I'm leanin'
Don't hesitate if you feel it, if you feel it
My love can't wait if you feel it, if you feel it
Just let it be if you feel it, if you feel it
Take all of me if you feel it, if you feel it
If you feel it, if you feel it
If you feel it, if you feel it
Love can't wait
Feel it, feel it
Satisfy
We're wasting time if you insist on being so shy
And you should know by now I only wanna satisfy
I don't know any way for you to miss my meanin'
There ain't no question anymore which way I'm leanin'
Don't hesitate if you feel it, if you feel it
My love can't wait if you feel it, if you feel it
If you feel it, if you feel it
If you feel it, if you feel it
Don't hesitate if you feel it, if you feel it
If you feel it, if you feel it
If you feel it, if you feel it
If you feel it
