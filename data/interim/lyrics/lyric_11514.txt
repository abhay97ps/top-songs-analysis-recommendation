I don't have plans and schemes, and I don't have hopes and dreams
I don't have anything since I don't have you
I don't have fond desires; I don't have happy hours
I don't have anything since I don't have you
I don't have happiness, and I guess I never will again
When you walked out on me in came old misery
And he's been here since then
Now I don't have love to share, and I don't have one who cares
I don't have anything since I don't have ...
You, you, you, you, you
