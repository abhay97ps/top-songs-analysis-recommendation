Yeah, feels like I’m losin' myself
Feels like I’m losin' myself
Why am I doomin' myself
Yo, fuck did I do to myself?
Should’ve been true to myself
Dumb to think you woulda helped
Dumb to think you woulda helped
Feels like I’m brewin' in Hell
Feels like I’m brewin' in Hell
Can’t be hard for you to tell
I'm, stuck in a slump and I keep climbin' up
I just turned 25 feels like my time is up
Feels like everyone's sus, and it’s harder to trust
And I can't shake the gut feelin'
Of feelin' like there’s a knife in my gut
And that’s a gut feeling when you know deep down
That the real person you love is doing you left
That’s why I left don’t get upset when you see me
‘Cause I didn’t wanna give you up
And it’s fucked to think for you I wasn’t enough
I just wanted your love but you wanted to suck
Just some nights I wanna go out and get hella drunk
So everything I was feeling could turn into numb
Addicted to you, you're my favourite drug
I buy your lies, you're my favourite plug
Sometimes at night, I would stare up above
And wish under a star that I wasn’t so dumb
Why does it even matter? Shit, I didn’t matter
I built up my hope just for it to get shattered
I’m always alone with the thoughts that I gather
I flip through my thoughts it’s a terrible pattern
As if flippin' through 'em will lead me to answers
I try to move forward but keep going backwards
I hide all my pain behind smiles and laughters
When no one knows that I’m a wild disaster, fuck
Give my all
Oh, I wanna walk away
I'm living like a ghost
That no one ever knows
See me fall
Oh, I knew that I would break
I'm living like a ghost
That no one ever knows
I'm, always alone wishin' someone could see me
I lay in my bed starin' up at the ceilin'
Talkin' to myself until I'm overthinkin'
At home all alone, no one knows that I'm weepin'
I swear my whole life is so fucking deceivin'
And I stand for broke with the cheques I’m receiving
My money can't buy the family I'm needing
My money can't heal the agony I'm feelin'
I need someone to love me, someone to hug me
Someone to be there when my mind gets ugly
I swear they really think my life is stunning
Bro, I come home to absolutely nothing
I’m just a lonely guy loaded with money
Nobody told me my days won't be sunny
I’m bleeding on people who didn’t cut me
So when they leave me, they leave me 'cause they're bloody
I have issues with women, I’m so co-dependent
I can’t love myself so I need her to give it
And that’s always where my self-worth is depicted
And that’s why I date women so narcissistic
My mind is a mess and it’s always conflicted
And lately, it’s been hard to make a decision
And it pains me that I finally admit it
I’ve been suicidal and tryin' not to end it, fuck
Give my all
Oh, I wanna walk away
I'm living like a ghost
That no one ever knows
See me fall
Oh, I knew that I would break
I'm living like a ghost
That no one ever knows
I'm, saddened to think people that think that I’m reaching
And that is the reason I feel what I’m feeling
I may have some fame, but it’s pain that I’m reaping
I been praying to God asking Him for a healing
Man, I need my mom, I need my dad
I need the family we never had
Our family’s broken, I’m feelin' hopeless
Nobody noticed, I’m in a trance
All I have is my daughter, I stare in her eyes
And I break down all I do is provide
How can I give her a family life, when it’s just me and her every night?
Fuck, yo this shit is too much
I’m single-handedly killin' my buzz
I don’t make music ‘cause I’m in a rut
And all of the stress of it is making me numb
Why do I dream of a Grammy and winning when I don’t have family to celebrate with me?
Look, there is no bullshit excuse you could give me
To make me feel like my damn life is worth livin'
I swear loneliness is a cancer within me
I’m searching for friend's ‘cause my family’s missin'
This shit is exhausting, I’m thinking of quittin'
And maybe the end for me's a new beginning, fuck
Give my all
Oh, I wanna walk away
I'm living like a ghost
That no one ever knows
See me fall
Oh, I knew that I would break
I'm living like a ghost
That no one ever knows
