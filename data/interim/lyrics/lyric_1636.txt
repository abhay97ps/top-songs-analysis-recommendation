If you were a rock 'n' roll record
You would be a hit, I know
If you were a rock 'n' roll record
You'd be played on every record show
You'd go round and around and around and around
They'd never let you stop all day
Around and around with the grooviest sound
You would be the one that everybody would play
If you were a musical platter
Soon you would be number one
If I was your phonograph needle
Woo, it would be such fun
We'd go round and around and around and around
And, baby, before we were through
If you were a rock 'n' roll record
I know they'd sell a million of you
You'd go round and around and around and around
They'd never let you stop all day
Around and around with the grooviest sound
You would be the one that everybody would play
If you were a musical platter
Soon you would be number one
If I was your phonograph needle
Woo, it would be such fun
We'd go round and around and around and around
And, baby, before we were through
If you were a rock 'n' roll record
I know they'd sell a million of you
I know they'd sell a million of you
I know they'd sell a million of you
I know they'd sell a million of you
