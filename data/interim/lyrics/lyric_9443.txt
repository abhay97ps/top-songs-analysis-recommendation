You can play the game and you can act out the part
Though you know it wasn't written for you
But tell me, how can you stand there with your broken heart?
Ashamed of playing the fool
One thing can lead to another
It doesn't take any sacrifice
Oh, father and mother, sister and brother
If it feels nice, don't think twice yes
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel
Things are gonna work out fine if you only will
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel
Things are gonna be much better if you only will
You can run but you cannot hide
This is widely known
And what you plan to do with your foolish pride
When you're all by yourself alone
Once you tell somebody the way that you feel
You can feel it beginning to ease
I think it's true what they say about the squeaky wheel
Always getting the grease
Better to shower the people you love with love
Yes and show them the way that you feel
I know things are gonna be just fine if you only will
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel
Things are gonna be much better if you only will
Whoa 
Yeah whoa yeah 
You'll feel better right away 
Don't take much to do 
Sell you pride 
I say 
They say in every life 
They say the rain must fall 
Just like pouring rain 
Make it rain 
Make it rain 
Love, love, love is sunshine oh 
Oh yes 
Make it rain 
Love, love, love is sunshine yeah 
All right 
Everybody, everybody 
Everybody, everybody
