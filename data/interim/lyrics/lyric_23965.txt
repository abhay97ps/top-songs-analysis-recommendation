Danger them is, while some call them "Major Lazer"
Stand up like a solider, baby
Yeah, I know you're built like that
Gun it like a holster, baby

Hoping that the bridge won't cave in
Tonight we let it all go free

Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hot step in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock, rock, rock, rock
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hot step in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me
Light it up!
Light it up!

Show them you're flame to the fire
It's written like your name on a flyer
They wanna tame your desire
But you light it up, now your aims getting higher

But until that day I'mma rise up high
I put my light in the air
I wanna see everywhere

I know say I'm bound to be next like my neighbour, ye
