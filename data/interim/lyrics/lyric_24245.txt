Ooo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo
Ooo, oo, ooo-oo
Ooo, oo, oo, oo, oo
Baby, you were so strong
Ooo, oo, oo, oo, oo
Baby, you were calm, you were so calm, yeah
Ooo, oo, ooo-oo
Tell me where it went wrong
Ooo, oo, oo, oo, oo
Tell me how to love, it's been so long
When a call's not enough, and you just need to touch
Thinking twice I'm the one
But you just need to trust
You're only looking for attention
You only notice it cause I'm never around
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
You're only looking for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
What do you expect now?
Ooo, oo, oo, oo, oo
Only thing left is the sex now
Ooo, oo, ooo-oo
'Cause baby, too vexed now
Ooo, oo, oo, oo, oo
Only see me on the TV or the bed now
When a touch not enough
You were more than a fuck
Thinking twice, I'm the one
But you just need to trust
You're only looking for attention
You only notice it cause I'm never around
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
You're only looking for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh-oh
Ooo, ooo, ooo, attention
Ooo, ooo, ooo, attention
You're only looking for attention
You only notice it cause I'm never around
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
You're only looking for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
