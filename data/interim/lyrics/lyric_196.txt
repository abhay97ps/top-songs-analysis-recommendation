Well, What am I living for, if not for you
What am I living for, if not for you
What am I living for, if not for you
Baby, nobody else, nobody else will do
Well, What am I longing for, each lonely night
To feel your lips close to mine, and hold you tight
Well, you'll be the only love, my whole life through
Baby, nobody else, nobody else will do
Well, I want you close to me, that's all I know
And I want you all the time
Because darling, I love you so
What am I living for, if not for you
What am I living for, if not for you
What am I living for, if not for you
Baby, nobody else, nobody else will do
Well, I want you close to me, that's all I know
And I want you all the time
Because darling, I love you so
Oh, What am I living for, if not for you
What am I living for, if not for you
Yes, What am I living fo,r if not for you
Baby nobody else, nobody else will do
Baby, nobody else, nobody else will do...
