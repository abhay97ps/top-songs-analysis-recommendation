Raise a cup up for all my day ones
Two middle fingers for the haters
Life's only getting greater
Straight up from nothing we go
Higher than the highest skyscraper
No Little League, we major
The proof is in the paper
We put the good in the good in the good life
We put the good in the good in the good life
We put the bad in the past, now we alright
Eazy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Kehlani, I got you
Ayy, yeah
And it's a feelin' that I can't explain
How you make it and your team still stay the same
Stay down from the jump and they never change
Man, this a moment I could never trade, yeah
I told my moms not to stress no more
Go hit the Bentley store and no credit card debts no more 
I bought the crib and it's in escrow now
So you don't ever have to worry about how you gon' pay rent no more
I put my team in position, now they makin' a killin'
Stackin' blue faces straight to the ceilin'
Out in Vegas I'm with 'em
Orderin' bottles of that Ace when they sit 'em
'Til there ain't enough space up on the table to fit 'em
Go ahead and
Raise a cup up for all my day ones
Two middle fingers for the haters
Life's only getting greater
Straight up from nothing we go
Higher than the highest skyscraper
No Little League, we major
The proof is in the paper
We put the good in the good in the good life
The good life
We put the good in the good in the good life
I said the good life
We put the bad in the past, now we alright
We alright
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah, yeah
Ayy, yeah
Pour some Clicquot in the glass, have a toast to success
No lookin' back from here, no more bein' broke and distressed
I put my heart into this game like I opened my chest
We only pray for more M's while you hope for the best
We make these plays, man I'm finessin' these checks
Time's up for everybody, I'm collectin' on debts
And I swear this champagne just tastes better on jets
I'm just out here bein' great, man, this as real as it gets
I put my team in position, now they makin' a killin'
Stackin' blue faces straight to the ceilin'
Out in Vegas I'm with 'em
Orderin' bottles of that Ace when they sit 'em
'Til there ain't enough space up on the table to fit 'em
Go ahead and
Raise a cup up for all my day ones
Two middle fingers for the haters
Life's only getting greater
Straight up from nothing we go
Yeah, go up
Higher than the highest skyscraper
No Little League, we major
Yeah
The proof is in the paper
You know
We put the good in the good in the good life

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah, yeah

Damn right, from the bottom we rise
So high, now we cover sky lights
We're building an empire
We owe it all to each other
Just look at us right now, destined
We're so good right now, legend
Here's to you and I
Raise 'em to the sky
We put the good in the good in the good life
Yeah
