Don't  stop !
Don't  stop !
If you wake up and don't want to smile
Open your eyes, and look at the day
Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop
It'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone
Don't  stop !
Don't  stop !
Why not think about times to come
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do
Don't  stop , thinking about tomorrow
Don't  stop ; it'll soon be here 
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone
Ooooh!
Oooh
Don't stop no!
Don't  stop !
Thinking about tomorrow
Don't  stop !
Oh
No, no, no
Ooohh! 
All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you
Ooooohhhh
Don't  stop , thinking about tomorrow
Don't  stop 
It'll soon be here
It'll be, better than before
Yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone
Don't  stop  thinking about tomorrow
Don't  stop ;
It'll soon be here
It'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone
