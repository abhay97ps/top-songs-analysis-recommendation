Baby baby, sweet baby
There's something that I just got to say
Baby baby, sweet baby
You left me hurting in a real cold way
Speak your name
And I'll feel a thrill
You said I do
And I said I will
I tell you that I'll stay true
And give you just a little time
Wait on me baby
I want you to be all mine
I just get so blue
Since you've been gone, baby
Since you've been gone
Baby baby, sweet baby
I didn't mean to run you away
It was pride on my lips
But not in my heart
To say the things that made you stray
But ah, babe
Hear me now
I don't know what I'm going to do
Got to get you back somehow
I'm trying
Take me back
Consider me please
If you walk in that door
I can get up off my knees
I just been so blue
Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
Well I've been so lonely
Baby, since you've been gone
I've been so lonely
Since you've been gone
Baby baby baby been so lonely
