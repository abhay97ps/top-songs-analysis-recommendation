I hear the tickin' on the clock
Countin' every day I've been alone
How long before you're coming back?
If I don't see your face, I'll turn to stone
Can't keep holdin' on this way
Can't go on another day
Can't you hear me when I say
Girl, I'm hungry for your love
Girl, I'm hungry
Baby, let me in
Hungry for your love
Hungry, I can't get enough
Your love's the color of my heart
When I look in you eyes, everything's so clear
So still together when we're apart
I begin to die unless you're here
I can't keep holdin' on this way
Can't go on another day
Can't you hear me when I say
Girl, I'm hungry for your love
Girl, I'm hungry
Baby, let me in
Hungry for your love
Hungry, I can't get enough
I lie awake all night
I can't stop remembering
You've got to make it right
I can't hold it in
Hungry
I hear the tickin' on the clock
Countin' every day I've been alone
Hungry
I'm hungry for your love
Girl, I'm hungry, I can't get enough
Hungry for your skin
Hungry
Baby, let me in
Hungry for your love
Hungry
I'm hungry for your love
Hungry, oh
Hungry
