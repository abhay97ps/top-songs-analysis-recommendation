Party people, rockin' in the house
Get up, let's all get live
Put your foot on the rug and clap your hands, baby mama
Cause you know that it's party time
Now I'm the zodiac man, I'm the prince of rhymes
Rappin' all about your zodiac signs
So if you came out here to party, let's start the show
Party people, just let me know
Go head, go head, go head, go head
Well like this y'all, like that
So what's the funkiest sign in the zodiac
Is it the lion or the scale or the scorpion
The ram or the bull or the Gemini twins
Now if you've never thought about it then we're gonna find out
Which party signs really rock the house
See, I searched around the world, went from town to town
To find all the funky signs that like to throw down
So all the men and the women and the girls and boys
If you ready to party, then make some noise
You don't ever have to worry cause you're never alone
You got Disco Daddy on the microphone
We're gonna start it all off with the sign of the ram
Cause that's the very first sign of my zodiac jam
To the left, to the right
From the front and to the rear
All the Aries in the house, if you're ready to rock
Let me hear you say oh yeah, oh yeah
Now when you talk about courage and confidence
Don't you know that this is the sign
And if you check out the one who's top of the class
It's an Aries every time
And if you ever take them out, you'll be surprised
By their boldness, initiative, and enterprise
Got mucho class and a lot of soul
And really good loving for your heart to hold
Now they like everybody but get along best
With Leo and Sagittarius
To all the Aries in the house, if you're getting on down
Just rock it to the beat with your big, bad song
Good boogie, Good boogie
Good boogie, Good boogie
Number two, in my zodiac rhyme
Hey Taurus the bull, that's you
Now you're a funky Earth sign and you got your own mind
And you do what you want to do
But one thing about Taurus, they're down to Earth
They always put the people that they love first
And you can bet your bottom dollar
If you ever meet a bull
Nine times out of ten, they're musical
Now your favorite signs, if you don't know
Are Capricorn, Cancer, or Virgo
So all the Taurus in the house
Let me hear you shout
I know you want to turn it out
To the windows, to the walls
'Til the sweat roll down your drawers
To the windows, to the walls
'Til the sweat roll down your drawers
Now tell me what's the sign with the natural high
Funky, funky, Gemini
So tell me what's the sign with the natural high
Funky, funky, Gemini
I said, now you see them and now you don't
You might think that you know them, but you really won't
You know they do it one way, then they change the style
Cause the sign of the Twins is all versatile
Now all your funky stars say you like to get it on
With Taurus the bull and Capricorn
So when you put it all together, then you can bet
That a Gemini is what you get
And if you think you can handle it and you want more
Better never let them get you on the funky dance floor
So all the Gemini, let's get wild and loose
And shake it to the rhythm like a long neck goose
I said oh! Ah! I said oh! Ah!
I said oh! Ah! I said oh! Ah!
I said oh! Ah! I said oh! Ah!
I said oh! Ah! I said oh! Ah!
Cancer, a romancer
You're such a fancy dancer
And now I know you feel the rhythm down to your toes
For the sign of the crab, that's how it goes
They know how to love, they know how to live
They're patient, warm, and sensitive
They don't talk too much, cause they're kind of shy
But they sure know how to rock when it's party time
Now all your funky stars say you're happiest
When you're rocking with a Libra and Aquarius
To all the Cancers in the house, if you ain't laid back
Let's warm it up a bit with a little soul clap
Don't watch the clock, don't watch the clock
I said, get on down, cause it's time to rock
Don't watch the clock, don't watch the clock
I said, come on everybody, let's take it to the top
I'm gonna rock you right down to your knees
Cause I'm Disco Daddy and I aim to please
Like this y'all, like that
What's the funkiest sign in the Zodiac
Hey Leo, get up out your seat
Are you ready to rock to the big and bad beat
Now this is the sign that likes to have big fun
They can't be number 2, they got to be number 1
They've got great big hearts and a lot of pride
And you'll always see a twinkle in their eyes
Now they might seem hard at first contact
But underneath it all, it's a pussycat
With a life of love and a love of life
They could make a good husband or an even better wife
But the only signs that you should trust
Are Aries and Sagittarius
They're always in front, but they're never behind
What else can we say about Leo the Lion
To all the Leos in the house, get off your butts
And shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it up
I said hey, hey
Party people get live, say what
I said hey, hey
Party people get live, say what, say what
Now it's on, and on, and on with the show
Hey Virgo, are you ready to go
Methodical industrious intelligent and chaste
The motto of the Virgo is haste makes waste
Now Virgos, they are the gentle folks
They like to laugh, they like to joke
They're bright and they're funny with the clever wit
And they got the kind of charms you just can't resist
They can start out with a little but they'll end up with a lot
And once they get to rockin' they don't ever want to stop
They love romance and you better believe
That Virgo love is like sweet ice cream
Now all your funky stars say you like to get it on
With the Taurus the bull and Capricorn
To all the Virgos in the house, if you're getting on down
Just rock it to the beat with your big and bad sound
We got the beat, let's move
We got the beat, let's groove
We got the beat, let's move
We got the beat, let's groove
Now it's time to rock with the seventh sign
Hey Libra, it's party time
Now the sign of the scales is all about love
That's always what they're thinking of
They even look like love, but you'd better watch out
Cause if you get to much, you might get strung out
Now I met a Libra lady and I took a chance
I got her on the floor, it was love at first dance
She moved so smooth, she moved so nice
I just had to get some of the sugar and spice
Now Libra gets along with every sign
But they really rock nice with Geminis
To all the Libras in the house, take my advice
Let's party on up, let's all get nice
Let's shake it up, let's shake it up
Let's break, break, break, break, break it up
Let's shake it up, let's shake it up
Let's break, break, break, break, break it up
It's Disco Daddy and I'm right on time
And with a freaky rhyme for a freaky sign
Freaky from their head down to their toes
You know I'm talkin' 'bout those Scorpios
Now with a Scorpio lover, you can never be bored
They say, you do mine, and I'll do yours
They like for you to get it 'til it hits the spot
And they never want to quit it cause it's always hot
Now if you don't believe what I'm talkin' 'bout
Don't take my word, just check it out
Now Scorpios can be hard to please
But they get along with Cancer and the double Pisces
Now lovers may come and they may go
Party people, there's one thing I know
If you ever get your hands on a Scorpio
Just hold on tight and don't let go
To all the Scorpios, let's get out your seat
And rock it to the rhythm of the big and bad beat
Now ain't no time out and ain't no rest
Rockin' out y'all, cause you're rockin' with the best
I'm gonna run it all down 'til you run out of breath
Cause I'm the king of the rap and I'm doing it to death
Like this y'all, like that
I said, what's the funkiest sign in the Zodiac
Let's take it to the stage, let's take it to the top
Sagittarius, are you ready to rock
Restless, curious, honest, and kind
Are the attributes of this fire sign
You know they really love speed, fast cars, and planes
And they spend their whole life living in the fast lane
And one thing about Sags, they like that cash
They're always making money, but they spend it so fast
Fascinating, stimulating, one of a kind and
If you let them get close, they'll blow your mind
They know how to get just what they need
And they like to rock with Leos and the funky Aries
So come on Sagittarius
It's time for you to show your stuff
Let's hit it, don't quit it
Put your boogie back down, everybody rock with it
Let's hit it, don't quit it
Put your boogie back down, everybody rock with it
Capricorn get it on
Just rock it to the beat
Until the break of dawn
They can do it by the book or
They can break the rules
But the Capricorns are always cool
They scheme and get just what they want
They can play cat and mouse and
They'll never get caught
So people let me tell you right from the start
Don't let that Capricorn break your heart
Now of all the funky signs in the zo-di-oh
They do best with Taurus and funky Virgo
Don't stop y'all, just keep on
Let's hear it from all you Capricorns
Go stick it in your ear
Go stick it in your ear
Go stick it in your ear
Go stick it in your ear
Put your foot on the rug don't call it quits
Check out the next sign that's on my list
You know they got it like that and they got it like this
Let me hear it from all the Aquarians
Now I don't know just what it is but
Everybody likes those Aquarians because
They're very friendly people with open minds
Without prejudice of any kind
The way they rock and the way they roll
Sometimes I think they've got too much soul
Now all your funky stars say you'll do just fine
When you rock with a Libra and a Gemini
So when everybody else starts calling it quits
The party is just getting started for Aquarius
So Aquarians if you're getting on down
Let me hear your funky sound
Let's party up, let's party up
Everybody to the beat
Everybody get up
Let's party up, let's party up
Everybody to the beat
Everybody get up
Hey, hey, Pisces get up on your feet
Are you ready to rock to the big and bad beat
Now the symbol for Pisces is two fish
One going like that and one going like this
Outside they might look sweet and kind but
You never will know what's on their mind
But if you take them out one thing you'll find
They let it all out when it's party time
They get along best now don't you know
With Cancer and Scorpio
So all the Pisces in the house get up off your butts
And shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it up
Let's rock the house, let's rock the house
Let's shock, shock, shock, shock, shock the house
Let's rock the house, let's rock the house
Let's shock, shock, shock, shock, shock the house
Now look at all the funky people
Rockin' in the house
I said one thing is clear there is no doubt
Like a hot dog needs that sauerkraut
I'm the funky emcee that turns the parties out
Because I got the gift and I got the knack
You know I'm giving it up and I'm gonna get it all back
I don't smoke no Sherm, I don't smoke no Whack
I'm just a hell of a man with a hell of a rap
On your feet, y'all
Out your seat, y'all
Let's rock it to the beat, y'all
Just scream and shout and have a great big ball
With the zodiac man cause I know all the little
Funky things about your signs
To make you rock it on your feet to the beat one time
Like this y'all, like that
What's the funkiest sign in the zodiac
To the beat, to the beat
To the big bad funky beat
