Just yesterday
I cast my eyes upon your lovely face, but that was yesterday
Now just a dream, a dream that lives inside my memory
Wish it could be reality
Shine on yesterday, carry me away and let me be back
In your arms holding you again
Shine on yesterday, carry me away to be with you
Somehow let my dream come true
You know sometimes
I stop and stare no matter where I am, thinking of you again
Once in a while I call your name out loud hoping you'll hear
Hoping my prayer will bring you here
Shine on yesterday, carry me away and let me be back
In your arms holding you again
Shine on yesterday, carry me away to be with you
Somehow let my dream come true
Shine on yesterday, carry me away and let me be back
In your arms holding you again
Shine on yesterday, carry me away and let me be back
In your arms holding you again
Shine on yesterday, carry me away and let me be back
In your arms holding you again
Shine on yesterday, carry me away to be with you
Because this is for me, my one and only dream
I ever wanted to come true
