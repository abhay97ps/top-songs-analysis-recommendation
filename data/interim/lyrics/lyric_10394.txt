Life can be too much, you see
We all need insanity
You're off the hook when you're off the wall
You got to say, "the hell with them all"
Come on, let's get crazy tonight 
No time to worry if we're wrong or we're right 
Caught up with people we've never met 
Ooh, Sunday morning, we'll forgive and forget
Before the dawn begins to shine its hazy blue light
Let's get crazy tonight 
Let's get crazy tonight 
There's a part of town you've missed
Where the rules just don't exist
Give no mind and give no name
No one knows who's taking the blame
Come on, let's get crazy tonight 
No time to worry if we're wrong or we're right 
Caught up with people we've never met 
Ooh, Sunday morning, we'll forgive and forget
Before the dawn begins to shine its hazy blue light
Let's get crazy tonight 
Let's get crazy tonight 
Let's get crazy tonight 
No time to worry if we're wrong or we're right 
Caught up with people we've never met 
Ooh, Sunday morning, we'll forgive and forget
Before the dawn begins to shine its hazy blue light
Let's get crazy tonight 
No time to worry if we're wrong or we're right 
Let's get crazy tonight 
No time to worry if we're wrong or we're right 
Let's get crazy tonight 
No time to worry if we're wrong or we're right 
Let's get crazy tonight 
No time to worry if we're wrong or we're right
