Ooh huh, hoo..ooh
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right...
As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street
Who am I, to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disre
A broken bottle 
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
That's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make that change
Nanana nanana nananana
Oh oh...
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be, really me
A willow deeply 
Somebody's broken 
And a washed out dream
Washed out dream...
They follow the pattern of the wind you see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
I'm starting with the man in the mirror 
I'm asking him to change his ways 
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make that change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror 
I'm asking him to change his ways 
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make that
Change!
