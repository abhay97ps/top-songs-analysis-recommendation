I've been a rolling stone all my life
Flying all alone, flying blind
I've seen it all, I've been around
I've been lost and I've been found
But who I am with you
Is who I really wanna be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you
It feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you
I've got a ways to go on this ride
But I got a hand to hold that fits just right
You make me laugh, you make me high
You make me want to hold on tight
'Cause who I am with you
Is who I really wanna be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you
It feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you
Who I am with you
Because of you,  I'm a lucky man
And you're the best part of who I am
Who I am with you
Is who I really want to be
You're so good
You're so good for me, baby
And when I'm holdin' you
It feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you
Yes, who I am with you
