Whoo!
Let you take me out
I know what you are all about
But when I did
I wasn't trying to lead you on
Now you bring me home and tell me
Good night's not enough for you
I'm sorry, baby
I didn't mean to turn you on
You read me wrong
I wasn't trying to lead you on
Not like you did
I didn't mean to turn you on
You read me wrong 
I wasn't trying to lead you on
I want a friend
I didn't mean to turn you on
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on
I know you
Expecting a one-night stand
When I refused
I knew you wouldn't understand
I told you twice
I was only trying to be nice
Only trying to be nice
Oh
I didn't mean to turn you on
You read me wrong
I wasn't trying to lead you on
Not like you did
I didn't mean to turn you on
You read  me wrong
I wasn't trying to lead you on
I want a friend 
I didn't mean to turn you on 
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on
Oh
Why should I
Feel guilty cause I won't give
Feel guilty cause I won't give in
I didn't mean to turn you on
I did, did, did, did, did, did, baby
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't, didn't
I didn't, didn't
I didn't, didn't
I did, did, did, did, did, did, baby
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
You think that I'm a fool
Cause I wouldn't play
By your rules
You don't stand a chance
All I want to do is dance with you
I told you twice
I was only trying to be nice
I loved you for a friend
But I guess this is
The end of our relationship
Cause I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I-I-I didn't mean to turn you on
I-I-I didn't mean to turn you on
I-I-I didn't mean to turn you on
I-I-I didn't mean to turn you on
