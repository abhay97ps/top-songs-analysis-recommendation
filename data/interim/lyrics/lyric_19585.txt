Now the time has come , the music between us
Though the night seems young  - is at an end
Only change will bring  you out of the darkness
In this moment everything  is born again
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Now the fireball burns , we go round together
As the planet turns  into the light
Something more than dreams to 
Watch out for each other?
Because we know what it means  to be alive
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life 
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Feel the new day enter your life
Feel the new day
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day  enter your life
Reach up...
Reach up for the sunrise 
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life 
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
