I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lyin' here, the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh, I hope that it won't end though...
Alone
'Til now, I always got by on my own
April & Will: I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight, yeah
Yeah, you don't know how long I have waited
And I was gonna tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
Ohhh, and my love for you is still unknown...
Alone
Ohhh...
Ohhh...
'Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
Oh, how do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
Alone
Alone...
Alone...
