Never, never, never find
Never find another
Never find another
I see it in your eyes
Don't play me for a fool
You know that I could always read between the lines
You seem to think
You want to find somebody new
Maybe we should take some time to be apart
Not gonna cry
I won't ask you why
If you're gonna go
Do what you got to do
I hope you know what you're leaving behind
Because I know that I'm a special kind
A love this good
You'll never find
I bet you'll never find another love like mine
I bet you'll never find another
I bet you'll never find another love like mine
I bet you'll never find another
So now you think that
I should get out on my own
That I should give somebody else a try
Don't make suggestions
Just leave well enough alone
If you're gonna go, why don't you say goodbye
No, you'll, you'll never find another
No, you'll, you'll never find another
You can search the whole world over
I'm that special kind
I'm not gonna cry 'cause I know that
A love this good you'll never find
No, you'll, you'll never find another
No, you'll, you'll never find another
No, you'll
No, you'll
No, you'll
No, you'll
No, you'll
No, you'll
