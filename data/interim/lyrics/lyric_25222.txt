Woke up this morning, can't remember nothing
Two bitches just flew in from London 
Last thing I remember they callin' me daddy
The mattress was covered in money 
Went to sleep with my jewelry and chains on
Had to wake up and recount the money 
I got a bitch, she gon' kill for real, talk about Clyde and Bonnie 
Coupe with the kit, cop it 
Pull up with a stick, stop it 
Rich nigga shit, solid 
Old hunnids, pockets rotted 
I go to space with the stars 
Might smoke a blunt with my pilot 
Saturn, Moon, Earth, and Mars 
NASA takeoff with the rocket 
Half a million on a necklace 
Young rich niggas we successful 
Said she wanna feel special 
That coco make her feel special 
I count a hunnid or better 
Back end two hunnid or better 
I might go put all my chains on 
I just might change up the weather 
She pop a perc, her pussy wetter 
I met the bitch at Coachella 
If she knew, tell her she'd probably do better
But can I get a E for effort? 
I prayed to God to wash my sins 
Nothing formed against me, not a weapon 
Ask Him where do I begin 
Devil tryna take my blessings 
They don't know the meaning of the white 
You don't really live this life 
Niggas in the hood shootin' twice 
See my niggas in the hood shoot precise 
Real wise, we ain't taking no advice 
I realize that these hoes ain't right 
Don't even ask, 'cause they know what's the price 
Ain't gotta snow, they already know it's white 
I talk to God cause I been baptized 
I got mob ties to the nawf side 
Pull up with the sticks on the niggas, straight slime 
They gon' make the nawf side high crime 
Better not hit a lick with these niggas droppin' ten 
Hit a lick with these niggas droppin' dimes
Fuckin' on her friend I'ma break her back in 
Lookin' at the watch I can't waste time 
Woke up this morning, can't remember nothing
Two bitches just flew in from London 
Last thing I remember they callin' me daddy
The mattress was covered in money 
Went to sleep with my jewelry and chains on
Had to wake up and recount the money
