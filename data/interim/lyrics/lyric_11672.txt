The sun just went behind a cloud again
Down crowded streets he walks alone
He's a stranger out of place
A number not a face
And all day long, all day long
He's feelin' like an alien
Feelin' like he don't belong
Have mercy, cried the alien
Help him find his way back home
The feelin' that he feels he can't explain
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, they're all the same
He's lost and all alone
A heart without a home
Standin' like a statue in the rain
He's feelin' like an alien
Feelin' like he don't belong
Have mercy, cried the alien
Help him find his way back home
Now, now and then we all are aliens
Feelin' like we don't belong
Have mercy, cried the alien
Help him find his way back home
Feelin' like an alien
He's feelin' like he don't belong
Have mercy, cried the alien
Help him find his way
Help him find his way
