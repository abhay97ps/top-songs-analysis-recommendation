Whispering while you cuddle near me
Whispering so no one can hear me
Each little whisper seems to cheer me
Oh I know it's true, there's no one, dear, but you
Whispering why you'll never leave me
Whispering why you'll never grieve me
Whisper and say that you believe me
Whispering that I love you
Whispering while you cuddle near me 
Whispering so no one can hear me 
Each little whisper seems to cheer me 
I know it's true, there's no one, dear, but you 
Whispering why you'll never leave me 
Whispering why you'll never grieve me
Whisper and say that you believe me
Whispering that I love you
Whispering that I love you
