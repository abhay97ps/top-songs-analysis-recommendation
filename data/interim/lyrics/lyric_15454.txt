I said it's sad to say, but Pete don't gotta years left to enjoy
So he's going to list his accomplishments, a bunch of other irrelevant nose
But I ain't gonna just fuckin' stand here and watch Kobe get his 70 points
Feel like I'm shuttin' down traffic work in the Vatican church
I came to separate the men from the boys
He's gonna say I pull bitches, that I drink a lot
You a Disney ass bitch you might as well sing your part
You rap for motherfuckers that don't like to think a lot
Meanwhile I've been a white boy slangin' keys  like it's Kingdom Hearts
I said that ain't no way that you servin' me
I heard someone say that you'd 30 me now I gotta make it a murder scene
So when I send somethin' airborne you either take the shot fake an emergency
How you don't say I don't struggle dawg? I'm literally standing in the face of adversity
What the fuck kind of face is that?!
It's time you face the facts
It's like you made a mask of fuckin' bacon fat
Looks like you survived some kind of face hugger Alien attack
It look like you went to ate some pussy and pussy ate him back
I said Pete's complexion...yeast infection
Whole skin routine look like a scene from Se7en
So it's clearly a bed of nails if he's sleepin' on me
He uses an aftershave called Deeply Lonely
He's got cheeks made of cheap bologna
Skinny Pete out here lookin' like one of Jesse Pinkman's homies
This is God's purpose
Go ahead and make some more tweets to prove that you're not worthless
But I will give you this though Pete
Congratulations on that car purpose
Your next whip should be a Rover since your face looks like Mars surface
I mean, you ought to take some steps bitch, I bet i could take it farther
Let me guess Pete you got some armor plated armor?
I guess it's a safe bet to say he's not the greatest father
But he's a pro poker player but he won't call or raise his daughter
I said I give this kid the business, that's moms and pops
I'll rearrange his grill, that's body shop
The chopper yops, turn his car inside out like Autobots
I said hold up, all by bars cold like Otter Pops
Now your kid gotta grow up without a pops
I said this shit a body, neck get severed, you gettin' carried
Get left in a cemetery somewhere next to the seminary
Decapitated, closed casket you dead and buried
The pole take his daughter head off, bitch it's Hereditary
I said, so y'all don't gotta keep comin' to this event and act like he matters
I'll turn Pete into my disciple like a Bible chapter
I don't ever wanna fuckin' hear again that this fuckin' guy's a factor
When they only put you on the card just to hype disaster  like a crisis actor
That's one
That was a pretty weak verse from me
He said he's standing in the face of adversity
But you know what else rhymes with "emergency", Caustic?
"Knee surgery"
I'm glad we're gettin' this out the way
I can't continue livin' with stress
He's seen a LOT of my worst moments at a million different events
And it's gonna cause some real life problems
Cause even if a chick is my ex
They're all gonna find out that I cheated now thanks to the Wicked Snitch of the West
Finally!
Battle rap is back in Oakland!
Action mode, cameras rollin', steal on him; Danny Ocean
Release the hounds; Ramsey Bolton
Crack his dome in, you can bank on that like Saks and Goldman
Make you vanish, I don't need Illmac's opponent for a Magic moment
I am the GOAT, a category I stand alone in
You ain't never had the throne, I've worn the crown and had it stolen
So don't pay no attention to the bitch fit Danny's throwin'
Caustic's just actin' like a kid again cause daddy's home to chaperone him
Career's longer than this guy's whole rap sheet
And ain't been dumb enough to let the 5-0 catch me
But don't act like that wide nose can't be lined up for the rhinoplasty you've been tryin' to buy so badly
I got the hand speed to shatter your skull
But I've seen it first hand, Caustic wouldn't put his hands on a Sole
Just don't let him catch me chattin' up hoes
Another wop snitchin' on the man in control like Sammy The Bull
He's mad cause he knows that's some shit that I can't beat with
Homie you about to fuckin' catch these Pete fists
Sorry, I forgot the line but that's thee remix
Meanwhile, he gets on cam' and can't keep secrets on some VladTV shit
Jesus, I gave you the whole blueprint
You're one of my old students, now I'm right back where it all started to home school him
Cult movement, Oakland to Vegas like Coach Gruden
I just put a whole clip in this hoe to put a hole through him
Now before I call my time Oakland
Just remember, any lines from him that are mind blowin'
I wrote them
I bet if I give you this work you won't do shit about it like it's a slow day
I can tell you ain't from 'round here you got that 'Old Town Road' slang
But you really not from the O mayne
So why the fuck is John Stockton actin' like this shit a home game
I said hold up, you from Monterey
Y'all know where that is?
Not the Bay
I said, y'all wanna know what else rhymes wit' "Monterey"?
"Fuckin' far away"
He just ain't been the same man since he lost the ole ball and chain
Now he tryin' to climb back into our good graces like Shabba Ranks
This a Drake apology, I'm out here catchin' cases like Charlemagne
So don't make this white boy get outta pocket like a wallet chain
I said it's sick, we at home, this is Oakland, California
If Pete played hoop, he'd be on the Social Justice Warriors
You bein' an SJW bruh, that shit is random as hell
I mean, you a battle rapper, might as well go dig up some tweets from 2012 and cancel yourself
Your face looks like the fuckin' backside of a animal pelt
I'm glad we did this in the pit so the fans can actually tell how fuckin' bad that you smell
You're a poker player, right? Well you should handle this well
When these two leave him face down, it's just the hands you were dealt
I said, everyday, you can see Pete on his grind
You know, changin' the world, one tweet at a time
But lately, even the Twitter feed's been gettin' a little uninspired
I mean, how many fuckin' times can we call Tomi Lahren a "fuckin' dumpster fire"
I mean, I guess you gotta crack a few eggs to make an omelette bitch
Let's start with the Twitter profile that you be arguin' with
Off line you be awkward as shit, but online you be talkin' that shit
Bet you wouldn't even talk to a bitch if you didn't have battle rap in your back pocket as a bargaining chip
Oh which reminds me, whatever happened to your ahh, little girlfriend?
You don't remember that?
Like the girl you tweet everyday and if you didn't then your world end
Everyday it's "I love you baby" like they're racin' to see who say it quicker
It's not like we're the only ones that were amazed you was even in a relationship with her
I don't give a fuck what that bitch made you for dinner
If you get up in my face, I'ma make you a quitter
See while you was up north gettin' your dick wet with some Canadian filler
I was back in Oakland High like Damian Lillard
I said, so what's up?
Let's treat it like it's only us in the room
Keep it real bro, who broke up with who?
She broke up with you?
I'm just sayin' if you keep gettin' us invested in these relationships we gonna need some fuckin' closure too
I said, this is not a subject you can dance around Pete
I just got one last question for you bro
Keep it real, on God
Did she ask about me?
No?
Nothing?
Fine if that's the case I can go back to sayin' that you been trash for days
You need to get off the fuckin' internet and act your age
Cause you're clearly going through a tragic phase
Like Dizaster's braids
Aye turn your haircut down I can't hear myself!
Alright, so what do you call Pete without a girlfriend?
Focused
Now, now what do you call Caustic without a girlfriend?
Homeless
Hold up! It's time for me to murder you now
This would be the part where I have an amazing rebuttal but I was too busy tweeting during your round
Ain't gon' be nothin' of Caustic left
For the autopsy to give the cause of death
{Chokes and starts freestyling}
Fuck it, we're just going to go through the motions, cause of death
Oh my God, let me stop a sec'
Why did I go for extra flips
It's all part of it. Don't fall for this shit. Swear to God. He got you the first time. Don't be stupid
You're welcome. I gotchu
I appreciate you bro. Go off the head. You just daringly escaped
...Cause of death
He'll talk about my delivery but the box he gets won't show up at the wrong address
I've never met a student who I took a loss against
So I guess it's only right for Daniel San to meet Miyagi yet
Wild card Caustic
The mini me I fathered best
Designed his blueprint, Dr. Frankenstein, God Complex
It's in my DNA, there's No Doubt if Stefani test
I've got son  down to a science like Johnny Quest
He's never seen your shots connect
You don't gotta go out on a limb to see that every punch you've got is stretched
That's the Dhalsim flex
But if battle rap was Street Fighter you'd relate to Blanka best
The answer why, it's common sense, you rely so much on shock effect
This shit is easy money, Price is on his head, deposit sent
Talkin' doe at any point, one finger got him pressed like Pop in Fresh
Jihadist rep
No I'm not a comic but I'll bomb your set, boxin' vet
Hit hard as Tyson after D'Amato's death
It's ironic that you paint this picture like you are a threat
Cause you look like every college campus rapist composite sketch
Speakin' of which, I'ma draw on him next
Only two options left
Get outlined by all I said or outlined by chalk instead
Walking Dead
Daniel Stefani, rap battle Tekashi
He'll snitch on a room full of his homies if the fans will applaud me
He'll fuckin' hold a black light up to a bag of your laundry
Fuckin' Daniel Stefani, you wouldn't cap a Dasani
He probably thinks this fight's an easy win for him
What type of dream you livin' in
You've had two knee surgeries in the last year
I will literally beat you limb from limb
Each of your ligaments are weak as a senior citizens
I just need to figure which knee to kick him in
To make the lights go dim and the screen say "Finish Him"
He choked
He choked and still did a 100 rhymes that rhyme with Das EFX
Saying he's my fuckin 'dad but I'm not impressed
Cause I used you to get to the next level, you're a step father at best
Aye fuck it, he's talkin' about some Mortal Kombat shit, right?
That's how I know he can't fuck wit' me
Cause if I push this square's button I bet he freezes up in front me of
You said I was homeless without a bitch, right?
Aye, aye that's crazy, right?
Let me explain to you fuckin' idiots why it ain't that tight
I can tell the difference between us, thank God the Bay raised me right
I swear, on everything, having good dick and game saved my life
He said I'm known for the shot like I'm Michael Duncan
Til he gets stretched from the line Michael dunkin'
Rifle's dumpin', you can lose seven pounds without the liposuction
Knife'll gut him
Remove his insides just like a pumpkin
But his heart's still beatin' in his lap, it's just out here tryin' to function
You had a lotta fun tonight Pete?
Yeah man. It's been great
But now we gotta handle matters
You are solely responsible for the fucking worse generation of battle rappers
Y'all should honestly thank me
For taking all those motherfuckers and turnin' 'em into antimatter
You outlived all your kids Pete, you're an anti vaxxer
I said, so this had to happen
Dawg I have to embarrass you
Motherfuckin' you- you start actin' tough and you can get slapped right back into character
Ten years ago he was the world's first multisyllabic competitor
Then that shit got old fast like Captain America
He like to rap like he be spendin' nights in the trap
But him lettin' all the white people in the game is basically a knife in the back
That's why it's so hard for us not to roll our eyes when you rap
Cause a thousand white people saw you and thought, "Hey, I can do that."
This is your fault
Now he can barely get in battles, he's hoeing himself out
Took up some ad space on Backpage
When they mention the GOAT's it seems all they talk about is Pat Stay
So if your'e such a fuckin' legend
How come you not got invited over to that SMACK stage
I guess you don't gotta read the book to figure out a thesaurus  doesn't translate
Them fools don't even acknowledge your W's
It's honestly fuckin' crazy how much black people don't fuck witchu
It's actually uncomfortable
This fool called Smack actin' like he's tryin' to get on some summer moves
And Smack answered the phone like, "How the fuck did you get this number fool."
Dizaster's hair sucks. 3-0 baby let's go
Ain't a chance in hell he's bombin' on me
Y'all gassed him up for that line about my car but his Honda's on E
Now that Michael Duncan line was somethin'
But the only thing it reminds me of is how high I'm jumpin'
Cause Iron's duckin'
Far as this battle shit though, you know that I gave birth to you, right?
Your Grind Time tryout, I was in your corner givin' you words of advice
Over a decade's past since then and you've earned a few stripes
But I'm gonna end you when I birthed you bitch, circle of life
Damn right, it's my soil, shit is in my roots
So I'm about to bark on the kid like Groot
I wanna see my knife goin' through a windpipe do
Then pull it out so it can report the inside scoop
Now that's unfortunate for you
The Matrix forcin' me to choose
Between worlds instead of goin' back and forth between the two
But shit, we all know what a Warrior would do
It takes more than new arenas for the Oracle to move
I will quarantine the room if it means keepin' my spot
The second hand'll sleep him but you feel like time stopped
Beef on my block? I'm not breeding livestock
You 'bout to catch a heavy cross, the one Jesus Christ got
My God I wish I could go back to Scribble '06
I bet
So I could show my old self to show myself a picture of this little broke bitch
And I'd say, "Today will be the first of many accomplishments you'll have
But just remember, in a few years you'll be responsible for that
Time
