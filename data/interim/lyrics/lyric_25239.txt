What do I want to do today?
808 Mafia
Um
That boy Cassius
Bad bitch 
Small waist, pretty face 
Havin' my way 
She let me nut on her face 
Stay in your place 
Shut up and stay out the way 
Decided what I'm gonna do today 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
I wanna look at the stars today 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
Thinkin' 'bout coppin' that Dawn today 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
I'ma ghost ride like I'm from the Bay 
You better watch your bae
Better off doin' what Simon say 
They mad 'cause I copped the Wraith
Police they look at my license plate 
They look at my jewelry
When I hop out, start singin' "Amazing Grace" 
The feast we eat
Before we jump in, my nigga we gotta say grace 
My grandmama gone but can't be replaced 
Jenna, she paved the way 
I'm turnin' the page on niggas 
I waited days, remember? 
Been had that fame on the side of my hood
Swear it couldn't change a nigga 
You niggas are slow 
I can beat you runnin' backwards 
The way I ghost ride the Wraith
Thought you would've seen Casper 
No I ain't gon' hide the K
'Cause I know I'm who they after 
How much you charge a feature?
Extra twenty if you askin', gotta tax 'em
Bad bitch 
Small waist, pretty face 
Havin' my way 
She let me nut on her face 
Stay in your place 
Shut up and stay out the way 
Decided what I'm gonna do today 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
I wanna look at the stars today 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
Thinkin' 'bout coppin' that Dawn today 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith 
I let her ride the Wraith , but she wanna ride the face 
Ain't give her the car, but I gave her 30K so she can slide and slay 
These niggas be talkin' 'bout double R Rolls, but that is 2008 
Beep, beep, double R backin' up, get out the way 
Reclinin' seats , pressin' one button, massagin' me 
I ride with heat , for all of my niggas deceased 
The pineapple 'scotti, it reek 
Gelato biscotti, it stink 
Fuck 12, nigga fast on feet 
Cartel get the bag dirt cheap 
Got gas but the tank on E 
No flash, but the ice on fleek 
Walkin' out with the bag and receipt 
No clout, all facts when I speak 
White Wraith with the red and black seats 
Pullin' up like a falcon with me 
She gon' faint when she see the double R 
When she find out Casper with me 
Bad bitch 
Small waist, pretty face 
Havin' my way 
She let me nut on her face 
Stay in your place 
Shut up and stay out the way 
Decided what I'm gonna do today 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
I wanna look at the stars today 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
Thinkin' 'bout coppin' that Dawn today 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith 
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
