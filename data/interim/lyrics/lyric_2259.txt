We'll have a hootenanny
Hootenanny Saturday night
We raise the roof and
The rafters with song
Yell out your favorite
We'll sing it loud and strong
Come and bring your
Lady love along
We'll throw a Hootenanny
Hootenanny Saturday night
And if you think we'll
Be rowdy, you're right
We'll hoot and holler
And raise almighty Cain
Every Saturday night
We'll throw a Hootenanny
Hootenanny Saturday night
And if you think we'll
Be rowdy, you're right
We'll hoot and holler
And raise almighty Cain
Every Saturday night
We'll have a hootenanny
Hootenanny Saturday night
We raise the roof and
The rafters with song
Yell out your favorite
We'll sing it loud and strong
Come and bring your
Lady love along
We'll throw a Hootenanny
Hootenanny Saturday night
And if you think we'll
Be rowdy, you're right
We'll hoot and holler
And raise almighty Cain
Every Saturday night
Every Saturday night
