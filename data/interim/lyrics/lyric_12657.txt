A combination makes the spark
We fuel the fire then watch it grow
A stimulation to the heart
I lose my head
Out of control
Pulling me over, running me through
I'd be right there in a beat  boy
I'd do anything to be with you
I lose my breath
Out of control
You make my heart beat faster
And that's all that matters
You make my heart beat faster
And that's all that matters
You make my heart beat faster
And that's all that matters
You make my heart beat faster
And that's all that matters
Imagination turn the key
Snap the shot
It's in my head
Anticipation grabbing me
I lose my breath
Out of control
A combination makes the spark
We fuel the fire then watch it grow
A stimulation to the heart
I lose my head
Out of control
