What good are you to me
When you found somebody else
No need of you coming back
Like I'm some package
On your shelf
Just leave me alone
Go back home to the
One the chose the best
I want you but
What would happen
That there'll be
No happiness
And it ain't no use
So I won't make it
Hard upon myself
Cause it ain't no use
When you belong to
Somebody else, girl
It ain't no use
Ain't no use
Ain't no use
Now I feel that I know myself
Better than anyone, I suppose
Always felt that you and I saw
Eye to eye and was pretty close
Guess I was wrong because
It wasn't long before
You was in another's arms
So hurt was I, when I
Started to cry thinking
That I had lost my charms
And it ain't no use
So I won't make it
Hard upon myself
Cause it ain't no use
When you belong to
Somebody else, girl
It ain't no use
Ain't no use
Ain't no use
Ain't no use
Just leave me alone
Go back home to the
One the chose the best
I want you but
What would happen
That there'll be
No happiness
And it ain't no use
So I won't make it
Hard upon myself
Cause it ain't no use
When you belong to
Somebody else, girl
It ain't no use
Ain't no use
I said it ain't no use
Ain't no use
