Wrong baby wrong baby wrong
It ain't the end of the world
Don't you worry pretty girl
Cause now that he's gone baby gone baby gone
You got nothing to lose
Count the minutes if you want to
It won't be long baby long baby long
'Til you find somebody new
Come on now
Everyone falls down
Everyone crawls now and then
Then they get up again
You cry if you want to
That's what we all do
But if you think you'll never move on you're wrong baby
Cry baby cry baby cry
Go on and let it all out
I ain't leaving you now
And we can fly baby fly baby fly
Let's share a bottle of wine
We can laugh about the good times
And you'll know why baby why baby why
It's going to be alright
Oh you ain't gone
Baby wrong baby wrong
There's nothing wrong with moving on
When you know he's good and gone
Come on now
Everyone falls down
Everyone crawls now and then
Then they get up again
You cry if you want to
That's what we all do
