Springtime Mama, with my lady
Let me know that I've been lazy
Let your smile that gets me crazy
Like the moon is shining through
Springtime Mama, roll it over
To the road side little cover
Hold me down now take me over
'Till that feeling's back again
Wanna have a simple moonshine
Wanna sing along on a song or two
Said, 'Gonna make it for the old times
Wanna hold your hand and kiss the whole night through
Wanna hear about your Springtime Mama
Said, 'Yeah wanna Springtime Mama'
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout your Springtime Mama
Said, 'Yeah wanna Springtime Mama'
Springtime Mama, I've been rolling
With the flow of old wind's blowing
Always hoping, never knowing
If I'd get with you again
Springtime Mama, with my lady
Let me know that I've been lazy
Let your smile that gets me crazy
Like the moon is shining through
Wanna hear about your Springtime Mama
Said, 'Yeah wanna Springtime Mama'
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout your Springtime Mama
Said, 'Yeah wanna Springtime Mama'
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout your Springtime Mama
Said, 'Yeah wanna Springtime Mama'
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout your Springtime Mama
Said, 'Yeah wanna Springtime Mama'
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout your Springtime Mama
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout
