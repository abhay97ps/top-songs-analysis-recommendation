Yeah
It's earlier in the morning
Mmm, mmm, mmm 
Since Iâ€”
All these damn chains, modern slavery 
But this ain't 1800 so they pay me 
Uh, yeah, shaking my demons off 
Dippin' my dreams in sauce 
Never been food for sharks 
Wrist like fins on dolphins 
Pop hella bands and I'm paid 
Whip got a switch, I go brainless 
Sip after sip, I feel painless 
Yeah, yeah, do it one time for team 
Burn it like gasoline 
Downing these jelly beans 
Diamonds they frolicking 
Red and blue matching drugs
Did 'em both just because 
They hoodie and maskin' up 
They the real Robin Hoods 
Yeah, if I, let my
Gang out, bow down 
Come 'round, gun you down
Hunt down , hunt down 
Rampage, campaign, champagne , I gain
Decades of no pain 
At this age, they fugaz' 
Who did you thought you was 
Get 'em knocked off for dubs 
Sit in the trap with bugs 
Walk in the lab with scrubs 
Niggas tried to count us out 
Fuck you thought this was 
Up like a coffee mug 
Save your salt for slugs 
Hot on the block, you told 12, got the drop
Rubber bands and they pop, so we weigh up the knots
Cuban link cost a lot, Houston cred with a lot
Let it fall from the top, she gon' bend, she gon' pop, oh 
All these damn chains, modern slavery 
But this ain't 1800 so they pay me 
Uh, yeah, shaking my demons off 
Dippin' my dreams in sauce 
Never been food for sharks 
Wrist like fins on dolphins 
Pop hella bands and I'm paid 
Whip got a switch, I go brainless 
Sip after sip, I feel painless
