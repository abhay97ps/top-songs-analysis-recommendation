SIG Sauer P226 Diana Ross cousin nina
Misdemeanor, that's what we do, understand it
I be more hipper than a hippopotamus
Get off in your head like a neurologist
Pushin more weight than Atlas
Got a partner by the name of 2Pacalypse
The seven-oh-seven my roots go hella far back to Floyd Terrace
I pull a forty out of my ballcap
And den I flush it down my esopha-garus
The group that I'm with The Click
Suga, D-Shot, Legit
Family orientated
Game Related, it's the shit
Killing motherfuckers off crucial
Sittin em down neutral
Running through these lyrics as if I was fibered
Like Metamucil
Timah timah.... forty wata..
Sprinkle me main, sprinkle me main, sprinkle me main, sprinkle me main...
Big timah timah, big timah, forty wata-ahh
Sprinkle me main, sprinkle me main, sprinkle me main...

Clicked out me Suga T from the V

Ya gotta strut that's a gang of shive 
Ooh ooh ooh I'm a fool
Slangin more mail as I smobs through yo' hood
Straight shakin all, these bustas and busterettes
Tryin to claim fame off my shive ass rep 
Ohh, why oh why must I be so tight? 
Most folks tell me, Suga you ain't right 
It makes me wanna scream while I make ya holla
Pullin a gang of clout like that al-mighty dollar
Suga Suga  Suga Suga

Sprinkle me girl, sprinkle me girl , sprinkle me girl, sprinkle me girl...

Sprinkle me girl, sprinkle me girl, sprinkle me girl, sprinkle me girl...
 Nigga PHin on a playa makin mega
Tryin to knock the hustle just because we way too major
Suga don't make me have to come up out the sound booth
And act a fuckin fool
BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM ON A TRICK
Play a player for false and get rubbed off ya don't want malse...
Fuck around and get evaporated
Cause I'mma timah timah.... timah timah
