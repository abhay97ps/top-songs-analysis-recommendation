It's kinda crazy babe
How I remember things, 
I went and made you fly
Put extras on your ride, 
You made it clear to me 
 but now I see
 I even heard it from your family
How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I taught you?
How could you put him on to the Ghetto Kama Sutra?
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
You must be out your mind
You got a lot of nerve 
I damn near carried you
I could've married you
Good thing I found out before I bought that 7 karat for you
 the way I found you out
 I hope he's got room in his house
You should have thought of me before you hopped in them sheets
Damn I can't believe that you did this to me
How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I taught you?
How could you put him on to the Ghetto Kama Sutra?
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
Girl I tried to give you everything
Can't believe the ways you repaid me
Girl you had it all
But I guess my all wasn't good enough for you
Baby I've accepted it
And I ain't gone trip
Girl I'm moving on
Sometimes I can't help but think that another man's gonna get the one I made for me
How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I taught you??
How could you put him on to the Ghetto Kama Sutra??
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you? 
 How could you girl?
How could you?  Ooh
 How could you?...
