1984 knockin' on your door, will you let it come, will you let it run your life ?
Someone will be waiting for you at your door when you get home tonight
Ah, yes, he's gonna tell you darkness gives you much more than you get from the light
Plexi-plastic eyeballs, they're your special friends, they see you every night
Well, he calls himself Big Brother but you know it's no game, you're never out of his sight
1984 knockin' on your door, will you let it come, will you let it run your life ?
It's time you started thinking inside your head that you should stand up and fight
Oh, where will you be when your freedom is dead 14 years from tonight
Those plexi-plastic 'copters they're your special friends, they see you every night
Well, they call themselves protection but you know it's no game, you're never out of their sight
1984 knockin' on your door, will you let it come, will you let it run ?
1984 knockin' on your door, will you let it come, will you let it run ?
1984 knockin' on your door, will you let it come, will you let it run your life ?
