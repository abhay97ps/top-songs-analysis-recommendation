Well, me and Jesus got our own thing goin'
Me and Jesus got it all worked out
Me and Jesus got our own thing goin'
We don't need anybody to tell us what it's all about
I know a man who once was a sinner
I know a man that once was a drunk
I know a man who once was a looser
But he went out one day and made an alter out of a stump
Jesus brought me through all of my troubles
Jesus brought me through all of my trials
Jesus brought me through all of my heartaches
And I know that Jesus ain't gonna forsake me now
We can't afford any fancy preachin'
We can't afford any fancy church
We can't afford any fancy singin'
But you know Jesus got a lot of poor people out doin' his work
Me and Jesus got our own thing goin'
Me and Jesus got it all worked out
Me and Jesus got our own thing goin'
