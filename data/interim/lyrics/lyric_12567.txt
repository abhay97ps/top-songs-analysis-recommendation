Once again we said it's over
And just like before
We vowed to take no more
Ooh, but I suddenly I find
That every time
Your face comes into view
And then you touch
The way that you do
I just can't walk away
Whenever you touch me
I give in to you
And I just can't walk away
I just can't walk away
Sometimes angry words with you
Make me lose my head
But memories unwind
To find my hear again
Ooh, but I stubbornly I go
And this time I am sure
'Cause I'm reaching for the door
And I feel your hand touch me
And my heart gives in
I just can't walk away
Whenever you touch me
My heart always wins
And I just can't walk away
When I think it must be hidin' in me
It always seems to find me close to you
It's the way that you touch me
I give in to you
I just can't walk away
Whenever you touch me
My heart always wins
I just can't walk away
No, we just can't walk away
