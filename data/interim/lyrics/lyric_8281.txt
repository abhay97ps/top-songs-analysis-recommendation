Hey, Virginia
I know it'll all come alright when I look into your eyes
It's something in you doin' it to me
My knees start to shake
My hands start to perspirate
And every time that you say: "Wait"
Lord, I think my back will break
Virginia, touch me like you do
Touch me like you do
Like you do, like you do
Like you do, like you do
Like you do
Oh yeah
Babe, believe me
The only time I fall apart is when he make those sounds
Don't ever leave me, ha
When you're around the feet hesitate
The voice starts fumbling
And if I don't get a chance
You always running up and dance
Virginia, touch me like you do
Touch me like you do
Like you do, like you do
Like you do, like you do
Like you do
Oh yeah
Lalala...
Ah, Virginia, touch me like you do
Touch me like you do
Like you do, like you do
Like you do, like you do
Like you do
Hey, Virginia
Now I know it'll come alright when I look into those eyes
It's some medium
Oh, but it ain't me
My voice start to break
My feet start to perspirate
Every time you say: "Wait"
My whole body starts to shake
Virginia, touch me like you do
Touch me like you do
Like you do, like you do
Like you do, like you do
Like you do, like you do
Like you do, like you do
Like you do, like you do
Like you do
Oh yeah
