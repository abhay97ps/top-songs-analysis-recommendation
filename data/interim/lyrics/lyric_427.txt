Way up north 
Way up north 
North to Alaska
We're goin' north, the rush is on
North to Alaska
We're goin' north, the rush is on
Big Sam left Seattle in the year of ninety-two
With George Pratt his partner, and brother Billy too
They crossed the Yukon River and found a bonanza gold
Below that old white mountain, just a little southeast of Nome
Sam crossed the majestic mountains
To the valleys far below
He talked to his team of huskies
As he mushed on through the snow
With the northern lights a-runnin' wild
In the land of the midnight sun
Yes, Sam McCord was a mighty man
In the year of nineteen-one
Where the river is windin'
Big nuggets they're finding
North to Alaska
We're goin' north, the rush is on
Way up north 
Way up north 
North to Alaska
We're goin' north, the rush is on
North to Alaska
We're goin' north, the rush is on
George turned to Sam with his gold in his hand
Said "Sam you're a-lookin'
At a lonely, lonely man
I'd trade all the gold that's buried in this land
For one small band of gold to place
On sweet little Jenny's hand
"Cause a man needs a woman
To love him all the time
Remember Sam, a true love is
So hard to find
I'd build for my Jenny
A honeymoon home
Below that old white mountain
Just a little southeast of Nome"
Where the river is windin'
Big nuggets they're finding
North to Alaska
We're goin' north, the rush is on
North to Alaska
We're goin' north, the rush is on
Way up north 
Way up north 
Way up north
