Normally this time of night, you wouldn't find me here
I'd be reaching for a good night kiss instead of one more beer
I'd never take a second look at the blond across the bar
Much less invite her over and let things go this far
But anything goes, when everything's gone
You ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong
So bring it on, anything goes, when everything's gone
Another morning after, a crazy night before
I'm searching for my blue jeans on the stranger's bedroom floor
Shouldn't I feel guilty? Well I don't feel a thing
I'd wake her up and say good bye but I can't recall her name
Anything goes, when everything's gone
You ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong
So bring it on, anything goes, when everything's gone
If you'd a left a single thread for me to hold on to
I'd have one good reason not to do the things I do
But anything goes, when everything's gone
You ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong
So bring it on, anything goes, when everything's gone
