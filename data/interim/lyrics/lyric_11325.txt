We could make it happen
If we try a little harder
I could tell by lookin
There was love in your heart
I could stay forever with you
Right here where we started
In this side of heaven
That I found here in your arms
'Cause you make me feel like someone new
You make me feel so good
You make me realize what your love could do
I'm happy that love has found you
Let it flow as the river runs wild
I'm happy that love has found you
Now I know this love will never run dry
You keep setting fire
To the soul that burns inside me
I won't let you go until I fill you with its light
We can make it happen if we try a little harder
I could tell by lookin there was love in your heart
'Cause you make me feel so wonderful
You make me feel brand new
You made my hopeless dreaming come true
