Born in the valley
And raised in the trees
Of Western Kentucky
On wobbly knees
With mama beside you
To help you along
You'll soon be a-growin' up strong
Oh, the long lazy mornings
In pastures of green
The sun on your withers
The wind in your mane
Could never prepare you
For what lies ahead
The run for the roses so red
And it's run for the roses
As fast as you can
Your fate is delivered
Your moment's at hand
It's the chance of a lifetime
In a lifetime of chance
And it's high time
You joined in the dance
It's high time
You joined in the dance
From sire to sire
It's born in the blood
The fire of a mare and
The strength of a stud
It's breeding
And it's training
And it's something unknown
That drives you and carries you home
And it's run for the roses
As fast as you can
Your fate is delivered
Your moment's at hand
It's the chance of a lifetime
In a lifetime of chance
And it's high time
You joined in the dance
It's high time
You joined in the dance
