Come on and walk with me
Jesus take my hand
Precious lord
Help me understand
When darkness falls
I want to take my stand
Precious lord
Take my hand
I know a man, and his name is Jesus
And he washed away my sins
And he started life as a lonely carpenter
And ended as a fisherman
And he came along and he passed out his glory
He cleansed my dirty soul
So precious Jesus
Take my hand
Help me make myself
Help me make myself
Help me make myself whole
Come on and walk with me
Jesus take my hand
Precious lord
Help me understand
When darkness falls
I want to take my stand
Precious lord
Take my hand
Come on and walk with me
Jesus take my hand
Precious lord
Help me understand
When darkness falls
I want to take my stand
Precious lord
Take my hand
Come on and walk with me
Jesus take my hand
Precious lord
Help me understand
When darkness falls
I want to take my stand
Precious lord
Take my hand
