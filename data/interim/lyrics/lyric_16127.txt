This old man I've talked about
Broke his own heart, poured it in the ground
Big red tree grew up and out
Throws up its leaves and spins round and round
I know all this and more
So take your hat off when you're talkin' to me
And be there when I feed the tree
This little squirrel I used to be
Slammed her bike down the stairs
They put silver where her teeth had been
Baby silver tooth, she grins and wins
I know all this and more
So take your hat off, boy, when you're talkin' to me
And be there when I feed the tree
Take your hat off, boy, when you're talkin' to me
And be there when I feed the tree
This old man I used to be
Spins around, around, around the tree
Silver baby, come to me
I'll only hurt you in my dreams
I know all this and
I know all this and
I know all this and more
So take your hat off, boy, when you're talkin' to me
And be there when I feed the tree
Take your hat off when you're talkin' to me
And be there when I feed the tree
