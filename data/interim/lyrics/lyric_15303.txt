Yeahh..
Girl I've been searchin so long thru this world
Trying to find someone who could be
What my picture of love was to me
And you came along
When I saw you I knew you were the one
The love that I've been dreamin of
I've been waitin for you 
All my life for somebody who 
Makes me feel the way I feel when I'm with you, baby
Have you been waitin too
Cuz I've been waitin for you
Girl I've been saving my love all this time
Cuz I knew someday I would find
The one that i've loved for so long in my mind
From the moment that I looked in your eyes
I saw the girl I've loved all my life
I've been waitin for you 
All my life for somebody who 
Makes me feel the way I feel when I'm with you, baby
Have you been waitin too
Cause I've been waitin for you
Now that I've found you I just can't let u go 
No no no ohhh
Oh there's just one thing I want you to know
Spoken: girl I love you so...
I've been waitin for you
All my life waitin for you
I've been waitin for you
All my life waitin for you
When I saw you I knew you were the one
The love that I've been dreaming of
I've been waitin for you 
All my life for somebody who 
Makes me feel the way I feel when I'm with you, baby
Have you been waitin too
Cause I've been waitin for you

All my life waitin for you

All my life waitin for you
