Thats the first thing that come to my mind
Im like
Wooo-hoo
Shawty you can get it all, what

I know you heard my reputation 
You dont think I would ever do right by you 
You think that if you and I was in a relationship
I would never be true 
You think that anything I say is straight gang 
And to me your just another new name 
But what im tryna tell you for every man
Theres a woman that'll make him change 
And I believe you the one that'll make me 
But any time I try to show you you shake me 
I know I make it real hard for you to take me serious
But baby girl I am 
And I ain't stoppin right here, I'mma keep going
And im gonna make sure everyday that you keep knowing
Whether if I have to send you flowers
Or talk to you on the celle-phone for few hours
Im yellin like..
One minute you act like you like me 
And then the next you don't 
You still sending me crazy emails
Like I know its just sex you want 
I can't lie the sex is truly incredible 
And every part of your body is so edible 
I get tears from just thinking bout it
But that ain't the reason why im stuck and can't let you go 
We got a serious serious bond 
And when we kick it we have nothin but fun 
I feel a whole lot of L-O-V-E between you and me
Even though we still young 
Just your company ain't gota get none
Talk the same lingo, understand where im coming from 
And if anybody ask me a question about you
Ima tell em you the one
You got me like
As long as you know that
I can have any girl I want to
Baby that sexual infectual
But still I choose you to be
With me and we're gonna
So you better not break it up
You got me like
