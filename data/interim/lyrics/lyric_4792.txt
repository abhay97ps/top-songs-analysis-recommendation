In my mind, thoughts are formed
Depend rights, and uh, words are born
Because we're shy when we’re young
I'll let my heart speak in place of my tongue
Darling, here's a letter
Written just for you
Next time, I’ll do better (The very next time
But oh, baby, what I have to say
Page after page, I wrote in this way)
Oo-oo-ooh, I love you, woo-ooh
Oo-oo-ooh, I love you, woo-ooh
Your love, girl
I wanna be your favorite
But I love you, taste in a day, baby
Everything , everything , everything
You're my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby
I love you, my baby, my baby, my baby
Love letters are written in many, many ways
But from start to finish, mine simply says
Oh my baby, my baby 
My baby, baby, baby, oh my baby, babe
I love you, baby, I love all of my baby, my baby, my baby
My baby, real good, baby, baby
Baby, baby, all of my baby
