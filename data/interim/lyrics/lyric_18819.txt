 Oh, whoa, oh, oh
Aye
Yeah, baby, mmm
I keep your picture beside my bed
And I still remember everything you said
I always thought our love was so right, I guess I was wrong
Always thought you'd be by my side, papa, now you're gone
What I wanna know, baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore?
Still light the fire on a rainy night
I still like it better when your holding me tight
Everybody said
Everybody said that we should never part 
Tell me baby, baby, baby, why
Why you wanna go and break my heart? Hey, ooh
All I wanna know is, baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore? Oh, hey 
Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me, Papa
Ooh, you got to try
I'll get down on my knees
Hoping you please, please, please
Oh-oh, ooh, won't you call me sometime, Papa?
Why on Earth
Can't you just pick up the phone?
You know I don't like to be alone
How come you don't call me? 
How come you don't call me? 
How come you don't call me anymore?
