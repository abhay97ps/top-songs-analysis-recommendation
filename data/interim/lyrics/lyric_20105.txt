Yeah nigga  all you niggas, 
We don't ride these no more nigga
We're in here with flats nigga
We sittin' on lebron back over here
All you fake mounted niggas ridin' these
We stop ridin' these in '99 
Put that lil' boy shit up
If you're ridin' rims, you gotta ride flats 
I'm sittin' high ridin' on lebron back 
Des 23's 
If you know 
I got a Tahoe truck sittin' up on 24's
I got more grams than Teddy, got a cam in my chevy, my car go  and when I ride I'm ready
Look like I'm glidin' on nothin', when I ride I be skatin'
I pull up swervi' on
Niggas they don't be tryin'
They be hatin'
They only ridin' on 20's
They might as well ride on hubs, if it ain't deuces or better
You might as well put em' up
Cause where I'm from  we mount up and ride on them big rims
A whole supply of deuces that spin harder than windmills, I been real  always too clean cause I pack heat
Or white leather guts
Plush, bitch scream in the back seat
23's on my fuckin' so I ride and I swerve
But we're too clean for the fuckin' street so I park on the curb
I got the chevy sittin' high, by matchin' corner ties
Michael Jordan's mounted up darts 23's on the ride 
I got man in the trunk, I'm workin' the alpine
Paint flippin', candy drippin', plus the wood inside, driving a big boy drop
A T.V. in the rear, the European clip on the rotatin' rim just got 'em up out jail
 buss a couple you turns
 punchin' on the gas pedal, make pipe start chokin', comin' down real clean
Got 66 lebron back home, look I'm sittin' right on it, comin' up in the lane
On the corner straight gunnin'
Loud pipes, satin music, with the judo eyes, 2nd tone background wit 2-inch ties
Cut curb on the block, it's a concert line
 swervin' side to side
Yup the cutlits mounted up like a H3 Hummer, but it's stuntin' 1-on-1 cause I'm the #1 stunner, goin' down 20  doin' more than a Honda
Since my paint wet, they say my trunk sound like thunder, break the law
 drivin' illegal, in a nice ol' school, flow like dead people, I park where I can't, hit button make my door's pop, rims go round and round
Custom seats lean 'n rock
Now my rims spin nigga, every time I make a stop, and I keep that Chevy clean, like a flow on disk it mop, when I'm posted at the light
Got a button that make the top drop now hoes hoppin' on my dick like
They playin' hopscotch hhhoes hopping on my dick like they playin'
Hopscotch, when I'm on the E-way
You see me hit it then I'm gone, shinin' red paint and I touch that whistle
Silicone I stay deep  hopin' at all cause I don't mind
Cause I'm wood grippin', flip switchin'
Flipping alpine, it's pimpin' nigga
So I'm always stunt nigga, pull up on the chevy and burnt like my blunts nigga
I keep good product in the hood it get delivered 
Sittin' back watchin' movies in the rear view mirror
