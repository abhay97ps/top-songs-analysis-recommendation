They say the beat of a butterflies wings
Can set off a storm the world away
What if they're right and the smallest of things
Can power the strongest hurricane?
What if it all begins inside?
We hold the key that turns the tide
Just a pebble in the water 
Can set the sea in motion 
A simple act of kindness 
Can stir the widest ocean
If we show a little love 
Heaven knows what we could change 
So throw a pebble in the water 
And make a wave, make a wave
Make a wave, make a wave
The single choice to take a stand
And reach out your hand to someone in need 
Don't fool yourself and say you can't
You never know what can grow from just one seed 
So come with me and seize the day
This world may never be the same
Just a pebble in the water 
Can set the sea in motion 
A simple act of kindness 
Can stir the widest ocean 
If we show a little love 
Heaven knows that we could change
So throw a pebble in the water 
Make a wave, make a wave 
Make a wave, make a wave 
Make a wave, make a wave
Heaven knows what we could change 
So let's show a little love
You never know we could change
So throw a pebble in the water, mmm
Make a wave, make a wave
Oh, oh, oh, Oh
