All I wanna do is rock with you
Shout it out an' tell ya friends too
Love is me
Love is you
This is what we wanna do
Yeah
Let's talk a while
My friend
Find out what's on your mind
Drift away in a darkness
We've ben sleepin' much too long
Enough! it's time to get up!
We gotta carry on 
Let's carry on 
Like a rose in the summer
In the midst of thorns
Our love must grow
The rivers must flow
We've been sleepin' much too long enough!
It's time to rise!
We gotta carry on 
We gotta carry on 
We gotta carry on 
Let's carry on 
Love is me
Love is you
Enough!
It's time to rise
