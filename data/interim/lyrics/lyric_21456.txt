She's got Brazilian leather boots on the pedal of her German car
Listening to The Beatles singing "Back in the USSR"
Yeah, she's going around the world tonight
But she ain't leaving here
She's just going to meet her boyfriend
Down at the street fair
And it's a French kiss, Italian ice
Spanish moss in the moonlight 
Just another American Saturday night
There's a big toga party tonight down at Delta Chi
They got Canadian bacon on their pizza pie
They got a cooler full of cold Coronas and Amstel Light
It's like we're all living in a big old cup
Just fire up the blender, mix it all up
It's a French kiss, Italian ice
Margaritas in the moonlight 
Just another American Saturday night
You know everywhere has something they're known for
Although usually it washes up on our shores
My great-great-great-granddaddy stepped off of that ship
I bet he never ever dreamed we'd have all this
You know everywhere has something they're known for
Although usually it washes up on our shores
Little Italy and Chinatown sitting there side by side
Live from New York
It's a French kiss, Italian ice
Spanish moss in the moonlight 
Just another American, I'm just another American
And it's just another American Saturday night
