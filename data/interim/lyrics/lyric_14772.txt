Smooth up in ya
Momma
Whoa
Oh baby, oh
Oh oh baby
I know you really want to move me
At least I know, you want to try
I've said it before and I'll say it again
You're not, not trapped if you don't give in
Looks like you're the harder kind
An' I ain't got that kind of time
Oh, I send shivers
Smooth up in ya
Smooth up in ya
You say I'm never gonna break ya
But we won't know until we try
So now's the time to make up your mind
I'll never ever be the one woman kind
Don't let your lovin' go to waste
All it takes is just one date
But I send shivers
Smooth up in ya
Smooth up in ya
Smooth up in ya
Smooth up in ya
Ohh, ooh, ooh
I wanna go
I wanna
I, I wanna go
Ohh, wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go
Ohh
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
Don't let your lovin' go to waste
I'm gonna take you just a taste
Whoa, I send shivers
Smooth up in ya
Smooth up in ya
Smooth up in ya
Smooth up in ya
Smooth up in ya
Smooth up in ya
Smooth up in ya
Wanna go
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Smooth up in ya, go
Yeah
