{Verse 1 : DOMS}
They say the grass is always greener on the other side
Either someone lied or when i seen it it just must've died
These cops are killing civilians but is it justified?
And why is it the government can treat us like were dumb and blind?
Well i won't let it crush my pride
Or abandon hope
Old friends are slamming dope
So i keep my family close
We got it handled bro
They can't control the words we spit
The sickest flow,there isn't no antidote or cure for this
Permanent
Hotter than the fire in a furnace is
I'm writing like a journalist
Tighter than a tourniquet
I'm righteous and i'm merciless
So while you're vibing to my verses
You should try and find your lighter and then burn a spliff
And kick back like when a twelve gauge shoots
Taking shots of vodka till u puke and smell grey goose
Yo i'm crazy raw,making all hell break loose
You tried to skate on thin ice but you fell straight through
See the potency of my flow will get your tolerance up
I'm bothered that the real mc's don't get acknowledged enough
I bet your favorite song lyrics are appalling to us
So when u claim u all in it,ill be i'm calling your bluff
Cause you just crying wolf
Your hearts beating with a hyper pulse
So you can either play the cards ur dealt or u can try and fold
I'm a load the bong so i can light a bowl
Sipping guinness taking giant gulps,cuz the pint is cold
But i ain't old enough to drink,aggravated i'm the young one
So i chug capri sun and minute maid until i'm punch drunk
We shocking haters like a taser and a stun gun
Trying to find a label that'll pay us by the lump sum
Vegas where i come from
Sin city living,swift precision
Making rappers run son like they're diggy simmons
I've been the business since an early age
And ill be spitting hot until i pick the lock up at the pearly gates
{Verse 2 : K.O.N}
Yo im a veteran savage
U better believe
Deserve the letterman jacket
With the leather on sleeves
We're a competitive bracket
U could never achieve
Unless your name begins with damien
A malevolent seed
What the devil conceived
Or the dude who was crucified
Say the end is near
They wonder where the future lies
Youth is euthanized
And the truth is scrutinized
Few who survive
Narrating the hate
And its soaking in your mind
Like marinating a steak
But the inherent mistake
Weren't prepared for the wake
When the overrun would overcome
And barricades break
Yo you better build a bunker
In your parents estate
Envision a police state
Prison no release date
I mean for pete's sake
Its every city in town
And they got cameras hidden
For the vision and sound
As a matter of fact i think they're listening now
So never mind shit i was just kidding around
You think its weird and berserk
When your hearing this verse
But no i don't fear hell if its here on this earth
I give em food for thought and now you near the dessert
And if hip hop is dead then this is spirits at work
Cuz with recording and spitting were like jordan and pippin
You disagree with this emcee you snortin' and sniffin'
Or tangled up in angel dust im kickin' those hard krills
To kill your buzz like a bug hittin' a car grill
Its hands down over your head shit is a cartwheel
Lyrical rap only the gifted and smart feel
So if you gonna sleep on the songs write
Then ill be freddy krueger when im palming the mic
Or jeff dahm with a knife when im eating your sixteens
This shit is a sick dream and its got me infected
So i say fuck the world y'all got sloppy seconds
