Listen easy, you can hear God callin'
Walkin' barefoot by a stream
Come unto me, your hair softly fallin'
On my face as in a dream
And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind
Sayin' nothin', lyin' where the sun is
Bakin' down upon our sighs
My lips touch you with their soft wet kisses
Your hands gentle in reply
And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind
Child, touch my soul with your cries
And the music will know what we found
I hear a hundred goodbyes
But today I hear only one sound
The moment we're livin' is now
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Young bird flyin' and a soft wind blowin'
Cools the sweat inside my palms
Close my eyes and see the flowers growin'
As you lay sleepin' in my arms
And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind
