Shoulda known it was you knocking on my door
At half past a heartache at quarter to four
Were you starting to worry I was finally getting over you
I almost forgot you looked so fine
If you told me some lies, it would be like old times
Just getting to see you is almost worth the things you do
You're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
You look so good but the way things look ain't the way they are
Better say goodbye
Before this goes too far
Cause now I realize you're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
I got to admit to you got a smile
That really reeled me in for awhile
But it ain't funny, honey, what you put me through
So why don't you send me your photograph
It'd hurt a lot less than taking you back
Then I could still have my favorite part of you
Cause you're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
You look so good but the way things look ain't the way they are
Better say goodbye
Before this goes too far
Cause now I realize you're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
You're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
You look so good but the way things look ain't the way they are
Better say goodbye
Before this goes too far
Now I realize you're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
Now I realize
You're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
