Tears start falling when I dream of you
Can't help myself, you're far away with someone else
And I will never find another girl
Who makes me feel, the way you do
When I dream of you
And I've been seeing, the same visions night after night
Till the morning light
As my soul starts to ache
My heart starts to break in two
When I dream of you
When I dream of you, like dreamers do
I get this way, all night and day
When I dream of you, like dreamers do
I get this way, when I dream of you
When I think of how you made me feel
At a time, when love was real, and you were mine
I start missing all the times we spent
The words we'd say, how I never dreamt
I'd get this way when I dream of you
Oh and I've been seeing, the same visions night after night
Till the morning light
As my soul starts to ache
My heart starts to break in two
When I dream
When I dream of you, like dreamers do
I get this way, all night and day
When I dream of you, like dreamers do
I get this way, when I dream of you
I remember looking in your eyes
I loved that most, these were the times
Heaven, never seemed so close
Tears start falling when I dream of you
Can't help but miss, the love I knew
When I dream, of you
