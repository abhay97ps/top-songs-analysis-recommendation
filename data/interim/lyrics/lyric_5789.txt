Hi, everybody. This is Neil Diamond, and I know we're goin' through a rough time right now, but I love ya, and I think that maybe if we sing together, well, we'll just feel a little bit better. Give it a try, OK?
Where it began
I can't begin to knowin'
But then I know it's growin' strong
Was in the spring
Then spring became the summer
Who'd have believed you come a-
Long?
Hands
Washin' hands
Reachin' out
Don't touch me
I won't touch you
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would
But now I
Look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two
And when I heard
Hurtin' runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when I'm holding you?
Hands
Washin' hands
Reachin' out
Don't touch me
I won't touch you
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would
Sweet Caroline
