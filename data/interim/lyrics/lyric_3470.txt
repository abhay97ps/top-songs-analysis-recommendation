Love has gone and I can't take it anymore
Seems you're actin' just like you don't love me anymore
But you know all I'll wanna see
Is your lovin' arms caressin' me
But you know that can never be
Don't pity me
Don't pity me
'Cause I can see you're goin' 'round with someone new
Reckon you have been with him a time or maybe two
But if you say you're goin' away
You're goin' away and away you'll stay
I'll want you back, but I won't take you back
Don't pity me
Don't pity me
Don't pity me
I want you to think that I'm alright
Think that I go to sleep at night
Oh, I know it's a lie
I know it's goodbye
Love has gone and I can't take it anymore
Seems you're actin' just like you don't love me anymore
But you know all I'll wanna see
Is your lovin' arms caressin' me
But you know that can never be
Don't pity me
Don't pity me
Don't pity me
I said don't pity me 
Don't pity me
Oh please, don't pity me 
Don't pity me
I said don't pity me
