Holly :
I see you driving round town with the guy I love
And I'm like "forget you" 
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like "forget you and forget him, too"
Saying if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Huh, now ain't that some shhh 
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "forget you" 
Yeah, I'm sorry I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess she's an Xbox and I'm more an Atari
Mmh, but the way you play your game ain't fair
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
Well 
Ooh, ooh
I've got some news for you
Yeah go run and tell your little girlfriend
I see you driving round town with the guy I love
And I'm like "forget you" 
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like "forget you and forget him, too"
Saying if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Now ain't that some shhh 
Although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "forget you" 
Now I know that I had to borrow
And beg and steal and lie and cheat
Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya
Cause being in love with your face ain't cheap
Nah, I pity the fool that falls in love with you
Well 
Ooh, ooh
I've got some news for you
Oh, I really hate you right now
I see you driving round town with the guy I love
And I'm like "forget you" 
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like "forget you and forget him, too"
Saying if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Huh, now ain't that some shhh 
Although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "forget you" 
Artie and Mercedes :
Now baby, baby, baby
Why'd you wanna, wanna hurt me so bad? 
So bad  
I tried to tell my mamma
But she told me "This is one for your dad" 
Holly :
 Why?
 Why?
 Why, baby, baby? 
I love you
I still love you!
