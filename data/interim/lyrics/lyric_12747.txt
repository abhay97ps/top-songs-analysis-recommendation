Hold on!
I like black and white
You like black and white
Run run away
See chameleon
All things to everyone
Run run away
If you're in the swing
If you're in the swing
Run run away
See chameleon
All things to everyone
Run run away
If you gotta crush
When I gotta crush
Run run away
See chameleon
All things to everyone
Run run away
Oh now can't you wait
Oh now can't you wait
Run run away
See the chameleon
Lying there in the sun
All things to everyone
Run run away
Run run away
Run run away
Run run away
