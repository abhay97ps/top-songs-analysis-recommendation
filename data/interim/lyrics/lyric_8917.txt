Wonderful baby
Living on love
The Sandman says maybe he'll take you above
Up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows
Where babies float by just counting their toes
Wonderful baby
Nothing but new
The world has gone crazy
I'm glad I'm not you
At the beginning or is it the end?
It goes in and comes out and starts over again
Wonderful baby
Living on love
The Sandman says maybe he'll take you above
Up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows
Where babies float by just counting their toes
Wonderful baby
I'll watch while you grow
If I knew the future
You'd be first to know
But I don't know nothing of what life's about
Just as long as you live
You'll never find out
Wonderful baby
Nothing to fear
Love whom you will
But doubt what you hear
They'll whisper sweet things to make untrue
So be good to yourself
That's all you can do
You're a wonderful baby
Living on love
The Sandman says maybe he'll take you above
Up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows
Where babies float by just counting their toes
Where babies float by just counting their toes
