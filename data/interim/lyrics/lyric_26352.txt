Spin that shit every day, every night

Y'all niggas can't even trap, nothing
Post up, nothing, kick with the hoes, barbeque, nothing
We spinning back to back
Two weeks, three weeks straight, nigga, on God, nigga
Big 4L, pussy
Rockin' ice like I'm tryna make a knot go down 
When the police hit the lights, I do not slow down 
Brand new Draco ready to crash like when the stocks go down 
I'm rich for real, I could press a button and make the opps go down 
Maybach with the shade 
Brand new CTS all red like the Braves 
Y'all just started slidin', we was slidin' back in the day 
21 Gang, woodgrain on the K 
Big Slaughter, nigga, big dagger in my face 
Ski mask, fuck a camera, gun him down on tape 
Breaking news, FOX 5, pussy, we don't play 
I call my Hellcat OVO 'cause it keep a Drac' 
Red dot, headshot, pussy DOA 
Count me a ten in one minute, count a whole hundred in ten minutes 
Niggas need to call they hood Beyblades 'cause all we do is spin in it 
I own me a couple establishments, I ain't worried 'bout your business 
Y'all running 'round here gossipin', I'm tryna make me some more millions 
Ridin' with a stick in the hotbox, I ain't never put my phone in it 
We call your main bitch pussy hood 'cause all we do is joan in it 
Money the only paperwork I put my bros in 
Somebody please unthaw my ears 'cause they frozen
Rockin' ice like I'm tryna make a knot go down 
When the police hit the lights, I do not slow down 
Brand new Draco ready to crash like when the stocks go down 
I'm rich for real, I could press a button and make the opps go down 
Charge him with theft by taking 'cause his drip stolen 
Trap spot in the neighborhood is 60 Rolling 
Had to do CPR, I got your bitch choking 
Selling Percocets, weed, bar, and cocaine
So many choppers in the spot, we leave the door open 
Put the water in the pot, then you stick the fork in
Put some holes in your shirt, now it's red, soakin' 
I ain't runnin' from no smoke, period, semi-colon 
You wanna hold somethin', I got plenty shells 
I don't even want no smoke, niggas gon' tattletale 
I don't even play with people's kids, go play Battlefield 
I'm from the East, home of the murders, you niggas'll die out here 
They like to box, we like to pop, both of us bodybuild 
You can get hit with one of them guns from my adlib 
You gon' fuck around and get chopped, lil' Karate Kid 
I ain't seen him in a minute, but ask if God did 
Saint Laurent sweater
Rock Balenciaga when I rock the Barett-er 
Shout out Robert Kraft, fell in love with the cheddar 
Beat a rapper ass, Def Jam Vendett-er 
When it come to shh, we got plenty
Eating Ruth Chris, I done burnt out on the Beni' 
And I eat, sleep, shit, fuck with the semi 
Screamin' fuck friends, family first, rocking Fendi
