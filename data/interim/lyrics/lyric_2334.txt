Never more to hurt me deep
Bye, bye Barbara
Never more to make me weep
Bye, bye Barbara
I have gone in the search of
A much truer love than your own
I'll find me one who understands
Bye, bye Barbara
Holds my heart in tender hands
Bye, bye Barbara
I have gone in the search of
A much truer love than I've known
Just read my note on your door
Just goodbye
Nothing more
It's better to leave you this way
You couldn't change
I couldn't stay
Never more to hurt me deep
Bye, bye Barbara
Never more to make me weep
Bye, bye Barbara
Since you are what you are
You'll not very long be alone
I have gone in the search
Of a much truer love than your own
