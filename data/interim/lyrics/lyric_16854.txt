Brokenhearted
Ooh-yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah yeah yeah
Oh-whoa
Oh, oh-oh
I'm young, but I'm wise enough to know
That you don't fall in love overnight, oh yeah
That's why I thought if I took my time
That everything in love would be right
But as soon as I closed my eyes
I was saying to love, "Goodbye"
But I guess I'm
Only brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over
No more empty conversations
Next time I will be totally sure, oh yeah
Don't want the pain of falling in and out of love
It's more than my poor heart should endure, ooh-oh
So I'll listen to all advice
And remember each time I cry
That I guess I'm
Only brokenhearted 
Life's not over 
I can start again 
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted 
It's a hurting thing to get over 
Only brokenhearted 
Life's not over 
I can start again 
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted 
It's a hurting thing to get over 
 Starting all over, yeah
Ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh oh oh-oh-oh, oh oh-ooh whoa
Oh oh-oh-ooh, whoa-whoa
Ooh yeah
Only brokenhearted
La-da-da-ah, whoa-yeah
Oh-ah
So I'll listen to all advice
And remember each time I cry, oh
Whoa, I'm
Only brokenhearted 
Life's not over 
I can start again 
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted 
It's a hurting thing to get over 
Only brokenhearted 
Life's not over 
I can start again 
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted 
It's a hurting thing to get over 
Only brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over, to get over
Only brokenhearted...
