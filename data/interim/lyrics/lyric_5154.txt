Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from? Yeah
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?
I look at all those lonely people
I look at all those lonely people now
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Donning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
I heard him say
All the lonely people 
Where do they all come from?
He turned to me and he said
All the lonely people, yeah 
Where do they all belong now?
I look at all the lonely people , yeah, 
I look at all the lonely people , oh, 
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
And Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walked from the grave
No one was saved
And he said
All the lonely people 
Where do they all come from? The man looked at me and he said
All the lonely people 
Where do they all belong?
I look at all the lonely people 
I look at all the lonely people , oh, 
All the lonely people 
Where do they all come from? I want somebody to tell me
All the lonely people 
Where do they all belong?
