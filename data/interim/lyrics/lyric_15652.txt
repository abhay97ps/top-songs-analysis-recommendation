He said that it was love at first sight
You knew he wasn’t right
Must be your method to his madness
She said that he should be for real
He said he could not deal
And now she’s full of sadness
She already know more than she knows
She knows that he may never come back
That will stop her from dreaming and scheming
Always old enough for mating
You said that hearts don’t think they feel
It’s just a minor complication
Hearts don’t think they feel
It’s just a careful observation
She said she knew him well
But wasn’t kiss and tell
He said she’s just a good friend
Someone had told a lie
In that they can’t deny
Who figured that it would end?
Nobody knows what’s really on your mind
But I can really tell that
The look in your eye is saying goodbye
You may never look back
Hearts don’t think they feel
It’s just a minor complication
Hearts don’t think they feel
That’s my careful observation
There’s no moral to the story
Somebody took your code away
So don’t let your tomorrows be sorrows
Live life today
She already know more than she knows
She knows that he may never come back
That don’t stop her from dreaming and scheming
Always holding on to mating
Say it again…
Hearts don’t think they feel
It’s just a minor complication
I said that hearts don’t think they feel
It’s just my careful observation
From a different situation
I said…
Hearts don’t think they feel
Minor complication
Hearts don’t think they feel
Hearts don’t think they feel
It’s just a min…minor…
Minor complication
Hearts don’t think they feel
It’s just my careful observation
They don’t think they feel
