He walked into the party
And looked at everybody in the room
She looked into those flaming eyes
She went and stood beside him
I thought she moved just a little too soon
I must admit to my surprise
He would not dance with her
He could not stay he said
He got no time to waste
He took her to, he took her to bed
He don't love nobody
He just wants your body, baby
I don't think she really knows, ooh, yeah
He don't love nobody
He just wants your body, baby
I don't think she really knows
I could not understand it
I don't know why she followed him home
She had not seen this man before
He touched her with his body
And then she could not leave him alone
They left me standing on the phone
He would not dance with her
He could not stay he said
He got no time to waste
He took her to
He took her to bed
He don't love nobody
He just wants your body, baby
I don't think she really knows, oh, no
He don't love nobody
He just wants your body, baby
I don't think she really knows
He don't love nobody
He just wants your body, baby
I don't think you really know, ooh, yeah
He don't love nobody
He just wants your body, baby
I don't think you really know
He don't love nobody
He just wants your body, baby
I don't think you really know, oh, no
He don't love nobody
He just wants your body, baby
I don't think you really know, oh
He don't love nobody
He just wants your body, baby
I don't think you really know, oh, no
