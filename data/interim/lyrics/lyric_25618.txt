We were just a couple years short of the age
By my name on a fake ID
And still 'bout a hundred away from the day
Your daddy said you could run with me
We were a couple of line steppers
Who just couldn’t wait to step over the line
Never thinkin' we wouldn't last
I was your first and you were mine
And we were leather jackets hangin’ onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin' out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mm-hmm
We were gonna make it, weren't we, baby?
Had it all laid out in our mind
By the time we knew time was runnin' out
We'd done run out of time
And we were downtown Saturday night, last-call cover band
'Til the last song played, never thought we'd fade
Like the stamp on the back of her hand
We were her on my shoulders, lighter in the air
"Pour Some Sugar On Me"
We were a top down at Johnson’s field
When she whispered that she wants me
At least there’s a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Oh, mm-hmm
We were leather jackets hangin' onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin’ out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mmm, yes, I do
My friends say
"Oh well, let that ship sail
You gotta let go of her"
Just wasn't meant to be
But somewhere down deep, I still believe
That we were
