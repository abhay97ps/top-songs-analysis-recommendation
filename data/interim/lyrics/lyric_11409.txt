Baby I couldn’t tell you
If its promised just maintain momentum and keep being honest
I left breakfast in the toaster
Still trusting every single one of my soldiers and
I can’t even say that your cigarette, was my dying face oh baby told
It’s been too long
Tell me how you could fill up with October
When you been drinking and you’re hardly sober
Packs in the mail but that's just not important
I take the whip and I’m hauling thru autumn
Days ended early as if we forgot em
Don’t make the same mistakes and use some logic cuz trust me you don’t want the pain of tomorrow
When you find out that the world spins without you
And you realize that the stars are just stars
Don’t call on angels or gods the devil is lost
When there’s no more pain in my heart
'Cept a couple things leading through shortage
Mocassins don’t feel as warm as they should’ve
Made it out of the summer of boredom
Went to sleep shivering in no comfort
And shorty so bad that she make me redundant
Know that’s no reason to sit in the corner
Spread up the apple butter in the kitchen been making up stories since I was a yungin
I want some silver linings in my sundays and no I don't need company for nirvana
Turned off the TV and picked up the mobile I told her come over excitement is going
Back on my seventeen
You know I don’t remember things as we all crack the medicine you need a better remedy
Parking lot synergy all I need is energy
You could tell me anything but that don’t mean...
 Well I would drive 40 miles to nickel dime
To sing the words to save your life
You offer things I can’t refuse
But give me times that don’t suffice
I need multiple suitors I’m suit and tie for the greetings
I don’t need money a man of nothing but some sneakers
I’m Tropicana in west savannah sippin sweet tea
Don’t want discussion if there’s percussion on the beating
Brothers on the ccs
Man without a reason
Click click cheesin
Passport Visa
Yung J Caesar
No fake family
At 4 seasons
That’s that dog
That’s that evil
I’m too flagrant
I’m too regal
I go postal I’m that post man
Nikol jokic or shaq diesel
I would drop everything to tame the fire
Or halt the storm to shine some light
On problems that you made yourself
On reasons I can’t spend the night
I’m just glad to clear the things on the easel
Much love pops left money all on the mantle
I never said that us together was easy
All things point to being too hard to handle
