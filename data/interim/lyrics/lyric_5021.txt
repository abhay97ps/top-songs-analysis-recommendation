At the top of the stairs, there's darkness
My life is not based on unhappiness
Just a life unwanted
My life has been sadly taunted
I fear the sight of darkness
'Cause I can see you in the shadow of happiness
Just a life on the border
My love has been taken from that order
My life has been arranged with sorrow
My life is cloudy today and tomorrow;
When I had love, it was nice
How could I base my entire life?
At the top of the stairs, there's darkness
My life is not based on happiness
My life has been sadly taunted
Now I fear the sight of darkness
Now I fear the shadow of loneliness
