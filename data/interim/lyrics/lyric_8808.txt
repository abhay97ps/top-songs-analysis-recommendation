If you add all the love in the world
Take away the hate and the pain
There'll still be some love left over
And that's what gives us hope
Nothing that's grown from love alone
Could ever see the bad side
They're on the right side of love
Completely
And some people live by love alone
Others live by hate
Me, I just stay in between
Cause I know
If you add all the love in the world
Take away the hate and the pain
There'll still be some love left over
There'll still be some love left over
And if you add all the times that you heal
Take away all the times that you don't
There'll still be some love left over
And that's what gives us hope
If you've got a plan for living, man
You better get things moving
Or you'll be losing your way to freedom
And some people tell the world about love
And others just say nothing
Me, I just stay in between
Cause I know
If you add all the love in the world
Take away the hate and the pain
There'll still be some love left over
There'll still be some love left over
And if you add all the times that you heal
And take away all the times that you don't
There'll still be some love left over
And that's what gives us hope
If you add all the love in the world
Take away the hate and the pain
There'll still be some love left over
