Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby
My heart's been broken so many times
That's where I begun to draw the line
But your cookin' is good, your kissin' is fine
And your lovin', baby, is right on time
Ain't no man so bad
That he cannot be bad
You got me walking, yeah 
Facing the floor
You got me knocking 
On the wrong door
You got me talking, yeah 
To myself
I'm never seen
With nobody else
Oh, breakfast in the morning, right on time 
While you teach the little baby  a nursery rhyme
I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lucky, lucky, lucky man, you better believe
'Cause ain't no man so bad
That he cannot be bad
You got me walking, yeah 
Facing the floor
You got me knocking 
On the wrong door, yeah
You got me talking, yeah 
To myself
I'm never seen
With nobody else
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You got me walking 
Feels so good 
You got me talking 
Feels so good
You got me walking, yeah 
Facing the floor 
You got me knocking 
On the wrong door 
You got me talking, yeah 
To myself
I'm never seen
With nobody else
