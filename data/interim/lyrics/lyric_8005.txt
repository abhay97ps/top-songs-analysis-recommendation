Now Roland the roadie was only a toadie who set up the lights and the mikes for the shows
And Gertrude the groupie was a rock and roll fan, who stood by the stage door in the rains and the snows
Roland the roadie met Gertrude the groupie at a rock concert back in Bayonne
He tried to seduce, said he'd introduce her to all of the Beatles and Stones
So Roland the roadie got Gertrude the groupie a seat in the balcony above
And Gertrude the groupie felt grateful and groovy but Roland the roadie felt love
And some folks loves ham hocks and some folks loves pork chops and some folks love vegetable soup
But Roland the roadie loves Gertrude the groupie, but Gertrude the groupie loves groups
She stood up and screamed as the amber spot gleamed on her heroes so skinny and tall
With their eyelids so droopy, and Gertrude the groupie and she was in love with them all
Roland the roadie told Gertrude the groupie to wait and he'd be her man
But while he dreamed of a rose covered home she was out with the group in the van
Hey Gertie, get out here, come on babe, come on out of there....I know you're in there...
The whole trailer's moving baby....What about me....Gertie... Oh Gertie
Now Roland the roadie is back on the road, his heart has been broken again
And Gertrude the groupie waits out in the cold for the very next group to come in
And some folks loves ham hocks and some folks loves pork chops and some folks loves vegetable soup
And Roland the roadie loves Gertrude the groupie, but Gertrude the groupie loves groups
....groups.....groups.....groups......
