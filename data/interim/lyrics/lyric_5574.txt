I pulled into Nazareth, I was feeling about half past dead
I just need some place where I can lay my head
Hey, mister, can you tell me where a girl might find a bed?
He just grinned and shook my hand, and "No," was all he said
Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free
Take a load off Annie, and, and, and put the weight on me
I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side
I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown
She said, "Well I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around
Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free
Take a load off Annie, and, and, and
Go down, Moses, there's nothing that you can say
It's just like all Luke waiting, waiting on Judgement Day
Well, Luke, my friend, what about Anna Lee?
He said, Do me a favor, stay an' keep Anna Lee some company
Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free
Take a load off Annie, and, and, and put the weight on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Catch me a cannon ball, now take me on down the line
My bag is sinking low, and I believe that it's about time
To get in touch with Annie, you know she's the one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone?
Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free
Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free
