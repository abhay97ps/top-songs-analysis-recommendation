I'm going down to Alphabet Street
I'm going to crown the first girl that I meet
I'm going to talk so sexy
She'll want me from my head to my feet
I'm going to drive my daddy's Thunderbird 
A white rad ride, '66  so glam it's absurd
I'm going to put her in the back seat
And drive her to Tennessee
Excuse me, baby
I don't mean to be rude
But I guess tonight I'm just not, I'm just not in the mood
So if you don't mind 
I would like to watch
We're going down, down, down, if that's the only way
To make this cruel, cruel world hear what we've got to say
Put the right letters together and make a better day
Cat, we need you to rap
Don't give to us slow
Cause we know you know
New Power Soul
Got to got to got to go!
Talk to me lover
Come on tell me what you taste
Didn't your mama tell you
Life is to good to waste? 
Didn't she tell you
That Lovesexy was the glam of them all?
If you can hang, you can trip on it
You surely won't fall 
No side effects and
The feeling last forever
Straight up - it tastes good
It makes you feel clever 
You kiss your enemies
Like you know you should
Then you jerk your body
Like a horny pony would 
You jerk your body like a horny pony would
Now run and tell your mama about that!
And while you're at it tell your papa about this!
Put your love down there when you want to get shot
Put your love down there when you want to get shot
Put your love down there when you want to get shot
Put your love down there when you want to get shot
Put your love down there
Get home, Alphabet Street
No!
L-L-L-L-Lovesexy
Yea, Oh, Alphabet Street
Yea, Oh, Alphabet Street
A B C D E F H I love you
