Jack 
Wanting someone to feel 
Sat up on the hill 
And waited all day for Jill
Jill 
Always away from home 
Never bothering to phone 
Always leavin' poor Jack alone
Now, why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
'Cause he needed love
Love he couldn't get from Jill
Why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
He needed love 
 Love he couldn't get from Jill
Jack 
Like Little Red Riding Hood 
Always tryin' to do good 
Waited as long as he could
Jill 
Is it right or wrong 
For Jack to carry on 
If you leave him home too long
Now, why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
He needed love 
 Love he couldn't get from Jill
Why do you think 
Jack snuck down the hill
He needed love 
 Love he couldn't get from Jill 
Now, why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
'Cause he needed love
 Love he couldn't get from Jill
Now, why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
He needed love
 Love he couldn't get from Jill
Now, why do you think 
Jack snuck down the hill
'Cause he needed love 
 Love he couldn't get from Jill
Now, why do you think 
Jack snuck down the hill 
He needed love 
 Love he couldn't get from Jill
Now why do you think
