You Are the One Supreme Being
Just Dressed to Kill
And Fulfill
Just Any Dream
And You Are the One Heart's Desire
All Hips and Lips
Made to Trick
Just Any Fool
I Could Have Sworn That You Were An Angel
'cause You're a Sweet, Sweet, Sweet, Divine Thing
But I Should Have Known That You Were the Devil
Dressed Like a Sweet, Sweet, Sweet, Divine Thing...
You Lack the One Thing That Is Devotion
Not Always There, in Your Hair
In a Daze
Just Too Wrapped Up In
Your Own Emotion
Your Vanity
Will Always Be
Your Greatest Thing....
Chorus
Divine Thing, Divine Thing.....
