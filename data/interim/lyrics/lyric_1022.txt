Big John, won't you come on home?
Ain't you gonna marry me?
My folks all want to know
When the wedding's gonna be
They're makin' plans, shakin' hands
I been waitin' so long
Has somethin' gone wrong?
Big John, if you don't come home
I'm gonna have to leave this place
Folks know you've jilted me
And I'll be shamed to show my face
They're makin' plans, shakin' hands
I've been waitin' so long
Has something gone wrong?
They all told me 'bout the things you do
If what they told me is true
They all said that I'd soon find out
I'm wastin' my kisses on you
I been waiting so long
Has something gone wrong?
They all told me 'bout the things you do
If what they told me is true
They all said that I'd soon find out
I'm wastin' my kisses on you
Big John, if you don't come home
I'm gonna have to leave this place
Folks know you've jilted me
And I'll be shamed to show my face
They're makin' plans, shakin' hands
I been waitin' so long
Has something gone wrong?
Been waitin' so long
Has somethin' gone wrong
