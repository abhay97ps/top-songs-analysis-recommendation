Ooohh, time is runnin' out
On this cold-hearted night, oh yeah
And the whole world seems stopped around
Without you by my side 
Oh, I realize I'm not the one you want
But understand it you're the one I need
So I'm gonna hold on as long as I can
Hold tight as I can
Hold on long as I can
Hold on tight as I can
Words don't come easy
With these teardrops in my eyes, oh my
And I, walkin' around in a stupor
Just like a helpless child, yes I am
Oh, I realize that things have changed
But the sweet, sweet memories still remain
I'm gonna hold on as long as I can 
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hold on long as I can 
Yeah, every beat of my heart
Keeps tellin' me to hold on
Mmm
Every day that we're apart is tellin' me to hold on
Oh 'cause  on it  break of dawn
I reach out to touch ya and I'm alone
I look in the mirror, my eyes are red
From crying all night long from the things you said
'Cause then I'm gonna...
Hold on as long as I can, oh yes I am!
I've got to, got to hold on as long as I can
'Cause I love ya 
I know I've got to hold long, long, long, long as I can
Oh yes I am!
