Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Up in the morning
At the crack of dawn
Just a cup of coffee to go to work on
Fight the traffic and the hustle and the bustle of the mob
Gotta hurry can't be late for my job
Gotta go at a fast pace
Gotta keep up with the rat race
Big tranquilizer gets me through the day
Work so hard for such a little pay
Just when I think I'm gonna blow my mind
The clock strikes five and I can leave it behind
Say goodbye to that work day grind
Run to you girl and unwind 
In your arms baby I can smile yeah
I can unwind
Your love makes it all worthwhile
Cozy room
Your hand in mine
Love's sweet perfume
Sweeter than wine
Everything is gonna be fine
As long as you are mine
You make my little world shine
I can unwind
Seven A. M. Comes too fast
Roll out of the bed to that alarm clock blast
Same routine work sweat tears don't relax
Worry about my bills snatch a little from my bag yeah
Gotta put up a good front
Gotta smile be polite and don't be blunt
Nerves on edge
Wound up too tight
A headache
I didn't get enough sleep last night
Just when I think I'm gonna blow my mind
The clock strikes five and I can leave it behind
Say goodbye to that work day grind
Run to you girl and unwind 
In your arms baby I can smile yeah
I can unwind
Your love makes it all worthwhile
Cozy room
Your hand in mine
Love's sweet perfume
Sweeter than wine
Everything is gonna be fine
As long as you are mine
You make my little world shine
I can unwind
Unwind
Unwind
