You look at me and all you see is muscle and bone
You sure I must be stoned
Think you're being strong
Standin' all alone
Goin' thru inspection
I can see you're lonely like me
In a world that needs affection
CHORUS
Strong enough for battle
Strong enough to survive
Strong enough to be gentle
To a hard woman soft inside
Ain't never in a hurry
Her eyes look her hungry or love denied
Whisper in your ear, chase away your fear
There's nothin' to hide
Dreams come true
When I'm making love with you
You know I'll do my best
If you want to try
Kick your legs high
And I will do the rest
CHORUS
