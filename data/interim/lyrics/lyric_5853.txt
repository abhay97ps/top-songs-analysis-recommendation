Why can't we be humble
Like the good Lord say?
He promised to exalt us
But love is the way
How men be so greedy
When there's so much left?
All things are God-given
And they all have been blessed
That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
Let not your heart be troubled
Let mourning, sobbing cease
Learn to help one another
And live in perfect peace
If we'd just be humble
Like the good Lord say, yeah
He promised to exalt us
But love is the way
That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
You better believe me
I hope you get this message
Where you won't, others will
You don't understand me
But I'll love you still
That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's the way God wants it to be
You better believe me
That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
