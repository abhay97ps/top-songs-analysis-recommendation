I likes to party
I likes to party
I likes to party
I likes to party
When you wanna party
And party, party hearty
Hold up, hold up
When you're getting down
No sense in messing around
Hold up, hold up
Talking 'bout do it, fluid
Talking 'bout do it, fluid
Talking 'bout do it, fluid
Talking 'bout do it, fluid
When you wants to move
And trying to stroke a groove
Hold up, hold up
And when you feel a ringle
And your body wants to intermingle
Hold up, hold up
If you wants to get crazy
Slow down and lazy
Hold up, hold up
If you want success
Then do the thing that's best
Hold up, hold up
If you're making shy
And like to be hip and fly
Hold up, hold up
Drugs are for fools
Love will keep you cool
Hold up, hold up
If you're making shy
And like to be hip and fly
Hold up, hold up
Drugs are for fools
Love will keep you cool
Hold up, hold up
