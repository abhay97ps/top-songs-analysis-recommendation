Venus must have heard my plea
She has sent someone along for me
I have waited a long, long time
For somebody to call mine
And at last he's come along
Baby, oh nothing can go wrong
We meet every night at eight
And I don't get home 'til late
I say to myself each day
Baby, oh long, long live love
True love must be the greatest thing
I know now why singers sing
Of the moon and stars above
How I love to be in love
We meet every night at eight
And I don't get home 'til late
I say to myself each day
Baby, oh long, long live love
Now of one thing I'm more than sure
Since love's come I don't want more
Than to kiss him every night
Makes everything all right
We meet every night at eight
And I don't get home 'til late
I say to myself each day
Baby, oh long, long live love
We meet every night at eight
And I don't get home 'til late
I say to myself each day
Baby, oh long, long live love
Long, long live love
