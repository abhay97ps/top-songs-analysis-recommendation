I'm gonna wait
Til the midnight hour
That's when my love
Comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait
Til the midnight hour
When there's no
One else around
I'm gonna take you
Girl, and hold you
And do all things I told you
In the midnight hour
Yes, I am
Oh, yes, I am
One more thing
I just wanna say
I'm gonna wait
Til the stars come out
See that twinkle
In your eyes
I'm gonna wait
Til the midnight hour
That's when my love
Begins to shine
You're the only girl I know
That really love me so
In the midnight hour
Oh, yeah, in the midnight hour
Yeah, alright
Play it for me one time now
I'm gonna wait
Til the midnight hour
That's when my love
Comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait
Til the midnight hour
That's when my love
Begins to shine
Just you and I
Oh, baby, just you and I
Nobody around baby
Just you and I
Alright, you know
I'm gonna hold you in my arm
Just you and I
Oh, yeah, in the midnight hour
Oh, baby, in the midnight hour
