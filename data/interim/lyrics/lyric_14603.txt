I know something about love
You've gotta want it bad
If that girl's got into your blood
Go out and get her
If you want her to be
The very heart of you
Make you want to breathe
Here's the thing to do
Tell her that you're never gonna leave her
Tell her that you're always gonna love her
Tell her, tell her, tell her, tell her right now
I know something about love, you gotta show it and
Make her see the moon up above
Go out and get her
If you want her to be always by your side
If you want her to only think of you
Tell her that you're never gonna leave her
Tell her that you're always gonna love her
Tell her, tell her, tell her, tell her right now
Ever since the world began, it's been that way for man
And women were created to make love their destiny
Then why should true love be so complicated
I know something about love
You gotta take her hand
Show her what the world is made of
One kiss will prove it
If you want her to be always by your side
Take her hand tonight, swallow your foolish pride
Tell her that you're never gonna leave her
Tell her that you're always gonna love her
Tell her, tell her, tell her, tell her right now
 oh, yeah
 yeah
Don't you let her go, now
 oh, yeah
 yeah
Just take her hand in yours and tell her
