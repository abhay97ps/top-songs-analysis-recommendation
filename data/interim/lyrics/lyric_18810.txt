Never thought that we would ever be more than friends
Now I'm all confused 'cause for you, I have deeper feelings
We both thought it was cool to cross the line
And I was convinced it would be alright
Now things are strange, nothing's the same
And really I just want my friend back
And my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone 
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on 
Said my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone 
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on 
I'd hate to walk away from you as if this never existed
'Cause when we kissed, the moment after, I looked at you different, yeah
Lately, I gotta watch what I say
'Cause you take things personal nowadays
You used to laugh, now you get mad
Damn, I just want my friend back
And my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone 
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on 
Said my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone 
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on 
Oh oh oh, oh oh, yeah
What happened to the one I used to know? 
The one I used to laugh and joke with?
The one I used to tell all my secrets?
We used to chill and be down for whatever, whenever together, yeah
And my mind's gone half crazy  'cause I can't leave you alone 
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me  holdin' on 
Said my mind's gone half crazy  'cause I can't leave you alone 
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on 
And my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone 
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on 
Said my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone 
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on 
Oh, oh, oh, uh
