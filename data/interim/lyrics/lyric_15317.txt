On a search, on a quest
For the one, for the best
Heavy days, heavy nights
I got you in my sight
I want you, you want me
To love you forever
Hold it together
And I want you to know that
Girl, sure lookin' good to me
Girl, sure lookin' good
Girl, sure lookin' good to me
Girl, sure lookin' good
You defy, you possess
Wounded hearts of the best
But if I surrender to your demands
Would it change circumstance?
I want you, you want me
To love you forever
Hold it together
And I want you to know
It's you for me, me for you
Forever and ever
Ah, any weather
And I want you to know that
Girl, sure lookin' good to me
Girl, sure lookin' good
Girl, sure lookin' good to me
Girl, sure lookin' good
Anything your heart desires
I will provide to you gladly
All you ever need and all you ever want
Is everlasting
Girl, sure lookin' good to me
Girl, sure lookin' good
Girl, sure lookin' good to me
Girl, sure lookin' good
