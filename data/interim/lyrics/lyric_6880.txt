The sun comes up
The moon goes down
A new day's on it's way
The stars in the sky
Are waving goodbye
And morning's here
Bringing in the day
Then the kids start to shout
Mother and Father, get up
And here's the sun
Light sings
All over the world
Light sings
All over the world
Light sings
All over the world
Light sings
All over the world
Light sings
The night is gone
The light has come
A new day has begun
The weather is clear
And people are here
And morning's here
Calling everyone
Then the kids start to shout
Brothers and sisters, come out
Into the sun
Light sings
All over the world
Light sings
All over the world
Light sings 
All over the world
 light sings
All over the world
Light sings 
 light sings
Light sings
All over the world
Light sings 
All over the world
Light sings
All over the world
Light sings 
All over the world
Light sings
Light sings 
Light sings
All over the world
Light sings
All over the world
Light sings
All over the world
Light sings 
All over the world
