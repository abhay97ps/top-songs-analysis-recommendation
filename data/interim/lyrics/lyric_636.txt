I punched my buddy
In the nose after lunch
Now I'm in trouble
'Cause the dean saw the punch
He was tellin' things
That were not true about her
So I let him have it
In the cafeteria
Now I'm stayin' in
Stayin' in
While my baby's walkin'
Home with him
They passed my window
Hand in hand just then
But what can I do
'Cause I'm stayin' in
If she just knew
What that son of a gun said
I know she wouldn't
Be caught with him dead
She don't know
What he has got up his sleeve
But she would find out
If I could only leave
But I'm stayin' in
Stayin' in
While my baby's walkin'
Home with him
I did it then
And I'd do it again
I love her so
But I'm stayin' in
