She's got an alligator bag
Top hat to match
Dressed in black on black
She's got a Filipino girlie
She claims is her friend
I tell you boys, you just gotta laugh
Now I used to call her Cindy
She changed her name to "Sin"
I guess that's the name of her game
Yeah, I really used to love her
Then, the kitty she discovered
It's got to be a sexual thing
Now all around the world
Girls will be girls
It's the same old, same old situation
It's the same old, same old ball and chain
I say no, no, no
No, no, no
Introduced me to her lover
In a cellophane dress
Then they bid me a sweet farewell
Last time I saw them
They were kissing so softly
To the sound of wedding bells
Well, all around the world
Girls will be girls
It's the same old, same old situation
It's the same old, same old ball and chain
It's the same old, same old situation
It's the same old, same old ball and chain
I say no, no, no
No, no, no
It's the same old, same old situation
It's the same old, same old ball and chain
Girl, it's the same old, same old situation
It's the same old, same old ball and chain
You know we just gotta say
All around the world
Girls will be girls
It's the same old, same old situation
It's the same old, same old ball and chain
I tell you girl, it's the same old, same old situation
It's the same old, same old ball and chain, yeah
Yeah, no-no
Yeah, yeah
No, no
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
