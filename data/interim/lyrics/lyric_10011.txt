I'm singin' to the world, it's time we let the spirit come in
Let it come on in
I'm singin' to the world, everybody's caught in the spin
Look at where we've been
We've been runnin' around, year after year
Blinded with pride, blinded with fear
But it's daybreak, if you wanna believe
It can be daybreak, ain't no time to grieve
Said it's daybreak if you'll only believe
And let it shine, shine, shine
All around the world
Singin' to the world, what's the point in puttin' it down?
There's so much love to share
I'm singin' to the world, don't you see it all comes around?
The feeling's everywhere
We've been closin' our eyes, day after day
Covered in clouds, losin' our way
Hey, but it's daybreak
If you wanna believe, it can be daybreak
Ain't no time to grieve
Said it's daybreak, if you'll only believe
And let it shine, shine, shine
All around the world
Yes, and it's daybreak
If you wanna believe, it can be daybreak
Ain't no time to grieve
Said it's daybreak, if you'll only believe
And let it shine, shine, shine
All around the world
Let it shine, shine, shine
All around the world
Yes, and it's daybreak
If you wanna believe, it can be daybreak
Ain't no time to grieve
Said it's daybreak, if you'll only believe
And let it shine, shine, shine
All around the world
C'mon and let it shine, shine, shine
All around the world
