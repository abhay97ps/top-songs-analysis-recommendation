People say I'm crazy, just a fool
But I'm the pigeon and baby, you're the stool
I always dug the color your hair
I always loved the clothes you wear
I can't say that you turn me on
But why'd I stay all night long
Take it easy - on yourself
Take it easy - there ain't no one else
Don't give me reasons
And I won't ask for nothin'
Rich girls, they run after me
They break my heart, you know I fall in love so easily
I always dug the color your hair
I always loved the clothes you wear
I can't say that you turn me on
But why'd I stay all night long
Take it easy - on yourself
Take it easy - there ain't no one else
Don't give me reasons
And I won't ask for nothin'
Take it easy - on yourself
Take it easy - there ain't no one else
Don't give me reasons
And I won't ask for nothin'
Yeah!
Take it easy - on yourself
Take it easy - there ain't no one else
Don't give me reasons
And I won't ask for nothin'
