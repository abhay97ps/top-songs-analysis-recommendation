No one hurt my fragile little mind right now
It´s tangled up, and don´t you know
The pussycat in me is curling up right now
But I´ll bloom
From the inside out
But right now there´s dust on my guitar
You fuck
And it´s all your fault
Oh, you paralyze my mind and for that you suck oh...
Freedom´s on my list today and I´m
Feeling pissed
But my timeless thoughts and ageless mind
Won´t let you get away 
And your guilty little coincence
Won´t either
But right now there´s dust on my guitar
You fuck
And it´s all your fault
Oh, you paralyze my mind and for that you suck oh...
We all take risk´s we all fall hard
But you, you went too far
And I´m too plush for your pathedic digs
And you´re the only one, you´ll scar
But right now there´s dust on my guitar
You fuck
And it´s all your fault
Oh you paralyze my mind
And for that you suck
And for that you suck oh....
Aho aho aho
Ha ha ha
