Love is the ritual
Little sister
She got a lot of time she got a lot of money
Don't you know that ain't enough?
Pretty thing
All dressed up for the main attraction
Like a baby doll looking for love
And she doesn't need a reason
She just hears a calling to the wild
God gave man the breath of life
To grow up strong to take a wife
To change the world and love is the ritual
You learn to walk & talk & laugh & cry
Work your fingers to the bone til the day you die
And above it all love is the ritual 
Naaa, na, na, na. Naaa, na, na, na. Naaa, na
Little man
Beating his chest & flexing his muscles
Gun for hire, he shoots for a star
Like a handsome prince
Walking down the street in his shining armor
Romeo in search of his heart
There's a method to this madness
And a message calling to the wild
God gave man the breath of life
To grow up strong to take a wife
To change the world and love is the ritual
You learn to walk and talk and laugh and cry
Give your heart and soul til the day you die
And above it all love is the ritual 
Come on dance, little sister
Little sister wants to dance
All night looking for a true romance
When in a black leather jacket walks little brother
To rock her world, to be her lover
So, signal all the children
Send a message calling to the wild
God gave man the breath of life
To grow up strong to take a wife
To change the world and love is the ritual
So you walk & talk & laugh & cry
Work your fingers to the bone til the day you die
And above it all love is the ritual 
Love is the ritual
Love is the ritual
Love is the ritual
Love is the ritual
