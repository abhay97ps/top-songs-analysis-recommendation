Sit by my side
Come as close as the air
Share in a memory of gray
And wander in my words
Dream about the pictures
That I paint of changes
Green leaves of summer
Turn red in the fall
To brown and to yellow
They fade
And then they have to die
Trapped within the circle time
Parade of changes
Scenes of my young years
Are warm in my mind
Visions of shadows that shine
Till one day I returned
And found they were the victims
Of the vines of changes
The world's spinning madly
It drifts in the dark
Swings through a hollow of haze
A race around the stars
A journey through the universe ablaze
With changes
Your tears will be trembling
Now we're somewhere else
One last cup of wine, we will pour
And I'll kiss you one more time
And leave you on the rolling
River shores of changes
I'll kiss you one more time
And leave you on the rolling river shores
Of changes
