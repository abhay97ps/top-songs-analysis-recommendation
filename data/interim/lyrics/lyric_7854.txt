What's the use in a pocket full of miracles
You gotta find them on rainy day
I believe in the power of the universe
Like a river gonna take you today
Come down, come down, come down
Come down the river with me
Come on down to the river road
It gonna take you away
It gonna ease your load
The river road, baby
You're my river road baby, for free
Back to back, it's only just beginning
Lord it feels so good
Gonna take ya today
He got his lady and she's sitting on a bull frog
Watching all the fishes just swimmin' away
Come down, come down, come down
Come down the river with me
Come on down to the river road
It gonna take you away
It gonna ease your load
The river road, baby
You're my river road baby, for free
Back to back, it's only just beginning
Lord it feels so good
Gonna take ya today
He got his lady and she's sitting on a bull frog
Watching all the fishes just swimmin' away
Come down, come down, come down
Come down the river with me
Come on down to the river road
It gonna take you away
It gonna ease your load
The river road, baby
You're my river road baby, for free
River road
River road
River road
River road
