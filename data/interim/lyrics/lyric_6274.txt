You broke my heart when you went away
But I knew that you would come back some day
You broke my heart when you went away
But I knew that you would come back some day
I always warned you when you were untrue
I told you some day you will want me to want you
Now you have your heartaches
Yvonne, you're paying for your mistakes
Who's sorry now? Who's sorry now?
Whose heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Go back to those who shared your caress
Who laugh last going to laugh the best
Your charms have faded and your beauty is gone
Here you stand bеfore me sick and forlorn
The mеn you leave me for forsake you and gone
Now you come back on my shoulder to cry on
In days gone by you were my very life
You thought you were too good to be my wife
There is no sense in shedding tears
Where were you when I was crying all them years?
You're sad and blue, and you're crying too
Yeah, just like I cried over you
You thought the world was running away
Never thought you'd be needing my help today
Every night you used to date a different boy
Going here, going there, spreading joy
They used to watch at me and laugh and make fun
What happen to you and them now, Yvonne?
Brook Benton say it's just a matter of time
Old people say time longer than twine
It wasn't Bobby Darin song you hear
When they leave you, you wouldn't know I'll be there
Just like a friend, yeah yeah, right to the end
I tried to warn you somehow
But you always had your bad intention
You forget there's a thing called retribution
Wepsee mama!
You had so many men and what did you gain?
Nothing but a lot of sorrow and pain
We all make mistakes that we regret
So I'll forgive you now and try to forget
You gave me tears for my souvenir
You left my heart in bitter misery
There is nothing more I can do
But say "I'm sorry, I'm glad that you're sorry too!"
You had your way, now you gonna pay
I'm glad that you're sorry - one more time!
Come on, follow!
You had your way, now you must pay
I'm glad that you're sorry now
