You're asking me to
Understand your feelings
To just forget about my own
And let you go
Darling, I won't raise a hand to stop you
Just let me say one thing before you go
Come to me whenever you get lonely
Just reach out your hand and there I'll be
My love will light your way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love, come to me
I believe that time alone will change you
The changing tides will bring you back to me
And when you grow tired of chasing rainbows
Just make a wish for love and there I'll be
Come to me whenever you get lonely
Just reach out your hand and there I'll be
Oh, my love will light your way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love, come to me
Come to me whenever you get lonely
Just reach out your hand and there I'll be
My love will light your way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love, come to me, sweet baby
Come to me whenever you get lonely
Just reach out your hand and there I'll be
My love will light your way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love, come to me
Come to me whenever you get lonely
Just reach out your hand and there I'll be
My love will light your way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love, come to me, yeah
