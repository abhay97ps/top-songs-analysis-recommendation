Their heads are up
The chests are out
Their arms are swinging
Now sound off!
Sound off!
Fellas now
Innie-minnie miney-mo
Let's go work and 
You had a good home but ya left
And you wanna go home but you can't
You think the girl that you left
Is she waitin' for you but she ain't
Ain't no use in goin' home
Alan's got your girl alone
Ain't no use in feelin' blue
Alan's got your sister too
