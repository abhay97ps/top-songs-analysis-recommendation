If you're living in a glasshouse 
Don't throw no stones
If you're living in a glasshouse 
Don't throw no stones
We're all made with feet of clay and some grease
We're born alone and we die alone
Why can't we live in-between?
I don't care what goes on in your house when you close your door
If you stop lookin' in my bedroom window, I'll stop lookin' in yours
My girl came home and she caught me with Alice
And she threw me out the door, nah, nah, nah
But the real reason that she was so mad
Is that she was with Alice before 
If you're living in a glasshouse 
Don'tcha throw no stones 
If you're living in a glasshouse 
Don'tcha throw no stones
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Woo, ooh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Woo, ooh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, I ain't no fool
Sweet-talkin', bar-hoppin', pill-poppin', wife-swappin'
Swappin', swappin', swappin'
Sweet-talkin', bar-hoppin', pill-poppin', wife-swappin'
Swappin', swappin', swappin'
If you're living in a glasshouse
Don't throw no stones
If you're living in a glasshouse
Don't throw no stones
If you're living in a glasshouse
Don't throw no stones
Sweet-talkin', bar-hoppin', pill-poppin', wife-swappin'
Swappin', swappin', swappin'
Sweet-talkin', bar-hoppin', pill-poppin', wife-swappin'
Swappin', swappin', swappin'
Hey, hey...I gotta say it again, I gotta say it again
If you're living in a glasshouse
