You look at me
And baby all you see
Are my blue eyes
I'm not a man
Baby, all I am
Is what I symbolize
Brown eyed woman
Brown eyed woman
Brown eyed woman
I could love you so
I could love you so
Brown eyed woman
I could love you so
All of the years
All the hate and the fears
Have twisted your heart
Now, you turn away
You won't trust what I say
And it's tearing me apart
Brown eyed woman
Brown eyed woman
Brown eyed woman
I could love you so
I could love you so
I'm holding out my hand to you
Darling, tell me, tell me please
What more can I do
Brown eyed woman
Brown eyed woman
I want you, I need you
I'm holding out my hand
I don't wanna' stay away
No, no
