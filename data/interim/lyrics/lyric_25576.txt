Did I really just forget that melody?
Naw, nana, bananana, nanananananana 
Alright, dada, dadadada
When I popped off then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
Amex, no cap, eight hundred score
They wonder how 
I rap my lyrics when I perform
They wonder how 
Married to the grind, I brought my ring
I'm corny, but your girly want the dick
Modest with my jewels, but check the bank
Finally got the money, say my thanks
When I popped off then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
Haha, I'm at the bank again
They wonder how 
Pink whip with flames all on the side
They wonder how 
Got that Gucci on my body, now she tryna pipe me, woo
Popped a Lucy, loosey-goosey, sussy boy, I keep you cool
Got the paper, went to school
Be careful who you callin' fool, ayy, ha, ayy
When I popped off then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
