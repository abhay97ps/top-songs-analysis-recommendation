If you were falling
Then I would catch you
You need a light
I'd find a match
Cause I love the way you say good morning
And you take me the way I am
If you are chilly
Here, take my sweater
Your head is aching
I'll make it better
Cause I love the way you call me baby
And you take me the way I am
I'd buy you Rogaine
When you start losing all your hair
Sew on patches
To all you tear
Cause I love you more than I could ever promise
And you take me the way I am
You take me the way I am
You take me the way I am
