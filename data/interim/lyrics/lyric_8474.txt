Oh, America your countryside is pretty
And America your cityside is nice
But America it's not your farms or freeways
It's the way you grow your sweet sugar and spice
American girls, American girls
 you know that I love you
 you know that I want you
 I've got to have you
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Oh America I love your Hollywood movies
And America Broadway opening nights are nice
But America it's not because of John Wayne
It's the way you grow your sugar and spice
American girls, American girls
 you know that I love you
 you know that I want you
 I've got to have you
Oh American girls
I've been to New York, Boston, L.A. & Chicago
From Hawaii sun to cold Alaska night
But America I don't have to look to far
'Cos everywhere's your sweet sugar and spice
American girls, American girls
 you know that I love you
 you know that I want you
 I've got to have you
Oh American girls
Yeah American girls
Oh American girls
