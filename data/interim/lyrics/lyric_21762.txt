If I could hock my love, could I trade
For your wings to cover me, unless I fall?
Half aligned, I heard the most brilliant lie
To sleep these eyes, closed the light
And lets the mind wide open
You can't stutter when you're talking with your eyes
By cutting out your tongue, you save face
Or feeding on the blood that's running from a black day
Cry on black rain
Cry on black rain
Cry on black rain
Cry on black rain
If I could hock my love, could I trade
For your wings to cover me, unless I fall?
To sleep these eyes, closed the light
And gets the mind wide open
You can't stutter when you're talking with your eyes
By cutting out your tongue to save face
Or feeding on the blood that's running from a black day
Cry on black rain
Cry on black rain
Cry on, cry on black rain
Black rain 
Black rain 
You can't stutter when you're talking with your eyes
By cutting out your tongue, you save face
Or feeding on the blood that's running from a black day
