All day I face a barren waste
Without the taste of water
Cool water 
Old Dan and I, with throats burned dry
An' souls that cry for water 
Cool 
Clear 
Water 
A-keep a-movin, Dan 
Don't you listen to him, Dan 
He's the devil not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water 
Dan, can't you see that big green tree 
Where the water's runnin' free 
And it's waitin' there for me and you
Cool clear water 
Shadows sway and seem to say
Tonight we pray for water
Cool water 
And way up there he'll hear our prayer
And show us where there's water 
Cool 
Clear 
Water 
A-keep a-movin, Dan 
Don't you listen to him, Dan 
He's the devil not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water 
Dan, can't you see that big green tree 
Where the water's runnin' free 
And it's waitin' there for me and you
Cool clear water 
Cool clear water
