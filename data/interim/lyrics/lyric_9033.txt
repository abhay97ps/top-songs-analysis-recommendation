Love is a rose, but you'd better not pick it
Only grows when it's on the vine
Handful of thorns and you know you've missed it
Lose your love when you say the word mine
I wanna see what's never been seen
I wanna live that age old dream
C'mon boy, let's go together
Let's take the best, right now
Take the best right now
Love is a rose, but you'd better not pick it
Only grows when it's on the vine
Handful of thorns and you know you've missed it
Lose your love when you say the word mine
I wanna go to an old hoe-down
Long ago in the western town
Pick me up cause my feet are draggin
Gimme a lift and I'll paint your wagon
Love is a rose, but you'd better not pick it
Only grows when it's on the vine
Handful of thorns and you know you've missed it
Lose your love when you say the word mine
Love is a rose, but you'd better not pick it
Only grows when it's on the vine
Handful of thorns and you know you've missed it
Lose your love when you say the word mine
Mine
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
