Hit me
All the chronic in the world couldn't even mess with you
You're the ultimate high
You know what I'm saying, baby?
Now check this out
Take my money
My house and my cars
For one hit of you
You can have it all, baby baby
'Cause makin' love
Every time we do
Girl, it's worse than drugs
'Cause I'm an addict of you
And you know that I...

You got me feenin'
Feenin', you got me feenin', feenin'

You got me feenin'
Girl, I'm feenin' for you

It's all blown on you, baby
Girl, I'm so strung out
All I do is wish for you
So tomorrow if you're not here
Then girl I'm down
So I need you near
I just wanna make it through the night
So hold me tight
Then girl I'm alright
I can't leave you alone
You got me feenin'
Feenin', you got me feenin', feenin'
I can't leave you alone
You got me feenin'
Girl, I'm feenin' for you
Lady, I'm hooked on you 
There's nothing else I'd rather do 
Spend my last dime 
For a drop of your time 
Surely, girl, without a doubt 
You know you got me strung out
And I need you more
And more
'Cause you are my joy
You got me feenin'
I can't leave you alone
