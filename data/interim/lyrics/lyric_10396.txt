Stare up at me, momma, like ya used to
Weather's kind of cold but I don't care
Fatten up that ol' Rhode Island rooster
It's gettin' to feel like fall at the county fair
Well, there's a Jaybird flyin' home to Mobile
Sleepin' in your cornfield for a while
Seems he just backed into a square meal
And he's in for the night
So fine, yellow moon reflectin'
Through the frost along the window pane
Well, I'm a shootin' star in the wrong direction
Hey, I love you, momma, but I just can't seem to change
And like that Jaybird flyin' home to Mobile
Sleepin' in your cornfield for a while
Seems I just backed into a square meal
And I'm in for the night
And if I was one for speculatin'
I suspect I might be back around
Well, you might find me riding on a breeze a-blowin'
Northern bound
Hey, like that Jaybird flyin' home to Mobile
Sleepin' in your cornfield for a while
Seems I just backed into a square meal
And I'm in for the night
