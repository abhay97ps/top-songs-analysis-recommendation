Damn right, we take turns bein' grown
I get real accountable when I'm alone
I get real about it all when I'm alone
It's so crazy missin' you when I get on
Don Julio made me a fool for you
And now I might hit your phone up with that ra-ra-ra
Missin' my da-da-da, missin' that ah-ah-ah 
All of this love is toxic
All of this love is toxic
All these kisses and hugs is knock shit
You a damn drug, you're toxic
Uh, all the sex on replay
Run it back like a DJ
Surfin' on your face while you eat that
Tryna make a bad bitch behave, no
I was this way for you
Put the pussy away for you
Thinkin' I would wait for you
And that damn Don Julio made me a fool for you
And now I might hit your phone up with that ra-ra-ra
Missin' my da-da-da, missin' that ah-ah-ah 
And all of this love is toxic
All of this love is toxic
All these kisses and hugs is knock shit
You a damn drug, you're toxic
Problematic 
You know that dick always been problematic 
Somehow, I'm always caught in your dramatics
All in your acrobatics
You know I want the static
Tell me to throw it backwards, uh 
And that damn Don Julio made me a fool for you
And I still hit your phone up with that ra-ra-ra
Missin' my da-da-da, missin' that ah-ah-ah 
All of this love is toxic
All of this love is toxic
All these kisses and hugs is knock shit 
You a damn drug, you're toxic
