Livin is dyin
Cause love youve left me cryin
Now theres no use tryin to go on
Each night I dream baby, pretendin
Therell be a happy endin
Burnin down deep inside
Got a heartbreak that I can't hide
Im not the proud one, I need you
Im beggin to you baby, please
Youre the proud one, believe me
This poor man is down on his knees
Baby, please
Oh baby, remember
The love we shared so tender
Hoping that forever youd me mine
I wish you could hear me, oh baby
If only you were near me
I didn't know what I had
Dont ya know that I feel so bad
