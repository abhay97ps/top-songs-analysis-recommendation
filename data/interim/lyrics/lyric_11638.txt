Finders not keepers
And all that's left is just reminders
Love in pieces
The debris and the dust of memories
That linger so long
The heartaches that keep hanging on
Just wondering where it all went wrong
And whether I can start anew
Oh, but I could never miss you more than I do
Loving you like this
Oh, I could never miss you more than I do
Loving you like this
Oh, I could never miss you more than I do
Beggars can't be choosers
And I've had my share of backing nothing but losers
But if I searched the whole world over from pillar to post
Your the one that I need the most
If I combed this land from coast to coast
Who would take the place of you
'Cause I could never miss you more than I do
Loving you like this
Oh, I could never miss you more than I do
Loving you like this
Oh, I could never miss you more than I do
I couldn't love you any better
I couldn't love you any more
'Cause I spend each and every second
Each and every hour hoping you'll be at my door
Loving you like this
Oh, I could never miss you more than I do
Loving you like this
Oh, I could never miss you more than I do
Loving you like this
Oh, I could never miss you more than I do
Loving you like this
Oh, I could never miss you more than I do
