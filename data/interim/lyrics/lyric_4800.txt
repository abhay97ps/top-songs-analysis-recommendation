You and I
Travel to the beat of a different drum
Oh, can't you tell by the way I run
Every time you make eyes at me
Woh oh
You cry and moan and say
It will work out
But honey child I've got my doubts
You can't see the forest for the trees
Oh don't get me wrong
It's not that I knock it
It's just that I
Am not in the market
For a boy who wants
To love only me
Yes, and I ain't sayin'
You ain't pretty
All I'm saying, I'm not ready
For any person, place or thing
To try and pull the reins
In on me
So, goodbye
I'll be leaving
I see no sense
In this cryin' and grievin'
We'll both live a lot longer
If you live without me
Oh don't get me wrong
It's not that I knock it
It's just that I
Am not in the market
For a boy who wants to love only me
Yes, and I ain't sayin'
You ain't pretty
All I'm sayin', I'm not ready
For any person, place or thing
To try and pull the reins
In on me
So, goodbye I'll be leavin'
I see no sense in this cryin' and grievin'
We'll both live a lot longer
If you live without me
