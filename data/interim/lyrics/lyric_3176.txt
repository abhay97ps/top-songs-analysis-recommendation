We've been goin' steady now for such a long time
And up until now, everything was just fine
You say you still love me but it's not the same
It's so plain to see that you're playin' a game
You really know how to hurt a guy
You really know how to make me cry
You really know how to hurt a guy
But what a mean way to say goodbye
Every time you hurt me, it seems like you planned it 
I've talked to your friends but they don't understand it 
Where did we lose it? What did I do wrong?
We can't break it up now, it's lasted so long
You really know how to hurt a guy
You really know how to make me cry
You really know how to hurt a guy
But what a cruel way to say goodbye
If you look at me, you'll see tears in my eyes
When we're together and you're lookin' at other guys 
The ones that you like are really not your kind
I know their type and what's on their mind
You really know how to hurt a guy
You really know how to make me cry
You really know how to hurt a guy
But what a mean way to say goodbye
You really know how to hurt a guy
You really know how to make me cry
You really know how to hurt a guy
But what a cruel way to say goodbye
You really know how to hurt a guy
You really know how to make me cry
You really know how to hurt a guy
But what a mean way to say goodbye
