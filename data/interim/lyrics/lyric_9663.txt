When love is new
Every day is a new sensation
When love is new
You thrill with infatuation
Oh, ho, ho
When love is born
It's so warm, so soft
And, oh, so tender
Everybody's willing to surrender
When love is new
When love is new
Don't let our love grow cold
'Cause funny things happen
When that love gets cold
So let's me and you make a pact
A promise to each other
For as long as we live
Long as we love, let's always
Always keep our love brand new
'Cause love is so wonderful
When love is new
I said when love is new
Whoa, ho, ho, oh
When love is born
It's so warm, so soft
And, oh, so tender
Everybody's willing to surrender
When love is new
When love is new
It's so wonderful
When love is new
Al we need is each other
To keep our love brand new
It's so warm, soft
Sweet and so tender
It's so soft, so sweet
And, oh, so tender
When love is new
It's so good to you, baby
It makes you feel brand new
When love is new
