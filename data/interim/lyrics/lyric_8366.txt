If I was a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?
If a tinker was my trade
Would you tinker with me?
Would you keep the vows we made
Followin' behind me?
And if I was Jesus
And I built some crosses
Could you see the future?
Could stand the losses
Of lovin' a carpenter
And being a lady
And takin' a chance on me
Just to be my baby?
Save my love through loneliness
Save my love through sorrow, yes
I'll give you my onliness
If you just give me tomorrow
If I was a rock star
Would you be my groupie?
Would you make sweet love to me?
Come to California?
Well, I might go crazy
I have to warn ya
Well, I get so mean sometimes
When the spirit's on me
That I think I'm Jesus
Out buildin' crosses
Could ya see the future?
Could ya stand the losses?
Of lovin' a carpenter
And being a lady
And takin' a chance on me
Just to be my baby?
Save my love through loneliness
Save my love through sorrow, yeah
I'll give you my onliness
If you'd only give me tomorrow
And if I was Jesus
And I built some crosses
Could you see the future?
Could stand the losses
Of lovin' a carpenter
And being a lady?
Would ya take a chance on me?
Would ya be my baby?
Come take a chance on me
Won't you come away with me
Come take a chance on me
Won't you be my baby?
Won't ya take a chance on me?
Won't ya be my baby?
Won't ya take a chance on me?
Won't ya be my... Ohh, be my... Ohhh
... Be my... Ohhh...
