To make you laugh I'd play the fool for you
Although the people turn and stare
I'd give my everything to keep you boy
It breaks my heart when you're not there
I'll stage a ballet on a table top
Command performance finger size
Though I ain't got no tune my show won't flop
'Cause I'll find the music in your eyes
Oh me oh my
I'm a fool for you baby
Oh me oh my
When I'm crazy, said I'm crazy
Oh me oh my
I'm a fool for you baby
Let your love light shine on me
We'll blow a genie from a cigarette
We'll take a magic carpet ride
We'll tell our smoky friend now don't forget
You must keep us side by side
Oh me oh my
I'm a fool for you baby
Oh me oh my
When I'm crazy, yes I'm crazy crazy
Oh me oh my
I'm a fool for you baby
Just let your love light shine on me
Listen to me, baby
Oh me oh my
I'm a fool for you baby
Oh me oh my, said I'm crazy, crazy
