There's been a hundred if there's been one, whoa, oh
And theve all been nice for a while, uh huh, yea
But then one day, i call on you
And i got to let ya know
That there's a feeling inside that i can't explain
But id like to let it go
Cause ive never had a love like this
No i never had a love like this
And i can't explain the way it feels but it feels right, yea
Infatuatuion usually wears off soon, whoa
And then you split and go on your way, yea
But this has been going on for too long
To be just another fling
And i could wait between two nighters to say that i dont care
But that doesnt really mean a thing
Cause ive never had a love like this
No i never had a love like this
And i can't explain the way it feels but it feels right, yea
No i never had a love like this
No i never had a love like this
And i can't epxlain the way it feels but it fels right yea
I tried to make a love work out, yea
Well i guess it wasn't supposed to happen thwen
Or i didn't find out how
Or the feelings werent just broken in
Well i know were working now
Cause ive never had a love like this
No i never had a love like this
And i can't explain the way it feels but it feels right, yea
No i never had a love like this
No i never had a love like this
And i can't epxlain the way it feels but it feels right, yea
