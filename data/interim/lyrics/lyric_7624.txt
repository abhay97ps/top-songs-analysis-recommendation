Don't deny your people
One more chance
Give tomorrow's children
One more chance
All they want is freedom
Just one more chance
To show that they can make a good living with one
Just one more chance
We are gonna give you
One more chance
Show your face and give us maybe
Just one more chance
If you're really living
In a mansion up above
Send a sign that you're really here
And then send us down some love
Don't deny your people
One more chance
Give tomorrow's children
One more chance
All they want is freedom
Just one more chance
To show that they can make a good living with one
Just one more chance
Now I don't need the answer
It's written everywhere
Seems that man upstairs
Well he don't really care
If you believe the stories
I tell you friend that's fine
But you don't get my hallelujah
Until I see the signs
Hear me now
Don't deny your people
Just one more chance
Give tomorrow's children
Just one more chance
All they want is freedom
Just one more chance
To show that they can make a good living with one
Just one more chance
Don't deny your people
One more chance
Give tomorrow's children
One more chance
Don't deny your people
One more chance
Give tomorrow's children
One more chance
