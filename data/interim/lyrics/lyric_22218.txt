Mami you looking like I'm just another guy
That came to check you, that came to wreck you
No disrespect, but mami, that's correct 'cause
What's in them jeans just got my mind hectic
I can see that you're feeling my fashion
Is it 'cause I'm flashing? Or is it this cash that's just
Way too reckless? Or is it this necklace?
Wait, let me interrupt myself with this message, see...
I don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved
I just want a quickie
No bite marks, no scratches, and no hickies
If you can get with that, mami come get with me
I don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved
I just want a quick fix
Up in your mix, miss, send me you wishlist
I have you addicted, so mami come hit this
Mami I realize that I'm mannish
I speak a language of love like Spanish
"Quero fugir"
I'm so obscene, know what I mean?
Yeah, sorry that was Portuguese
That I speak with easeâ€”please 
Get on them knees
I got a penny for your thoughts if you know what I mean, but...
I don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved
I just want a quickie
No bite marks, no scratches, and no hickeys
If you can get with that, mami come get with me
I don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved
I just want a quick fix
Up in your mix, miss, send me your wishlist
I have you addicted, so mami come hit this
Don't be offended, babe, by what I say
It's just a game, and how I play
Pillage and plunder, call me your plumber
Knock on this wood, get rocked by this thunder
Don't be offended, babe, by what I say
It's just a game, and how I play
Pillage and plunder, call me your plumber
Knock on this wood, get rocked by this thunder
I don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved
I just want a quickie
No bite marks, no scratches, and no hickies
