I'm back on the street
Baby, I'm downbeat
You know it's you I see
In every girl I meet
I'm giving you up
And it's getting me down
Everybody's talk, talking at me
It's all the same sound
I hang up the phone
I go out alone
There's nothing left to say
Love's a heartache away
When I lost you, baby
I lost it all
They say in love and romance
We all take a fall
Go to places we'd go
And talk to people we know
I'll get over you someday
Love's just a heartache away
I hang up the phone
I go out alone
Nothing left to say
Baby, love's just a heartache away
I hang up the phone
I go out alone
There's nothing left to say
Baby, love's just a heartache
A heartache away
I'm giving you up
And it's getting me down
Everybody's talk, talking at me
It's all the same damn sound
I hang up the phone
I go out alone
There's nothing left to say
Baby, love's just a heartache away
Hang up the phone
I go out alone
There's nothing left to say
Baby, love's just a heartache
A heartache away
Love's a heartache away
It's just a heart ache away
Love's a heartache away
