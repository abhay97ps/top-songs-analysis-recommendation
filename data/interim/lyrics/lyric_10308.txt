You're talking to me from the back of the car
And I can't get nothing right
And then you wonder why I stand at the bar day and night
I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No no no no no no
I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No no no no no no
You stand behind me with a watch in your hand
And I can't get nothing done
Well people tell me you're a punctual man, but come on
Come on
I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No no no no no no
I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No no no no no no
I earn the money and you take it away
When I don't know where you're from
I should be worried but they say it'll pay for a bomb
Oh, I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No no no no no no
I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Hey, I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No, no, no
I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No, no, no, no, no, no
Baby you know sometimes you get a little weary
But if it ever happens honey, you just come along to me
Because you know
I-I-I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No, no, no, no, no
I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No, no, no, no
I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I can't put up with any more, no baby
I've had enough
