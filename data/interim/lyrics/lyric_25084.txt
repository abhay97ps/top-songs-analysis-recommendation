Who's that creeping through my window?
'Fore you come outside, I got the M4
Took her to the endzone from the Enzo
Know I love to smoke, you love the liq more
Wanna hit the Jack, then what you call for?
All that out-your-name shit, that ain't called for, mm
Who that creepin'? Know the tint is dark 
All that fall-in-love shit, gotta Kevin Hart 
All that speed and fly shit, we might teleport, yeah 
All that cop harass shit, I might clip a sarge, yeah 
Keep bouncin' that ass, you just might get award, yeah
If she bad, she get a pass into the tour 
I pick through the family, grab the bad sister like Janet
Opps outside, don't panic, gotta switch, gotta change up transit
Still jump around, move antsy, and I still don't like shit fancy
Up late feelin' real chancy, they outside really tryna end me, yeah
Who's that creeping through my window? 
'Fore you come outside, I got the M4

All that out-your-name shit, that ain't called for 
Who the fuck is this?
Met somebody baby mama inside of the VIP, while I'm tryna tip
Shawty said she holding, got a razor in her lip
Mix my cup and twist one up, I love that ratchet shit
She like, iced out wrists, iced out-iced out wrists 
Fuck don't kiss, fuck, she fuck don't kiss 
Look like friends but she say they twins 
Jump right in, there's legroom in this Benz 
Ten miles to the crib, you know that's deep 
I think it's someone out there watching me, yeah
