You come home with lipstick
Stains all over your face
Tell me no lies
'cause your friends been calling
Seems you've been out on a date
What good is home
If you can't be true to me
One who's been giving your love
When times get rough
Then you say you need me
I gonna fix ya
I'll never do it your way
Once you hit the road, oh baby
There ain't no, ain't no turning back
Baby, there ain't no, ain't no turning back
So it's goodbye, and I'll see you later
There's nothing for you to say
Give up! Don't hang around
Now that love is over
'Cause you've been wasting my time
How could it last
When your heart don't need the
Iove that you needed before
I feel so bad
'cause I'm not the someone
All of your time has been for
Is she giving you more?
Once you hit the road, oh baby
There ain't no, ain't no turning back
Baby, there ain't no, ain't no turning back
Once you hit the road, oh baby
There ain't no, ain't no turning back
No, baby, there ain't no, ain't no turning back
Once you hit the road, oh baby
There ain't no, ain't no turning back
No, baby, there ain't no, ain't no turning back
