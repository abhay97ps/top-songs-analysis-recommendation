The last word in lonesome is me
The last word in lonesome is me
My heart is as lonely as a heart can be lonely
The last word in lonesome is me
Too bad what's happened to our good love
Too bad what's happened to our good love
Sometimes our best isn't quite good enough
And the last word in lonesome is me
The last word in lonesome is me...
My heart is as lonely...
