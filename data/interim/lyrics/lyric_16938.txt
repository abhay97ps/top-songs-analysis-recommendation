I'm a good guy for a gal
So won't you look my palm over?
I got time for a chat
So won't you tell me my future?
I'm gonna break down at 50
And I'm not quite a stallion
I'm a good guy for a gal
And I'm mentally slippin'
Oh yeah, oh yeah, what's that you see?
Oh boy, find out, what's up with me
Oh yeah, oh yeah, what's that you see?
Tell me, more of, what's gonna be
If you're friends with P
Well then, you're friends with me
If you're down with P
Well then, you're down with me
Friends of P
Friends of P
We're friends of P
Friends
Some modest fame and fortune
Is gonna come to me early
I get two loves in my life
And I'm dying at 90
Oh yeah, oh yeah, what's that you see?
Oh boy, find out, what's up with me?
Oh yeah, oh yeah, what's that you see?
Tell me, more of, what's gonna be
If you're friends with P
Well then, you're friends with me
If you're down with P
Well then, you're down with me
