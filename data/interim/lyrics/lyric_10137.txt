Once upon a time, science opened up the door...
We would feed the hungry fields, till they couldn't eat no more...
But the potions that we made
Touched the creatures down below...
And they grow up in a way, that we'd never seen before...
Supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature!
They were angry with the man 'cause he changed their way of life!
And they take their sweet revenge, as they trample through the night...
For a hundred miles or more, you can hear the people cry...
But there's nothing you can do, even God is on their side
Supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature!
Supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature!
How can I explain?
Things are different today...
Darkness all around, and nobody makes a sound...
Such a sad affair, no one seems to care...
Supernature, better watch out!
Look at you now, better watch out!
Look at you now!
Supernature
Watch out
There's no way to stop it now
You can't escape, it's too late...
Look what you've done:
There's no place that you can run...
The monsters made, we must pray
Supernature, better watch out!
Look at you now!
Supernature, better watch out!
Supernature!
Look at you now!
Better watch out
There's no way to stop it now
You can't escape it's too late
Look what you've done
There's no place that you can run
The monsters made, we must pray
Maybe nature has a plan
To control the ways of man
He must start from scratch again
Many battles he must win
'till he earns his place on earth
Like the other creatures do
Will there be a happy end?
Now that all depends on you
Supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature
Supernature
