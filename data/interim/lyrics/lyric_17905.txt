Complicate this world you wrapped for me
I'm acquainted with your suffering
All your weight it falls on me
It brings me down
All your weight it falls on me
It falls on me
Hold me up to those whom you've deceived
Promises you break you still believe
All your weight it falls on me
It brings me down
All your weight it brings me down
It brings me down
All your weight it falls on me
It brings me down
All your weight it falls on me
It falls on me
All your weight it falls on me
It brings me down
All your weight it falls on me
It falls on me
