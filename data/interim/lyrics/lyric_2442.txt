That's when it hurts
Oh, oh, yeah
That's when it hurts, ooh
You don't kiss me
Like you used to do
You don't miss me, darling
Darling, darling, darling
When the night is through
So I sit at home
Turn off the light
Here comes the night
That's when it hurts
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's when it hurts, ooh
I'm going downtown to Joey's place
And I know that, darling
I'm gonna walk right in
And I'll see your face
Yes, you'll be dancing
With someone new
Here comes the pain
That's when it hurts
Oh, oh yeah
That's when it hurts, ooh
Then you're gonna
See me sitting all alone
Based at the corner table
And I'll be sitting there smiling, honey
Sitting over there somewhere by myself
Smoking a cigarette
Then you're gonna feel
That you'll have to come over
And say something real nice to me
Oh baby, that's when
My eyes will get wet
And I'll walk out the door
And I'll walk back home
Take the same street
That we used to take
When we walked alone
Then I'll see your friends
All pitying me
Whoa, their sympathy
That's when it hurts
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
That's when it hurts
Yeah, yeah
It hurts, it hurts, oh, yeah
That's when it hurts
