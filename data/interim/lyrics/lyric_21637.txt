Every time that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone, it went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way, everybody's got the dues in life to pay
Yeah, I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win
Half my life's in books' written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things come back to you
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Take you away...
Yeah, sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away...
Yeah, dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until the dream comes true
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dreams come through
Yeah, dream on, dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on, dream on, aah!
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter
Sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me
Sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
He'll take you away
