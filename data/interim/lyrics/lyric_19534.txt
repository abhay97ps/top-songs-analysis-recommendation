I was 18 making minimum wage
With a letterman's jacket and a chevrolet
Thought I was cool
Yea, I ruled the school
You were cumlada with the strawberry lips
Had the whole world danglin' at your fingertips
Your senior year, and I was your daddy's worst fear
We ran off on graduation night
Thought a couple of left-hand rings would make everything alright
Chorus:
With a little bita live, little bita learn
Little bita watchin' a few more candles burn and
Finding out what life was
Oo with a little bita fuss, little bita fight
Littel bita kiss and makin' up all night and
One day waking up
Oh in a real love
Well I was 22 working double overtime
I was spending dollars and making dimes
We were overdrawn, yea and barely hanging on
Then one night you came to me
With tears in your eyes and an EPT and said
"Guess what? Yea baby ready or not"
I just smiled but I was scared to death
How am I gonna have a kid when I'm still a kid myself?
Woah in a real love
Yeah yeah
Its a real love
Yeah baby its a real love
Yeah its a real love baby
Yeah its a real, real, real, real, real, real love
Whoa
