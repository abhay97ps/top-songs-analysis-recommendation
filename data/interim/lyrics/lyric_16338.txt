Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax 
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax 
Here we are in the room together
Holding hands and it's gonna get better
And I know that you're in the mood, yes
So I put your purse down
And take off your jacket
Oh girl it's about to get nasty
You'll love what we gonna do
So lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax 
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax 
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax
Won't you pull back the sheets and lay down
Put your head upon my shoulders
Let me tell you how I wanna feel
You're the girl that knows my pleasure
So let me go down and find my treasure
Let me see where my pearl is at
So lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax 
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax
The cutie pies they all know
They can always L-A-Y on my pillow
The cutie pies they all know
They can always L-A-Y on my pillow
The cutie pies they all know
They can always L-A-Y on my pillow
They can always, they can always
