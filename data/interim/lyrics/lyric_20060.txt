J.E., y'all 
And she saw the light, my shining star
She's so dear to me
Yes, she is, yes, she is 
My, my rabbit's foot, my lucky charm
Yes, she is, yes, she is
Woah, woah, oh
Every time that something good happens in my life
You're always there for me, looking good by my side
Picture you now, pulling up your pantyhose
And you always got that sexy underwear on
So much good has come my way since she came in my life
I'll never push you away or brush you off to the side
See, girl, I, I, I
See, my luck has changed for the better 
See, I got so much love for you in these arms 
Don't you know that you're my good luck charm? 
Wear you 'round forever, girl, ain't no harm 
And nobody else can borrow it, I won't allow it 
See, I got so much love for you in these arms 
Don't you know that you're my good luck charm? 
Loving you forever, girl, and never do I
Wanna go without my good luck charm
Like a rabbit's foot on keys, or some lucky dice
All I want or need, I ain't gotta ask twice
Where would I be? What would I do
Without you looking out for me?
Probably be, probably be in these streets
Without you in my life
My future ain't the same, no 
And I'm not wanting the blame 
Baby, I know I been around
I'm tired of messing around
I got so much love for you
See, I got so much love for you in these arms 
Don't you know that you're my good luck charm? 
Wear you 'round forever, girl, ain't no harm 
And nobody else can borrow it, I won't allow it 
See, I got so much love for you in these arms 
Don't you know that you're my good luck charm? 
Loving you forever, girl, and never do I 
Wanna go without my good luck charm 
And I'd throw away this ice, and give up my J.E. pieces
Just to get a piece of your love forever, uh
And I knew you were a keeper
So, baby girl, I'm keepin' you
Can't think about lettin' you go, no, no
It seems like every situation I been facin'
You know what to do to save me
So I know you bring me luck
So I'm standin' strong like a soldier
I know how to hold you
I'm sayin' this to let you know
I got so. ooh
See, I got so much love for you in these arms 
Don't you know that you're my good luck charm? 
Wear you 'round forever, girl, ain't no harm 
And nobody else can borrow it, I won't allow it 
See, I got so much love for you in these arms 
Don't you know that you're my good luck charm? 
Loving you forever, girl, and never do I 
Wanna go without my good luck charm
