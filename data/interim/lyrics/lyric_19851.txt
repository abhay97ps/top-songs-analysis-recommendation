Konvict, Konvict 
Akon and Young Jeezy 
Tryna take it easy 
Only way to go
You already know what it is, you already know what it is, nigga
And so 
But if you lookin' for me, I'll be on the block
With my thing cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider 
I'm just a soul survivor 
'Cause everybody know the game don't stop
Tryna make it to the top 'fore your ass get popped now
If you a rider 
Or just a soul survivor 
Tonight I can't sleep, we livin' in Hell 
First they give us the work, then they throw us in jail 
Road trip, yeah, I'm traffickin' the white
Please Lord, don't let me go to jail tonight 
Who me? I'm a soul survivor
Ask about him in the street, the boy Jeez a rider 
A hundred grand on my wrist, yeah, life sucks 
Fuck the club, dawg, I rather count a million bucks 
If you lookin' for me, I'll be on the block
With my thing cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider 
I'm just a soul survivor 
'Cause everybody know the game don't stop
Tryna make it to the top 'fore your ass get popped now
If you a rider 
Or just a soul survivor 
Another day, another dollar  same block, same nigga 
Same part, same green, I guess we got the same dreams 
Or is it the same nightmares? 
We let the doves do it for us, we don't cry tears 
Real niggas don't budge
When Mel Man got his time, he shot birds at the judge 
I'm knee-deep in the game
So when it's time to re-up, I'm knee deep in the caine 
Real talk, look, I'm tellin' you, mayne 
If you get jammed up, don't mention my name 
Forgive me, Lord, I know I ain't livin' right
Gotta feed the block, niggas starvin', they got appetites 
And this is e'ryday, it never gets old
Thought I was a juvenile, stuck to the G-code 
This ain't a rap song, nigga, this is my life 
And if the hood was a battlefield, then I'd earn stripes 
If you lookin' for me, I'll be on the block
With my thing cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider 
I'm just a soul survivor 
'Cause everybody know the game don't stop
Tryna make it to the top 'fore your ass get popped now
If you a rider 
Or just a soul survivor 
Gotta watch ya every move 'cause them eyes be on you
Gotta drive real cool when them pies be on you
Just because we stack paper and we ball outrageous
Them alphabet boys got us under surveillance 
Like animals, they lock us in cages
The same nigga that's a star when you put him on stages
I ain't cheat, played the hand I was dealt
Tried to tax the grand pearl when I got it myself 
No nuts, no glory 
My biography, you damn right, the true story
Set the city on fire, and I didn't even try
Run these streets all day, I can sleep when I die 
Cause if you lookin' for me
You can find me on the block disobeyin' the law
A real G, thoroughbred from the streets
Pants saggin' with my gun in my drawers
Just keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now, ay
But if you lookin' for me, I'll be on the block
With my thing cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider 
I'm just a soul survivor 
'Cause everybody know the game don't stop
Tryna make it to the top 'fore your ass get popped now
If you a rider 
Or just a soul survivor 
If you lookin' for me, I'll be on the block
With my thing cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider 
I'm just a soul survivor 
'Cause everybody know the game don't stop
Tryna make it to the top 'fore your ass get popped now
If you a rider 
Or just a soul survivor
