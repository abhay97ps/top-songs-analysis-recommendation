Put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
Hands up! Shorty, when you party with me
We goin' way past quarter to three
 I'm good in the VIP
I got my hammer right here with me
 You know when you party with crooks
You gotta learn to respect the jux
 Everything ain't cool as the fame
And this shit ain't as sweet as it looks 
You know I'm puttin' something on me
Right before I leave outta the car 
You go tough talkin' at me
You gon' leave out the club wit a scar 
We pop bottles like it's all free
'Fore I leave, I'mma buy out the bar 
You gon' order whatchu want, it's on me
I'm a G, take a look at a star 
It feels so good to live sucka free
I'm soakin' it all up while your girl's suckin' me
It mean the world to her, it's nuttin' but a nut to me
Look miss, get a grip or let a mothafucker be
I'm a rap star, who 'posed to be ridin' around in that car
Two in the front, in the back got the plasma
This ain't a free ride, you gotta have the gas ma
I wouldn't buy a chick a pump that got asthma
And I'm busy so I move a bit faster
You can't tell me yes if I don't ask ya, huh
I'm a bastard, damn near chauvinist, hand over the plastic
Cause they wanna see ya man go in the casket
Rule number one: keep ya gun or get ya ass hit
And that's it, lights off and ya body stiff
By the same niggas you used to party with
Yea
I cruise through the strip, 22's on the whip, new Ruger on the hip
Thousand dollar outfit, never stooge never slip
Follow rules or get whipped, nigga move or get hit
I don't care who's on the strip
It ain't only the Ferrari now, the jewels got 'em sick
Now it's 2006, I need a new bottom miss
It's a'ight, they can talk, I'm amused by the pricks
I'm the news out the bricks, nigga, who's hot as this?
I bet the mansion and the swimming pool got 'em pissed
I ain't a cuddler, I fuck the drool outta chick
My niggas ice-grill, but it ain't the same
They don't see the faces, they just see the chains like
OOH when ya get 'em, they don't know you with me
They probably think the bouncers at the front door frisk me
This regular shit, the everyday mentality
They charged up, don't make me put in the battery
Put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
