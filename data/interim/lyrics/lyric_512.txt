I love Corinna, tell the world I do
I love Corinna, tell the world I do
I pray at night she'd like to love me too
Corinna, Corinna
Corinna, Corinna
Corinna, Corinna
I love you so
Oh little darling, where you've been so long?
Oh little darling, where you've been so long?
I ain't had no lovin' since you've been gone
Corinna, Corinna
Corinna, Corinna
Corinna, Corinna
I love you so
I left Corinna way across the sea
Oh me, I left Corinna way across the sea
If you see Corinna send her home to me
Corinna, Corinna
Corinna, Corinna
Corinna, Corinna
I love you so
Corinna, Corinna
Corinna, Corinna
Corinna, Corinna
I love you so
Oh darling, don't you know
I love you so
Darling, don't you know
I love you so
