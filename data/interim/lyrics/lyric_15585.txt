MC Skat Kat: Well You've never seen a kat with so much charisma
Got More Moves than a mutant nina- turtle that is
And I'm doing the Skat Strut
To hell with John Travolta and the Disco Duck
They call me Skat Kat, the dance floor maniac
One more of my hip is like an afro-disiac
Swinging and wingingI'm just doing my own thing
Girls don't jump me
Give me room to be funky
Step to the dance floor bust a little spin
SHUT UP KID!!
This is a new dance so shake your butt
And get a load of what its like to be doing Skat Strut
Now Jack was nimble and Jack was quick
But it was Skat Kat that made Jack trip
I burned him on the butt with a flick of my bic
And then I cold ran away with the candle stick
I've got all the right moves
Ladies think I'm Loveable
Love to wine and dine sippin' on bubble
But most of all, I like dancing y'all
And doing my Skat Strut from wall to wall
It's as simple as it gets, just stick out your neck
Lift up your leg and step to the left
Now shake a little as you groove to the beat
--Bend over, shake your big booty
And if you get dizzy from shaking your butt
You must have shook the wrong end cuz you ain't doing
The Skat Strut 
As we go a little something like this-- Hit it!!
Without a question, its the strut to fame
I can see myself now on the aisles of "Soul Train"
People want to know if its meant to be silly
I say only when it's done by Milli and Vanilli
The dance is mine a generation of felines
Mastered this step back in '69
Return of the Skat Strut a brand new dance
 could but you can't-- BUST IT
Homeboy Fatz, Why don't you step up to the microphone
And give them a little taste of
Your beat box boy---
FATZ: Hey man, I've told you
I don't like nobody telling me what to do
Now I'm a beat-box, but I'm a do-it-my-way
Anybody got something to say?
MC Skat Kat: For those who don't know me
My name is Skat
I'm the kat who did the rap in "Opposites Attract"
Me and Paula did a duo and then I went solo
To grab the microphone and make the ladies go
HO!
And now that I've got you at my command
Its my sole opportunity to make you dance
I want all four paws on the dance floor
Do that strut until your legs get sore
Come on! Come on! Come on!
