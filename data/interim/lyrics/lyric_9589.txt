Whenever I'm away from you, baby
There's nothin' much I wanna do, oh baby
If you could only see
What I've been goin' through 
Without you 
Each day I smile so well, but they can't see
The real me that's inside hurtin'
I read my books to occupy myself
The therapy, it's just not workin'
And it's only my imagination
Somethin' in mind
'Cause the only indication
Is I'm wastin' my time
I've lived in fairytales and nursery rhymes
An uphill climb without an ending
Although my life with you had ups and downs
Smiles and frowns, just pretending
And it's only my imagination
Somethin' in mind
'Cause the only indication
Is I'm wastin' my time
Whenever I'm away from you, baby
There's nothin' much I want to do, oh baby
I'm just livin' for the day I make you mine 
One more time
