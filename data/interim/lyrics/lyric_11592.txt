She never sees it goin'
She lacks a certain point of view
But something always pulls her through
What she tries
It's a weapon deep inside

Suzi's found a weapon
And I don't even think she knows

You'll have to run and die
Not to love her

And I don't even think she tried
Mmm, Suzi found a weapon
And I don't even think she tried
