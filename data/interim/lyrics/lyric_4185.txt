Put your damn hands up
I'm in the middle with a hand and a hammer
You in the crowd with a handful of cameras
Me and my people, we've got all the damn answers, so
One time for the people who made me
And two times for the people that hate me
We here
We here
Geez. I think I lack the motivation
I think I lack the motivation 
Or maybe I don't have the patience
Or maybe I don't have the patience for fakeness
Lame shit never make it
You'll probably fuck around and blame it on the racists
And every time they ask me what my name is
 look 'em in the face and tell 'em I'm the latest
Shit, from the pits up in Holly
What can't spend money and then fall in love with Barbie's
Where superfical and and superstitious niggas is folly
They give their heart to Shaniqua and then fuck around with Carly's
Questions and answers, cancerous
Say you had enough? Enough chances
Dancing with the devil
Girl, just because you was bad don't mean that you on my level
Wow. I think I lack the inspiration
I think I lack the inspiration 
Forgot to take my medication
Forgot to take my medication
Damn, niggas need a superhero
I'm more like a Doctor Evil
Lock the keyhole, rocks regal in vivid
Giving women a number that's only got six digits
Girl, please
You the baddest girl ever from your toes to your knees
If that cross that you rock make your asshole leave
Yeah, my ass don't bleed. I say my ass don't bleed
What's you religion? I mean supervision
I mean, what's the difference between a minute and infinity?
I've got the power, I got the soul
They fell off the game so I'm putting 'em on
