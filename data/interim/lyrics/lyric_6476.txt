Part I
I'm a product of my environment
Born and raised in the belly of Leviathan
Firecracker pops, ambulance, police sirens
One I in friend, me, myself and fuck whoever's lyin' in my lion's den
Jungle I am in, dead presidents will cease alliances
Peace and silence come 'round like leap years foolish violence
Pull up, hop out, air out, made it look like Goku's Kaioken
Mama, bathrobe, hair net, tears of sorrow, cue the violins
I'm a product of my environment
Daddy gone, hittin' licks and whippin' an entire Benz
My higher sense tell me this is not what I was made for
Stayed inside, played Pimp My Ride, and dreamt of what I prayed for
Nigga's gettin' older, got a lot of chips upon they shoulders
My homie got laid off of postin'
Funny how he ended back up on the corner
Tried to give him words, a little wisdom
Like, "Boy, you better get yourself in order
You know you got a brand new baby daughter
Don't let me be the one to say I warned ya
Click clack to the max, we almost mourned ya
The block stays hot, don't knock the warm up
You ain't gotta fight for blocks and corners
The world's much more than rocks and torture
My nigga said, "This is all I see
And therefore this all I know
And I ain't tryna rewrite history
I'm better off livin' it like it's told"
'Cause nigga I'm a mothafuckin' product of my environment
My nigga's lie within the confines of social riotin'
No eyein' them, you hide and duck when you hear screechin' tires
In the island of hood geographical entitlement
My daddy was a ghost, heard some stories 'bout the most
Mama dragged me out of church, 17 I had a choice
Had a Bible on my left, uh, right I had a toast
Almost robbed a liquor store before my partner overdosed
Part II
It ain't 'bout where you're from
It's where you're goin', it where you're goin'
It ain't 'bout where you're from
It's where you're goin', it's where you're goin'
My daddy hit a lick today
Servin' up whips, drinkin' Tanqueray like ahhhhh
My mama had to pay the rent today
Couple hundred short, but we're still okay like...
Mothafuck my president, I love my residence
Disrespect my brethren, dirt slumber, no hesitance
Things taught hood etiquette, north Dade I represent
Doodoo dreads like fellowship, Zoe on Zoe elegance
Boost Mobile liquor store, gun store, Boost Mobile
Heard you caught two bodies like last week, who told you?
EBT in my wallet, cop canned salmon my mom vexed
On the first floor right next door, nigga sellin' dope in my complex
No snitchin', my area locked, I got more fear in these cops
Roaches in my cereal box, gunshots, my stereo knocks
Got a job like four times my God we've got minimal opps
Little bro watch Akademiks, couldn't even spell academics
Flea markets, police watchin', can't even reach for my key pocket
Please stop it, sling, sing, b-ball dreams my three options
You know the story and how it goes, what's to unfold?
The paradise to outsiders lie to all of the globe
No change am I convinced only I can alter through my intent?
Or just another product of my environment?
My daddy hit a lick today
Servin' up whips, drinkin' Tanqueray like ahhhhh
Part III
We all have the same emotions. You know, no matter who you are or where you're from, we all have the same emotions. You know, we all wanna be successful, you know, we all have the same fears of failure. We all have, you know, um, you know, this... feelings of abandonment. We all, you know, want love
Uh, pardon my sincerity, God just spared me the clarity
Thank you to the angels on Earth who loved me to carry me
When life decided to bury me
Wasn't even safe in my apartment
I came outside to four officers aimin' to sing it merrily
Shiver me timbers, who knew the law could be scared of me
Black boy fly, nah, watch this black boy
Gunshots we all seen it
My mama crafted imaginary curfews for that very same reason
Young and guided by dreamin' somehow I dodged all the precincts
Product of my environment
See our beliefs tend to shape the system we place in our minds now
Let's rearrange some of these habits
In due time we'll make peace with all of our imperfections
What causes pain can be used to serve as a greater message
See poverty brought me to understand
The gift of life is bein' grateful for simply what could have been
I could have been lost in cycles many of peers would kill to break
You leave this place that raised your heart to gain perspective love and grace
I know it takes wantin' more than what's provided on your plate
The meal is cool for you but what about all your loved ones at stake?
No lie, guilt trippin' through all the drama
I still got visions of trigga behind the llama my father
No love in the city, but there's love in your heart
A will that can brave is a mind that can spark change
I've tried and fought, against it all
But I found out only acceptance provides the cure
