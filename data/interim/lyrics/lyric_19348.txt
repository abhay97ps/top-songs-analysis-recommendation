He can't remember the times that he thought
Does my daddy love me? Probably not
That didn't stop him from wishing that he did
Didn't keep him from wanting or worshipping him
He guesses he saw him about once a year
He could still feel the way he felt standing in tears
Stretching his arms out as far as they'd go
And whispering daddy, I want you to know
I love you this much and I'm waiting on you
To make up your mind, do you love me too?
How ever long it takes, I'm never giving up
No matter what, I love you this much
He grew to hate him for what he had done
'Cause what kind of father could do that to his son?
He said 'damn you, daddy' the day that he died
The man didn't blink, but the little boy cried
I love you this much and I'm waiting on you
To make up your mind, do you love me too?
How ever long it takes, I'm never giving up
No matter what, I love you this much
Half way through the service
While the choir sang the hymn
He looked up above the preacher
And he sat and stared at him
He said 'Forgive me father' when he realized
That he hadn't been unloved or alone all his life
His arms were stretched out as far as they go
Nailed to the cross, for the whole world to know
I love you this much and I'm waiting on you
To make up your mind, do you love me too?
How ever long it takes, I'm never giving up
No matter what, I love you this much
