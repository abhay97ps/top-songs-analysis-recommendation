-I love you!
-Show me
Something got me started
You know that I will love you
Lately since we parted
I truly know that I need you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you 
I'd give it all up for you 
I'd give it all up for you 
I'd give it all up for you 
Totally brokenhearted
Guilty of what I did to you
Lately since we parted
I truly know that I need you
Yes, a little because
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you 
I'd give it all up for you 
I'd give it all up for you 
I'd give it all up for you 
Come on
'I really love you'
Come on
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you 
I'd give it all up for you 
I'd give it all up for you 
I'd give it all up for you 
Yes, I would
Yes, I would

Hey!

You've got to help me now
You've got to help me now

I'll take it out
