I don't know, what happened to the love we shared
Don't go, sometimes I think it's just not fair
I know, the pain I feel inside my heart
I wish I'd known it from the start
That you would come and break my heart
I can't hold back these tears in my eyes
The feeling of pain inside me cause...
Chorus:
I'm dreaming of love, thinking of you
Remembering times that we once shared
Dreaming of love, thinking of you
And knowing someday you'll come back to my life
I try to love, but it just don't feel the same
Our love was once in a lifetime
I'll take the blame
God above, hear my prayer
Bring her back to me
I wish I'd known you from the start
That you would come and break my heart
I can't hold back these tears in my eyes
The feeling of pain inside me cause...
I'm dreaming of love
I am dreaming of love
I don't know, why did you leave me all alone
Our love was once in a lifetime
I'll take the blame
Now I know, true love I feel inside my heart
I wish I'd known it from the start
That you would come and break my heart
I can't hold back these tears in my eyes
The feeling of pain inside me cause...
Chorus
