Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Each morning I get up
I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!
Somebody 
Oh, somebody 
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
I work hard 
Every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end 
I take home 
My hard earned pay all on my own
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray 
'Til the tears run down from my eyes
Lord, somebody
Oh, somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Every day 
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in the brain
Oh, I got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe
Oh, I just got to get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free
Oh
Love, love
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
Somebody to love
Hey, yeah
Whoa
Find me, find me
Somebody to love
