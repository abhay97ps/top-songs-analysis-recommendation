Oh-oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh-oh
You walk and talk like you're some new sensation
You move in circles, you don't need an invitation
You spend your money, you can't get no satisfaction
You play it right so you can get the right reaction
It won't be long, my darlin'
Pick up the phone, nobody's on it
Where are your friends now, baby?
All of the ones supposed to be there for
You 
When you're falling down, the world starts spinnin' out
You 
When you're falling down, now it's not all about
You 
When you're falling down, you know I'll be around
When you're falling down, falling down
What's out of place when you look into the mirror?
The truth is blurry, but the lies are gettin' clearer
Your eyes are fixed, your smile is so elastic
You give me roses, but they're all just made of plastic
It won't be long, my darlin'
Pick up the phone, nobody's on it
Where are your friends now, baby?
All of the ones supposed to be there for
You 
When you're falling down, the world starts spinnin' out
You 
When you're falling down, now it's not all about
You 
When you're falling down, you know I'll be around
When you're falling down, falling down
Smile for the camera, everybody's lookin' at ya
Smile for the camera, 'cause they're all about to trash ya
Smile for the camera, camera, camera
Smile for the camera, who's gonna catch ya?
You 
You 
When you're falling down, the world starts spinnin' out
You 
When you're falling down, now it's not all about
You 
When you're falling down, you know I'll be around
When you're falling down, falling down
Smile for the camera, everybody's lookin' at ya
Smile for the camera, 'cause they're all about to trash ya
