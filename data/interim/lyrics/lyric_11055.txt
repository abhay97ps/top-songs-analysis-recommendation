I know it's late to call
I don't blame you if you're angry
But there are things
That only old lovers understand
I remember rainy nights like this
When we'd go to bed real early
 try to catch each other's dreams
And wake up holding hands
We'd light a fire in the morning
And keep it burning strong
Outside it could be storming
But we never felt so warm
We'd curl up on the couch
And trade the world for our love song
We'd light a fire in the morning
And make love all day long
I hope you know
It's not that I've got no one else to go to
'Cause I keep thinking of you
Even when I'm not alone
Now I'd love to hear you say
I'm still the one you can't say "no" to
And that you'll take me back tonight
For all the love we've known
We'd light a fire in the morning
And keep it burning strong
Outside it could be storming
But we never felt so warm
We'd curl up on the couch
And trade the world for our love song
We'd light a fire in the morning
And make love all day long
