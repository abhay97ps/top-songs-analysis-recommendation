Your precious love
Means more to me
Than any love could ever be
For when I wanted you
I was so lonely and so blue
For that's what love will do
And darling, I'm
Oh, when I first realized
That a-you were fooling me
And darling
They say that our love won't grow
But I just wanna tell them
That they don't know-oh-ho
For as long
As you're in love with me
Our love will grow wider
Deeper than any sea
And of all the things that I want
In this whole wide world
Is just for you to say
That you'll be my girl
And woo-ooo-ooo
Wanting you
I'm so-whoa, lonely
