Just a good old boys
Never meanin' no harm
Beats all you never saw
Been in trouble with the law since the day they was born
Straightening the curves, yeah
Flattenin' the hills
Someday the mountain might get 'em but the law never will
Makin' their way the only way they know how
That's just a little bit more than the law will allow
Makin' their way the only way they know how 
That's just a little bit more than the law will allow
I'm a good old boy
You know my mama loves me
But she don't understand
They keep a-showing my hands and not my face on TV, haha
