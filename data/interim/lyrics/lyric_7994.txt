There you go
There you go
There you go using that weapon on me again
You know I can't stand to see you cry and you know that I'll give in
Girl I'm in love with you
Do anything you ask me to
And any time I try to say we're through oh baby
Oh baby
There you go using that weapon on me again
You know that I'll never leave and I'll never stop loving you
Using that smile you possess
Your pretty ways and tenderness
I don't know if I'm cursed or blessed
Oh baby
Oh baby
You don't know how much I love you
How much I really care
Sometimes you ask just like, girl
I'm not really here
There you go
There you go
Oh oh ah ah
There you go girl using that weapon on me again
I don't know why I try to fight it
I only find myself giving in
Your love is like the weather
Changing every time
You love me you hate me you hate me you love me
Girl why can't you make up your mind
There you go girl using that weapon on me again
There you go
There you go
I know that its true that my weakness is you there ain't nothing I can do
There you go
There you go
There you go using that weapon on me again
There you go
There you go
You know that you're wrong but I got to hold on you've been loving me just that strong
