Is keep it light, keep it light
Is make it right, make it right
Is give you that thing
Play you that song you and your girlfriends sing
Is get you back tonight
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta treat her right, whoa I gotta cherish her for life
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her tonight
I never should’ve raised my voice, or made you feel so small
I never should’ve asked you to do anything at all
I should’ve kissed you longer
I should’ve held you stronger
And I’ll wait for forever for you love me again
Is keep it light, keep it light
Is make it right, make it right
Is give you that thing
Play you that song you and your girlfriends sing
Is get you back tonight
Oh it’s so hard 
Oh it’s so hard 
But it doesn’t have to be
Cause ...
Is keep it light, keep it light
Is make it right, make it right
Is give you that thing
Play you that song you and your girlfriends sing
Is get you back tonight
Is keep it light, keep it light
Is make it right, make it right
Is give you that thing
Play you that song you and your girlfriends sing
Is get you back tonight
