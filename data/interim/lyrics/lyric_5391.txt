Oh, say can you see
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the Twilights last gleaming?
Who'se broad stripes and bright stars
Through the perilous night
O'er the ramparts we watched
Were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there!
Oh say does that Star-Spangled Banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
