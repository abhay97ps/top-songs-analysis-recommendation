Falling in love was the last thing I had on my mind
Holding you is a warmth that I thought I could never find
 Just trying to decide
 Or stay by your side
 I know I could cry
I just can't find the answers
To the questions that keep going through my mind
Hey, babe
Isn't it time?
Isn't it time?
I've seen visions of someone like you in my life
A love that's strong reaching out
Holding me through the darkest night
 Just trying to decide
 Or stay by your side
 I don't want to cry
I just can't find the answers
To the questions that keep going through my mind
Hey, babe
Isn't it time?
Isn't it time?
I feel a warmth in my heart and my soul that I never knew
This love affair gives me strength that I need just to get me through
 Just wondering why
 I know I could cry
 And everything seems alright
I've finally found the answers
To the questions that keep going through my mind
Hey, babe
Isn't it time?
I know it's time
Ooh, yeah  I know it's time
It must be time 
 It must be time
 It oughta be time
It must be time
