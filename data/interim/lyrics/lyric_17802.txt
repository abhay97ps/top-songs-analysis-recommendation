Two broken hearts lonely lookin' like houses
Where nobody lives
Two people each havin' so much pride inside
Neither side forgives
The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
In the number of husbands and wives
A woman and a man, a man and a woman
Some can, some can't, some can't
Oh, two broken hearts lonely lookin' like houses
Where nobody lives
Two people each havin' so much pride inside
Neither side forgives
The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
Oh, it's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
In the number of husbands and wives
Yeah, it's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
In the number of husbands and wives
