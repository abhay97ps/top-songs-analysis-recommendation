I'm comin' home baby now
I'm comin' home now, right away
I'm comin' home baby now
I'm sorry now I ever went away
Every night and day I go and stay
I'm comin' home baby
Comin' home baby now
I'm comin' home now, real soon
Comin' home baby now
I'm comin' home, I know I'm overdue
Expect me any day
Now, real soon.

Comin' home baby now
That everything is gonna be fine
Comin' home baby now
Expect to see me now, anytime
When you're in my arms

And I never will go away.

Oh hear me holler and hear me roar
Gonna be with you
Ever more. 
I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home baby now
That's what I say: I say I'm comin' home
The road is long baby now
I'm comin' home and never more to roam
Baby I'm for sure
Comin' home. 
I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home baby now
