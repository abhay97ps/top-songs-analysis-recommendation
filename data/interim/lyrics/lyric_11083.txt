Mmmm
You know you brought it home to me once more
Oh
You know I won the battle but I lost the war
I'm not the same since you got a hold on me
And you burned me, baby, burned me
My heart ain't my brain
If it was I know I would do, I would tell you, I would say
Chorus
Let me be, let me be
If you want to love me, babe, you got to give me some more
I can see, I can see
Bridge
That everybody little sure that I want to love you
Everybody little sure that I got to love you
I never learned
I keep holding onto you
And you hurt and you hurt me
So bad
I could say
I gotta get away from you gonna lose you, gonna lose
Chorus
That everybody little sure that I want to love you
Everybody little sure I got to love you
Got to love you, got to love you, got to love you
Dreams often change
But I want to keep mine
It's a bad time just to throw them away everyday
I'm think I'm gonna leave you but I stay here and I stay
Chorus
That everybody little sure that I want to love you
Everybody little sure that I got to love you, got to love you, got to love you, got to love you
Chorus
That everybody little sure that I want to love you
Everybody little sure that I got to love you
Everybody little sure that I got to love you
Chorus
That everybody little sure that I want to love you
That everybody little sure that I got to love you
