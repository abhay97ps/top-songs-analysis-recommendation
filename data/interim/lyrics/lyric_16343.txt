I'm in love, I'm in love
And it feels so fine
Take the sun from above
And my heart still shines
Wanna sing when you bring
Me a kiss and smile
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
Never knew elation
What a sensation
Livin' is great
Hey I'm feelin' free
Never knew happiness
Baby I'm obsessed
Crazy I guess
But you're all I see
With you, I'm on a holiday
No troubles I can see
Like a child I want to play all day
Forever you and me
Love's my first impression
I'll give no less than
All of my best
'Cause I know it's real
Fascinate me baby
Don't keep me waitin'
Reciprocating the way I feel
I wanna fill your every need
Your very soul desire
'Cause you are everything to me
There's nothing more to find
When your love starts callin'
I can hardly wait
'Cause my heart has fallen
Baby I'm here to say
Well my heart keeps racin'
I can hardly keep up
And my mind keeps chasin
Every second that we stay apart
Can't keep up
Can't get enough
I'm in love
