I left you this morning
Couldn't take anymore
You laughed and you dared me
To walk out the door
You said that I'd come back
You knew what I'd do
And you know you were right
Cause I'm back here tonight
Beggin' to you
I won't disappoint you
I'm beggin' to stay
But that's what you wanted
To hear anyway
It must make you happy
To make me so blue
What a pitiful sight
I must be tonight
Beggin' to you
You don't want my lovin'
But you let me stay around, oh
I guess just to walk on
So you won't touch the ground
To you it don't matter
What you cause me to do
As long as you keep me
Beggin' to you
