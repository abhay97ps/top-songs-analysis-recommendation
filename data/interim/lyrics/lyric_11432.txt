This is it
This is what I've waited for so long
Starting now
Gotta trust these feelings comin' on
Take a chance
Even though I feel like I should run
I'm stayin' with it
Let my heart take me there
Got a feeling
Ooh I'm going somewhere
I'm deep in it
And I really do care
Wait a minute now
Boy don't walk out now
I can see
I can see you're disbelieving eyes
Don't you know
Holding back your love is so unwise
Take a chance
Ain't it time you took a lover's stand
I'm stayin' with it
Let my heart take me there
Got a feeling
Ooh I'm going somewhere
I'm deep in it
And I really do care
Wait a minute now
Boy don't walk out now
I'm stayin' with it
Let my heart take me there
Got a feeling
Ooh I'm going somewhere
I'm deep in it
And I really do care
Wait a minute now
Boy don't walk out now
I'm stayin' with it
Let my heart take me there
Got a feeling
Ooh I'm going somewhere
I'm deep in it
And I really do care
Wait a minute now
Boy don't walk out now
Stayin' with it
Ooh stayin' with it
Stayin' with it
Ooh, hoo, hoo, yea
Stayin' with it
Don't hold back 'cause you gotta take a chance with me
