I stayed up cryin' all night 
I knew the end was in sight 
And now you're walkin' out on me 
You're wonderin' where the little tears can be 
Well, baby....
I'm all cried out, I'm all cried out
All my little tears are all dried out, oh yeah
Now, that you say we're through
I'm all cried out over you
Last night I knew we were through 
It hurt 'cause I still loved you 
Went home and couldn't fall asleep 
'Cause sleep just won't come into eyes that weep 
And that's why....
I'm all cried out, I'm all cried out
All my little tears are all dried out, oh yeah
Now that you say we're through
I'm all cried out over you, oh yeah
I'm all cried out
I just can't cry no more, no, no
No, no, no, no, oh
All cried out
And that's why....
I'm all cried out, yes I'm all cried out
All my little tears are all dried out, oh yeah
Now that you say we're through
I'm all cried out over you
Listen to me when I'm a-gonna say
I'm all cried out, yeah, over you
Listen to me when I'm a-tellin' you
I'm all cried out, yeah, over you
Over you
