For so long it's been you and me
But now there's someone else
I know you wanna see
And you say "why can't we be three?"
But in the middle I don't want to be
You say I'm wrong to show my jealousy
You say that it's a chance to show maturity
Well, I don't want to spoil your fantasy
But in the middle I don't want to be
Oh Lord! When you gave me your affection
I thought I was movin' in the right direction
But that's all gone and I'm no referee
So in the middle I don't want to be
I don't want to cramp your style
That would be juvenile
You know you're more versatile than me
You know what you want to do
I'm not going to question you
I always want you to feel free
Oh Lord! When I gave you my affection
I thought I was makin' such a good connection
But that's all gone and so I'll have to leave
'Cause in the middle I don't want to be, uhn, uhn
In the middle I don't want to be
 no, no
In the middle I, I, I
Don't wanna be
