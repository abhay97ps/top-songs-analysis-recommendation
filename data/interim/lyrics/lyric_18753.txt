My breath is short, my heart is beating fast
Every time I smile at her she's smiling back
If I'm dreaming, please just let me sleep
Anyone can see that she's too good for me
Oh, give her time, she'll find out soon enough
Just let me have and hold her 'til she does
What we've got going on is so incredible
This chemistry between us feels so wonderful
But knowing me, I'll probably
Find a way to mess it up
Who knows, who cares, right now
Just let me be in love
Don't concern me with reality
Don't convince me she's too heavenly
Forget the future, disregard the past
Those are questions I don't want to ask
To my heart, all that matters is tonight
Just let me live this moment in her eyes
What we've got going on is so incredible
This chemistry between us feels so wonderful
But knowing me, I'll probably
Find a way to mess it up
Who knows, who cares, right now
Just let me be in love
What we've got going on is so incredible
This chemistry between us feels so wonderful
But knowing me, I'll probably
Find a way to mess it up
Who knows, who cares, right now
Just let me be in love
Who knows, who cares, right now
Just let me be in love
Let me be in love
I just want to be in love
