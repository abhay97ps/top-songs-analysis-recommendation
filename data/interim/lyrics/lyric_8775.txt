Who’s sorry now
Who’s sorry now
Whose heart is aching for breaking each vow
Who’s sad and blue
Who’s crying too just like I cried over you
Right to the end
Just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You have your way
Now you must pay
I’m glad that you’re sorry now
Right to the end
Just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You have your way
Now you must pay
I’m glad that you’re sorry now
