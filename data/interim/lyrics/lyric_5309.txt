Way out at London Airport
In Hangar Number Four
A lonely little biplane slept
Whose name was Evermore
His working days were over
No more would he sail
Upon his wings above the clouds
Flying the royal mail
Bye-bye, biplane
Once-upon-a-sky plane
Bye-bye, hush a bye
Lulla-biplane
All the mighty jet planes
Would look down their nose
They’d laugh and say, “Oh, I’m so glad
That I’m not one of those.”
Bye-bye, biplane
Once-upon-a-sky plane
Bye-bye, hush a bye
Lulla-biplane
And Evermore would shake away
The teardrops from his wings
And dream of days when he again
Could do heroic things
Bye-bye, biplane
Once-upon-a-sky plane
Bye-bye, hush a bye
Lulla-biplane
Then one day the fog and rain
Had closed the airport down
And all the mighty jet planes
Were helpless on the ground
When a call came to the airport
For a mercy flight
‘Twould be too late, they could not wait
Someone must fly tonight
They rolled the little biplane
Out to Runway Number Five
And though he looked so small and weak
He knew he could survive
And as he rose into the storm
The jet planes hung their wings
And they hoped someday, like Evermore
To do heroic things
Bye-bye, biplane
Once-upon-a-sky plane
Bye-bye, hush a bye
Lulla-biplane
And so, my billy bundle
I have spun a tale for you
You must learn there’s nothing
In this world that you can’t do
Now, do not be discouraged
By circumstance or size
Remember Evermore
And set your sights up in the skies
Bye-bye, biplane
Once-upon-a-sky plane
Bye-bye, hush a bye
Lulla-biplane
Goodnight, Wilbur
Goodnight, Orville
