I look at you, my stomach turns, I hate your guts
You turn to me and whisper, "You're a stupid klutz"
And baby , when your memory starts to linger
I reach out, ooh, and give you the finger
Ooh
Eat my shorts 
Yes, choke on polished cotton
Eat my shorts 
Everything we have is rotten
And baby , ooh, baby, I'll see you in court
Eat my shorts 
You put me down, you run around, you spit in my bread
They just declared our sex life legally dead
And baby , without saying a single word
I put my hand in the air and give you the bird
Eat my shorts 
Yes, choke on polished cotton
Eat my shorts 
Everything we havе is rotten
And baby, oh, baby, I'll see you in court
Eat my shorts 
Mmm
Eat my shorts 
Yes, choke on polishеd cotton
Eat my shorts 
Everything we have is rotten
And baby , ooh, baby, I will see you in court
Mmm, eat my shorts 
Ooh, you got to, you got to eat my shorts 
Ooh, choke on it, choke on it
Eat my shorts 
Choke on polished cotton
Eat my shorts
