I bruise you, you bruise me
We both bruise too easily
Too easily to let it show
I love you, and that's all I know
All my plans have fallen through
All my plans depend on you
Depend on you to help them grow
I love you, and that's all I know
When the singer's gone
Let the song go on...
But the ending always comes at last
Endings always come too fast
They come too fast, but they pass to slow
I love you, and that's all I know
When the singer's gone
Let the song go on
It's a fine line between the darkness and the dawn
They say the darkest night
There's a light beyond
But the ending always comes at last
Endings always come too fast
They come too fast, but they pass too slow
I love you, and that's all I know
That's all I know
That's all I know, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
