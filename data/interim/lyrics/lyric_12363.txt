It's not the way you look, it's not the way that you smile
Although there's something to them
It's not the way you have your hair, it's not that certain style
It could be that perfume
If I had a photograph of you
Or something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing
It's not the makeup and it's not the way that you dance
It's not the evening sky
It's more the way your eyes are laughing as they glance
Across the great divide
If I had a photograph of you
Or something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing
It's not the things you say, it's not the things you do
It must be something more
And if I feel this way for so long, tell me is it all for nothing
You'll still walk out the door
If I had a photograph of you
Or something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing
