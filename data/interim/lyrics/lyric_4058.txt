Yo check it
Hey yo the disk in, we sittin, I'm listenin, we listenin
The disk out at 6-10, we dip out
After a 40 of OE a shorty approached me
With gold teeth I said "What's in your mouth?"
And now my fingertips tippin on the button of ignition
And the mission is to fix the transmission and the pistons
Know I'm on a roll like the man of the Michelin
The 'Go is my home but my man is from Michigan
And when I'm fishing for a line out my brain's pond
Know I'm the man for the mission like James Bond
Eating wonton soup on top of Mt. Fuji, dude
Fubi be who? Got this shit sewn like a Coogi suit
Hula Hoop, hop through it just like a poodle do
Medulla Oblongata is your noodle, just another term
I'm the early bird in the trees, you're another worm
He's so cold, he could freeze in a ton of fur
Yo, yo, what' up?
Aye, bro', what's up?
I got it like that
You got it like wha-ohh?
This, like that, like this, and uh—
Get down with it or get get your hands up
Yo, yo, what' up?
Aye, bro', what's up?
I got it like that
You got it like wha-ohh?
This, like that, like this, and uh—
Get down with it or get get your hands up
I'm riding through Bel-Air like Uncle Phil, Will, Jeff
Philly Eagle Randall Cunningham jersey number 12
And ain't no way in hell Chuck he can undersell
I'm selling water at a well, I put that water in that pail
They called that bottled water, pardon all the beg ya pardon
Brick, shovel, dog muzzle, freshest lettuce in the garden
Not saying that the karats ain't fresh tho
Se habla Ingles Chucky del fresco
Yes no maybe so, pay me though
Cause I get it moving like a big ass sail on a baby boat
So it ain't no way that I can't be dope
Olympic sevens with the Expos Starter coat
Or the Chalk Line raiders jacket
I'm like Neon Deion cause you all know Bo Jacksons
And I know that, you too should know that
We don't need practice all net from where I throw at
Yo, yo, what' up?
Aye, bro', what's up?
I got it like that
You got it like wha-ohh?
This, like that, like this, and uh—
Get down with it or get get your hands up
Yo, yo, what' up?
Aye, bro', what's up?
I got it like that
You got it like wha-ohh?
This, like that, like this, and uh—
Get down with it or get get your hands up
