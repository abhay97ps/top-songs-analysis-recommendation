When we had all that time
Still, it’s only wishin’

These are only cities

Never goin' back, never goin' back, never goin' back
Ah, to Nashville anymore
Still, it’s only wishin’
And I know it’s nothing more, so I’m
[Chorus}
Never goin' back, never goin' back, never goin' back
Ah, to Nashville  anymore
