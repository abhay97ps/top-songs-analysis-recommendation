Goin' to a go-go
Goin' to a go-go
Na na na na, yeah
Well, there's a brand new place I've found
Where people go from miles around
They come from everywhere
And if you drop in there
You might see anyone in town
Goin' to a go-go
Goin' to a go-go
Don't you want to go
One more time, yeah
I'm goin' to a go-go
Goin' to a go-go
It doesn't matter where you are
A go-go can't be far
You'll see the people from your block
And don't be shocked
If you see your favorite star
Goin' to a go-go
Goin' to a go-go
Don't you want to go
Na na na na, yeah
Tell me, don't you want to go
Yeah, now, it's all right
I'm goin' to a go-go
Yes I am
Goin' to a go-go
Oh, come on now
It doesn't matter if the people stagger
It doesn't matter if you go dragger
You're sure to have some fun
I'm telling everyone
Most every taxi that you flag is
Goin' to a go-go
Goin' to a go-go
Don't you want to go
One more time, yeah
I'm goin' to a go-go
Ooh, ooh, whee
Goin' to a go-go
Goin' to a go-go
Goin' to a go-go
Goin' to a go-go
