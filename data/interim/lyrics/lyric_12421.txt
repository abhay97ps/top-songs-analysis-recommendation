All I wanted was a sweet distraction for an hour or two
Had no intention to do the things we've done
Funny how it always goes with love
When you don't look, you find
But then we're two of a kind, we move as one
We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more than falling in love
On an all time high
We'll take on the world and wait
So hold on tight, let the flight begin
I don't want to waste a waking moment
I don't want to sleep
I'm in so strong and so deep, and so are you
In my time
I've said these words before
But now I realise
My heart was telling me lies
For you they're true
We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more than falling in love
On an all time high
We'll take on the world and wait
So hold on tight
Let the flight begin
So hold on tight
Let the flight begin
We're an all time high
