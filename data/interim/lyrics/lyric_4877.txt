Oh darling
Ooh, my darling, you're so fine
Ohhhh-ahhh-ahhh
Don't know if words could say
But darling, I'll find a way
To let you know what you meant to me
Guess it was meant to be
I hold you in my heart
As life's most precious part
Oh darling 
I dream about you often my pretty darling
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love
Uh huh, oh
I was living like half a man
Then I couldn't love, but now I can
You pick me up when I'm feeling sad
More soul than I ever had
Gonna love you every single night
Cause I think you're too outta sight
Oh darling 
I dream about you often my pretty darling
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love
Uh huh huh
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Every night, oh darling
Gonna love you every single night, yes I will
Cause I think you're too doggone outta sight
Oh darling 
I dream about you often my pretty darling
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love
Uh huh, oh
