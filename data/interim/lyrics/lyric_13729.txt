I was born in a cross-fire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain, woo, yeah
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas!
But it's all right, jumping jack flash
It's a gas, gas, gas, oh yeah
I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back, oh, yes I was
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, jumping jack flash
It's a gas, gas, gas
I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead, oh, yes I was
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled, woo
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread, yes I did
I was crowned with a spike right through my head, yeah
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, jumping jack flash
It's a gas, gas, gas, yes it is
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Hallelujah
