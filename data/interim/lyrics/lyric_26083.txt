These niggas ain't seen me when I jumped out, they just seen all these diamonds
I hope I motivate your soul
Fuck who ain't feelin' me, ain't no gettin' rid of me
My money long, life should be balanced once I'm gone
Makin' sure it don't stop
This life of a young hard knock
I bet they wishin' they ain't leave me now
I wish my grandmother could see me now, 'cause I say I'm that nigga now
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no runnin' the block
I remember times that I would cry and you would tell me to stop
You knew the times when I was high just from the look in my eye
I know that you the main reason that I'm shinin' right now
I say the hood still the same
See Nicky old house, start thinkin' 'bout lil' Dave
I look next door and I don't see Miss Annie-May
I can't be standin' out here too long 'fore we start hearin' them K's
I'ma turn the page
He say he know where, I say they in there
We gon' go around the back and we gon' burn this bitch up
For them to take what we done earned, they gotta burn our wrist up
Patek on Audemar, Rolex on Hublot, bitch, watch how it glist' up
Yeah, we rollin' four-deep in the streets and we be sticked up
You keep stuntin' in front them hoes and get your stupid ass sticked up
Aw well to all them niggas took a shot and fuckin' missed us
Thankin' God for my shooter, I'm so thankful he don't miss nothin'
Heart race at night, hold me tight
If they catch you cold, then you pay my price
I say my prayers to be safe, money make up for a kite
To DDawg, I hope he fine, 'cause he ain't call last night
Makin' sure it don't stop
This life of a young hard knock
I bet they wishin' they ain't leave me now
I wish my grandmother could see me now
Makin' sure it don't stop
This life of a young hard knock
I bet they wishin' they ain't leave me now
I wish my grandmother could see me now
I say confess, tell the truth 'bout everything I know
And I promised to place you deep inside, right there where my pain is
Fuck my feels, come and tell me how I really feel
Hey, fuck that fast money, tell me where you wanna live
Overdose off shine
Came from the back as a lost man
I'm in love with you and I can't hide it
My chest got an ice box inside it
Yeah, I sent them slimes to send them shots out the coupe
You might say I fucked up 'cause they came back ridin'
But then we spinned again, like back-to-back
You pussy bitch, you spinned again then we double-back
And that's that, boy
These niggas ain't seen me when I jumped out, they just seen all these diamonds
I hope I motivate your soul
Fuck who ain't feelin' me, ain't no gettin' rid of me
My money long, life should be balanced once I'm gone
Makin' sure it don't stop
This life of a young hard knock
I bet they wishin' they ain't leave me now
I wish my grandmother could see me now
He say he know where, I say they in there
We gon' go around the back and we gon' burn this bitch up
For them to take what we done earned, they gotta burn our wrist up
Patek on Audemar, Rolex on Hublot, bitch, watch how it glist' up
Yeah, we rollin' four-deep in the streets and we be sticked up
You keep stuntin' in front them hoes and get your stupid ass sticked up
Aw well to all them niggas took a shot and fuckin' missed us
Thankin' God for my shooter, I'm so thankful he don't miss nothin'
