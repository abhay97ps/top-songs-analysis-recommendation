How could you lie to me
After all that we've been through?
It's just so sad to see
Me in love with you, I gave you all of me
Still, it wasn't enough for you
Is this how love's s'posed to be?
Now I'm trying to get over you
You ain't missin' me at all
You won't pick up the phone and call
You don't know me, like you used to
Tell me, what is goin' on?
You got me standing here alone
You don't know me, like you used to
Oh yeah 
Uh, come on
Oh yeah 
Come on, come on
Oh yeah 
Come on, come on
Oh yeah 
Remember what you said
When you stepped up on the scene
You got into my head
Had me stressin' like a fiend
No, I just can't forget
How you put that thang on me
I wish we never met
This way I wouldn't be lonely
You ain't missin' me at all 
You won't pick up the phone and call
You don't know me, like you used to 
Tell me, what is goin' on? 
You got me standing here alone
You don't know me, like you used to
You ain't missin' me at all
You won't pick up the phone and call
You don't know me, like you used to 
Tell me, what is goin' on? 
You got me standing here alone 
You don't know me, like you used to
Ah ah
Ah ah
Ah ah
Ah ah
Oh ah
Oh ah
Oh ah
Oh ah
You don't know me 
Know me, like you used to
You don't know me 
Know me, like you used to
You ain't missin' me at all
You won't pick up the phone and call
You don't know me, like you used to
Tell me, what is goin' on? 
You got me standing here alone 
You don't know me, like you used to
You ain't missin' me at all
You won't pick up the phone and call
You don't know me, like you used to 
 Tell me, what is goin' on?
You got me standing here alone 
You don't know me, like you used to
You ain't missin' me at all 
You won't pick up the phone and call 
You don't know me, like you used to
Tell me, what is goin' on? 
You got me standing here alone 
You don't know me, like you used to
