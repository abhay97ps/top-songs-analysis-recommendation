Heyhey
Well well well well
Yeaah
Yeaah
 We will go our way
 We will leave someday
 Your hand in my hand
 We will make the plans
 We will fly so high
 Tell our friends goodbye
 We will start life new
 This is what we'll do
 Life is peaceful there
 Lots of open air
 To begin life new
 This is what we'll do
 Sun in winter time
 We will do just fine
 Where the skies are blue
 This and more we'll do
 We will love the beach
 We will learn and teach
 Change our pace of life
 We will work and strive
 I know you love me
 Happy and carefree
 I have no protest
 You want to go west
 Life is peaceful there
 Lots of open air
 To begin life new
 This is what we'll do
 Sun in winter time
 We will do just fine
 Where the skies are blue
 This and more we'll do
 there are many ways
 in the sun or shade
 we will find a place
(to settle] down and live with space
 busy pace back east
, rustling of the feet
 ready to leave too
 what we're going to do
 Life is peaceful there
 Lots of open air
 To begin life new
 This is what we'll do
 Sun in winter time
 We will do just fine
 Where the skies are blue
 This and more we'll do
 Life is peaceful there
 Lots of open air
 To begin life new
 This is what we'll do
 together together we'll gone our way
 together together you lead me the way
 you begin life new
 this is what will do
 life is peaceful there
