Oh
End of another long show
And I search for the love of a lifetime
This is the best that you gave
Because stars aren't allowed to get lonely
My heart screamed out
"No, just let dreams be your master"
Look past my fame. I'm in need
Need of some laughter
Oh, please let me live in your world
I hope that your eyes can see
That I need someone to love me for me
Mmm
Me
So you ask yourself
Oh, this feeling
Is it true from the heart?
Was it my fame and glory?
Why the stars in your eyes wrote the story
And if I want satisfaction
I can have anyone that I see
But why should I settle for less
When I need you
To love me for me
Oh, so confused
Is this real?
Do you love me?
Give me the feeling you care endlessly
My love
Please let me live in your world
I hope that your eyes can see
That I need someone
To love me for me
Me
Yes, this will be our finest hour
You taught me it was forever
Let's take this to the highest power
Oh, let's take it, baby
Let's take it, baby
Please let me live in your world
I hope that your eyes can see
That I need someone
To love me for me
That I need someone
To love me
Please let me live in your world
Hey, Paul Anthony
Why don't you say something to all the lovers out there?
Well, Bow-Legged Lou
I was just about to ask you to drop the same science
Well, I got a better idea
Hey, Lisa
Why don't you tell it like you feel it?
Well, I would like to say
To all the lovers of the world
If you are in love with someone
I mean really in love with someone
Make sure that you hold on to that person
Make sure that person
Loves you for who you are
And not for the materialistic things that surround you
Enough said
For me
That I need someone
To love me for me
