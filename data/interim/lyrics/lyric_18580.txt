Dirty pop
Sick and tired of hearin' all these people talk about
"What's the deal with this pop life
And when is it gonna fade out?"
The thing you got to realize what we doin' is not a trend
We got the gift of melody
We gonna bring it 'til the end, c'mon now
It doesn't matter
'Bout the car I drive or what I wear around my neck
All that matters
Is that you recognize that it's just about respect
It doesn't matter
'Bout the clothes I wear, and where I go and why
All that matters
Is that you get hyped and we'll do it to you every time
Come on, now
Do you ever wonder why
This music gets you high?
It takes you on a ride
Feel it when your body starts to rock
Baby, you can't stop 
And the music's all you got 
This must be pop
Dirty pop
B-baby, baby, you can't stop
I know you like this dirty pop
Now, why you wanna try to classify
The type of thing that we do?
'Cause we're just fine doin' what we like
Can we say the same for you?
Tired of feelin' all around me animosity
Just worry about yours 'cause I'mma get mine
Now people can't you see?
It doesn't matter
'Bout the car I drive or the ice around my neck
All that matters
Is that you recognize that it's just about respect, oh!
It doesn't matter
'Bout the clothes I wear, and where I go and why
All that matters
Is that you get hyped and we'll do it to you every time
C'mon!
Do you ever wonder why 
This music gets you high? 
It takes you on a ride
Feel it when your body starts to rock
Baby, you can't stop 
And the music's all you got 
This must be...
Oooh ooh, ooh ooh
Man, I'm tired of singing
Dirty, dirty, dirty pop!
Dirty pop
Do you ever wonder, wonder, wonder, won-?
Oh! Do you ever wonder why
This music gets you high? 
It takes you on a ride
Feel it when your body starts to rock
Baby, you can't stop 
And the music's all you got 
This must be...
Do you ever wonder why
This music gets you high?
It takes you on a ride
Feel it when your body starts to rock
Baby, you can't stop
And the music's all you got
This must be... 
Do you ever wonder why 
This music gets you high? 
It takes you on a ride
Feel it when your body starts to rock
Baby, you can't stop 
And the music's all you got
This must be pop!
P-p-p-p-p-pop, pop!
