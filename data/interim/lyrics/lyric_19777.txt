Hey baby whatcha doin' this evening?
Can you meet me down at the railroad tracks?
I got Tom Petty playin' in my Silverado
And I iced down a six-pack, uh-oh
Hey Daisy don't you worry 'bout your mama
Like 007 we can keep it covert
Undercover on the ground by the water
Gonna get a little peace on earth
Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers
Hey baby, Mother Nature is waitin'
And love's bloomin' like a cherry tree
Let's buzz around, maybe do some pollinating
Dive on in like honey bees
Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby
Pickin' wildflowers
Take a trail ride if you know what I mean
Hey baby won't you come with me?
Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
Spend a little time, pickin' wildflowers
Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby, You and me baby
Pickin' wildflowers
Whatcha say we go
Whatcha say we go
Whatcha say we go
Whatcha say we go, pickin' wildflowers?
Pickin' wildflowers?
