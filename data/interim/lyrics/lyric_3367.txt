Don't tell me about towns like New York, Frisco
I'm not interested in all that small talk, go-go
I'm more satisfied being here by my baby's side
Just give me my town, my guy and me
My town, my guy and me
My town's got all the other towns beat
My  town's got everything that I need
Just give me my town, my guy and me
Don't tell me about all the good times I'm missin'
Nothings good as the time when were lovin, and kissin'
I'm happy right here, yeah, where every night
He holds me tight
Just give me my town, my guy and me
My town, my guy and me
My town's got what no other towns got
A guy that loves me and needs me a lot!
So give me my town, my guy and me
My town, my guy and me
Oh, I'm happy right here, where every night
He holds me tight
Just give me my town, my guy and me
My town, my guy and me
Just give me my town, my guy and me
My town, my guy and me
So give me my town, my guy and me
