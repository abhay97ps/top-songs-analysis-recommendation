Good girls shop, bad girls shop
Shopping, shopping, shopping
Shopping, shop, shopping
I went shopping
With a list from A to Z
Everything I needed
For a happy family
Walked through the doors
Give the box boy a smile
Grabbed a silver buggy
And I boogied down the aisle
I got A  B 
C  D 
Snapped up the frozen food
Chicken pot pie
Rolling through the produce
That's a better buy
Satisfied the munchies
With an open bag of chips
Lady with the samples says
Try it with this dip
It's good with E

Shopping
Standing in the line and
The checker said to me
If you wanna cash a check
I need two pieces of ID
Someone stole my coupons
So I said, forget the flour
They copied down my number
Said, I'll call you in an hour
