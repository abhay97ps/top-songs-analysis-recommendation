Teeny bopper, my teenage lover
I caught your wave last night
It sent my mind a-wond'rin'
You're such a groove, please don't move
Please stay in my love house by the river
Fast-talkin' guys with strange red eyes
Have put things in your head
And start your mind a-wond'rin'
I love you so, please don't go
Please stay here with me in Mendocino
Mendocino, Mendocino
Where life's such a groove
You'll blow your mind in the mornin'
We used to walk through the park
Make love along the way in Mendocino
Like I told you, can you dig it?
If you wanna groove
I'll be glad to have you
Ah, 'cause I love you so, please don't go
Please stay here with me in Mendocino
Mendocino, Mendocino
Where life's such a groove
You'll blow your mind in the mornin'
We used to walk through the park
Make love along the way in Mendocino
Mendocino
Mendocino
Mendocino
