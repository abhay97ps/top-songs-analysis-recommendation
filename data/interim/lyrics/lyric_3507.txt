Hey, girl, with sunlight in your hair 
It hurts me so to see you standing there 
O-O-Oh Sandy, you laugh and run away
You just don't care
Your kiss was warmer than the sun 
And I can't forget all the things we've done 
O-0-Oh Sandy, do you remember when
I was the one?
You've been around since
That new boy who found you
Took you uptown
So far from me
But someday, you're good times will be through 
And I know just what you're gonna do :
You'll come back, Sandy; you know I'll still be here
Waiting for you
Sandy. Sandy. I love you
