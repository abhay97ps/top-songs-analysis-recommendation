Nappy Boy, hey, with Pretty Boy, oh-oh
Hey, Nappy Boy, hey with Pretty Boy, oh-oh
Turn up the bass, turn up the treble
I'm 'bout to take you to a whole other level 
DJ, turn off what you're playing 
I want the whole club to hear what I'm saying 
Because this girl means so much to me
And now we're on the floor and she touching me
And if I wanna take her home
It's gonna be better than what they do on the radio
It's gotta be the crunkest, it's gotta be the loudest
It's gotta be the best, the best love song she ever heard in her life
I gotta tell her how I feel 
I gotta let her hear, the best love song she ever heard in her life
No need for me to write it 
I just gotta picture her smiling
And if you feel that way , go ahead and kiss your baby
Now we've got the whole stadium in love like
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Turn on the lights , give me a mic 
I'm 'bout to sing it to it just how she likes 
Jump off the stage, oh, bombs away
Crowd surfing all the way,  cowabunga
You know it's right , just do the wave 
Girl, just move your body like a snake 
And if you wanna get with me
Put your hands in the air, show me that energy
It's gotta be the crunkest, it's gotta be the loudest 
It's gotta be the best, the best love song she ever heard in her life 
I gotta tell her how I feel 
I gotta let her hear, the best love song she ever heard in her life
No need for me to write it 
I just gotta picture her smiling
And if you feel that way , go ahead and kiss your baby
Now we've got the whole stadium in love like
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
Homie kiss your girl, shorty, kiss your man
We can see you on the kissing cam
Now show me some love 
Show me some love 
Now look her in the eye , say, "Baby, I love you," 
"I never put no one above you"
And if you feel that way , go ahead and kiss your baby
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
And if you feel that way , go ahead and kiss your baby
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
