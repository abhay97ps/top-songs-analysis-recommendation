Look for the light if you're lost in the night
I'll write your name on my door
If you ever need warmth and comfort
Darlin', I'll be here to hold you near
I heard your name
'Cause you'll be my security
Love is a house, you got the key
Open up and let me into your heart , baby
Open up and let me into your heart, baby
Look in my eyes, there'll be no surprise
You'll find the window to love
And I'll do anything in my power
To welcome you and please you too
But deep in my heart 
I know you're the one for me
Love is a house, you got the key
Open up and let me into your heart , baby
Open up and let me into your heart , baby
Love's a house, love's a home, I don't wanna be alone 
In your arms , I'm happy to be
Open up, let me in , I'm hungry for your love again
You got the key , give it to me 
When the night meets the morning
I'll hear you calling my name 
And baby, you know if I answer
Things will never be the same 
But deep in my heart
I know that you're the number one for me
Love is a house, you got the key
Open up and let me into your heart , baby
Open up and let me into your heart 
Love is a house, you got the key
Open up and let me  into your heart , baby
Open up and let me into your heart 
Love is a house, you got the key 
You got the key 
Love is a house, you got the key 
You got the key 
Love is a house, love's a home , I don't wanna be alone
In your arms, I'm happy to be 
Open up , let me in, I'm hungry for your love again 
You got the key , give it to me
Love is a house 
Love is a house 
Love is a house 
You got the key 
You got the key
