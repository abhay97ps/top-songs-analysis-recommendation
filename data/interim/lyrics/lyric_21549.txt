God, I'm down here on my knees
Cause it's the last place left to fall
Beggin' for another chance
If there's any chance at all
That you might still be listenin'
Lovin' and forgivin' guys like me
I've spent my whole life gettin' it all wrong
And I sure could use your help, cause from now on
I wanna be a good man
A "do like I should" man
I wanna be the kind of man the mirror likes to see
I wanna be a strong man
And admit that I was wrong, man
God, I'm asking you to come change me
To the man I wanna be
If there's any way for her and me to make another start
Could you see what you could do
To put some love back in her heart
Cause it's going to take a miracle
After all I've done to really make her see
That I wanna be a stay man
I wanna be a great man
I wanna be the kind of man that she sees in her dreams
God, I wanna be your man
And I wanna be her man
God, I only hope she still believes
In the man I wanna be
Well, I know this late at night that talk is cheap
Lord, don't give up on me
I wanna be a givin' man
I wanna really start livin', man
God, I'm asking you to come change me
