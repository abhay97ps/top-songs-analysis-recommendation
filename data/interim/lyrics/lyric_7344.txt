Girl, my love is really strong
I can't ever really be wrong
That's a message I receive directly from God
You ain't that naive
Maybe I'll find you in Spain with your wad
For that's where my dick it is you crave
We want the same thing, baby
We basically think the same
How could I ever be taken seriously?
With me wandering into your brain
I hear you want to know if you are the one?
Is that a question?
Only one simple thing is true
I can draw a straight line between the two of you
That's you, I'm holding here
Living with the smokes, fuck bears, it's beer
As far as your question goes
There ain't no such thing as the one
It's one world, one life
We solemnly love
What may seem as redundant spasms
Are actually multiple orgasms
You make me touch ecstasy, pleasure's crest
A jolt passes down my spine when my hand is on your supple breast
You always are stubborn, looking for ways to elude
But girl I'll snap my fingers and set you in the mood
I may be rough, sometimes hard and crass
But baby its heaven when I hold that fine ass
Its an explosion of lust, love and emotions all in a boom
Baby, we made epic love in that hotel room
You call me vampire, hard, cold and pretty
I'm a different breed of monster in flesh, blood..m gritty
Thank god the room service didn't get the pen
Or else they would have heard a loud n horny Edward Cullen
We laughed and joked and the cam went click click
But baby doll it’s a different joy altogether when our bodies writhed like sweet music
You have no anger
You have no hate
You love the soul and not the money
Blessed I am to be gifted with a piece of paradise, that you honey
You made your way into my heart
My soul you did maraud
Baby Girl, I love it when you laugh, your heart pauses and says ohhh gaawwwdd...!!!
You’re my love; you’re my life, my essence of life, in the love vortex i finally did fall
My darling, my angel, my sweetheart, my maiden, you will always be my porkydoll
And I will be your satan
We want the same thing, baby
We basically think the same
How could I ever be taken seriously?
With me wandering into your brain
I hear you want to know if you are the one?
Is that a question?
Only one simple thing is true
I can draw a straight line between the two of you
That's you, I'm hoarding here
Living with the smokes, fuck bears, it's beer
As far as your question goes
There ain't no such thing as a one
It's one world, one life
We solemnly love
They can't get what they are truly after, cause it's not you
You are my concern
We will genuinely go solid, he'll be too busy to focus on you
There are games I created to get to penetrate you
But it was my greed and selfishness, I hadn't a clue
My pursuit of you doesn't change in this manhood
I was broke at the time
You told me Marshall make something out of your brokenness now, so I wrote this for you
But you don't want to read, that was the last thing on your mind too lou
I'm not a comedian to just witter and not say a thing that I wouldn't mean, with every I mean, I mean
I'm doing my best to get my life together so you find someone serious to settle with
I'll get a clap for every time I crack a joke
But then too their will be serious glares for there ain't no shitty jokes with you
All those three things are in a sync so I'll sync in with the one who doesn't want to make you into a woebegone
It was all madness, it got me waddling off for macaroons
I won't vulgarize this, it's like sugar on vanilla, it's amorous
My animus is vaporized
I'm answerable to no one, it's being in supremo command
I might have bit my tongue, but there is no suppressing thing for you
I'll open up and shout it out, get wild, maybe hurt myself too
It's a bruise, not a Bruce, a Bruce wouldn't let that happen too
I'd re-hydrate and keep saying all that happens till I die for you
Call it magical when I'm with you, till then it's nothing but how wieners maim
Check your calender for tuesdays, Mardi gras is around the corner you might want to lurk in
You think you want to look marred and out, I can see they have surrounded you, climbing you on a pyre right there to burn you
I'll take my boat to a marina and bring some water to put it out
Relax, there ain't no fire, it's the fire within you
It's burning so fast that you can't even think about your stomach too
It's so painful to see you without any loving
We want the same thing, baby
We basically think the same
How could I ever be taken seriously?
With me wandering into your brain
I hear you want to know if you are the one?
Is that a question?
Only one simple thing is true
I can draw a straight line between the two of you
That's you, I'm holding here
Living with the smokes, fuck bears, it's beer
As far as your question goes
There ain't no such thing as the one
It's one world, one life
We solemnly love
