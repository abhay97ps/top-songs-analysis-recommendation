The whisper in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Is rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes
I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender now
A love that I could not forsake
'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
Even though there may be times
I seem so far away
Don't ever wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side
I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn about the power of love
The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear so suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is so far away
'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn about the power of love
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn about the power of love
I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn about the power of love
