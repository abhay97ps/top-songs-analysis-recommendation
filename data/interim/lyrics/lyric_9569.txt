We  hold the key 
To the world's  destiny 
Have you the feeling to shine your light
Usin' the power, shinin' bright
Years we've been searchin', born to be
{Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh}
All the good thing discovers, we're able to see
Your heart's a fire, create for you, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Love and desire, hearts of two
Mmm mmm mmm ooh hoo ooh ooh ooh
Think it over , ooh
Life ain't a four leaf clover,  ooh
Think it over , ooh
Life ain't a four leaf clover, ooh 
Love is a flower, from that a bud
To spread its sunshine and make us love
Beautiful colors shinin' though
{Bless you, brother} Bless you, brother, {God is watching you} God is watching you, woo
Think it over , ooh
Life ain't a four leaf clover , ooh
Think it over , ooh
Life ain't a four leaf clover , ooh
Love is a flower, let it shine on through {Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh}
All you know where it's comin' from, God is watchin' you, oh, yes, He is
Oh, listen, this is the tower {Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh}
Let that flower bloom all over you, you, you, you, ooh ooh

To the world's  destiny

To the world's  destiny
Woo woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
