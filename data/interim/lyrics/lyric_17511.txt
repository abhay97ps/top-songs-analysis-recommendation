Ooh, hoo, hoo
Oh, hey
After spending my whole weekend
Kicking back with all my friends
Think my battery has run out
But I fight to raise my hand
And I get a little nervous
Watching day turn into night
Read another bedtime story
Before you turn out the light
Tuck me in
And hold me real right
That`s the only way I`ll know
Everything is gonna be alright
Tuck me in
Before you tell me goodnight
That`s the only way I`ll know
Everything is gonna be just fine
You wonder why I get so nervous
Wonder why I get so scared
Friend of mine I used to hang with
Has an address way up there
She was minding her own business
Trying to have herself a little fun
And she never knew what hit her
She never saw tomorrow come
Tuck me in
And hold me real right
That`s the only way I`ll know
Everything is gonna be alright
Tuck me in
Before you tell me goodnight
That`s the only way I`ll know
Everything is gonna be just fine
And I wake up in the middle
In the middle of the night
I just can`t sleep
So I hold my pillow tight
Counting backwards from a hundred
Only get to ninety-nine
When I call out to you
Tuck me in one more time
Tuck me in
Hold me tight
Don`t let go until the morning light
Tuck me in
Hold me tight
Don`t let go until the morning light
Tuck me in
And hold me real right
That`s the only way I`ll know
Everything is gonna be alright
Tuck me in
Hold me tight
Don`t let go until the morning light
Tuck me in
Hold me tight
Don`t let go until the morning light
Tuck me in
Hold me tight
