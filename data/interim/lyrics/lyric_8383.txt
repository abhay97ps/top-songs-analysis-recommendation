Finally got myself together. 
Now I know just who I am. 
Finally got myself together. 
Now I know just who I am
Felt uptight and so confused;
Felt unloved and I felt abused
I didn't know what was wrong with me
I felt like Skid Row was my destiny
And I'm a changed man
Finally got myself together 
Now I know just who I am 
Finally got myself together 
Now I know just who I am 
A little smoke, got a little drink
Kept my head bad, so I couldn't think
Love came along late one night
And I finally see the light
I'm a changed man
Finally got myself together 
Now I know just who I am 
Finally got myself together 
Now I know just who I am 
Look at the smile on my face 
Just look at the smile on my face 
Don't just glance as you walk by 
Look me straight in my eye 
Finally got myself together 
Now I know just who I am 
Finally got myself together 
Now I know just who I am 
Finally got myself together 
Now I know just who I am 
Finally got myself together 
Now I know just who I am 
Finally got myself together
