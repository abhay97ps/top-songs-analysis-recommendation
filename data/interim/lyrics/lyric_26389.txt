Will I ever love the same way again? 
Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you?
Never thought you'd be so damn hard to replace
I swear it don't need to be this way
If I can't have you, is love completely off the table?
Do I sit this one out and wait for the next life? 
Am I too cold? Am I not nice?
Might not be quite yet healed already
Should I be goin' too steady? 
But I just wanna know is love completеly off the table?
Will you be thеre? 
Can I still love you? 
Not yet healed or ready 
Should I be goin' too steady? 
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
I'll wait for you
Even though it always feels like I'll be number two
To someone you can't hold anymore
If you let me in, I'm ready to give you what I couldn't before
'Cause I got you, girl, let me help you through it
You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it 
I can love you harder than I did before
Was in a dark place back then
I was toxic, then I was toxic to someone else
I was haunted by the hills 
I couldn't give you my all, but I will
If you let me in your arms 
If you let me in your heart
I don't think that love's completely off the table
Will you be there? 
Can I still love you? 
Not yet healed or ready 
Should I be goin' too steady? 
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
So can you hold me?
If I let you, can you prove it to me? 
'Cause I need you to calm me down, babe
Gotta get out of my head 
Tryna be here from this bed 
Just wanna know, just wanna know, know, know, baby 
Can you touch it like you believe in it, baby? 
Let me think you never gonna leave on me, baby
'Cause I ain't her and you ain't him, thankfully 
But it's gon' be hard to let someone else in again 
Baby, baby 
Will you be there? 
Can I still love you? 
Not yet healed or ready 
Should I be goin' too steady? 
Just wanna know is love completely off the table, baby?
I swear, I swear
I will wait for you whenever you need
Ooh, ooh
