You...have been single for a long time
And I don't wanna cramp your style
Still you insist you want to settle down
But I know better
You can't change years overnight
And asking that, I would never do
So here is the solution that comes to mind
As long as I can be your number one
You still can have your fun
Whenever you need love
I will give it to you
Just the way you like it
You keep your other girls
Until you settle down
Whenever you get bored
I will give it to you
Just the way you like it
I...have never had a guy
Who has as many girls as you
But numbers cannot take the place of quality
I have no doubt
By this decision to see us through
And my love is so strong for you
And by your side I always will remain
As long as I can be your number one
You still can have your fun
Whenever you need love
I will give it to you
Just the way you like it
You keep your other girls
Until you settle down
Whenever you get bored
I will give it to you
Just the way you like it
Just the way you like it
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
Just the way you like it
Ooh-ooh...
If you...plan on loving me for a lifetime
It doesn't matter what you do
With other girls, they just can't change your mind
 'Cause when you're tired of them
You'll come back to me
I won't tie you down
You can play around
'Cause you know where the best love is found
Right here
As long as I can be your number one
You still can have your fun
Whenever you need love
I will give it to you
Just the way you like it
You keep your other girls
Until you settle down
Whenever you get bored
I will give it to you
Just the way you like it
As long as I can be your number one
You still can have your fun
Whenever you need love
(Anytime, anywhere
Just for you, I'll be there
Anyway you want it)
You keep your other girls
Until you settle down
Whenever you get bored
(I'll be there on the casee
Keep a smile on your face
Just the way you like it)
As long as I can be your number one

Whenever you need love

Just the way, just the way you like it)
