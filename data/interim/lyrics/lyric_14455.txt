This is not an easy life
It's hard to hang on to hope
There's so many things that need to change
Well I wonder how we'll cope
But I know where to go
Run away, run away
And lose myself inside a dream
Opening up a secret door
I lose myself inside a dream
And find a world worth living for 
There is way too much to grasp
Am I losing hold
In a world full of many problems
I feel no control
Only a dreamer
Can keep the dream alive
I'll work and pray and sweat and slave
Until the dream is realized
