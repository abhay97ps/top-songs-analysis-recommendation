When there's a shadow you reach for the sun
When there is love then you look for the one
And for the promises there is the sky
And for the heavens are those who can fly
If you really want to you can hear me say
Only if you want to will you find a way
If you really want to you can seize the day
Only if you want to will you fly away
Da-da duh-da, da-da-da duh-da
Da-da duh-da, da-da-da duh-da
Da-da duh-da, da-da-da duh-da
Da-da duh da
When there's a journey you follow a star
When there's an ocean you sail from afar
And for the broken heart there is the sky
And for tomorrow are those who can fly
If you really want to you can hear me say
Only if you want to will you find a way
If you really want to you can seize the day
Only if you want to will you fly away
Da-da duh-da, da-da-da duh-da
Da-da duh-da, da-da-da duh-da
Da-da duh da
If you really want to you can hear me say
Only if you want to will you find a way
If you really want to you can seize the day
Only if you want to will you fly away
Ah! Je voudrais voler
Comme un oiseau d'aile
Ah! Je voudrais voler
Comme un oiseau d'aile, d'aile...
If you really want to you can hear me say
Only if you want to will you find a way
If you really want to you can seize the day
Only if you want to will you fly away
If you really want to you can seize the day
Only if you want to will you fly away
