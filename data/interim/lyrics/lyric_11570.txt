When I came home last night
You wouldn't make love to me
You went fast asleep
You wouldn't even talk to me
You say I'm so crazy
Coming home intoxicated
I said I just wanna love ya
Guess that's why I'm so elated
C'mon, girl
Give it to me, baby 
Give it to me, baby 
I betcha, I'll make you holler you had enough
Give it to me, baby 
Just give it to me, baby
Give it to me, baby 
I betcha, I'll make you holler you had enough
Give it to me
Give me that stuff, that funk, that sweet, that funky stuff
Give it to me
Give me that stuff, that funk, that sweet, that funky stuff
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me that stuff, that sweet, funky stuff
Yo...HO! OW!
Give it to me, baby
When I was high as the sky
Out all night just dancing
You say let's go home
That's the time I start romancin'
You say "How can I love ya?
When your body keeps on moving?"
I say "Wait 'til I squeeze you" 
Maybe then you'll start to groovin'
C'mon, girl
Give it to me, baby 
Give it to me, baby 
I betcha, I'll make you holler you had enough
Give it to me, baby 
Just give it to me, baby
Give it to me, baby 
I betcha, I'll make you holler you had enough
Give it to me
Give me that stuff, that funk, that sweet, that funky stuff
Give it to me
Give me that stuff, that funk, that sweet, that funky stuff
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me that stuff, that sweet, funky stuff
Yo...HO! OW!
Hey, girl
Give it to me, what you say
Give it to me, what you say
 what you say

Hey, girl
Give it to me, what you say
Give it to me, what you say
Hey, girl
Give it to me, what you say
Give it to me, what you say
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, what you say
Give it to me right away
Give it to me, give it to me
Hey, girl
Give it to me, what you say
Give it to me, what you say
Give it to me, give it to me
