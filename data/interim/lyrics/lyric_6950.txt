Those old bad dreams
Been sleeping in your head
Those old dark clouds
Been hanging around your head
But all your hard times
Will vanish in the wind
When the mighty clouds of joy
Come rolling in
Ohhhh, Holy Jesus
Let your love seize us
Oh, let us find sweet peace within
Hallelujah!
Happiness begins
When the mighty clouds of joy
Come rolling in
Those old storm clouds
Are slowly drifting by
And those old raindrops
Are fading from your eyes
And oh, Mr. Sun
Gonna shine on us again
When the mighty clouds of joy
Come rolling in
Ohhhh, Holy Jesus
Let your love seize us
Oh, let us find sweet peace within
Hallelujah!
Happiness begins
When the mighty clouds of joy
Come rolling in
Holy Jesus
WonÂ´t you let your love seize us
Let us find sweet peace within
Hallelujah!
Happiness begins
When the mighty clouds of joy
Come rolling in
