It's been a happy day
Try not to spoil it now
Please don't get hung up that way
Oh, he's not the boy for you
And I think you know it's true
Kiss him and don't start to cry
'Cause you're having a pipe dream, an ordinary pipe dream
Now you see him flashing right before your eyes
You're having a sweet dream, a lifelong sweet dream
I'm the one who loves you, can't you see it's me?
Pipe dream
Pipe dream
Come back to reality
Now, in your mind there's always me
That's the way it's gonna be
Kiss him and tell him goodbye
I say you won't have to dream tonight
Tomorrow you might be clear and bright
I think the pipe's going out
'Cause you're having a pipe dream, an ordinary pipe dream
Now you see him flashing right before your eyes
You're having a sweet dream, a lifelong sweet dream
I'm the one who loves you, can't you see it's me?
Pipe dream
Pipe dream
Come back to reality
Hey, coming back to reality
