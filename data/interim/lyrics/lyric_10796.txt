Ooh, I'm wishin'
Boy, I got my eyes on you
This mystery is thrillin'
I'm not sure just what to do
Ooh-hoo-hoo, this oasis
It is no mirage to me
Touchin' gently
Feel the love in me
Tell me, what you gonna do with my lovin'?
I'm crazy 'bout your smilin' eyes
What you gonna do with my lovin'?
Please don't make me fantasize
What you gonna do with my lovin'?
Tell me now, oh
So hard lovin' daydreams
All my pleasure's make believe
But with you as my daydream
I never want to leave
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, this feeling
Shines like a precious jewel
And here, if you want me
All my love is for you
Tell me, what you gonna do with my lovin'?
I'm crazy 'bout your smilin' eyes
What you gonna do with my lovin'?
Please don't make me fantasize
What you gonna do with my lovin'?
Tell me now, oh, tell me now
What you gonna do, what you gonna do? 
What you gonna do? 
Come on
Tell me
What you gonna do, what you gonna do? 
What you gonna do? 
Tell me, tell me, oh
What you gonna do, what you gonna do? 
What you gonna do? 
Ah, ah, ah
Oh, tell me, baby
What you gonna do, what you gonna do? 
What you gonna do?
