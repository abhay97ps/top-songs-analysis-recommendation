The other night
As I lay sleeping
Whoah, I dreamed I held you
Held you in my arms
Well, but when I woke up this morning
I found out I was mistaken
Do you know that I hung my
I hung my head and cried
Whoah you are my sunshine
Ohh, my only sunshine
Well, little girl you make me happy sometimes
When my skies are grey
Umm, you'll never never never know dear
How much I love you
Whoa, and I don't want you to take
My sunshine away
You told me once, dear
That you really loved me
And no one else
Could ever come between, yeah
But now you left me and you love another, yeah
And you have shattered, oh yeah
All of my dreams
Whoah you are my sunshine
Ohh, my only sunshine
Ohh, you make me happy sometimes
When my skies are grey
Whoa, you'll never never never know dear
How much I love you
Whoa, and I don't want you to take
Whoa, if you love me
Umm-hmm, if you need me
Uh-huh if you want me
Waaaahh! Listen
I don't want you to take
Waaaahh! Listen
I don't want you to take
Whoah, my sunshine away
