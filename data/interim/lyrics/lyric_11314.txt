Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
Because we've only just begun
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
You would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
Would be jammin' until the the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin' jam on
You ask me am I happy
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
Because we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star
You didn't know that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Don't you stop the music, oh no
Na, na na...
Nobody told you Oh, Oh, Oh, you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you if someone approached you
Yesterday to tell you that you would be jammin' you would not believe it because you never thought that you would be jammin'
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, You may as well believe what you are feeling
Because you feel your body jammin'
Oh, Oh, you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
