I got into the rocket ship to see the Martian hop
I saw the place a-shining red so there I made my stop
But as I opened up the door and climbed the ladder down
I saw the Martians on the floor a-dancing to this sound
Eeeeee-ee-ee
Ee-ee the Martian hop
Eeeeee-ee-ee
Ee-ee-ee-ee
It seemed I was the first one there and so I was surprised
To see the Martians twist and stomp before my very eyes
They did the loco-motion and the hully gully, too
I couldn't name a single dance the Martians wouldn't do
Eeeeee-ee-ee
Ee-ee the Martian hop
Eeeeee-ee-ee
Ee-ee-ee-ee
Eeeeee-ee-ee
Ee-ee-ee-ee
Eeeeee-ee-ee
Ee-ee-ee-ee
And right around the stroke of twelve the dance had just begun
The Earth kids parked their spaceship down on Mars to have some fun
And so I left my friends, the Martians, stomping on the ground
And even though I'm back on Earth I still can hear this sound
Eeeeee-ee-ee
Ee-ee the Martian hop
Eeeeee-ee-ee
Ee-ee-ee-ee
