Stars fall at my feet, keep me grounded as I reach
Higher than I see, is there something there for me?
Pulling back the reins, letting go again
I'm not afraid, I'm not
All my life, one page at a time
I'll show you my, my true colors
And no-n-no, I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't your rainbow
A promise with a lie is broken by design
And what I thought I knew has been swallowed by the truth
It's time to light the flame, right before it rains
I'm not afraid, I'm not
All my life, one page at a time
I'll show you my, my true colors
And no-n-no, I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't your rainbow
Something tells me I know nothing at all
I've escaped my capture and I have no master
And somehow it's like I've waited
All my life, one page at a time
I'll show you my, my true colors
And no-n-no, I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't your rainbow
It ain't your rainbow, it ain't your rainbow
It ain't your rainbow
