Who's that calling?
Who's that who can show the way?
The child inside
The child inside
Who's that calling?
Ne ho ye yehe hiyo
Ne ho yehe yehe ha
Ne ho ye yehe hiyo
Ne ho ne ho neheya heyeh
Who's that dying
Trying for a space
In the cage you call your life
Who's that crying
Crying out just what it is
You've thrown away
The child inside
The child who lives still in your eyes
Ne ho ye yehe hiyo
Ne ho yehe yehe ha
Ne ho ye yehe hiyo
Ne ho ne ho neheya heyeh
Who's that dancing
Laughing, crying, living
Every day by day by day by day
The child inside
Its the child who lives still in your eyes
Ne ho ye yehe hiyo
Ne ho yehe yehe ha
Ne ho ye yehe hiyo
Ne ho ne ho neheya heyeh
Secret of the sun is in your eyes
Take the power from your dreams and fly
Children know it's magic
That makes the world go round
Secret of the sun is in your eyes
Take the power from your dreams and fly
Children know it's magic
That makes the world go round
Ne ho ye yehe hiyo
Ne ho yehe yehe ha
Ne ho ye yehe hiyo
Ne ho ne ho neheya heyeh
Ne ho ye yehe hiyo
Ne ho yehe yehe ha
Ne ho ye yehe hiyo
Ne ho ne ho neheya heyeh
Who's that calling?
Who's that who can show the way?
The child inside
The child inside
