Cartman:	Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...
Kyle:	What is this, Cartman?
Cartman:	They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
Stan:	Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
Cartman:	Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday...
Kyle:	Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.
Cartman:	That's right.
Stan:	Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too.
Cartman:	That's ri-aayy.
Pip:	Oh, Eric. I didn't get an invitation.
Cartman:	 Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember!  I shoved it up my ass!  Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap!  Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde...
Mr. Garrison:	 Children, children! Today is a very special day.
Cartman:	No, my birthday isn't until Saturday.
Mr. Garrison:	I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today.
Cartman:	Eeeeeeh!
Mr. Garrison:	Now, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town, so I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate...  uh-uh, what's your name again?
New kid:	Damien! 
Mr. Garrison:	Say 'hi' to Damien!  And where are you from, Damien?
Damien:	The seventh layer of hell!
Mr. Garrison:	Ooooh, that's exciting, my mother was from Alabama. 
Damien:	My arrival shall note the end of the Beginning, the beginning of the End, the new reign of my father! 
Mr. Garrison:	Your father?
Damien:	The Prince of Darkness!
Mr. Garrison:	Wow, we have royalty in our class. Why don't you take your seat, Damien? We're gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque era.  Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass...
Cartman:	Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?
Damien:	Here begins the rule of pain! The new domination of...
Cartman:	Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?  Byah. Oof! 
Stan:	Whoa, dude! 
Kyle:	Damn, what a freak!
Cartman:	 Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk! 
Damien:	Now feel the wrath - of the fallen angels! The plague of night is upon ye.
Mr. Garrison:	Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes? 
Cartman:	Eheh. You got in trouble, you got in trouble.
Stan:	Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?
Kyle:	Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.
Cartman:	Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
Stan:	Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
Kyle:	Yeah, that's weak!
Cartman:	Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?
Stan:	Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. 
Cartman:	Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mon's cake, pie, and ice cream, then.
Stan:	Oh great, Green Mega Man it is. 
Cartman:	Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is. 
Stan:	Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?
Cartman:	Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!
Damien:	Infidels! I will turn you all into beasts of burden!
Kyle:	You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table! 
Cartman:	Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.  Eeyy!
Pip:	 Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me.
Damien:	Then I will call you Pip.
Pip:	Right-o.
Stan:	Hey new kid!  Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.
Kenny:	
Damien:	That does it! Woo-paah 
Stan:	What the... ?
Kyle:	Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
Stan:	A what?
Kenny:	Quack-quack.
Cartman:	Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butthole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!
Chef:	 Hello there, children.
Stan:	Hey, Chef.
Chef:	How's it going?
Kyle:	Bad.
Chef:	Why bad?
Kyle:	Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.
Chef:	Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song:
We're all special in our own way
Everybody's different, but that's okay
'Cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin
Different points of view, be tall or thin
It doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin
With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been
Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...
What were we talking about again?
Kyle:	The new kid.
Damien:	 Death to the holy! The wrath of the fallen angels now heads for you all! 
Stan:	Whoa!
Chef:	Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker! 
Kyle:	We told you, dude. 
Chef:	We've got to do something, children! 
Damien:	Bring me Jesus! My wrath shall continue until I speak to Jesus! 
Stan, Kyle:	Jesus?
Roland:	Two minutes to air, Jesus.
Jesus:	Thanks, Roland. Blessed art thou. 
Stan:	Jesus, Jesus!
Jesus:	Ah-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show.
Stan:	Nono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.
Kyle:	Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny.
Kenny:	Quack-quack.
Jesus:	Wow. That's pretty heavy.
Stan:	This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.
Jesus:	The Dark Prince?
Stan:	Yeah.
Kyle:	Yeah.
Jesus:	So it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One.
Stan:	 Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
Jesus:	Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth.
Kyle:	... K.
Groundskeeper:	Five minutes until recess is over, you little bastards!
Cartman:	Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Choopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money... 
Redhead:	Aaaaa Bebe!
Bebe:	Our slide!
Damien:	Feel my wrath! 
Pip:	 Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday.
Damien:	I don't need acceptance. I'm the Son of Satan! 
Pip:	Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely. 
Jesus:	Damien!
Damien:	Aaah! Son of Stench! Cursed Ruler of the weak!
Jesus:	So it is thou, Son of Lucifer!
Damien:	Your time on this earth is short. Soon, my father comes.
Jesus:	Let him come then. I shall stop him!
Damien:	Behold! He is already upon us! 
Kyle:	Ohh, dude!
Satan:	Hic dominus ampullicus unum sum. Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus. 
Jimbo:	What the hell's going on here? 
Priest:	Look! It's that guy from the public access show!
Blonde:	What's happening?
Chef:	Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!  Not you, dammit!
Satan:	Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.
Damien:	Jesus, my father says... he chooses you! He calls you out! Be here at this time tomorrow! Then the terms will be discussed!
Jesus:	Very well. Let the final battle between Good and Evil be fought - right here in South Park!
Jimbo:	Come on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie! 
Stan:	You're gonna fight Satan?
Jesus:	This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history.

Man in crowd:	Damn.
Satan:	I have such delightful horrors to unleash upon thee.

Satan:	Let the new prince be decided on Saturday. First South Park, then the world. 
Jimbo:	 Well-uh... I think I'll-uh uuduh-I think I left the oven on.

Priest:	Uh-ssee ya - Saturday - Jesus. Good luck. 
Man 1:	Change my bet!
Man 2:	I'm betting on the Devil!
Jimbo:	I wanna change my bet to Satan.
Ned:	Me, too.
Mr. Garrison:	Wai-wa I was here first.
Mr. Mackey:	Now, uh, as your counselor, I want you to feel like you can tell me anything. mkay? Uh, being the new kid can be tough, but I'm your friend, mkay?
Damien:	Everybody hates me!
Mr. Mackey:	Well-uh. Why do you suppose that is?
Damien:	Because I'm the son of the Devil?
Mr. Mackey:	Uhuh. That's a good start, why else?
Damien:	Because I... burn them and kill them?
Mr. Mackey:	Well yeah, maybe that's it. Wha... wha what you need to do, uh Damien, is - is to be overly nice. Nde no no matter how mean the other kids are to you, just don't retaliate. Yeeu be passive, mkay? That's what I taught the little British boy, Pip, and, and just look at how much the other children like him now.
Clyde:	I bet I can spit the most on him. 
Bebe:	Oh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair. 
Pip:	Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.
Stan:	Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'
Cartman:	 Oh, here comes the unholy butthole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!
Damien:	I a - pologize for ruining your playground. And turning your friend into a duck-billed platypus. I was doing my father's bidding. I didn't have a choice. 
Cartman:	 Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice! 
Stan:	Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.
Kyle:	Yeah. We're gonna call you Fartboy from now on.
Stan:	Bubye, Fartboy.
Kyle:	See ya.
Pip:	Good day, Damien. How are you?
Damien:	Those guys farted on me, and then called me-
Pip:	Fartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call me that anymore.
Jesus:	Ahm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar-
Chef:	Oh ooh. 
Jesus:	I have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning.  In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me!
Priest:	You should all be ashamed of yourselves, betting against your Lord and Savior! I am disgusted!
Jesus:	Your bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too!
Priest:	Oho... Right, well... He does have a couple of hundred pounds on you, Jesus.
Jesus:	I implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win.
Priest:	Jesus, I am sorry I have sinned against you. I'm gonna march right over to that bookie and change my bet right now!
Mr. Garrison:	Oh, ye- yeah, yeah, me too, me too.
Jimbo:	Yeah.
Priest:	Praise the Lo-hohohord! Thank you sweet Jesus for showing us the light! See ya later.  What the hell, does he think we're all crazy?
Mr. Garrison:	Yeah, crazy. 
Man 3:	He's so gay.
Man 4:	Yeah. 
Jesus:	You're all a bunch of Judases!
Stan:	Hey, Jesus.
Jesus:	What are you doing out so late, kids?
Kyle:	We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
Jesus:	Oh. Kids, yeyou believe I can beat Satan, right?
Stan:	Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God.
Kyle:	Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?
Jesus:	No, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little?
Reporter 1:	Satan, what do expect the outcome of the fight to be?
Satan:	I will crush him like a little bug!
Reporter 2:	Satan, what about the rumors of your involvement in the Gulf War? 
Don King:	Let's focus on the fight, can we please? I'm so sick of people talkin' smack about my fighters, all this 'He's mean. He's a dirty fighter. He's the cause for all the violence and death in the world.' It's just getting old. Let's just let everything be decided in the ring.
Cartman:	You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?
Stan:	Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs.
Jesus:	No way, dude!
Chef:	 Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.
Stan:	But you're his sparring partner, Chef.
Kyle:	Yeah, you have to hit him.
Jesus:	Satan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train.
Chef:	Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?
Jesus:	Give it your best sho-  Oh! 
Chef:	Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!
Jesus:	Anybody get the number of that truck? 
Liane:	Come on, kiddies. Eat more.
Cartman:	 Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.
Chef:	Yup! Here's your present, children.  Well, uhnice party. Uh, see ya later.
Kyle:	Hey, you just got here, Chef!
Chef:	I know, but the fight is starting.
Stan:	Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.
Mrs Cartman:	 Mmmmm.
Chef:	Mmmmm. That's my favorite kind of chili.
Damien:	I guess all the kids are at that fat boy's party.
Pip:	Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there.
Damien:	The other kids have always hated you?
Pip:	Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me. 
Michael Buffer:	In the blue corner, wearing white trunks, weighing in at a mere 140 lbs., Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!  And in the very very blllack corner, wearing very very blllack trunks, the king of all that is evilll, Beeeeeelzebub!  Ladies and gentlemen, Lllllet's get ready to rumbllllle!!
Referee:	Okay, I want a good clean fight guys. No punches below the belt, holding, or miracles. 
Cartman:	Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?
Stan:	Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid.
Kyle:	And neither were you, Pip!
Pip:	Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-
Damien:	Wait a minute! Give me a chance. I want to do something special for your party. 
Pip:	 Aaaa!  Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee! 
Kyle:	Wow!
Stan:	Whoa, that was cool! 
Kyle:	Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.
Cartman:	Yeah. Come on in and join the party. 
Satan:	Come on, you little wuss, fight! Throw a punch!
Cartman:	Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now.  And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy. Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS? 
Kyle:	It's a game, dude. It's really fun.
Cartman:	YOU SON OF A BITCH! 
Kyle:	 Aaaaa!
Cartman:	YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! 
Kyle:	They were all out of 'em dude!
Cartman:	I HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!
Kyle:	 Aaaaaaaa!
Cartman:	 That's it! Party is over!  Everybody go home!  GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT! 
Stan:	Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!
Cartman:	Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! 
Damien:	Wow. That kid has some emotional problems.
Stan:	Aaanh, he does this all the time.
Chef:	Come on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!
Pip:	 Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty.
Jesus:	Oh! 
Satan:	Fight, dammit! 
Jesus:	Oow!  Ooooooh! 
Stan:	 Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked!  You've got to fight, Jesus.
Jesus:	Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on Satan. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook.
Kyle:	Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.
Jesus:	It doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up.
Stan:	Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!
Kyle:	Uuuuh. Stan?
Stan:	Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!
Kyle:	Stan.
Stan:	She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
Kyle:	Stan!
Stan:	 What?
Kyle:	Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.
Stan:	 ... Really?
Kyle:	Yeah, dude!
Stan:	Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.  You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'
Jesus:	... Who said that?
Stan:	You did, Jesus. 
Jesus:	You're right, Stan. Thank you, boys! 
Kyle:	Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
Stan:	Nah, I saw it on Star Trek.
Kyle:	Hmmm.
Satan:	 Come on, sissy. Hit me! Hit me!
Jesus:	Okay, pal. You asked for it! 
Satan:	 Ooooooh, you got me. 
Referee:	One... Two... Three...
Jimbo:	No way! He barely touched him!
Referee:	... Seven... Eight ... Nine... Ten. You're out! 
Stan, Kyle:	Our Savior!
Michael Buffer:	The winner by knockout and still undisputed ruler of your spiritual kingdommmm, Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ! 
Mr. Garrison:	Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!
Jimbo:	Yeah!
Satan:	Fools! You are all fools! Of course I took a dive. Don't you see? Who do you think was the one person that bet on Jesus to win?  Me, you idiots! And now I will take all your hard-earned money, and return to Hell a much richer Prince of Darkness, and buy some realty. HA HA HA HA HAA! 
Priest:	I don't believe this!
Mr. Garrison:	Yeah, what a mean thing to do!
Satan:	 Farewell, fools!
Jimbo:	Man, that guy is a jerk. 
Stan:	 Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
Mr. Garrison:	Boy, did we get screwed.
Chef:	Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?
Jesus:	Aw heck.  Do I have a choice? 
Jimbo:	Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus!  Ih-it's comin' right for us! 
Stan:	Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
Kyle:	You bastard!
Damien:	Well, goodbye, guys. It was nice getting to know you. 
Stan:	You're leaving already?
Damien:	I have to. My dad's always on the move. 
Stan:	Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
Kyle:	Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
Stan:	Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
Liane:	More pie, hon?
Cartman:	Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.
