Sing it out, boy, you've got to see what tomorrow brings
Sing it out, girl, you've got to be what tomorrow needs
For every time that they want to count you out
Use your voice every single time you open up your mouth
Sing it for the boys, sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it, sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart, sing it till you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf, sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
Sing it out, boy, they're going to sell what tomorrow means
Sing it out, girl, before they kill what tomorrow brings
You've got to make a choice if the music drowns you out
And raise your voice every single time they try and shut your mouth
Sing it for the boys, sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it, sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart, sing it till you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf, sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
Cleaned-up corporation progress, dying in the
Process, children that can talk about it, living on the
Web-ways, people moving sideways, tell it till your
Last days, buy yourself a motivation, generation
Nothing! Nothing but a dead scene, product of a
White dream, I am not the singer that you wanted, but a
Dancer, I refuse to answer, talk about the
Past, sir, wrote it for the ones who want to get away
Keep running!
Sing it for the boys, sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart, sing it till you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf, sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
Got to see what tomorrow brings, sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
Girl, you've got to be what tomorrow needs, sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
