Misty sunrise in my hometown
Rows of cotton about knee high
Mrs. Baker down the dirt road
Still got clothes out on the line
Erwin Nichols there
With Judsley playin checkers at the gin
When I dream about the Southland
This is where it all begins
From Carolina down to Georgia
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama
Roll Tide Roll
Muddy water Mississippi
Blessed Graceland whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet Southern comfort, carry on
Catching catfish on the river
Chasing fireflies by the creek
Kissing Gabby Williams' sister
On the porch homecoming week
With rusted cars and weeping willows
Keeping watch out in the yard
Just a snapshot of downhome Dixie
Could be anywhere you are
In Carolina or in Georgia
Open arms are waiting for you
Louisiana
Yellow Rose of San Antone
Arkansas
Mississippi
Old man river whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet Southern comfort, carry on
As I sit here
I'm surrounded by these priceless memories
I don't have to think about it
There's no place I'd rather be
Than
Carolina or in Georgia
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama Roll Tide Roll
Muddy water Mississippi
Blessed Graceland whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet Southern comfort
Carry on, carry on
Sweet Southern comfort, carry on
