I don't know why
Don't know why that I torture myself
Overact and draw conclusions of truth
Sometimes I hate myself for wanting you but then
You only have to say you love me
To make it worth it
You only have to say you love me
And I'm flying flying
So many times I try
To find a way that I
Will never be denied
To your world
I put aside my pride
Cross the great divide
I wanna stay inside
In your world
I don't know why
Don't know why that I torture myself
Overact and draw conclusions of truth
Sometimes I hate myself for wanting you but then
You only have to say you love me
To make it worth it
You only have to say you love me
And I'm flying flying
You only have to say you love me
To make it worth it
You only have to say you love me
And I'm flying flying
Love me
Love me
You only have to say you love me
So many times you say
There's gonna come a day
Your heart will always stay
By my side
Why do I act so foolishly
Need you to notice me
Why can't I love you patiently
I don't know why don't know why
That I torture myself
Overact and draw conclusions of truth
Sometimes I hate myself for wanting you but then
You only have to say you love me
To make it worth it
You only have to say you love me
And I'm flying flying
You only have to say you love me
To make it worth it
You only have to say you love me
And I'm flying flying
And I'm flying flying
