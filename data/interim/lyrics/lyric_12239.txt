You told me you loved me
So I don't understand
Why promises are snapped in two
And words are made to bend
Some stolen from Japan
Collected from around the world
They'll catch you if they can
Lies lies lies yeah
Lies lies lies yeah
Lies lies lies yeah
Lies lies lies yeah
Do I have to catch you out
To know what's on your mind?
Well, Cleopatra died for Egypt
What a waste of time
White ones and red ones
And some you can't disguise
Twisted truth and half the news
Can't hide it in your eyes
Lies lies lies yeah
Lies lies lies yeah
Lies lies lies yeah
Lies lies lies yeah
You say you'll try harder
But I think it's just too late
Well the car is revving in the drive
And I'm not the sort to wait
Some nicked from old Saigon
Collected from around the world
Love lies on and an and on and on and on and
Lies lies lies yeah 
Lies lies lies yeah 
Lies lies lies yeah 
Lies lies lies yeah
Oh you know I know
Lies lies lies yeah
