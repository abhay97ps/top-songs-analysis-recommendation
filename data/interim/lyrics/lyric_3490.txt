I'm tryin hard to forget
That you've been cheatin'
Wishing, you I had never met
'Cause you've been cheatin'
Did you know lies
Can be seen in your eyes
And from wrong you'll never be free
No use in cryin'
You've been lyin'
You've been cheatin', cheatin' on me
Yeah, you make me suspect and I know 
You don't want me
Cookies crumble and that's how it go 
You don't want me
Did you know lies
Can be seen in your eyes
And from wrong you'll never be free
No use in cryin'
You've been lyin'
You've been cheatin', cheatin' on me
Yeah-eh
Another lover, you discover
Our loves gone and I don't know why
It's just as well though, at last I do know
All said was just a lie
So I'm tryin' hard to forget 
You've been cheatin'
Wishing, you I had never met
'Cause you've been cheatin'
Did you know lies
Can be seen in your eyes
And from wrong you'll never be free
No use in cryin'
You've been lyin'
You've been cheatin', cheatin' on me
Whoo baby 
You must not love me 
You must not love me 
You just don't care
