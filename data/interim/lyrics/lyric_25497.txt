Ah

Oh, yeah
Mama had five boys, me, I was the middle child
By the age of 13, bitch, I was young and wild
Caught my first case, then I got kicked out my mama house
Got nowhere to stay, bitch, I'm runnin' in your fuckin' house 
With them 30s out , fuck you talkin' 'bout? 
Yeah, ridin' 'round 'round the city, I swear I'm lurking out 
Really I'm high as  shit, I'm off a Perky now 
Huh, nigga run up on me, I'ma blow eem down
So much cash in my jeans, Louis V, pocket wallet
Niggas hate, niggas bitches, niggas bitches, pocket watchin'
Uh, not talkin' 'bout no pistol, talkin' 30s now 
Hey, hey, 30s now, 30 bands, 30 now 
Pussy nigga always talkin', why the fuck these niggas talkin'?

Huh, yeah, catch a opp outta bounds and we gon' burn eem down 
Burn eem down, 30 rounds, hunnid rounds 
Hold up, niggas don't want no smoke
Roll up, dead niggas when I smoke
Bad bitch, she put it all in her throat
She suck my dick while I float in the Ghost
New bustdown, yeah, my wrist is on froze 
These niggas is hoes, I keep me a pole

Slimin' like I'm drippin' snot from my nose 
You know I came from the mud with this 
They never showed me no love with this

Was selling them drugs and shit 
They used to be on some other shit 
Now they see me coming up and shit 
I tell them leeches to suck a dick 
Nowadays they see me dubbin' shit
