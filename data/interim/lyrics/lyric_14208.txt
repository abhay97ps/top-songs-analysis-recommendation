They tell me, Gladys, you know you love too hard
But I tell 'em, not nearly hard enough
They say, girlfriend, you know you go too far
Around the world ain't far enough
'Cause I only wanna show you what you mean to me
Every time I'm reachin' out to you I start to sink
I may be drowning with desire from your sweet, sweet touch
I don't care what people say 'cause I love you so much
Love overboard 
My love's in need of help
Love overboard 
I sure can't help myself
Love overboard 
I don't know what to do
Love overboard 
I'm so in love with you, baby
Baby, they say I work too hard
Not really, when it comes to lovin' you
You've got my overtime
You bring me peace of mind
And there's so much more I'd like to do
I only wanna find the love my heart's been searchin' for
I'd climb most every mountain swim from shore to shore
Just to feel the soft caressin' from your warm embrace
In this ocean of love, no one can take your place
Love overboard 
Oh, my love's in need of help
Love overboard 
Sure can't help myself
Love overboard 
I don't know what to do
Love overboard 
So in love with you
Love overboard 
I'm running out of time
Love overboard 
I'm 'bout to lose my mind
Love overboard 
I don't know what to do
Love overboard 
I'm so in love with you
All my friends keep telling me to let you go , babe
Between the two of us how could they ever know
About the love you been givin'?
Seems some people like to live their life so very close
I like to let go sometime
So I can flow with the time
I've done made up my mind
You're the only one for me
Oh, my love's overboard
I'm so in love with you
Spinnin'
Fallin'
Deeper
Aah, deeper
Love's callin' 
I'm fallin'
S-O-S-O-S-O-S-O-S
Love's overboard 
My love's in need of help
Love overboard 
Sure can't help myself
Love overboard 
I don't know what to do
Love overboard
