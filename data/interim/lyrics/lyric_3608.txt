Rain, rain, rain, rain
My tears keep tumbling down
I haven't seen my baby
Since I left this town
Rain, rain, rain, rain
My pillows soaking wet
You broke my heart
And I ain't over it yet
Rain, rain, rain, rain
Like to see my girl again
Rain, rain, rain, rain
Why'd you cause me so much pain
Rain, rain, rain, rain
My pillows soaking wet
You broke my heart
And caused me so much pain
Rain, rain, rain, rain
Like to see my girl again
Rain, rain, rain, rain
I wanna see you again
Please rain, come on, rain
Why'd you cause me so much pain
You broke my heart
And you caused me so much pain
Rain, rain, rain, rain
Like to see my girl again
Rain, rain, rain, rain
I wanna see you again
