Tell me where does the lovin’ go when it’s gone away
Tell me when does the heartache end, or is it bound to stay
I always thought that we would last forever;
A love that never ever would be ending
Now I see it isn’t meant to be and I’ve got to stop pretending
Tell me where are all the things that we used to share
Are they lost to some other time? Will they still be there?
I can’t believe that my place could be taken
A heart so easy breakin’ up inside
‘Cause after all this time I’ve thought of you as mine
And it’s hard to let go, my heart says no
I never knew we were losing touch
I didn’t think we could change so much
Don’t take your leave of me just yet;
Smile for me once more, so I won’t forget
Tell me where is another chance like the one we knew?
Tell me where can I find someone, someone just like you?
Can’t imagine what I’m gonna do
‘cause I’ve lived my life for you and all we’ve planned
And I don’t think I’ll ever understand where does the lovin’ go
