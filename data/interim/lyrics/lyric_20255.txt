The other side , the other side 
The other side of me 
By day, I play the part in every way
Of simple, sweet, calm and collected
Pretend, to my friends, I'm a chameleon
Can make a girl feel disconnected
Feel like a star, a superhero
Sometimes it's hard to separate
If you could see the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell?
I hold the key  to both realities
The girl that I want you to know, if only I could show
The other side , the other side 
I want you to see 
The other side , the other side 
The other side of me 
Inside , I try to make the pieces fit right
A jigsaw puzzle everywhere
'Cause I flip  the script 
So many times I forget 
Who's on stage, who's in the mirror
Back in the spotlight, the crowd is calling
The paparazzi and the fame
If you could see the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell?
I hold the key to both realities
The girl that I want you to know, if only I could show
The other side , the other side 
I want you to see
The other side , the other side 
The other side of me
Down inside, I'm not that different
Like everyone, I have a dream 
Don't wanna hide, just wanna fit in
Sometimes it's harder than it seems
If you could see the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell?
I hold the key to both realities 
The girl that I want you to know
If you could see 
The other side of me 
I'm just like  anybody else, can't you tell?
I hold the key  to both realities 
The girl that I want you to know, if only I could show 
The other side , the other side 
I want you to see 
The other side , the other side 
The other side of me
The other side , the other side 
I want you to see 
The other side 
The other side of me
