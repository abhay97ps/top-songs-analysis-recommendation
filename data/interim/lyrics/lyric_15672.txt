Oh, oh, take me there
Sing
I know a place, y'all
Ain't nobody crying, no
Ain't nobody worried
Ain't no smiling faces
Lying to the races
I said ain't no smiling faces
No smiling faces
Lying to the races
Ain't nobody crying
No more crying
If you're ready now, oh
 come on
Lord, have mercy
Say if you're ready
Oh, oh 
Come on 
I said come on
 play it
 play on it
Play on the keyboard 
If you're ready now 
I could use some guitar 
Sounds good
Help me now
If you're ready now
Come on
Mavis
Oh, I, oh, I
I know a place, y'all
Ain't nobody crying
Said there ain't no
Ain't nobody crying
I said, I said ain't no
Nobody worried
No smiling faces
Lying to the races
Help me now
I said if you're ready 
I said 
Come on if you're ready
Come on
Ain't nobody crying
Let me take you there
Help me, Lord
Said mercy, mercy now
Come, go, come, go with me
Are you ready now
If you think you're ready now
What good times, happy times
Just take my hand and come on
BeBe, CeCe
Can you see it
Wipe the tears from your eyes
