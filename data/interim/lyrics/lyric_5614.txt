People say I'm the life of the party
Because I tell a joke or two
Well, although I may be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see then my smile seems out of place
And if you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Since you left
If you see me with someone else
Acting like I'm having big fun
Well, although he may look fine
He's not a really man
You're the only one
So take a good look at my face
You'll see then my smile seems out of place
And if you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I'm masquerading
My hope is fading
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up
I wear since my break up
With you
Baby, take just a
One good look at my face
You'll see that my smile seems out of place
And if you look closer, it's so easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
Oh baby, take just
One look at my face
You'll see that my
Smile is out of place
And if you look closer
It's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
O-o-o-o-oh oh o-o-oh oh oh o-o-oh
Oh, look at my face
You'll see that my smile
Seems out of place
And if you look closer...
