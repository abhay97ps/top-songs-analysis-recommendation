And it goes, and it goes
And it goes a little something like this
Hit It!
Aaron's in the house
Get up get up
I wanna make it back
Here we go
Aaron's in the house
Get up get up
I wanna make it back
Yo guys, check out, guess what happened to me
I was hanging at the court, just playing some ball
Working on my game 
I heard the fans screaming, I thought it was for me
But then I saw a shadow, it was 12 foot 3
It was Shaquille O'Neal 
I told him why not, I got some time
But when I beat you real bad, try not to cry
(Please Aaron, are you for real?
One-on-one with Shaquille O'Neal?)
Yeah, 34 center from the L.A. Lakers
 I knew I could take him
Stared at Shaq, psyche him out
I said O'Neal, you're in my house now
Start the game the whistle blows
Pay attention close 'cause the story goes
It's like boom 
I put it in the hoop
Like slam 
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam 
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
It's like boom 
I put it in the hoop
Like slam 
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam 
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
So check it out, I thought I had the lead
But then he started scoring mad points on me
I was scorin' the bricks 
I knew that there was a way that I could make it stop
I had a plan, I could change the pace
I said, "Yo Shaq you didn't tie your shoelace"
He looked down, I stole the ball
I'm taking him to school now, watch me all
A 3-pointer, nothing but net
Come on Shaq, had enough yet?
Down by two, I'm catching up
I guess you're getting nervous 'cause you already lost
It's like boom 
I put it in the hoop
Like slam 
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam 
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
It's like boom 
I put it in the hoop
Like slam 
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam 
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
Dunk after dunk, jam after jam
Cheerleaders are cheering 
Dunk after dunk, jam after jam
Cheerleaders are cheering 
Announcers were shocked, couldn't believe it was real
One more second, was all that remained
I put the ball up, I put him in shame
I must admit that it sounds real crazy
But the ball went in, then he cried like a baby
Sorry Shaq, I should've let you win
You're good too and we can still be friends
The fans went nuts, they put me on their shoulders
Then I heard a voice and it sounded like my mother's
Ma, can't you see that I'm playing a game?
Aw, man it was all a dream
I guess that kinda thing could never happen to me
If it was a dream and it wasn't real
How'd I get a jersey with the name O'Neal? Woah
Boom 
I put it in the hoop
Like slam 
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam 
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
Boom 
I put it in the hoop
Like slam 
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam 
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
