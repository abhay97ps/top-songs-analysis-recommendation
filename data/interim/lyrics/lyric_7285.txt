This ain't fair, but I fear
I traveled here alone 'cause of you
Think I may be daydreamin' baby but I know
I know what I still don't mean to you
While I try, while I try, while I try, don't start tellin'
White lies, you better talk it over
White lies, everywhere I go I'm hearin'
White lies
Tellin' everybody that I love you
Tellin' everybody that I love you
Ramble on, stars set and gone
And I feel like I've been broken inside
Tell me I'm wrong pretty lady
But the strong part of me keeps on by your side
While I try 
While I try 
While I try 
White lies, you better talk it over
White lies, everywhere I go I'm hearin'
White lies
Tellin' everybody that I love you
Tellin' everybody that I love you
While I try 
While I try
While I try 
White lies, you better talk it over
White lies, everywhere I go I'm hearin'
White lies
Tellin' everybody that I love you
Tellin' everybody that I love you
