Some days it's tough just getting up
Throwing on these boots and making that climb
Some days I would rather be a no show or lay low
'Fore I go out of my mind
But when she says baby 
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me 
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby
Some nights I come home fighting mad
Feel like running my fist through the wall
Is it even worth what I'm fighting for anymore
Feeling torn, aw, to hell with it all
But when she says baby 
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me 
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Everything gonna be alright
Just lay down by my side
Let me love you through this life
Yeah, she's a perfect shot of faith
When every bit of mine is gone
Something I can believe in, a best friend
A heaven sent love to lean on
But when she says baby 
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me 
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
