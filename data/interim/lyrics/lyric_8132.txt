Day after day, I must face the world of strangers
Where I don't belong
I'm not that strong
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to
Who will always care
You're always there
CHORUS:
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
So many times when the city seems to be without
A friendly face
It's a lonely place
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you
And you'll always smile
It's all worthwhile
CHORUS
Touch me and I end up singin'
Troubles seem to up and disappear
You touch me with the love you're bringin'
I can't really lose when you're near
When you're near, my love
If all my friends have forgotten half their promises
They're not unkind
Just hard to find
One look at you and I know that I could learn to live
Without the rest
I've found the best
CHORUS
