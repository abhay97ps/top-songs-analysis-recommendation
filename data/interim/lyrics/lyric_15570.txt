You said that you still loved me
Never once believed your eyes
You found a way to touch me
But still inside
You're filled with lies
I never said
I need to love you
But still you know I do
I need you here to feel this moment
My heart depends on you
But my love
I can`t decide so please
My love is in your hands
Just touch my heart
You`ll see
Baby, please
A day in my life without you
Keep your love line close to me
A day in my life without you
Give me your love like it used to be
Those times you caught me crying
You never tried to understand
I need to have you near me
Baby, you need to hold my hand
Don`t ever think I`d fall to pieces
You know my hearts too strong
But deep inside
I know I love you
With you is where I belong
But my love
I can`t decide
So please
My love is in your hands
Touch my heart, you`ll see
Baby, please
