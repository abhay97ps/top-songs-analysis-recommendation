It may be way too early in the game
For you or me to know how far we'll go
But when I look at you
From any point of view, I see
Whoa-oh, you're looking like love to me
We've only met and yet it feels so right
To see the fire between us come aglow
You make my body melt
I swear I never felt so free
Whoa-oh, you're looking like love to me
Do I expect too much
And move too fast
Do I expect so much
So soon to last forever 
I'm gonna toss all caution to the wind
And let my deep down
Feelings overflow
I bet my life on us
Tonight, I tell you, trust in me
Whoa-oh, you're looking like love
Ooh-hoo, you make my body melt
I swear I never felt so free
Whoa-oh, you're looking like love to me
Whoa, looking like love 
Definitely
You're looking like love to me
So lovely, love
Whoa-oh, you're looking like love to me
Whoa-oh, you're looking like love to me
