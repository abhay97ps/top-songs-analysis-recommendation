Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Why you got an attitude?
Why you acting all foolish?
When you see me out in the street boy
You wanna embarass me, call me names
Slap my face until
Until you see my friends come, ooh
Then you wanna try to console me, oh
But they already know boy
Cause for the last week I've been in the house
And I've cried and cried
Chorus
I can't go for that, no, no, no can do
I can't go for that, no, no, no can do
I can't go for that, no, no, no can do
I can't go for that, can't go for that
Can't go for that
Now you bring me flowers
You say you got it together
Soon as I let my guard down
Oh there you go again
In my grill till I call the cops then
Then you wanna chill out and say
I'm the one who's buggin'
But, no, no it's you, you see
Every time I go out
You come grabbin' all over me
Chorus
Why you trippin?
Get your hands off me
Why you illin?
I'm supposed to be your nubian queen
Why you trippin?
Get your hands off me
Why you illin?
I'm supposed to be your nubian queen
I'm supposed to be your nubian queen, oh
Chorus Until fade
