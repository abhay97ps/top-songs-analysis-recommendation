A good song and a love affair
Go hand in hand together
When you think you've gotten over one
The other holds on to your forever
I've tried hard to forget 
Ever lovin' you
But just when I've convinced myself
It's over with, then I hear
That old song that they used to play 
On the radio just about every day
And whenever I hear it all I can do
Is reminisce about lovin' you
That old song that they still play 
Keeps me longin' for the good old days
The lyric and the melody 
Remindin' me how in love we used to be
I shouldn't be tellin' you this
I know that I'm out of place 
But when I love another woman
I can still see your face, baby
Maybe this is a sign for us 
To try and get back together
You can't imagine that those memories 
Do to me every time I hear
That old song that they used to play 
On the radio just about every day
Whenever I hear it all I can do
Is reminisce about lovin' you
That old song that they still play 
Keeps me longin' for the good old days
The lyric and the melody 
Remindin' me how in love we used to be
Think of you and me
Every time I hear that song
I recall the good times
When I hear that song, that song, that song
Makin' me realize
That I want you back, girl
Every time I hear that song 
Keep on playin' that old song
Ooh, when I hear that song 
It reminds me of a love so strong, mmm...
Mr. DJ, would you please play 
That old song
Help me bring my baby back home 
Keep on playin', playin' that old song
Ba-de-ah-ba-de-ah
Ba-de-ah-ba-de-ah-ah-ah
