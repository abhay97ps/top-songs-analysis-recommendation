Oh my God, Ronny
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bitch – hi, bitch
Hi, bitch – hi, bitch
I do not sniff it or roll it 
It do not drip when I pour it 
I do not run, I reload it 
I do not save it, I throw it
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bitch – hi, bitch
Hi, bitch – hi, bitch
Please stop, please stop, please stop, please stop! 
That fit look like you bought it at a kiosk  
And they got the nerve to ask, "Why she hot?" 
Why you countin' all that money that we got?
I ain't worried 'bout no basic bitches
All y'all look like you still fly Spirit
All y'all must not've looked in the mirror
All y'all lookin' but the windows tinted like... 
I don't know what made all y'all haters 
Play if you want, but you know I ain't playin' like...
White J's, white Porsche

Hi, bitch – hi, bitch
Hi, bitch – hi, bitch
I do not sniff it or roll it 
It do not drip when I pour it 
I do not run, I reload it 
I do not save it, I throw it
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bitch – hi, bitch
Hi, bitch – hi, bitch
Grown as hell and you still hatin'?
I look at you and thank God, I made it like...
Hi, bitch
Hi, bitch
