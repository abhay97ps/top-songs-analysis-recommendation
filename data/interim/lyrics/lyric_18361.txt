Here's a little bit of old school for ya
That goes a little something like this...
I always tried to be the flyest kid in the block
The popular one with the rising stock
So that's when I had this bright idea
No, the party of the year
All the fine girls couldn't turn it down
Now all I gotta do is get my parents out
Should I send them to a movie
Let me think, hmmm
It's gotta be long though
I said Mom, Dad, yo why ya sittin' home
It's a Friday night, have you seen Aunt Joan
And don't worry about stayin' out too long
Don't fuss over me, I'll be fine alone
Have a good time...
The doorbell rings 'cause the party's here
I'm crankin' up the stereo like it's New Years
Walkin' 'round the house like who's Da Man
First on the floor, you know that's me
Bustin' out the moves like it's MTV
I guess somewhere along I lost my head
Then I jumped on table, this is what I said
People all around you gotta
Everyone together sing it loud
Jump all around, come on
What...
Say it again
People all around you gotta
From the left to the right, make noise
Here we go now, come on
Uh uh what what
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Things are goin' great then to my surprise
Some people walked in, I didn't recognize
I said fellas, yo, ya gotta get out
Open house?
Well I didn't put out flyers
Then walked in
The girl I'm crushin'
And the kid spilled juice
On my Mom's new cushion
I turned around and
Another kid broke the lamp
They got them from France
For now I won't sweat it
I'll clean it up later
There's a honey over there
And I really wanna meet her
People all around you gotta
From the left to the right, make noise
Here we go now, come on
Uh uh what what
People all around you gotta
From the left to the right, make noise
Here we go now, come on
Uh uh what what
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Aaron C's in the house, here we go
Come with it
Break it down
Is that a car door
Oh dang, I'm in trouble
Everybody get out now
On the double
I'm dead  that's it for me
I'm gonna be picked off my family tree
Once Mom finds out 'bout this party I had
I don't even wanna start thinkin' about dad
I'm hustlin' around the house
Trying to clean up the mess
I sure put my new white Nikes to the test
The car door slammed
And they're walking up the steps
I guess life is good with 10 seconds left
Grounded
People all around you gotta
Everyone together sing it loud
Jump all around, come on
What...
Say it again
People all around you gotta
From the left to the right, make noise
Aaron C's in the house, come on
Uh uh what what
Na na na na
C'mon, haha
Na na na na
What, what, c'mon, c'mon
Na na na na
C'mon, c'mon, come get it
Na na na na
Wave your hands from side to side
Na na na na
Do it one time for the rodeo
Na na na na
C'mon, yeah, come get it
Na na na na
Uh, uh, haha
Na na na na
Come get it
Na na na na
