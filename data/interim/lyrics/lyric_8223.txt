Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't wanna see my Mumma cry
Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't wanna see my Mumma cry
Just last year when I was only seven
And now I'm almost eight as you can see
You came home at a quarter past eleven
Fell down underneath our Christmas tree
Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't wanna see my Mumma cry
Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't wanna see my Mumma cry
Mumma smiled and looked outside the window
She told me son, you better go upstairs
Then you laughed and hollered Merry Christmas
I turned around and saw my Mumma's tears
Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't wanna see my Mumma cry
Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't wanna see my Mumma cry
No, I don't wanna see my Mumma cry
