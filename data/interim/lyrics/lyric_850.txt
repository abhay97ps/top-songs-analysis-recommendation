Each time I hold somebody new
My arms go cold aching for you
No one can take your place
I'll never be free
And when my lips burn with desire
No other kiss puts out the fire
Though I may try and try
This longing in me
How can I be free when I still remember
How you could thrill me with a sigh
Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains when we're apart
Each kiss, I gave to you
I'll never be free
Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains when we're apart
Each kiss, I gave to you
And so I'll never be free
