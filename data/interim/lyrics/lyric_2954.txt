Kingdom with the Sinisters
Court Jesters and the Warriors
Sorcerers and Peasants
Entertain the Queens and Royal Ministers
Crown the King the same night
Moonlight said it ain’t right
Bringing switchblades to a gunfight
His mind wandered when the sun set
City feelin like a prison on an island or a military complex
Same horizons, different chemistry
Girl called but he let it be
Phone crying like an enemy
So he let it breathe sayin
Kingdom with the Sinisters
Kingdom with
Kingdom with, Kingdom with the Sinisters
Queens and Royal Ministers
Crown the King the same night
Moonlight said it ain’t right
Bringing switchblades to a gunfight
Baby I ain’t going to another city less the money twice as good
But you’ll prolly blow
Why’nt go and try to spit the shit twice as hood
Get yourself racks on plaques
Valentino with a black Maybach
Drug money like that ’03 trap
OGs with a OG past
Now it’s NY so I’m old school never done that new hop shit
And they got these new cops with these new Glocks that’ll go bruise that shit
Nixon went and got a new block snitch. Where he at?
Too Late
When I fly wanna really fly
Wanna Clark Kent not Bruce Wayne
What you gon do when you squeeze
And your clip gone and your bullets end?
Maybe go check the bulletin
Took my pencil put the bullets in
In the temple got some bullet friends
That’ll go past where your bullet ends
That’s your cortex, cerebral, that’s lethal
Yo I know we don’t got the same mind
Or the same weapons. But yo
We sippin the same shit, you know
Coming from the same grains. Same strain
Same strain as Adam, same atoms
Just rearranged differently
Never tryna get the money if they gonna fire bullets cause I whip like this
Moving too quick on the highway so I’m gon coast with a hit
And I curve minds with the force
What that rhyme with? Of course
West 4th never really played ball
But I stilI went and rhymed by the courts
Let my mind run its course, runnin like Usain
Joyner, pointers from DMC and Jam Master
Or 5 and the Grandmaster
So I spit the shit then pray after
Rather be Midas than King James
Downtown never mid-range
More Samuel than Ving Rhames
Paint drip on the new pave
Meant that we was going too fast
So I hit the pedal for some new gas
Flipped the dough for some new masks
But I’m still Dilla glad you asked
Tryna keep up in that new shit
Go ahead homie you gassed
It’s no longer exciting
Less you make em hear the sound of science
Sound of atoms, sound of silence and the sound of lightning
Crowd is hyping with tomfoolers and shaky shooters
Expired hookers, tired spitters, defeated rulers
I wanna be the greatest
Not whatever my fate is
My latest ventures can’t calm the temper
Unless the battle is won
Tell me is you Vader, Anakin’s son?
You kill the tyrant ever wonder what the shooter becomes?
Begun my journey in the sewer where the
Rats don’t sleep, back on beat
Knocked down but we back on feet
84 put the wax on me
Couple years and the past gone see
Everything that your pastors see
Talkin shit about how I lean, how I beam
You ain’t no god ain’t no Nas ain’t no prophet you ain’t Ali
Process ain’t fine by me
Egos is get broken, your planets ain’t got a motion
Your rhyme never had a moment
Split bombs like I split quotients, split bombs like I split oceans
See I
Been a idol since my pops was prayin idols
Hella cash so I finna sign a doc before I sign a bridal
Hella cash so I dodge the war to fight the title
But this Manhattan man we drop the bomb that spark the tidal
Kingdom with the Sinisters
