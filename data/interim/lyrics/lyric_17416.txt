Thinkin' about you baby all of the time
I wake in the morning with you on my mind
I think I must be dreaming, too good to be true
And it's so amazing just what love can do
Baby you've given me the sweetest emotions
And now that I've found you I'm never gonna
Let you go
Because I'm with you
My dreams have come true
And baby I'm oh so happy with you
I feel so alive
Cause this love is so right
And that's why I'm so happy with you
Whenever you're around me I need your touch
Ooh you drive me crazy, I want you so much
Keep doing what you're doing cause it
Feels so good
And it's so amazinging, that's what love can do
