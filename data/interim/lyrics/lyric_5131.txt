Lone-ly Is The Name
That I ans-wer to
And cry-ing is the game
Since I'm losing you;
I'll never be the same
With-out your love
Be-lieve me...
Sorry is the role
That you make me play
Tor-ment-ed is the soul
That is mine today
I'm lost beyond control
With-out your love
Missing is the kiss
Absent is the sigh
Gone -- the look of love
You wore
Was it all a dream?
Was it all a lie?
Don't you love me
Any-more?
Just tell them...
Lone-ly is the name --
It will always be --
And crying is the game
'Til you're back with me;
I'll never be the same
With-out your love
