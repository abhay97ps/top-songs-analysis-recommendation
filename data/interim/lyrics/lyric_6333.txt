It's been a long time since I've even bothered you
It's been a long time since I realized that you weren't there
It's been a long time since I looked at what I'm doing
It's been a long time since I realized I don't really care
'Cause I'm thinking of you down in Mexico
Feeling free as the air
Here I am stuck in the city
Still going nowhere
It scares me sometimes when I see how I'm held here
It scares me sometimes when I see just how you got away
It seems to work fine leaving all of the trouble
It seems to work fine and I really don't know why I stay
'Cause I'm thinking of you down in Mexico
Feeling free as the air
Here I am stuck in the city
Still going nowhere
'Cause I'm thinking of you down in Mexico
Feeling free as the air
Here I am stuck in the city
Still going nowhere
'Cause I'm thinking of you down in Mexico
Feeling free as the air
Here I am stuck in the city
Still going nowhere
Thinking of you down in Mexico
Feeling free as the air
Here I am stuck in the city
Still going nowhere
