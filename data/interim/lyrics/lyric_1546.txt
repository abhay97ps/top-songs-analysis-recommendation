The boat rides 
We would take 
The moonlight 
On the lake 
The way we danced 
And hummed our favorite song
The things we did last summer
I'll remember 
All winter long
The midway 
And the fun 
The Kewpie dolls we won 
The bell you rang 
To prove that you were strong
The things we did last summer
I'll remember 
All winter long
The early morning hike 
The rented tandem bike
The lunches that we used to pack
We never could explain 
That sudden summer rain
The looks we got when we got back
The leaves 
Began to fade 
Like promises we made 
How could a love 
That seemed so right go wrong?
The things we did last summer 
I'll remember 
All winter long
