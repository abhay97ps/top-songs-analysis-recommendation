Darlin, I am whatever you make me
So baby, baby whatever you make me
Make me belong to you
I can be a beggar or a queen
You've got the power to make me anything
You've got the power so open your heart
It's up to you
Yeah, 'cause darlin' I am whatever you make me
So baby, baby whatever you make me
Make me belong to you
I can be a puppet on a string
You've got the power to make me anything
You've got the power so open your heart
It's up to you
Yeah, darlin' I am whatever you make me
So baby, baby whatever you make me
Make me belong to you
