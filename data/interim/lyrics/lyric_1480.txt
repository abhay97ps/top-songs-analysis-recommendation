That day, I first saw you passing by
I wanted to know your name but I was much too shy
But I was looking at you so hard
Until you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me my name
You beat me to the punch that time
You beat me to the punch
You beat me to the punch
After I had known you for it seems like a long, long time
I wanted, wanted to ask you, would you please, please be mine
Whenever you came around, my heart would pound
So you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me to be yours
You beat me to the punch that time
You beat me to the punch
You beat me to the punch
Since I love you, I thought you would be true and love me tender
So I let my heart surrender -- to you, yes, I did
But I found out beyond a doubt one day, boy, you were a playboy
Who would go away and leave me -- blue
So I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down
This time I'm gonna play my hunch
And walk away this very day
And beat you to the punch this time
And beat you to the punch this time
I'll beat you to the punch, yes, I will
And let you know, know, how it feels
