There must be thousands of people out there
Who search for love and find more than their share
They seem to fall into it naturally
But you know that doesn't apply to me
Some fools  get lucky
The first time out take a chance on love and they win
But some fools like me, they never learn
They keep on playin' the game
And it turns out the same
Oh, when will it ever be lucky me?
I got that butterfly feeling inside
With you I knew that love had fin'lly arrived
Now like all the rest you say goodbye
Leavin' me alone to keep wondering why
Some fools  get lucky
The first time out take a chance on love and they win
But some fools like me, they never learn
They keep on playin' the game
Though it turns out the same
Oh, when will it ever be
Oh my heart aches impatiently
Oh when will it ever be lucky me?
When will it ever be lucky me?
