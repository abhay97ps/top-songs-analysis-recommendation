Hush, hush, baby, don't believe a word
Hush, hush, honey, don't believe a word
Well, you don't know nothin'
But believe everything you heard
Hush, hush, yakka yak all the time
Hush, hush, yakka yak all the time
Well, if you don't stop yakkin'
You're gonna drive me out of my mind
Hush, hush, I didn't hear a word you said
Hush, hush, didn't hear a word you said
If you don't stop talkin'
I'm gonna leave and I'm mighty afraid
Hush, hush
Hush, hush
Hush, hush
Hush, hush
