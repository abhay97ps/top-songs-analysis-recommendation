 Yo, baby
You ready to let the games begin? 
 'Cause I'm ready 
On your mark, get set, here we go
Check it
Girl, I want you to stay
So we can play this little game we play
You go hide, and I will seek
Let me be the one to make you weak
Boy, I really wanna stay
And play that little game you play
But you go hide, and let me seek
Let me be the one to make you weak
Aww yeah, first verse
I'm thinking about you, every day
Got me feelin' kinda freaky
Girl, why you wanna leave me that way?
Boy, I don't wanna leave you
So I'll stay for a little while
But we play by my rules
'Cause bein' loose just ain't my style
No no no no ohhhh
Girl, I want you to stay
So we can play this little game we play
You go hide, and I will seek
Let me be the one to make you weak
Boy, I really wanna stay
And play that little game you play
But you go hide, and let me seek
Let me be the one to make you weak
Ohhh, so you wanna run things 
Well, that's cool with me
You better know what you're doin' 
Girl, I'm a hard one to please
Come on
Oohhh, talk is cheap 
Let's get right to it 
Let the fun and games begin
Boy, I'm ready to do this
Girl, I want u to stay
So we can play this little game we play
You go hide, and I will seek
Let me be the one to make you weak
Boy, I really wanna stay
And play that little game you play
But you go hide, and let me seek
Let me be the one to make you weak
It's your move, baby 
So show me what u got 
'Cause when it's my turn 
The game is gonna get hot
I like what you're sayin'
Boy, it sounds real good, real good
But are you ready for a real woman
To test your manhood?
This little game that we play 
It's just a little game that we play 
This little game that we play 
It's just a little game that we play
Baby, don't start if you think you can't finish
Come prepared if you think you're gonna win this
Give it your best shot 
Give me all you got 
Guaranteed to make you hot 
I wanna play this game with you
I wanna play this game with you
But don't be no fool 
You gotta play by my rules
Girl, I want you to stay
So we can play this little game we play
You go hide, and I will seek
Let me be the one to make you weak
Girl, I want you to stay
So we can play this little game we play
You go hide, and I will seek
Let me be the one to make you weak
