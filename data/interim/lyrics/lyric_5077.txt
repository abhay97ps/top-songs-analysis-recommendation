I remember how it started
On a sunny summer's day
I was looking out my window
All the kids were out to play
Then she said, hey
Let's play May I
Out into the street I came
Ever since that sunny morning
Nothing has been quite the same
May I take a giant step into your heart
May I give you love and sweet affection
May I take a giant step into your heart
So that you will look in my direction
May I take a giant step into your heart
Though I may be getting older
May I's still my favorite game
Girl, I got to have your permission
If our need's to be the same
Show me if you really want me
Show me if you really care
Give me just a little sign, girl
Make me feel you want me here
