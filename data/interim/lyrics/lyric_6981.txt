Super-Wolf, can do it
Super-Wolf, can do it!
Super-Wolf, can do it
Super-Wolf, get to it!
Alright everybody, what do you say?
You got the Super-Wolf here to make your day
From station WOLF, Wolfsville U-S-A
I'm the meanest, I'm the cleanest, I'm the boldest, I'm the coldest
You'll freak to the beat up in here jammin' everyday of the week
Super-Wolf, can do it
Super-Wolf, can do it!
Super-Wolf, can do it
Super-Wolf, get to it!
I'm the people's choice of this Rolls-Royce
The ladies freak when they hear my voice
And the  supreme
Often known as a sex machine
I'm the ladies' pimp and the men's threat
If you're lookin' for better they ain't made it yet
I know I'm tough, I got the soul
When they made the Wolf, they broke the mold
I'm the Super-Wolf, from the Cherry Hill
I never work and I never will
My Daddy was a player, my Grandpa too
I don't know nothing else to do
So when you hear this beat, and you hear my howl
You know the Wolf is on the prowl!
Wolf, can do it
Super-Wolf, can do it!
Super-Wolf, can do it
Super-Wolf, get to it!
Now here I am right on the scene
Your lover man, your sex machine
I'm super cool, I'm super clean
I line my pocket with plenty of green
I got diamond rings and fancy things
I got a leather bar, got a superstar
I got a limousine, a fine place to stay
All the girls they wanna give me play
I like to ride in the back, jack before i lack
'Cause I don't get off on nothing wack
I'll huff, I'll puff, I'll blow your mind
Guaranteed to please every time
I got more finesse than the Pony Express
I got more soul than a donut hole
I got more gold than Fort Knox
So come on and ride with your jock in the box
It's not Rapper's Delight, it's dynamite
I'm not Sugarhill, I got sex appeal
Not the Sequence Gang, I just do my thing
Said Super-Wolf and not Superman
The number one rapper in all the land
I'm heavy on my feet but light on the scene
Just like honey but I'm twice as sweet
So when you hear the Wolf howlin' at your backdoor
Give him what he want, he won't howl no more
Super-Wolf, can do it
Super-Wolf, can do it!
Super-Wolf, can do it
Super-Wolf, get to it!
Yo my old man was a smooth 
 skin in your hand, get what you can
When the night is out it could be day's end
Just might wind up with me my friend
When you  a girl and you have no 
Just spit the rap right in her ear
And if your rap is good and you love her right
She'll meet you here tomorrow night
'Cause the thing to do is make your plans
See the baddest DJ in the land
And after all has been said and done
I guess you'll know I'm the only one!
Wolf, can do it
Super-Wolf , can do it!
Super-Wolf , can do it
Super-Wolf, get to it! 
Ah put your weight on it
Put your weight on it, put your weight on it doggone it
Have no fear the Wolf is here
The Wolf is right in your ear
Musically baby
I got something for your cranium medulla oblongata!
Get up and party, don't ask why
I just want everybody to get up and shake your gluteus maximi
Let's do it
C'mon, get up!
Alright
Ha-ha!
Ha-ha!
Ha-ha!
Super-Wolf, can do it
Super-Wolf, get to it!
So to all you other rappers out there
You ain't sayin' nothin' just blowin' hot air
You can rap, you can rap 'til your blood boil
Runnin' off at the mouth like castor oil
And when you blow your amp and your green smoke
That's the time to grab a bottle of Scope
And you'll wonder where the yellow went
When you brush your teeth by accident
As a disco jock, I'm number one
It's just a game, just having fun
In case you're wondering where I be
At the Players Palace, Jackson Tennessee
I'm a cool jock with the master plan
If you dig my rap give me your hand
I'm a cool jock with the master plan
If you dig my rap give me your hand
Let's do it, let's do it
So let's rock
Super-Wolf
Aliens 
I only come out at night
That's when i do it right
C'mon! Let's do it
Let's do it, let's rock, let's go!
