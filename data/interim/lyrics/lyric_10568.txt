Up in the morning, it's six o'clock
Head for the city
Turn on the music, the radio
Nobody's boogie 
Day after day, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Slavin' away, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Punch in the timer, I'm late again
Sneak in the back way
I count the hours, minutes too
So glad it's Friday 
Jump in my ride, ooh ooh ooh ooh
It's Friday night, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last
Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last
Only on a Friday
Never on a Sunday
Never on a Monday
Same situation every day
Some kind of voodoo 
Same complications stand in the way
Nowhere to run to 
My mind is dreaming I'm somewhere else
Can't seem to shake it 
I miss the feeling, having fun
No way to fake it 
Jump in my ride, ooh ooh ooh ooh
It's Friday night, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last
Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last
Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last
Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last
Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last
Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last
Livin' it up, livin' it up, oh yeah
Friday night
