Yeah, yeah, my face is red
When I aim for her lips
I kiss the back of her head
I used to kiss my baby
Every time I took her to a dance
But since she started twisting
Now I never even get a chance
I wanna get some loving
But I find I'm in an awful fix
Cause twisting and kissing
Are two things that just don't mix
Can't mix twisting and a kissing
Can't mix kissing and a twisting
Yeah, yeah, my face is red
When I aim for her lips
I kiss the back of her head
She looks like a yogi, yeah
She's twisting and a spinning about
She's a female pretzel
That just needs some straightening out
I move a little closer cause
I'm ready and I wanna get kissed
Oh, but my finger popping baby
Always hits me in the face with a fist
Can't mix kissing and a twisting
Can't mix twisting and a kissing
Yeah, yeah, my face is red
When I aim for her lips
I kiss the back of her head
She looks like a yogi, yeah
She's twisting and a spinning about
She's a female pretzel
That just needs some straightening out
I move a little closer cause
I'm ready and I wanna get kissed
Oh, but my finger popping baby
Always hits me in the face with a fist
Can't mix kissing and a twisting
Can't mix twisting and a kissing
Yeah, yeah, my face is red
When I aim for her lips
I kiss the back of her head
Can't mix twisting and a kissing
Can't mix kissing and a twisting
Yeah, yeah, my face is red
When I aim for her lips
I kiss the back of her head
