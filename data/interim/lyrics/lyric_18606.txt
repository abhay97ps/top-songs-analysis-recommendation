If I ever write
The story of my life
Don't be surprised
If you're where it begins
Girl, I'd have to dedicate
Every line on every page
To the memories we made
While you loved me
I was born the day you kissed me
And I died inside the night you left me
But I lived
Oh, how I lived
While you loved me
I'd start with chapter one
Love innocent and young
As a morning sun, on a new day
Even though I know the end
Well, I'd do it all again
'Cause I got a lifetime in
While you loved me
I was born the day you kissed me
And I died inside the night you left me
But I lived
Oh, how I lived
While you loved me
I was born the day you kissed me
And I died inside the night you left me, yeah
But I lived
Oh, how I lived
I lived
I was born the day you kissed me 
And I died inside the night you left me, yeah
But I lived
Oh, how I lived
I lived
While you loved me
