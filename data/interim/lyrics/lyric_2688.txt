Always together, until forever
Leaving the dreams that we share
True hearts together, until forever
Showing the world that we care
You won't be lonely
I'll love you only
I'll live my life just for you
Always together, until forever
Our love will always be true
True hearts together, until forever
Showing the world that we care
You won't be lonely
I'll love you only
I'll live my life just for you
Always together, until forever
Our love will always be true
