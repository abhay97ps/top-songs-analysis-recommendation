Toca me
Esta tarde se me va, toca me
Hey yeah, hey yeah, miracle 
Hey yeah, hey yeah, miracle 
Hey yeah, hey yeah, miracle 
Hey yeah, hey yeah...
If you're gonna save the day
And you're hearin' what I say
I feel your touch, your kiss
It's not enough
And if you believe in me
Don't think my love's for free
I won't take nothin' less then a deeper love
Let me tell you, know
I, I need a miracle
I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel from you
Let me tell you, know
I, I need a miracle
I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to get me through
Tell me that you understand
And you'll take me as I am
You'll always be the one to give me everything
Just when I thought no one cared
You're the answer to my prayers
You lift my spirits high
Come on and rescue me-e-e 
Let me tell you, know
I, I need a miracle
I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel from you
Let me tell you, know
I, I need a miracle
I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to get me through
Let me tell you, know
I, I need a miracle
I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel from you
Let me tell you, know
I, I need a miracle
I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to get me through
