Spring'll soon be gone 
Summer's comin' on 
And I'm-a dreamin' of 
Lotsa summer love 
And all I think about 
After school is out 
Headin' down the shore 
To have a ball once more
Whoa whoa whoa whoa those Wildwood days
Wild, wild Wildwood days
Oh baby, every day's a holiday and every night is a Saturday night
Oh those Wildwood days, wild, wild Wildwood days
And then those party lights wild, wild Wildwood nights
Say baby you'll be mine 
'cause it's kissin' time 
Gonna twist again 
Like remember when
Sleepin 'on the beach 
Seven days a week 
Rockin' every night 
'Till the early bright
Whoa whoa whoa whoa those Wildwood days
Wild, wild Wildwood days
My baby, every day's a holiday and every night is a Saturday night
Oh those Wildwood days, wild, wild Wildwood days
And then those party lights wild, wild Wildwood nights
Whoa whoa whoa whoa those Wildwood days
Wild, wild Wildwood days
Oh baby, every day's a holiday and every night is a Saturday night
Oh those Wildwood days, wild, wild Wildwood days
And then those party nights
