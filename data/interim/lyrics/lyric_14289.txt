We tell sweet lies, fooling one another
We get outsmarted when we rediscover
We underplay
You took me in – I never minded
You broke the rules – I saw through you then
What a surprise when we turn into lovers!
All those sweet lies tear away the covers
And now we know not to underestimate
What hearts can do
You keep an eye on me
I'll keep an eye on you
You took me in – I never minded
You broke the rules – I saw through you then
What a surprise when we turn into lovers!
All those sweet lies tear away the covers
The tables turn
