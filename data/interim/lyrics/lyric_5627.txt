If loving you was ice cream
Oh, I could be the ice cream man
If loving you was a whole lot of money
I'd be the richest man in all the land
If a bee made honey
They way that I need you
They wouldn't only make it in the summertime
They'd make it in the winter too
Cause I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
Good God almighty
If loving you was water
My well would never run dry
If loving you was happiness
My eyes would never, never cry
If my love was a light
The dawn would never
Have come around
Well my love would
Shine on and on and on
And the sun would never go round
Angel, I love you 
I just love you 
I love you 
Good God almighty
I love you 
I just love you 
I love you 
Good God almighty
If loving you was time
A second could never slip away 
If loving you was a whole lot of power
Girl, I'd rule the world in just one day
And if hurting you was living
My life wouldn't be worth a dime
I'd die in a day and I couldn't wait till tomorrow
I do declare, I ain't lying
Oh, angel, I love you 
I just love you 
I love you 
Good God almighty
I love you 
I just love you 
I love you 
Good God almighty
I just love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you
