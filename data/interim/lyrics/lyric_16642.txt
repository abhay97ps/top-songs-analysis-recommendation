Baby, don't stand there in the doorway
With all your bags ready to go
Baby, sit down and let's talk it over
Oh, I need to know
What do you think you're gonna find?
What are you looking for?
The world is cold out there
Don't say goodbye, girl
Take a look inside and read my mind, girl
Everything I do, I do for you
Don't leave me crying, crying
Maybe my crime is carin' bout'cha, yeah yeah
Wanting you close by my side
Baby, you need some space around you
Some room to fly
Don't ever think I'll hold you back
And when you call my name
Together we'll be fine
Don't say goodbye, girl
Take a look inside and read my mind, girl
Everything I do, I do for you
Don't leave me crying, crying
Oh, baby
Baby, you know you mean the world to me
I never loved nobody the way that I love you
The way it feels, ooh, when I'm close to you
When I'm holding you, touching you
What do you think you're gonna find?
Just wait and you will see
The world is cold out there
Don't say good...don't say goodbye, girl
Hey, take a look inside and read my mind, girl
Everything I do, I do for you
Don't leave me crying, crying
Don't say goodbye, girl
Take a look inside and read my mind, girl
Everything I do, I do for you
Don't leave me crying, crying
Don't say goodbye, girl
Take a look inside and read my mind, girl
Everything I do, I do for you
Don't leave me crying, crying
Don't say goodbye, girl
Take a look inside and read my mind, girl
Everything I do, I do for you
Don't leave me crying, crying
