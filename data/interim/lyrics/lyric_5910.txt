Sad girl
You look so sad
Did he break your heart?
Gee, that's too bad
I guess
Now you see, Oohh
How love coud be
Sad girl
Forget that guy
Come on let's smile and
Please won't you try?
Get a hold of yourself
Come on and
Find you someone else
Open up your heart, girl
We can make a brand new start
Please don't cry
Just go out
And find yourself another guy
Sad girl
Hold your head up high
Things are gonna change
I know
As time goes by
Because...
That's the way it goes
Everybody knows
Everybody's somebody's fool
And you're no exception to the rule
Your days gonna come
I know...
...all you gotta do is keep on smiling
