Let me see you put your middle fingers up
To the world, I made up in my mind 
I'm doin' things my way, I'm burnin' shit down tonight
I'm doin' things my way 
It's my way or the highway, let me say it one more time
Middle fingers up to the world, to the world
To the wor-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-orld
To the world, to the world
To the wor-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-orld
Let me see you put your middle fingers up!
Middle fingers up!
 Deuces minus one
Middle finger to the sky tonight 
The whole world is a couch
Bitch, I'm Rick James tonight 
Throw it up  throw it up  cause you can't take it with you
Funny how they wait 'til you gone just to miss you
To the world  to the world  then I'm on my Sinatra
I'm doing it my way, let's take it a notch up
Take it u-u-u-up
Let me see you put your middle fingers up!
To the world, I made up in my mind 
Doing things my way, I'm burning shit down tonight
I'm doing things my way 
It's my way or the highway, let me say it one more time
Middle fingers up to the world, to the world
To the wor-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-orld
Mmm, ain't this some shit? Pulled up in the A-V-entador
And the doors, raise up like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show, and a tour, this the movie and the score
This a ghetto opera, Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that
Said I be all up in Goldman Sachs, like these niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back, I'm just tryna protect my stacks
Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax
Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axel Foley at?
"Ease up there, baby boy": Ving Rhames told Jody that
R. Kelly and the God of rap, shitting on you, holy crap
Let me see you put your middle fingers up!
To the world, to the world
To the wor-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-orld
To the world, to the world
To the wor-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-orld
Let me see you put your middle fingers up!
I could give it all up, but it's not enough
Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger
To the world, to the world, from the ground to the moon
Hills to the mountains, yeah, hands to the roof
Give it up, give it up, won't let you deny me
Makin' you love me, makin' you love me
