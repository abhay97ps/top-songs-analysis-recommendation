You're a young man, a sweet guy
Handsome, kinda shy
You got a nice car, a steady job
Money, you got plenty of
What can I give a man with everything?
Just one thing you need
You need one lovin' woman
Every home should have one
Two hearts filled with passion
Make your house a happy home
You'll never be alone
When you've got one lovin' woman
Every home should have one

For lovin' belongin'
Got ideas, plenty of them
I can help you with your problems
Don't you know that I'm gonna give to you my everything
Everything you need
You need one lovin' woman
Every home should have one
Two hearts filled with passion
Make your house a happy home
You'll never be alone
When you've got one lovin' woman
Every home should have one
Don't you know that I'm gonna give to you my everything
Everything you need
Everything you need
You need one lovin' woman
Every home should have one
Two hearts filled with passion
Make your house a happy home
Oh, you'll never be alone
When you've got one lovin' woman
Every home should have one
Two hearts filled with passion
Make your house a happy home
Oh, you'll never be alone

Every home should have one
Two hearts filled with passion
Make your house a happy home
