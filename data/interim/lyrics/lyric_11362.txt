Through the night while I was fast asleep
I could feel you tuggin' me
Then I slowly opened my eyes
You were layin' by my side
Oh what a night
Could I be dreamin'?
Are you really with me
Are you right here by my side?
Could I be dreamin'?
I've waited for this moment for so long
And now you're mine
No, it's not a dream
Boy you know, I like your company
And I'm glad you said to me
Baby, can I come inside
I'm so glad I opened up my door
Because we both knew the score
Adn the time was right
No, I'm not dreamin'
You're really really with me
And I love the way it feels
No, I'm not dreamin'
I've waited for this moment for so long
And now it's real
No it's not a dream
Life will come too slow, but
All things come and go, but
I'm sure glad to know
I got you here
And I love the feelin'
So sincere
Your love has got me spinnin'
I'm not dreamin'
You're really really with me
And I love the way it feels
No, I'm not dreamin'
I've waited for this moment oh so long
And now it's here
I should be screamin'
Oh, telling everybody just how good you make me feel
No, I've got you here beside me
And this time I know it's real
Could I be dreamin'?
Or are you really with me right here in my arms?
Oh baby, no I'm not dreamin'
Ohhh, ohhh, gonna love you, gonna love you
