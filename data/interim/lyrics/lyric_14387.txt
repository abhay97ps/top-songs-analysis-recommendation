We’ve been together for a long time, baby
Do you have to leave?
I just can’t live without you
So listen to me
Don’t go girl
Please, don’t go, girl
You would ruin my whole world
Tell me you’ll stay
Never ever go away
I love you
I guess I always will
Girl, you’re my best friend
Girl, you’re my love within
I just want you to know that I will always love you
Ooh, baby, ooh
Tell me you’ll stay
Never ever go away
I need you
I guess I always will
Girl, you’re my best friend
Girl, you’re my love within
I just want you to know that I will always love you
Ooh, baby
I’m gonna always love you, girl
I’m gonna love you, girl
Until the end of time
Tell me girl 
You’re gonna always be mine
Please don’t go, girl
You would ruin my whole world
Tell me you’ll stay
Never, ever go away
I love you 
I guess I always will
Girl, you’re my best friend
Girl, you’re my love within
I just want you to know that I will always love you
Ooh, baby 
Please don’t go, girl 
Please don’t go, girl 
Please don’t go, girl 
Please don’t go, girl 
Please don’t go, girl 
Please don’t go, girl
