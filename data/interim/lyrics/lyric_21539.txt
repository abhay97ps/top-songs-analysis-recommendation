Hang up that red dress
Let down your hair
Cancel those reservations
There's no need to go nowhere
As good as you're lookin' right now
Girl I bet you thinkin' I'm crazy
There's a side of you that I wanna see
That never ceases to amaze me
Gimme that girl with her hair in a mess
Sleepy little smile with her head on my chest
That's the you that I like best
Gimme that girl
Gimme that girl lovin' up on me
Ol' t-shirt and a pair of jeans
That's the you I wanna see
Gimme that girl
Gimme the girl thats beautiful
Without a trace of makeup of on
Barefoot in the kitchen
Singin' her favorite song
Dancin' around like a fool
Starrin' in her own little show
Gimme the girl the rest of the world
Ain't lucky enough to know
Gimme that girl with her hair in a mess
Sleepy little smile with her head on my chest
That's the you that I like best
Gimme that girl
Gimme that girl lovin' up on me
Ol' t-shirt and a pair of jeans
That's the you I wanna see
Gimme that girl
Gimme that girl
Gimme that girl with her hair in a mess
Sleepy little smile with her head on my chest
That's the you that I like best
Gimme that girl
Gimme that girl lovin' up on me
Ol' t-shirt and a pair of jeans
That's the you I wanna see
Gimme that girl
Gimme that girl
