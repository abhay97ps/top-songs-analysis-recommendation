And Jackie, and Jackie, and Jackie, ha-hmm
And Jackie, and Jackie, and Jackie, hey
A Bouvier till her wedding day
Shots rang out, the police came
Mama laid me on the front lawn
And prayed for Jackie’s strength
Feeling old by 21
Never thought my day would come
My bridesmaids getting laid
I pray for Jackie’s strength
Make me laugh, say you know what you want
You said we were the real thing
So I show you some more and I learn
What black magic can do
Make me laugh, say you know you can turn
Me into the real thing
So I show you some more and I learn
Stickers licked on lunch boxes
Worshipping David Cassidy
Yeah, I mooned him once on Donna’s box
She’s still in recovery
Sleepovers Beene’s got some pot
You’re only popular with anorexia
So I turn myself inside out
In hope someone will see, will see
Make me laugh, say you know what you want
You said we were the real thing
So I show you some more and I learn
What black magic can do
Make me laugh, say you know you can turn
Me into the real thing
So I show you some more and I learn
And Jackie, and Jackie, and Jackie's strength
And Jackie, and Jackie, and Jackie, hey
I got lost on my wedding day
Typical, the police came out
But virgins always get backstage
No matter what they’ve got to say
If you love enough you’ll lie a lot
Guess they did in Camelot
Mama’s waiting on my front lawn
I pray, I pray, I said I pray for Jackie’s strength, strength
Make me laugh, say you know what you want
You said we were the real thing
So I show you some more and I learn
And Jackie, and Jackie, and Jackie's strength
And Jackie, and Jackie, and Jackie, hey
