Gimme a beat
Sittin' in the movie show, thinkin' nasty thoughts, ha
Better be a gentleman or you'll turn me off
That's right, let me tell it
Nasty, nasty boys don't mean a thing 
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys don't ever change 
Oh, you nasty boys
I don't like no nasty car, I don't like nasty food
Ooh, ooh yeah
The only nasty thing I like is a nasty groove 
Will this one do? Uh-huh, I know, sing
Nasty, nasty boys don't mean a thing 
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys don't ever change 
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, give me a nasty groove 
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, let me see your nasty body move 
Oh, you nasty boys
I could learn to like this
Listen up
I'm not a prude 
I just want some respect 
So close the door if you want me to respond 
'Cause privacy is my middle name
My last name is control
No, my first name ain't baby
It's Janet, Miss Jackson if you're nasty
Nasty, nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys don't ever change 
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys don't mean a thing to me 
Nasty, don't mean a thing 
Oh, you nasty boys 
I love this part
Hey, who's that thinkin' nasty thoughts? 
Who's that in that nasty car? 
Who's that eatin' that nasty food? 
Who's jammin' to my nasty groove? 
Ladies?
Nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys
