When the temperature dips
I miss my baby's arms
His tender finger tips
Knows just how to keep me warm
It may be zero degrees
With the snow falling down
But I've got warm and tender love
Just as long as he's around
It may be winter outside
But in my heart it's spring
How much joy and pleasure Baby
Can one guy bring me
Winter Nights can be awful cold
Without someone to hold
But when I have him next to me
Baby, I'm in ecstasy
It may be winter outside
But in my heart it's spring
How much joy and pleasure Baby
Can one guy bring me
Throughout my life
I've had my share of guys
But he's been the only one
Who can make my temperature rise
Things are just not the same
When he's not by my side
But yet I shouldn't complain
But be waitng with my arms open wide
It may be winter outside
But in my heart it's spring
How much joy and pleasure Baby
Can one guy bring me
It may be winter outside
But in my heart it's spring
How much joy and pleasure Baby
Can one guy bring me
It may be winter outside
But in my heart it's spring
How much joy and pleasure Baby
Can one guy bring me
