Sometimes she's undecided
Sometimes she just don't care
She thinks so one sided
She thinks looks are fair
Kick the wall
You try but can't quit her
What she wants God only knows
This love it doesn't fit her
She doesn't keep what she outgrows
Kick the wall
You dreamed that she loved you
You couldn't keep her away
When it seemed that she wanted you
But she can't make you stay
If it makes you feel better
Makes you feel like a man
If you can't get her
At least you'll know you can
Kick the wall
You're saying all the things that she wants to hear
All the things that you thought that would make it clear
She's holding out for someone else
And you know that you're still loving by yourself
You take it out on her or something else
If it makes you feel better
Makes you feel like a man
Yeah, if you can't get her
At least you'll know you can
Kick the wall
Makes you feel like a man
Yeah;if you can't get her
At least you'll know you can
Kick the wall
If it makes you feel better
Makes you feel like a man
Yeah, if you can't get her
At least you'll know you can
Kick the wall
Whoa, it makes you feel better
Makes you feel like a man
Yeah; if you can't get her
At least you'll know you can
Kick the wall
