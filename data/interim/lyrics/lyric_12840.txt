Young thing, young thing
Your blade is ripe
Walk out with a fever
In the night
Young thing, young thing
With your fist so fat
Forget about that
Come on out and move me
Move me, move me
Let your spirit ring
Rock me
'Til I can't think
Young thing, young thing
Is your world so flat
Drive out to the edges
Drive it all back
Young thing, young thing
When they lock you inside
Slip out the back
Come on and move me
Move me, move me
Let your spirit ring
Rock me
'Til I can't think
Move me, move me
With all of your might
Rock me, rock me
Rock me, rock me
Young thing, young thing
With your senses sharp
This land is your land
It's in the heart
Young thing, young thing
With your senses keen
This world is your world
This world is free
Young dream, young dream
Take it to the heights
Roll me over
Those cities of lights
Young thing, wild dreams
We'll roll it to the sea
We won't sop until we've
Been released
Move me, move me
Put it to the test
Rock me
I can't get no rest
Move me, move me
'Til I can't sleep
Rock Me
Young thing, young thing
Take me to the heights 
Roll me over
Those cities of lights 
Young thing, wild dreams
We'll roll it to the sea 
We won't stop
Until we've been released 
Young thing, young thing
Is your world so flat 
Let's drive out where the edge is
Drive it all back 
Young thing, wild dreams
When they lock you inside
Slip out the back 
Come on and move me
