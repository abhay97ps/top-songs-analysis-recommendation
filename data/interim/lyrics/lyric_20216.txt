Haha! Y'all need to get ready to hear
The unbelievable, indescribable Vanessa Hudgens
Baby V! 
Every day, I try to play another game
But my heart can’t take it
I try to find another boy
But all the while, I can't face it 
Why do I miss you so much?
I wanna stop this hurt inside
Oh baby, please, give us one more try 
I see you out with all your friends
Laughing it up, as you pretend to have a good time 
I know, 'cause I'm living the same lie 
So one of us has got to say
We can't keep living this same way
So I’ll be the one
Yeah, I’ll say it, I’ll say it, I’ll say it, I’ll say it again 
Baby, come back to me
In my heart I still believe, we were meant to be together
So whatever it takes 
Baby, come back to me
I should have never set you free, my baby
Come back 
I wanna call, but then I stall
'Cause after all, I just couldn’t take it
'Cause if your play was to push me away
You know that day
My heart, you’d break it 
I know I made a mistake 
Can’t you stop your foolish pride  and come back to me?
Let’s try, let’s try, let’s try, let’s try it again
 Baby, come back to me 
In my heart I still believe, we were meant to be together
So whatever it takes 
Baby, come back to me 
I should have never set you free, my baby
Come back 
You know you miss your baby V
And I can see that you think about me
So why do you act like you don’t care? 
Like all this love between us isn’t there
I know that you're upset 
I know I did you wrong 
I know that you want me to pay for all the pain I’ve caused
But in the end, it all comes down to just one thing
It’s you and me, so I sing
Baby, come back
Baby, come back to me
In my heart I still believe, we were meant to be together
So whatever it takes 
Baby, come back to me 
I should have never set you free, my baby
Come back
