Feel lights on me everywhere I go 
Like a little boy up in the candy store 
C-c-craving to get ya hands on 
Give it up before Mama says 'no' 
I'mma let you get a little closer 
Even though I ain't supposed to 
I like it strong when it's longer
I'm a little tipsy, play along with me

All the ladies up in the place , it's your turn 
Give the fellas a little taste  of how it works
I know I probably shouldn't but, uh, I'm feeling good 
I'm a little tipsy, play along with me 
Okay, guess who got that mhm-mhm nani-nani 
In the Mondrian, mhm-mhm, in Miami 
Who's Galliano, whip-whip the Armani 
When it drip-drip, lick-lick like a lolly 
Or, left from Jamaica, go a foreign pan tour 
Jimmy Iovine, Tom Whalley and Lyor 
Keep me and Chrissy in Christian Dior 
But that was before , or, for you
My name Nicki, little daddy, and you? 
You can do anything you put your mind to 
Way you French kiss it, "Français, parlez-vous?" 
Way you work your tongue, can I hire you? 
You know you really wanna , wanna taste my 
You know you want to get a peek, wanna see my 
You know you wanna put your lips where my hips are 
Kiss on my  all over my 
All the boys think it's cake when they taste my 
You don't even need a plate, just your face, ha 
Licky-licky yum-yum, what a great guy 
Now kiss on my  all over my 
Kiss on my, all over my
Kiss on my, all over my
You wanna taste my 
You wanna taste my 
You wanna see my 
All my ladies say 
If you gotta great 
Let him get a peek 
If you gotta sweet 
Let me hear you scream 
But bitches keep it clean
