I told you I was sorry
I told you I was wrong
I said it was an accident, now don't tell anyone
But you love to circle round and round, you're so misunderstood
Yeah, you love to circle round and round and you know that we should
Forget about it--
Let's forget about it
You lied about how much you knew, I thought you were my friend
You lied upon the matrtress, c'mon, tell me where ya been
You lied about this night apart, you lied about the room
If you're gonna have to lie to me then--
Let's forget about it
Let's forget about it
Then, I'll stop cryin' on the mountain that we made from the molehill where we spilt the milk
Yeah, I'll stop cryin' on the mountain that we made from the molehill where we spilt the milk
So you say this never happened, just not the way I thought
Did I throw this out of focus - or was it just the way we fought?
But it seemed to me you took this girl, but you swear to God it's not. 
Let's forget about it
Let's forget about it
Let's forget about it 
Let's forget about it
I'll stop cryin, if you'll stop
I'll stop cryin, if you'll stop
I'll stop cryin, if you'll stop lyin to me
