MALE>There she sits all alone, her tear begins to shed
A written letter in her hand, this is how it read:
Turned sixteen just yesterday 
All my world was bright and gay 
Thought for sure you'd write or call but you didn't after all
Got the Happy Birthday Blues 
Maybe you had lots to do 
Or you found somebody new 
How I pray you'll hear my plea, I'm as lonely as can be
Got the Happy Birthday Blues 
I planned just how this day would be for such a long, long time
You'd wish me "Happy Birthday" while I held your hand in mine
I'd blow out all the candles while I wished that you and I
Would be together ever more until the day we die
As I sit here in the gloom 
Of my cold and lonely room 
How my heart is filled with fears and my eyes are filled with tears
Got the Happy Birthday Blues (Happy Birthday Blues
