You can chain my feet
To the ground
You can build me up
Just to tear me down
Well, you can break my mind
And tear it apart
Can't change my heart
Can't change my heart
Well, you can scream and shout
Tear yourself apart
But you can't change my heart
No, you can't change it
You can't change it
You can't make me love you
Can't you see
Unchain my heart
And set me free
Won't turn me loose
I can't live a lie
Girl, there ain't no use
To stop and wonder why
You better go on out
And make a new start
You can't change my heart
Can't change my heart
No, no, no
Don't you try to do it
No, no, no
Can't change my heart
