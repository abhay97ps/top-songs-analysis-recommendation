Time for livin', time for givin'
No time for makin' up a monster to share
Time for livin', time for givin'
No time for breakin' our own fairytale
Ain't, ain't, ain't nobody's got to spell it for me
Ooh, ain't nobody got to yell, I can see
Ain't nobody got to think, I can hear
But if I have to I will yell in your ear
AAH-OOH!
Time for livin', time for givin'
No time for runnin' over anyone
Let's share time for livin', time for givin'
No time for passin', done the fun
Ain't nobody's got to spell it for me
Ain't nobody got to yell, I can see
Ain't nobody got to think, I can hear
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you yell in my ear
Time for changin', re-arrangin'
No time for peace, just pass the buck
Rearrangin', leader's changin'
Pretty soon he might not give a damn
Ain't nobody's got to spell it for me
Ain't nobody got to yell, I can see
Ain't nobody got to think, I can hear
But if I have to I will yell in your ear
Time's a changin', rearrangin'
Time's a changin', rearrangin'
 Time's a changin',  rearrangin'
 Time's a changin',  rearrangin'
Time rearrangin', time rearrangin'
 Time's a changin',  rearrangin'
 Time's a changin', rearrangin'
 Time's a changin', rearrangin'
Time's a changin', rearrangin'
