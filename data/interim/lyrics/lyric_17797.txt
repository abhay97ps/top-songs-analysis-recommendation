Baby, I know you're hurting
Right now you feel like
You could never love again
Now all I ask is for a chance
To prove that I love you
From the first day
That I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would be
Together, forever, oh, oh, oh
Oooh, when I asked you out
You said "no", but I found out
Darling, that you'd been hurt
You thought that you'd never love again
I deserve a try honey just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me 
Honey, that's no lie 
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me, honey, that's no lie
As time goes by you will get
To know me a little more better
Girl, that's the way love goes baby, baby
And I, I know you're afraid 
To let your feelings show 
And I understand
Girl, it's time to let go, ooh
Girl, it's time to let go because
I deserve a try honey, just once
Give me a chance
And I'll prove this all wrong 
You walked in
You were so quick to judge 
But honey he's nothing like me
Darling, why can't you see
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry 
I'd rather die 
Than live without you 
I'll give you all of me 
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry 
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me, honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart
No way, know how
Girl, I'll never break your heart
No way, make you cry
I swear, oh believe me
I swear, I swear, honey, I swear
No way, know how
I'll do your right
Girl, I'll never break your heart
'Cause I know how!
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry 
I'd rather die 
Than live without you 
I'll give you all of me 
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart 
I'll never make you cry 
I'd rather die than live without you 
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie
