How do you fall in love
And when do you say "I do"
And when is the perfect time
To spend the rest of your life
Seasons may come and go
And sometimes it rains and snows
And there will be highs and lows
So only you will know
You never know just where it will find you
'Cause it can come on you so fast
Or seems like it takes forever
When you want it so bad
But don't ever take it for granted
'Cause it's more than sowing some seeds
And it takes sun and water
So give it what it needs
And that's how you fall in love
And that's when do you say "I do"
And that's when you know it's time
To spend the rest of your life
Now seasons may come and go
But sometimes it rains and snows
And there will be highs and lows
So only you will know
And there will be highs and lows
So only you will know
