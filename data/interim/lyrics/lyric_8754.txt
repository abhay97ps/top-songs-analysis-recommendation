Na nanana nanana nanana
I got a certain little girl she's on my mind
No doubt about it she looks so fine
She's the best girl that I ever had
Sometimes she's gonna make me feel so bad
Na nanana nanana nanana
Hush, hush
I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart but I love her just the same now
Hush, hush
Thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
I need her loving and I'm not to blame now
They got it early in the morning
They got it late in the evening
Well, I want that, need it
Oh, I gotta gotta have it
She's got loving like quicksand
Only took one touch of her hand
To blow my mind and I'm in so deep
That I can't eat and I can't sleep
Na nanana nanana nanana
Listen
Hush, hush
Thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart but I love her just the same now
Hush, hush
Thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
I need her loving and I'm not to blame now
They got it early in the morning
They got it late in the evening
Well, I want that, need it
Oh, I gotta gotta have it
I'm alive!
And I see things mighty clear today, I'm alive!
I'm alive!
And I'm breathin' clean, fresh air today, I'm alive!
I'm alive!
Who cares if my hair is a little bit long, I'm alive!
I'm alive!
And I'm doin' my thing and singin' my song, I'm alive!
I'm real!
I can see and touch and taste and feel and I'm alive!
I'm a man!
And I'm red and yellow and black and tan, I'm a man!
