You were such a beautiful soul
But we all know that this world is ruthlessly cold
We all gotta go thru heat
Even the greatest fall while standing on both feet
Why I quit crying cus I know that you in heaven
Riding d bicycle u never learned perfectly as an earthling
And every time you look down I hope you smiling at me
I hope ur tear drop is among the rain drops fallin on me
I hope ur spirit kissed me goodbye b4 you left earth
Tho I was fast asleep laying right beside ur death bed
You was my biggest fan and it always struck my heart
When u recited  all the lyrics to my tracks by heart
Though u didn't like rap, but they were your favorite songs
To say I lost my biggest fan is quite affirmative huh
But I know a nigga gotta take heart and stay strong
So am lifting these heavy barrels of my chest with this song
Memories come alive in my head
Reminiscing but the beauty unsaid
Memories come alive in my head
Of you of you of you
Rose petals falling and I think of you
Naomi Naomi Naomi Naomi
There should be no hook on this song cus am not tryna catch a fish
I should let it slip away but am not tryna catfish
Shook the foundations of everything a nigga believed
When I gave you cpr and you couldn't come out of sleep,.... damn
Oh Lord, why didn't you give her another chance
Or heal her like u promised I'd  I'd never understand
Told my momma not to cry I had to act like her man
All is well the God always has a better plan
So you see apparently your brother has been mixing all these melodies
Just to show you how much your passing away has affected me
And when you left I felt there was nothing left in me
Feels like I've been hit a plague without a remedy
Still I try to keep it on a lowlow
Even when the traffic of my thoughts make me go slow
Because of this occurrence I swore that I would grind more
And always ringout your name whenever ProSyd on tour
Memories come alive in my head
Reminiscing but the beauty unsaid
Memories come alive in my head
Of you of you of you
Rose petals falling and I think of you
Naomi Naomi Naomi Naomi
Had to call my Vanessa Victoria told me she ain't sleeping at night
Cracked her a few jokes to make her heart feel light
I think I cried myself to sleep right about that night
When i remembered that taught you to build that kite
I remember holding on my arms when you were born and I was like
Hey mama can I marry this beautiful one
She laughed and laughed and said that won't be possible son
That's what we call abomination in the land where we from
I remember admist the crying and wailing
On that fateful day
I checked my phone guess what the wallpaper was saying
It said put up and be strong
That was the Lord speaking to me so I wiped my tears off
So ama be strong for u
This Ep is dedicated to you
Cause I know if u were around you'd prolly know all the lyrics b4 I even get to perform em
We love you forever and a week more
