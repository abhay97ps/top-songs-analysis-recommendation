I know what life has done to you
Things haven't been much fun for you
That's why you went away
And now, I'm all alone
I wasn't meant to be on my own
Turn back, turn back
And come and get me
Oh, come and get me
Take me along
I don't care where you lead me
If you leave me
It can't be wrong
Just to be with you
There's no place in this world
That I wouldn't go
This time isn't the time for you
You have to be where the skies are blue
And here, the skies are gray
Darling, I understand
Don't you need someone to hold your hand?
Turn back, turn back
And come and get me
Oh, come and get me
Take me along
I don't care where you lead me
If you leave me
It can't be wrong
Just to be with you
There's no place in this world
That I wouldn't go
Oh, please, won't you tell me
Where you've gone to, gone to?
If I knew where you were I'd be right there
Please, send me hope to be hanging onto
Just to show me you care
