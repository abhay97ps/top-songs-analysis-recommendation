I wanna be your lady
I wanna be your baby
Hug me every night
Cuddle me real tight
Squeeze me with all your might
Oh yeah...
Uh huh
Take up to heaven above
Today'll be my birthday
But? day
Love is crazy, they say
I was born today
Won't you skate my way
Oh baby...
Oh yeah
Uh huh
Take up to heaven above
Come on now...
Take me?
Take me?
Say you'll be my boy
Rock me in the cradle of love
My baby
Oh yeah
Uh huh
Take up to heaven above
Oh yeah...
Kiss me every night
Cuddle me real tight
Squeeze with all your might
Rock me in the cradle of love
Everybody...
Rock me in the cradle of love
Come on now...
Rock me in the cradle of love
Come on now...
Rock me in the cradle of love
