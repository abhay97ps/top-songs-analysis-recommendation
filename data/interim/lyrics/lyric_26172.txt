I ain't gonna stay for the weekend
I ain't gonna jump off the deep end
I ain't gonna ask where your ring is
Thing is, we all got secrets
You don't wanna hear about my last break up
I don't wanna worry 'bout space you take up
I don't even care if you're here when I wake up
It's just a room key
You ain't gotta lie to me
Can't you just use me like I'm using you?
How it goes is, bar closes
There's no king bed covered in roses
Just a room without a view
I don't want a number you ain't gonna answer
Let's just stick to the one night standards
Well, I ain't Cinderella, but who is?
Call me what you want if the shoe fits
I ain't gonna say I never do this
'Cause truth is, lonely makes a heart ruthless
Ain't nobody gonna hurt nobody
Ain't nothing wrong with needing somebody
You can leave all that
Down in the lobby
It's just a room key
You ain't gotta lie to me
Can't you just use me like I'm using you?
How it goes is, bar closes
There's no king bed covered in roses
Just a room without a view
No, I don't want a number you ain't gonna answer
Let's just stick to the one night standards
How it goes is, bar closes
There's no king bed covered in roses
Just a room without a view
No, I don't give a damn about the morning after
Bottles on the floor don't even matter
I don't want a number you ain't gonna answer
Let's just stick to the one night standards
The one night standards
The one night standards
