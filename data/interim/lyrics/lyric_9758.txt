Everybody's startin' to pick on you
Just can't let them tell you what to do
You've only got one life, so live it cool
In this world of strife, you can't be a fool
Don't let nobody tell ya what to do
You gotta be your judge, and your jury too
Don't let nobody tell ya what to do
Gotta be your judge and jury too
All right
Gotta do your thing, and let it all hang out
Gotta really show them, what it's all about
Move on up, don't look around
People will always try to put you down, down, now
Don't let nobody tell ya what to do
You gotta be your judge, and your jury too
Don't let nobody tell ya what to do
Gotta be your judge and jury too
Woooo!
What you wanna
What you wanna
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do
I'm gonna do, yeah
I'm gonna do
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna do, yeah
I don't want to hurt nobody
I don't want to hurt nobody
I don't want to hurt nobody
Just got to do my thing, now
Gotta do, gotta do, gotta do
