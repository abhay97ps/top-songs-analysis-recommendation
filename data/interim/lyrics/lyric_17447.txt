We carved a path to the ocean*
We built a house of brick and stone
So that they couldn’t see us
So that they wouldn’t know
And we were sure we could be all alone
But all the spaces and the corners
All the sons and all the daughters
All the crimes and hallelujahs;
All the turnkeys and the hinges
All the carnies and the kinless
All the rockets and the tailspins
And we still can’t hide
Small time saviors have all tried
To convince us we can hide
But take the tongue from a bell;
All that’s left’s a sad farewell
‘Cause you know what’s not said will tell the tale
Say what you please, there’s a target on your sleeve
But can’t you see, you got lots of company?
Don’t you know we are all fugitives and refugees
