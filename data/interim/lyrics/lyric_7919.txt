We ran the through hills and forests
As two under a spell
He was a city boy, Floyd the outlaw
But I thought I knew him well
Long after that great summer
When I first came into my fame
And the Avenger from Oklahoma
Was added to my name
The Avenger I became
Well, they call me Avenging Annie
I'm avenger of womanhood
I spend my whole life telling lies
Lead you on and mess you over good
I take all you spoiled young hippies
Running around, playing games
Mess around in your bed, I'll blow your head
I'll put you through a change
What you've done to others
I'll do unto you
And then I met my sensitive outlaw
He was the best thing I had ever seen
I wanna be his wife forgiving my life
I was so blind I could never have seen, no
So I joined up with my outlaw
And headed for California
He treated me worse than I ever imagined
He even say he don't want me around
Kept it up so long, I couldn't be strong
He run me right into the ground
After five long years
He picked me up and then he slapped me down
When I told my friends about him
They all were on my side
And I could see through the haze he looked so crazy
I put my head right down and I cried
For my poor lover
I cried like a mother for my poor lover
Well, I felt so sad about it
But I knew I couldn't do him no good
He was so far gone while standing all alone
I left him, I knew I should
I knew I couldn't do him no good
And now I live out on a mountain top
And I'm almost thirty-five
And I've found my peace and I've found my release
And I'm happy just to be alive
And I might go back to my Floyd
If I think it's the thing to do
He gave up murder and theft right after I left
And you know I still love him too
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Just like your woman loves you
Well, they call me Avenging Annie
I'm avenger of womanhood
I spend my whole life telling lies
Lead you on and mess you over, yeah
They call me Avenging Annie
I'm avenger of womanhood
I spend my whole life telling lies
Lead you on and mess you over, yeah
