I love you so you'll never know
Don't ever stop believing
Out of out minds time after time
It's such a crazy feelin'
Feelin' good feelin' high
Feel so free I wanna fly
Feel the sun feel the ground
Feel it just go round and round
I wanna stay day after day
And just a little longer
You close to me I gotta be
You know the love gets stronger
Ooo turnin' like a wheel
Changin' it to real
Whenever we are one
It's true it's always me and you
Thru any kinda weather...
