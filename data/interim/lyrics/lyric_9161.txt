See girls every day
But I just look away
I'm saving all my love for you
I want you here in my heart
Until you're in my arms
??????
So pledge your love to me
Through all eternity
I love you with every
Beat of my heart, girl
With every beat of my heart, girl
With every beat of my heart, girl
With every beat of my heart
I love you with every
Beat of my heart, girl
I love you
