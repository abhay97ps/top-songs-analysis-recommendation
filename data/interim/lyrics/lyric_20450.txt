"Diamonds Are Forever" instrumental
Uhh yeah - Y, B's
I swear this album is crazy
Do our dance with us
Get'cha lean on, shorty bring it back
Go get'cha lean on, shorty bring it back
Hey get'cha lean on, shorty bring it back
Get'cha lean on, shorty bring it back, c'mon
Hey sexy lady, it was nice to know you 
But I gotta move 
Hey sexy lady, it was nice to know you 
But I gotta move 
Hey sexy lady~!
Oh - and damn right babygirl's a diva
But e'rytime she out with me she be blowin reefer
In the Coupe lookin better than the Mona Lisa
Tunin into my songs thinkin 'bout features
She know her little nigga spit ether
And them grown dudes really don't know how to treat her
So she rock with me, and I roll wit her
Cause I'm a d-boy, and she's a go getter
Uhh, this new girl that I'm provin on
Got a young boy thinkin 'bout movin on
She got her Louis Vuitton bag and her shoes on
Wanna take her to the telly bust a move dawg
See a nigga need more than one
I parked the Rolls outside like Reverand Run
And rolled up the blunt, yeah full of bubblegum
Yung Boss, it's our year, we got another one
Hey sexy lady, it was nice to know you 
But I gotta move 
Hey sexy lady, it was nice to know you 
But I gotta move 
Hey sexy lady~!
Yeah - and damn right baby girl the shit
Say she love it when I throw it deep like Micheal Vick
I love it cause she know them young'uns don't bite or lick
She know the kid hit the lab though and write a hit
Uhh - and ain't no denyin it 
She want it she can have it, why? Cause I'm buyin it
The boss boy gotta roll with the flyest bitch
And she the truth; if I'm lyin' then I'm dyin' man
This other chick that I'm divin' in
She a good look that's why we always dinin' in
Shyea, in L.A. we at Katana
Or in Chi-Town, we straight to Benihanas
And how she doin', man she did it proper 
Three hours and we both kept on our Prada's 
I had my loafers she was in them heels 
Berg and the Y.B.'s hit big deals
Hey sexy lady, it was nice to know you 
But I gotta move 
Hey sexy lady, it was nice to know you 
But I gotta move 
Hey sexy lady~!
Get'cha lean on, shorty bring it back 
Go get'cha lean on, shorty bring it back 
Hey get'cha lean on, shorty bring it back 
Get'cha lean on, shorty bring it back, ah c'mon~!!
