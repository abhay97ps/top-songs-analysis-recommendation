Supreme
My Elohim team goin' lead
I keep it OG where they don't come around
Some of y'all is in at night, scared when the sun is down
Welcome to the town, it's like a battleground
14th, Broadway, helicopters hover now
Gather the homies we gonna mob like renegades
Black hoodie, black hat, to them I'm the enemy
That's Babylon, 100 uniform
Black bloc, blacktop, trouble gonna bubble up
Come on baby light my fire
Come on baby light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Supreme
My Elohim team goin' lead
Big it up for the kings and queens

Where they at? Where they at yo?

Yeah, they shot another brother
It made it on the cover
And still the killer walked
Oakland to Florida
There's been a lot of pork
I mean a lot of swine
Just what I'm tryin' to say is
This happens all the time
To you it might be cool, but see the golden rule
Do unto others as, they will do unto to you
Trayvon and Oscar too, you can't escape the truth
Too many cities gonna burn
What's a G to do?
A change for better or
Better prepare for war
Communities are torn
Hostilities are born
How to bear the storm?
Put some compassion on
We human beings are the same
Don't care where you're from
I never pack a gun, enough destruction, son
I'm on the run, 'til I'm done, rebel champion
I love my fam, and my God, I protect
Good folk, represent, now let's step
