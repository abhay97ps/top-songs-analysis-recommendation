Spoken: In the year of our Lord Nine Ninety-Two, the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu set sail in their long boats on a voyage to rediscover the lost continent. After many months on perilous, stormy seas, their search was fruitless. Just when all seemed lost, they discovered AMERICA! The music you are about to experience is the celebration of the one thousandth anniversary of their founding of this great nation
The lyrical Prophet just can't stop it
The way I drop it and change the topic
Get hyped to the tongue of a native
So creative - KLF made it
We came a long time ago
Nine Nine Two - but you did not know
So if you think that the going gets tough
Just remember
What Time is Love
What Time is Love
What Time is Love
I wanna see you sweat 
I wanna see you sweat 
America 
America
Get Higher
Take a chance to advance and participate
I Devastate - The Rhymes are Great
We had to pass the Pyramid Blaster
The JAMs are here, to put you in a rapture
To make you, shake you, break you, take to
Right in the Path, what they call the Mu Mu
KLF - Can you get enough? Bring the Break
What Time is Love 
What Time is Love 
What Time is Love 
I wanna see you sweat 
I wanna see you sweat 
America
I wanna see you
Be young, be free, the American way
Be young, be free, the American way
America
America
America
America
Ohhhhhh Get Higher
Ohhhhhh Get Higher
Be young, be free, the American way
Be young, be free, be rich

The Final Chapter, Copecetic, Poetic
When I've done - This calls for anaesthetic
Make way for a positive thing
A theme, a dream and the man might sing
We came a long time ago
Nine Nine Two but you did not know
So if you think that the going gets tough
Just Remember
What Time is Love 
What Time is Love 
I wanna see you sweat 
I wanna see you sweat 
America

What Time is Love

What Time is Love
