If teardrops could flood an ocean
I have an ocean
You try
You'd make it in extra fast time
Just as a pastime
Easy as pie
Each time you
Cry, baby, cry
Just the way I did the day you broke my heart
Cry, baby, cry
Tables turn and now you've learned you're not so smart
You broke every promisea
You couldn't be true
You gave me the go-by
For somebody new when I needed you
So cry, baby, cry
My eyes are dry
I'm laughin' up my sleeve to see my cry baby cry
Cry, baby, cry 
Just the way I did the day you broke my heart
Cry, baby, cry
You feel too high
Tables turn and now you've learned you're not so smart
You broke every promisea
You couldn't be true
You gave me the go-by
For somebody new when I needed you
So cry, baby, cry
My eyes are dry
I'm laughin', yes laughin'!
I'm laughin' up my sleeve to see my cry-baby cry
