There is a place
That is so hard to find
Behind the walls
We build inside our minds
Some break the walls
Some break the rules
Some even get things changed
And when they do
That leads to the truth
Yet questions still remain
But all that it's saying
Somewhere in life
There's a joy to be
Between the hope and reality
There in a mirror
And then the street
That's where you'll find
People in search of a life
And what of love
Is that a point of view
And when you're alone
It can seem so confused
That's when a friend
Can pull you in
Lend you a helping hand
But what happens when
Your only friend
Sells you out in the end
How do you face it
Somewhere in life
There's a joy to be
Between the hope and reality
There in a mirror
And then the street
That's where you'll find
People in search of a life
In search of a life
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Searchin'
Lookin' in a bottle
Lookin' in a needle
Lookin' in the street
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Searchin'
Everywhere
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh-oh-oh
Straight from Brooklyn
Better known as Crooklyn
Never take us short
Cos Brooklyn's the borough
Straight from Brooklyn
Better known as Crooklyn
Never take us short
Cos Brooklyn's the borough
We did it like that
And now we do it like this
We did it like that
And now we do it like this
Yeah
Now the clock hits
Who got the cocaine
Don't tell me it's
The little kids on Soul Train
The metaphor sent
From my brain to my jaw
It comes from other places
Not the typical places
Journalistic values are yellow
And then the court falters
You watch Channel Zero
And that bitch Barbara Walters
She'll have you believe
Black invented crack
When President Lyndon had to form
A law way back in '63 with Kennedy
Yes, the double-cross
Remember that's when they blew
His fucking head off
Vietnam vets come back lookin'
Like one-armed pets
Mixin' thoughts, purer text
No picket fence
No job, no ATM in the car
Blue collar comes to bourgeois
Depressed in your chest...

Hey! Welcome to the show
That never ends
Bartucci, what you got?
We got a black male, dead man
Darryl Adams, 22 years old
He's the night manager of this joint
Kid's standin' by the door having
A conversation with another male
Pop, pop, poppity-pop
Darryl goes down
Shooter does a Carl Lewis
Neighbourhood says
There's four shots fired
At this point, that's all she wrote
- Robbery?
- Nah. Way too fast
Drugs? Was he a scumbag?
To tell you the truth
I never seen this kid before
Boys, Darryl Adams
Darryl Adams, the boys
- Hey, Darryl
- Hello in there
Live by the gun
Die by the gun

Bing, bing, bing. Ricochet Rabbit

Let's see
No powder burns on the face

Nothin' up the sleeve
He might get better
But he ain't never gettin' well
- And presto!

On the light hand side
Hey, look at that. Looks like some
Kind of an Egyptian peace sign
You're right there. It says goodbye
Hey, Moe. My main man
Gonna need prints off that door
Fuck you, Rocco
That'll really narrow it down

Son of a bitch! That's Darryl Adams!
Who?
He worked in Rodney's candy store

Clockin' like a motherfucker, man
You guys done yet?
Ho! Marvello the magician!

To be an accountant
Now this shit is fuckin' my body up

That's why I don't
Give a shit about nobody
And I don't wanna
See your ass no more!
Cos you ain't got no business
Out here fuckin' with this shit
You'll end up like me. Or worse
My old man...
Was a preacher
And when I started messin'
With this shit
He said, "You gonna pay for that
"You gonna pay for that shit, boy."
He was right
You can't cheat this shit no...mo'
Get the fuck outta here!

Good-for-nothin', death-dealin' scum

Messin' with Tyrone

In your butt my own damn self
Don't let me find Andre either
Have a good Sunday
Shit. I know that bitch
Ain't talkin' to me
- Scientific, man, shut up
- You shut up, man
OK, Victor? Ready to go?
Normally I'd cuff you, brother
But you look like
The kind of guy I can trust
Like I said
I had some drinks at Kool Breeze
- Uh, Scotch
- "Some"?
Like two or three
I usually go in there
After most work nights
Uh-huh. How long were you in there?
Uh, I don't know
About eight-thirty till about ten
Uh, see... My shift...at Hambones -
I'm a...I'm a manager
It don't end till ten
I wasn't feelin' very good
So I left early
You weren't feelin' good
So you went to Kool Breeze?
It wasn't like it was a "goin' home"
Not feelin' good
You had a headache? An argument?
No, I just...just tired, man
Go ahead
So I left Kool Breeze
Uh, started walkin' home
I cut through Ahab's parking lot
And this guy just flexed on me, man
He jumped outta nowhere
I got scared. You know the rest
Tell me, Victor.
I just... I shot him
Hey, little man
I like that cut
- Where'd you get it?
- Barber shop
You know, you used to have
A good head on your shoulders
Before Rodney got a hold of you
Still do
You know, Ronald, I been lookin' out
For you since you been yea high
Now, you don't want my guidance?
Fine. It's your life
Let me tell you somethin'
You even glance in the direction
Of that little kid Tyrone
And I'm gonna fuck you up so bad
You're gonna wish I had killed you
Now, do we have an understanding?
Do we have an understanding?
Yeah
Why do we keep goin' through this?
I told you already
The guy jumped outta nowhere, I
Got scared... Bam! Then I ran. I ran!
You mean bam, bam, bam, bam
- What?
- Four bullets in the body
- Where did you carry the gun?
- In my gym bag
What else you carry in it?
My uniform from Hambones
A sandwich from home
I don't eat Hambones myself
As quiet as it's kept
OK. Was the, uh
Gym bag zippered, locked?
Don't shake your head, Victor
- Where's my mattresses?
- What?
I told you about my mattresses
For them kids
They ask, "You say we gonna have
A tumblin' club. We need mattresses."
And I say, "Well, Strike's
Buyin' 'em. He promised."
Now, look, I ain't busted you yet
But till I do
You gonna be my main benefactor
You gonna sponsor this club
You understand me?
And, Ronald, I'm only tellin'
You one more time, you hear?
The store was closed
One of them Jewish holidays
- What Jewish holiday?
- I don't know. Pick one
Tomorrow, all right?
I swear, I'll swing by tomorrow
Andre, these cuffs is too tight, man
You and me used to be tight
Am I under arrest?
What for?
Could you uncuff me, please
And let me outta here?
You don't have to live like this
There's more than just these projects
Out there, you know
Don't you wanna go someplace
You never been?
I mean, you love trains
But you've only ridden the subway
Go on, man. Get outta here
And get them mattresses
For my kids, hear?
- Never
- Never?
You never walked by
On a hot day with your two kids?
- Stopped in for a soda?
- With my two kids?
I barely see my two kids
I'm always working
When I get home, I'm exhausted
Do you have any kids?
Yeah. I have
A two-year-old daughter
Have you ever come home so tired
You hated the sound
Of your own kids cryin'?
Your own flesh and blood
My wife, Sharon, says
"Quit a job. You got two."
What the hell she thinks I got
Two jobs for in the first place?
Look, I'm...I'm tryin', man
I am really tryin'
To move us out of the projects
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm working, I'm saving
I'm trying to do the best I can
Provide those ends. I gotta work
I'm never late. I gotta work
Victor, listen to me
You're a good, decent
Church-goin', God-fearin' kid
And if you did pull the trigger
There has to be a reasonable answer
Other than what you've told me here
I gotta ask myself, why would Darryl
The night manager at Ahab's
Try to rob you
In his own parking lot?
So I think it had to be personal
Mm-mm. No
I never saw him before in my life
- He flexed, you shot?
- I'm through with it
I told you what happened
What else do you want?
- The truth
- The truth is lookin' at you!
If he did something, if he threatened
Your family, this helps you
You were buggin' - "can't sleep
Can't eat". This helps you in court
What did that prick do to you?
It was self-defence
Self-defence, huh?
I wanna see what you see
Uh. I disagree
I don't think I do look
That fuckin' stupid
Dang, man. In the papers
I thought Vic was legit
What happened?
Boy already had like five jobs
Ooh-ooh!
Aw, shit, man! What the fuck
The homo-cide want now?
Mandela projects, all right?
- Yo, Tyrone
- What's up?
Come over here and watch
The car for me, all right?
- All right?
- Yeah, cool. What you gonna give us?
Catch you in a little bit
We ain't gonna do it
For free
I'll take care
Of you later
Excuse me, sir
Which building is 235 Hoyt?
- Right there
- Thank you
Is that Nintendo or Sega?
- Sega
- What's it called?
- "Gangsta."
- Whatever happened to Tiddlywinks?
Rocco, don't you know this is
The new sensation across the nation?
- Where you goin'?
- My friend's house
Everybody wants
To be a gangsta, right?
Yeah, you like that, right?
You like lookin' at that, right?
- Wanna know how much it costs
- I know that
Yeah, I'm sure
Probably want to buy one, right?
How you know I don't got one?
- Why did he have that gun?
- Everybody has one
- Does he drink a lot?
- He only drank at night
That makes two of us
- How about drugs?
- He's clean as the Board of Health
Did he have
Any new friends recently?
- Hangin' out with any new people?
- Not that I know of
You must be thinking of Ronald
But he hasn't lived here in a while
- He's quite the athlete
- Yes
- You boys must be proud of your dad
- Yes
I'll bet. Something's not right
When I'm workin' on something
I gotta make it right
These are my two sons
Victor and Ronald
Victor's a hard-working
Handsome young man
He doesn't lie. If he said it was
Self-defence, it was self-defence
Why don't you believe him?
Do you mind
If I borrow these?
I have to go around and retrace
His steps the other night
- and I'd rather not show a mug shot
- Sure
You be good boys
Take care of your mother
- Strike
- You know him?
He's an arrogant piece of shit
Comes into my store all the time
Like he craps beige
He used to work with Rodney
Last year in his store, with Darryl
Now he runs the crew on the benches
Clocks for Rodney just like Darryl
Let's bring him in
- What up, man?
- They went to the ninth floor
Shit! I knew it
- Did they say anything?
- Asked me about "Gangsta"
- Anything else?
- Nah
All right, Shorty
You did good, man
Go upstairs before your mom
Come down flippin'
All right
Go on upstairs
- Who you hidin' from?
- Come on, man
What you sneakin' up on me for?
I'm not gonna keep tellin' you
To leave him be
- Tell him!
- How you feel about your brother?
It's fucked up, man
I heard he confessed
You been to see him?
I'm goin'. I'm goin'
You need to have your stomach
Checked out
By the way, my kids thank you
From the bottom of their hearts
For their mattresses
Now doesn't that make you feel good?
You know this kid?
- Yep. He was in here
- When?
Boy was in here Friday
He had one drink
- One drink? Wasn't drunk?
- Nope
- He was rude
- Yeah
Ooh! I'm just gettin' warmed up
But it's The Bomb
Was he with anybody?
He came in alone
Might've had a conversation
Can't recollect
Do you recollect the shooting?
Hell, yeah
Who do you think called the cops?
So that's who you're lookin' for?
Do you remember if the kid was here
Before or after the shooting?
He was in here before
You know how I know?
Cos I was watchin' him
I never saw him before. He was jumpy
Thought he might have been
One of those stick-up kids
This is Strike. Jesus Christ
They don't look alike to me
What about him?
Oh, yeah. Victor? A regular
What's up with him?
Strike, how come you didn't tell me
Your brother did it?
Come on, Rodney, man
What, you forgot?
- You told me you didn't wanna know
- Yeah, you right
Victor popped Darryl?
Hey, I don't know if he even did it
Victor your brother
You supposed to know
Errol, Errol, just...
We ain't had that conversation
About Darryl, did we?
What conversation?
There, you see? Ain't no problem
Go ahead, man. Break
That's my boy!
Came in one night only
On the night of the shooting
Has the jumps. Never sat down
Left sober before the shooting
Yo's jacket shows
Possession with intent
Possession of unlicensed firearm
And assault, for which
He still owes three years
Listen to me, Rocco
He's all strung out
Has a few schnorts over his limit
He gets fried, walks out of Kool
Breeze with the heater in his bag
The Adams guy jumps out
Startles him
Pops the first guy
Who steps on his Nikes
It's like a capper on a bad day
That's how these Nubians do it. He
Gets religion, comes in, gives it up
I'm not wasting my time on this
Come on, Larry. Can't you see
What they're tryin' to pull?
Larry. Yo walks in
Says he's the shooter
No record
Two adorable kids, two jobs
Model citizen. Claims self-defence
- OK. All right
- Who's gonna argue?
Now, this other one...Strike
If he tried that, they'd throw
The key away. He's a known scumbag
No wonder this sounds like horseshit
He's lying
Victor never got off that bar stool
- Yo was taken away for his brother
- For what?
Brotherly love?
Fear? For money? What?
They ran a game on me, these two
Cos this cocksucker
Is an innocent man
Just because a Nubian -
Excuse me, Lieutenant -
Got a wife, a job, kids
A dog and a bank account
He can't be a shooter?
You did everything but stick
Your tongue down his throat
The kid didn't budge
Rocco, listen to me
Even if this Victor kid is sellin' us
A line of shit on the tape...
Which is what they all do anyhow
Even if they're givin' it up...
This is still a good
Solid "closed by arrest"
And if I'm wrong, and Rodney
Conspired in on this, or Strike...
Or the fuckin' Medelln cartel
I don't give a fuck
Cos we got the shooter
We locked up the wrong brother
The wrong brother. Yeah. Yeah
Well, it's on you, OK?
What I want to know is where the fuck
Did these yos get balls big enough
To think that they could
Put this one past me?
I'm tired of hearin' that "yo" shit
From you. Back off
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. Excuse me
I don't mean any offence
Anybody can bust off an oowop
What makes Vic any different?
Come on, man
Papers say he had a .38
- Regardless what the papers say
- Wait, motherfucker
When was the last time
You bust off an oowop?
I never murdered nobody
But I'm gonna murder someone now!
Yo, yo, chill. Hold it, man. Kill
That noise. Homo-cide creepin' up
How you doin', fellas?
Look who's here
Ronnie Dunham, big man
- Ronnie?
- Can I talk to you a minute?
Go on, bitch
I'm Rocco Klein
DA's Homicide Squad
- You got a minute?
- Homo-cide
I'm doin' the Darryl Adams job
Your brother, you know?
How's he doin'?
Wouldn't know. Haven't seen him yet
That's no joke in there
You been in?
Just overnight on a confusion
Wasn't no thing
Errol. I thought you were dead
I was. I came back
Mr Barnes waiting for you?
Nah, not me
I'm not happy about this
Your brother fessed up
But it was some bullshit explanation
Ronnie, you know what he told us?
How the fuck would I know?
I wasn't there
- Wasn't there?
- Where he was telling you all this
What do you think happened?
Got me
You think him and Darryl
Had some static? A beef?
- Did you know Darryl Adams?
- No, no, no
- You didn't know Darryl Adams?
- Nah, man
I never met him, nothin'. Nah
When's the last time
You saw your brother?
- It's been a while
- Week, month, year?
- Yeah
- Which one?
Two months
Two months?
You wanna get that?
What you talkin'? That ain't mine
What do you know?
Ronnie, I was lookin' for
Some help, some insight
Your brother's got those kids
Your nephews
Hey, maybe the guy was a crackhead
Darryl?A crackhead?
Crackin' up? Says who?
Ain't nobody sa... It's just...
It's just around, you know
You know what I'm tryin' to say
- You clocking?
- Nah

- What is you? Deaf? I don't hustle
Look. Here's my card
You hear anything...
Boom - pick up the phone

Cos I wouldn't do this
Lord, if I tried...
- What he want?

Yeah, all right
Hm

- Likes to drink the chocolate Moos
I need yo to talk to me. You mind
Laying some cards on him for me?
- Depends
- Need him to sweat
- What'll you do for me?
- Nothin' you don't do for yourself
Strike, my man!
This is a new day, Strike
Dinkins out, Rudy in. Law and order
Cut the budget. Party's over
Crackdown on drugs, crime, niggers
Spics, homeless, squeegeemen
African-Americans

Not a thing, Detective
Detective? Call me Jo-Jo
You like basketball?
Nah. I don't like sports
- What do you like?

Choo-choo trains?
You can't dunk a basketball?

For some chocolate Moolies
Or whatever it is you drink
Till about 11, bet?
Yeah, bet
I look out for you
You look out for me
- Yeah, all right
- No, no, no. No "all right"
I look out for you
You look out for me
- You look like 500
- 500. That's a start
Good. Every week, I look out for you
I tell you when we're hittin'. Week
In, week out, you look out for me
- Cool?
- Cool
This is my man Kirby
Kirby gonna double back in
Like 30 minutes. You lay it on him
You tell your boy Rodney
I got some good stuff he could use
Finest, highest quality
Peace out
I think you dropped this
If I was you
I think I'd call this guy
Larry
Yo, Strike
- Been waiting for 40 minutes...
- Who's here to see Victor Dunham?
You told me he was gonna
Come down a half-hour ago
Watch your tone
Young lady
Aw, man. I love you. I love you, man
- Cool, man
- You look good
After you, man
Somebody got bored shaving
So they decided
To cut me up with a razor
And they stole my sneakers, too
Yo, big brother
You made the papers, man
Ronnie...
Can you get me outta here, man?
- I'll try. What's the bail?
- 50,000
- What's the cash options?
- My lawyer says maybe in a week...

That ten per cent thing
- Maybe Rodney got...

Tell motherfuckers
To stop fuckin' with you
Yeah, man
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe
Look, man, I'm gonna try
To get you outta here, OK?
Ronnie, some of these brothers...
Some of these men...
They love jail, man
But all this, this ain't for me, man
I'm gonna get you
Outta here, all right?
You kiss my babies for me, please?
- All right
- Thank you
We've been open
For about a year
We've done pretty well so far
When I read about it
My heart was broken
Victor is a sweetheart
- Was he ever late for work?
- Never. Like Swiss movement
- Did he ever steal?
- No, he was honest
- Get any visitors?
- No
See him in here?
No
Victor was my buffer
He could talk and reason with them
Anybody ever threaten him?
Open up your eyes
And realise things is tough
Your shit is my rough
When you livin' in the city
Walk with your head high
Step with the bitty-bop
Got to survive
When you slam or you do or die
Cos niggers try to read through
A nigga's eyes...
- May I help you?
- Huh?
- May I help you?
- Yeah, let me the fuck in the store
This is a store, right?
People buy shit in the store
- What do you wish to buy, brother?
- I wish to buy what you got
Maybe we don't have what you want
Unbelievable. What are you
The security house nigga?
- What? They rent you by the hour?
- We're just trying to help...
Fuck that, man!
Cos I'm black, that automatically
Mean I'm gonna steal something
Nigga, I came in here
To buy a birthday gift for my mom!
But you ain't shit
And neither is this bullshit kung fu
Chinese bitch store!
Fuck you, motherfucker!

And pump bullets in your ass
Think I'm playing?
You disrespectin' me
On my mother's birthday...nigga!
Listen up, man

Yo, Ty, that's my landlord

Now, go up the steps. Hurry up
Hey, Shorty
What you doin'? Don't touch that
Buggin'. You know anything
About what you're touchin'?
No
Little buster
Lionel Trains, right?
They was built in the early 1900s
But them cheap shits
They only ran on dry cell batteries
But, yo, after World War II
When more folks started getting
Electricity in their cribs
Boom, they made the new ones
Yeah, phat, right?
Yeah
Yo, profit's all in the cut
Don't never forget that
Yo, Shorty, if I ever see
Or even hear about you
Messin' with this stuff right here
Man, sniffin' or pipin' up...
Yo, come here, man
The word to my mother
Put a cap in your ass
This ain't no TV movie
Violence bullshit neither
This stuff out here is real
Real bullets hurt
And real guns kills you dead
See this right here?
This is .25 automatic
I keeps this for all them
Ill niggers out there
Like that one dude Errol
Now that brother's crazy
He will blast your ass
Just won't give a fuck
The messed-up thing is
That they never find the body
Just the blood stains on the ground
If he ever try to creep up on me
I'm gonna gat his ass
You best be ready
To do the same shit, too
Aw, don't think
That just cos you're 12
Small and shit
That he won't smoke you
Just last year
He caught himself a ten-year-old
I knows you probably thinking about
What Mr Brown said earlier and all
But, chill, don't even
Sweat that shit, man
He's old and po'
He don't know what time it is
This is how you get
That money right here
How do you think I got
That phat-ass train set?
From pumpin'
This white shit right here
Any fly shit you want
In this world, it costs money
And this is how you get it. Hustling
Don't never forget that shit neither
Yo, Shorty, you're smart, right?
Well, answer me this
Boss buys him a key
For $22,000, right?
Cuts it up to 3,500 $10 bottles
Boss takes 60%, $17,000 profit
Leaving up $7,000
How much for me?
My man, Shorty
Keep hittin' them books, all right?
All right
If I ever catch you playing hooky
I'll put a cap in your ass
My name is M-O
And don't you forget it
Takin' out your boys
And you don't know how I did it
Pickin' off your crew one by one
Don't step in my way
Cos I just might have a gun
May be loaded just might not be
Cos I'm a menace to society
My name not Thiggy-thiggy
But I still get hip
- So back the fuck up and just
- Chill
Cos steppin' on me
You'll be a-writin' your will
I'm like an Energizer
Can't never die
Ba, ba, ba, ba, nice try
Ha, ha, ha
I saw you run in the building
Throwing up my guns
To the ceiling
Ba, ba, ba, here I go again
Ba, ba, ba, cops are comin' in
Run into the back, man
I'm fast up the staircase
I got no time to waste
Nobody seen my face
So I leave without a trace...
Make the drops over on Smith Street
From now on
Yeah, all right
Oh, yeah, crooked-ass Jo-Jo
He said he got
Some weight for you to buy
Forget that motherfucker
Fuckin' faggot
He tapped me up for $500, too
Errol told me you talked
To the homicide cop
- How'd that go?
- It was aight
"Aight" or all right?
It was "aight," all right?
I ever tell you about
The first time I killed somebody?
Nah
Errol Barnes made me do it...
Cos it was three guys burned us
On some bogus dope
Errol's already killed
The other two, right?
We got the third guy
Be cool, man
Chill, motherfucker, chill
Ain't you all sorry
You fucked with us?
I ain't fucked with you
You're lucky we don't blow your ass
Off like them crackers down South
- Look, I hate this shit, man
- What the fuck is my name?
- Errol, man
- You're goddam right
Motherfucker
Crying like a baby
Tears, snot flying, and shit
Errol turned to me
Says, "You got
To cap him, or I'm gonna cap you."
Man, come on, that shit
Ain't necessary, man
I ain't gonna cap that boy
He's scared like a motherfucker
You think I'm playin' with you?
Open your mouth
You gonna take this piece...
And you're gonna put that
Motherfucker's brains out
- You understand me?!
- I got it
Go to it
I said you shouldn't
Have did that shit, man
- Come on, please! Please!
- On three, Rodney
I can't stop my hand from shakin'
- Don't you chump out on me
- I can't stop my hand from shakin'!
- Cap him!
- All right!
Please...
Don't you wish
You'd done us right?
Hey, hey, hey. Don't you
Ever, ever fuck with me, boy
Do you know me now? I'm a bad man
Errol couldn't have me runnin'
Around here knowin' what he did
Without somethin' personal
Hangin' over my head, too
Personal, Strike
Otherwise, I might give him up
Someday, you understand?
Strike, that's the reason why
I needed you to be bloody
On this Darryl thing
You hear me?
Errol Barnes, boy
Motherfucker had a sawed-off
Shotgun right in my mug, Strike
He's my best friend, too
- What's the matter with you?
- Shit!
You gotta take care of yourself
Here. Wipe that off
You OK?
You ain't seen my doctor, have you?
- Huh?
- Nah
Strike, why I got to tell you things
Two and three and four times, huh?
Why you don't want to listen to me?
You OK?
Shit
To be honest, I don't really
Give a fuck because you lied to me
Lied about what? You said Darryl
Had a drug problem, a crackhead
I asked around. The guy was clean
I was just speculatin'
That's some nasty-ass speculatin'
Damn. You're comin'
At me with mad questions
I'm just tryin'
To answer them shits
Then you said you never met 'im
Maybe just by eye, all right?
"Just by eye."
You and him never had any static?
Naw
There's no way Victor could've been
Cuttin' through the parking lot
In the dark, and Darryl would've
Mistaken him for you?
Naw, man
Cos you and your brother
In the dark
Probably look like two peas in a pod
What the fuck you sayin'?
All black people look alike at night?
I can't even tell you guys
Apart in the day
Hey, you got jokes
- You and your brother close?
- Not really
I forgot. Long-lost brothers
When was the last time?
A month
Strike, you told me
Two months before
If you know so much
Why you keep asking?
- You know what Alzheimer's is?
- Some kind of beer?
Wise guy. You visit him yet?
Yeah
He's claimin' self-defence
He goes to trial with that
Those two nice kids of his
By the time he'll be gettin'
Out, they'll be goin' in
Did it ever occur to you
Maybe he didn't even do the shit?
You know who did?
Who did it?
Come on, man, I gotta go. I'm sick
- Here's my card
- Got two already
You better have that checked out
Hey, what the fuck y'all lookin' at?
Oh, shit!
You all right, man?
Strike! Strike! You smokin' crack
Motherfucker, huh?
Get the fuck up!
Get an ambulance, man!
Let's get an ambulance!
Let's get him the hell
Outta here
He'll be all right. He'll be fine
Watch it, guys
One, two, three
Let's go!
Here you go. It's all right, man
- Hit that pipe today?
- Dice that shit. He don't use
Anyone ever tell you not to do drugs?
Where do you live?
I'll give you that
Just get him to hospital
Welcome to Ahab's
May I take your order, please?
Yes
We need a Double Whaler on a bun
With cheese?
Yes, with cheese
A fried shrimp boat
One fried shrimp boat
- Two
- Yeah, two
Two fried shrimp...
Uh, could I please get my
Captain Ahab with a clam roll?
- Captain Ahab, Captain...
- What's up, boys?
Hey, it's a nice car you got
- Yeah, it's my dad's car
- How ya doin'?
Power windows
Air bags, cellular phone
Bet he paid a pretty penny for this
Oh, yeah. We were lookin'
For the Short Hills Mall
- It's not here
- No?
Come down from Connecticut
Just to buy some whiting?
Some golf balls
You buy anything else around here
I should know about?
- Some gum
- No
You like soul food?
Can't say I do
- You like to wear lipstick?
- Todd, why don't we get outta here?
McCauley does
In the back...occasionally
- You like skirts?
- Something we did wrong?
- You ever suck a black man's dick?
- Let's get outta here!
A big, 16-inch tar baby?
- No?
- No
If I toss this car and I find any
Drugs, I got 12 baboons in a cage
Who are gonna be callin'
You boys Mary all night
- Come on, Todd
- Shut up, man!
- Who's got the drugs?
- We don't have anything
- You got five seconds
- Todd's got the drugs!
- Shut up, man!
- Todd's got the drugs
- Fuck you guys, man!
- Put your hands on the car
- Take it easy!
- Fucking cocksucker!
Fucking touch him again, I'll rip
Your throat out. Get your hands up
- What's up?
- You tell me
What you up to, man?
You the one involved
In all the drama out here
How you always know
When I'm comin' out of somewhere?
Don't you know I know everything?
Didn't I tell you
To go see my doctor?
Didn't I tell you to stop
Drinkin' that Moo shit?
Yeah, you did, you did
No doubt, man, no doubt
- How you so smart and so stupid?
- Cut me some slack
I heard that Homicide came back
On you again yesterday
He ain't sayin' I'm in
He's just fishin'
You and him fuck buddies now?
- You got jokes, man
- Come on, get in, get in
- How do you feel?
- I'm all right
You better be, cos we got
Another big order come in
Hey, Rod
If God created anything better
Than crack cocaine
He kept that shit for hisself
I mean, that shit
Is like truth serum
It will truly expose who you are
I mean, you happen to be
A low-life rat bastard motherfucker
Who will sell off his newborn
For a suck off that glass dick
Crack will bring it
Right on in the light
I don't care you black
White, Chinese, rich, poor
You take that first hit
You on a mission
And that mission will never end
Even when the house
The money, loved ones are gone
They send you to the joint
You still gonna try to cop
No doubt
Only time it ends, Strike, that
Mission, when you six feet under
That's the reason I don't ever want
To hear about you using this shit
- You understand me?
- You crazy?
All right, then
Cos it's also the reason why
I ain't never goin' outta business
I'm a great businessman, Strike
And I got me the world's
Greatest product
Now you think about that
Yo, so what up?
I'm gonna see you at the store
- Go ahead
- All right
You believe I used to deal with that
Woman when she looked like somethin'?
Yeah. You didn't know that, did you?
She used to look good, right?
She looked better than she look now
- Finest shit we got today
- Let me see
- Yeah
- 50 dollars
But ain't y'all pregnant
Though, y'all?
- You got to maintain that, man
- We already know that
That's the last
I'm gonna sell to y'all
Y'all got to take care
Of that little girl
Got red caps?
I'm getting tired
Of these nickels, man
Where the dimes at, Lou?
We don't got it like that
Come on, let's do this
You got it?
I got reds and I got yellows
- What you need?
- Two yellow ones
- Want two yellows?
- I want two reds
All right, Veronica. Slow down, girl
Why you in such a hurry?
- Because I wanna get out of here
- Wanna get outta here?
- Let me see this money
- No, I said two
- Let me see the money. Chill
- I want yellow
- You want yellows?
- I want reds
It's the same shit. Both
Of 'em just to crack your ass up
- I want three of 'em
- And I said two
You notice the tablecloths out there
With the African prints?
The nice carpeting and the plants
Hanging from the ceilings?
It's all Victor's ideas
You see, Victor always wanted to make
This place like somebody's home
He treated everybody with respect
The workers, the customers...
Even the clockers
Like, you asked me
About last Friday night
We got three
Cocolo chocho face maricones
Trying to set up shop out there
Right in front of my business
I reach for my...trusty Roberto
Clemente Louisville Slugger here
And I'm ready to bash in a head
I'm ready to bash in an arm
But Victor, Victor, he says...
No, Jesus, no
Let me handle them, please
We set somebody up
In the bathroom there
Put somebody over there
As a lookout in the window
Sorry, but you brothers
Can't clock in here
This is a family place
And I need you to respect that
Here. Take these jumbo sodas
This is a Pepsi
An orange. A root beer
I would appreciate it very much...
If you would leave when
You finish your jumbo sodas
Usually they would just be happy
To get the free jumbo sodas
But on this night, Leroy pulls out
A roll this big and says...
My boss says that he'll pay you $300
A week if you let us set up here
What did he say?
Victor puts please and thank you into
Every sentence. So, it was either...
No. Please, thank you
- Or...
- Please. No, thank you
What? You tryin' to be fuckin'
Burger boy of the month, man?
Wait. Your girlfriend likes you
Smellin' like burgers?
No. My wife...
Oh, your wife, your wife
Got it. I see, OK, look
We're tryin' to do something here
I can respect that
You take your business outside
And I'll handle my business inside
You can't even smile, man. You don't
Like this job. Feel that money
- It's power
- I need you to respect that
I'm gonna miss you, man
So, I have to check the floor
I got a business to run
- So, Hay-sus...
- I pronounce it "Jesus"
I feel more comfortable
Calling you "Hay-sus"
My mother called me Jesus, my father
Called me Jesus. You call me Jesus
All right, Jesus. So is that why
Victor left early Friday?
He said he wasn't feeling well
- Fuck. I gotta make a call
- There's a phone out in front
Wasn't feeling well?
Would you feel well after working
It'll make you sick. Try it. Give me
Your badge, I'll give you my apron
How much cheese
You make yesterday, yo?
I made like a motherfuckin' yard
I did all right
- Yo, Strike!
- Here comes Shorty
- Take this
- Shorty, what I told you?
It's yours
I told you!
- Here comes your moms
- Oh, shit
- It's yours
- You crazy?
- What did I say? Huh? You hear me?
- What are you doin'?
You hear me? I told you!
You leave my son alone!
Don't you ever put your motherfuckin'
Hands in my face
I will put my hands
Wherever I want to!
You stop buying him shit
I ain't buyin' him shit
- Fuck!
- Go home. Go!
The Nikes
The Sega game, the haircut!
You thought you were slick, right?
I saw him riding the bike
You wouldn't let him bring that home
You best stay the fuck
Out of my face
I am not scared of you
Maybe you're scared of Andre
You get Andre. I don't give a fuck
You are sellin'
Your own people death
All of y'all. I'm not gonna let you
Take him with you
You hear me?
I can't let you do that
I can't let you do that
Can't! You understand?
I'm gonna go get Andre
She took a pop at him, the ho
Yeah, here come your friend, man
Now you're beatin' up
On defenceless women?
- What gives?
- Come on, man. She attacked me
Can I talk to you a minute?
Have a seat
Don't look so depressed
Worse things could happen
Hey, Ronnie, have I treated you
Like a hard-on out here?
What?
Have I not treated you
Like a man out here?
Talked to you
With respect, courtesy, huh?
What you talkin' about?
Why you tryin' to make
A fuckin' fool outta me?
- What you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about?
You told me you
Didn't know Darryl Adams
I'm running around like
A horse's ass on that
Not only did I find out
That you know him
But you worked a year with him
At Rodney's store
Why the fuck didn't you tell me?
I thought you meant
This other Darryl
What other Darryl?
If you knew some other Darryl
You should have said
"Yeah, I know him," right?
- I don't get it
- I only know one Darryl
You said you didn't see
Your brother in two months
- Oh, God
- You got all kind...
What? Ronnie, don't "Oh, God" me
You got all kinds of pissed off
At me just like you are now
- cos I forgot you said that, right?
- Yeah
Well, guess what?
I go into the Kool Breeze
The bar your brother was in
Just before the shootin'
The bartender ID'd you
In there that night
He even remembered the drink
He made for you
Pina colada, straight out of a can
Does this ring a bell?
Why did you lie to me?
- Cos man, it's my brother
- What's your brother?
Your brother made you lie?
Tryin' to look out for him
Explain to me how lyin' helps him
He's locked up
What you sayin'?
You tryin' to pin this on me?
I didn't say that. You said that
I asked you why you throwin' me
A line of shit. Why did you say that?
Oh, man
See, you fuckin' with my words
You confusin' me
Twistin' my shits around
Me? Oh, who's twistin' who
Here, Ronnie?
All's I'm askin' is why did you
Try to play me like a jerk?
- Please, stop fuckin' with me
- What's in it for you?
What the fuck is this?
We already spoke about this shit
Hey, Ronnie! I just want to know
What you know
Am I under arrest?
Fuck, no! If I arrest you
I can't talk to you
Then the conversation's over
Fine. You don't have to do shit
But if you wanna continue
To do business here
Without Jo-Jo and his crew puttin'
Their hands in your pockets
I would think about
Takin' a ride right now
What the fuck I look like?
I ain't goin' nowhere
With your homo-cide ass
Look
Shit
Are you comin' or what?
How you doin'?
Man, you crazy, man?
I ain't goin' up in there
No?
Yo, Rocco. Yeah, yeah, come on, come
On, man. I ain't got nothin' to say
I was prayin'
You could help me out here
Because to tell you the truth
I've come completely around
To your way of thinking
- What's my way of thinkin'?
- I know your brother is innocent
If Victor was my brother
And I knew what you know
Every day of my life
Would be a living hell
You think we can do something
About this?
- About what?
- All bullshit aside
You, me, Victor, we all know
Who did Darryl Adams
Who?
Who do you think?
I don't know. You tell me
You!
- Me?
- You little fuck. You did it
I know it, you know it!
- Your brother knows it
- Shit
What's the thinkin' on this
That if Victor claims self-defence
He'll get off
Because he has no record?
His life is over!
I know it's rough out here
For young, black males
With racism, no jobs
Single parent families...
- Fuck that
- Don't fuckin' gesture at me
Have some fuckin' respect
But you're the fuckin' king snake!
You're a low-down, cold-blooded
Evil junkyard nigga...
- ..like I've never seen in my life
- What you talkin' about?
What'd you do, offer him money?
Who the fuck are you kiddin'?
You're not the Mafia
You're not even Rodney Little! You're
A skinny-ass snake motherfucker
You think you're hot shit. You ain't
Nothing but a cold, fucking fart
You don't know a motherfuckin' thing
About me
You just a racist-ass
Nigga-hating cop
You don't know how it is
For brothers
And you motherfuckin' definitely...
- Don't point...
- ..nothin' about what's goin' on
Don't you fuckin' point
Your finger at me
What's goin' on? What don't I see?
I ain't tellin' you shit
Till I see my lawyer
Listen. I talked to...
Look at me
I got something nice to say
I talked to all your brother's
People. He's one of the decent ones
Probably in his deluded decency
He thinks he's doing a noble thing
But you and Victor playin' me
For a patsy? Usin' me?
Back up with that shit
I read you like a Marvel fuckin'
Spiderman comic book!
I been inside your bald pea brain
Since you were born
You don't play me, I play you!
Fuck!
Rocco, you can't do this
In front of our house
Understand? It's no good
Strike
Strike!
You want to make yourself crazy
Goin' after someone else on this?
There's your man, right over there
Hold on
Man, get your little ass in the car
Fuck Rodney. Yo thinks
He's gonna okey-doke me
He's goin' down, Larry
Down for the fuckin' count
Take it easy
- How ya doin'?
- Fuck you, too, Rodney
- Come on. Hey! Take it easy
- I'm gonna cripple that cocksucker
I swear on my mother's grave
I'm gonna cripple him
You were supposed to be
At my spot an hour ago
What am I supposed to do?
Tell Homicide I can't talk now?
I gotta go bag up some ounces
For my boss, Rodney Little?
- He arrest you?
- Nah
Why didn't you tell him
To go fuck hisself?
Well, what did he want?
Nothin' much
You know, same old, same old
- He ask about me?
- Nah
- Huh?
- Nah. Damn
Cos I never said nothin' to you
About shootin' nobody
All's I said, you want Darryl's spot
You got to get it for yourself
- Shit, I didn't even say that
- Fuck you, Rodney
Excuse me. Who the fuck are you
Talkin' to like that?
You outta your motherfuckin'
Mind, hmm?
You think I'm one of them little crew
Niggers sittin' on a project bench?
Open your mouth, nigga
You feel that?
I put this gun in your bad breath
Smellin' mouth
I will pull the trigger
I'll splatter
What little brains you got
All over the Corinthian
Leather interior of my car
This is my wife's brand-new car
So you know I don't give a fuck
- You understand?
- Yeah
- Do you understand me, bitch?
- Yeah!
Let me tell you somethin' else
If I ever hear about you talkin' to
That Homicide one more time
That Rocco, I don't care
If he asks you the time of day
If I hear about my name comin' up
I'm gonna know it was you
And I'm gonna kill ya
I mean, you are 1-87
On the street, understand?
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah
Word is bond
Now get your motherfuckin'
Ass outta my car
Who bought you this shit?
Strike bought you that shit?
Where your mama at?
She know you out here?
When I was a little boy
My daddy would have kicked my butt
All over this street
- I don't have a father, all right?
- You got one now
When Errol is talkin' to you
You listen
- You're not my daddy
- I'm your daddy now
You get your butt...
You little motherfuckers
Get outta here!
Hey, look here
Now I got to deal with this
Look at this
Shit
What the fuck is he doin'?
I'm a bad man
Errol!
Get your hand off me
- What are you doin', man?
- Get the fuck outta here
Errol, come here
Step off
Hey, Shorty
Now, fun and games is over
I warned your ass
About Errol, didn't I?
- Huh? Didn't I?
- What's goin' on here?
I don't want to see your ass
Hangin' around me no more
- What'd I do?

I don't want to see
Your ass no more!

Get the fuck up them steps
Hurry up, man!

In Daddy's Benz to cop
So fuckin' what?

Motherfucking shinehead Rodney

You got Rodney set up?
Got that fuckin' yo
Set up just like the movie
Let me do a favour for ya
Me and Mazilli know the prick
Let us pick him up
You'd owe me two favours
You ain't gonna let me forget
I ain't worried
No, I won't
I wash my face in dirty water
Cos it gives my mind a little order
And I play that game
Just like I should do
But my whole world slips away
I live my life, I live it slowly
And I take my time, I'm in no hurry
Yeah, I'm livin'
And when I go
Then I would surely...
Hey, Mr Mazilli
Klein. What you need, man?
- I need you, brother
- Oh, yeah?

You want to arrest me?

Excuse me

How long we been
Doin' business, huh?
All of a sudden
It don't count for nothin'?
All I know is, somebody says

He's not gonna break balls
If you go in. So?

I always wanted to ask you
You Italian, you a Jew? What are you?
You can't make up your mind?

Skyler, go find Errol
Tell him to come down
And mind the store for me

Stop sweatin' me. You a kid
This is grown-up stuff
You gonna get hurt out here
Now, take your little bag
Of candy, take your little bike
And go find some friends, all right?
Damn! Fuckin' kids, man
Oh, shit!
Boogie-Down was performing
Down with the sounds called VDP
Boogie-Down was performing
It ain't no joke
Back in the days
I knew rap would never die
I used to listen
To Awesome-2 on WHBI
I used to hear all kind
Of rap groups
Before samplin' loops
Rappers wore bell-bottom Lee suits
Me and Kenny couldn't afford that
So we would go to the park
While they was jammin' to hear rap
I used to listen till
The cops broke it up
Always thought to myself
"Damn, why they fucked it up"
But nevertheless
I was in love with the microphone
And it stayed that way
Until I left home
On the streets of New York
Now I'm free
But with freedom
Comes big responsibility
I used to walk around
Driven by the force
I remember how large Super
Rhymes was when he fell off
I used to wonder about crews
That used to rock
They were large but none of them
Could manage to stay on top
Do you ever think about
When you outta here
Record deal and video outta here
Mercedes-Benz
And Range Rover outta here
No doubt BDP is old school
But we ain't goin' out...
What you want, little shou...
Yo, Ty! Ty!
You little motherfucker!
Some years went by, I signed myself
Into a group home...
What the fuck is wrong with you, huh?
You buggin'?
Shit
I don't know what happened
I've known this kid his whole life
His mother, too. Good, decent people
Now, whatever happened out there
It was a big mistake
I mean... I mean, Tyrone's never been
In trouble before. He's like...
He's like, uh, 85th percentile
On the national education test
I mean, uh...
Now this thing could ruin his life
Please
Just help him with his moms
And his statement
You know what I'm askin'
Does my son have to go to jail?
Would you permit me to talk to him?
If you talk to him, does he still
Have to go to jail?
Tyrone, you know
What you did, don't you?
- Yeah
- You know it was wrong?
- He knows
- OK. We got that outta the way
You did wrong
But you were scared, right?
You couldn't help it
My son was terrified
Tyrone, you're a good kid, but it's
Tough growin' up in the projects
Drugs, crime, peer pressure. You know
What that means, peer pressure?
- Yes
- I hear you're real intelligent
Don't your friends make fun of you
When you get straight As
Speak correct English
Attend school
Go to classes, don't hang out?
Don't they call you white boy?
Don't they call you soft because
You ain't hanging with them hard?
I know they do, but all you
Want to do is the right thing
But they keep threatening you
Threatening your mother
Tyrone
So you get a gat
So you, too, can be hard-core
Protect yourself and your mother
- Do you know the man you shot?
- Yeah
That was Errol Barnes
A stone killer
He did time
For killin' a kid your age
Here you are, riding your bike
Minding your own business
You have a gun for protection
All of a sudden
There's Errol, that kid killer
Standing right in front of you
He's got this horrible look
In his beady eyes
You see him reaching...
Tyrone, look at me
Look at me, Tyrone
You see him reaching for that .38
Stuck in his waist
You know he's gonna gat you
Then who's gonna protect your mother?
You never fired that gun before, but
Errol was about to pull that trigger
You're scared
All you wanna do is ride your bike
It's either him or you
But this killer in front of you
There's no time to think
His finger is on the trigger
Boom, boom. The gun just appeared
In your hand
That's what happened
That's what exactly happened
And when I ask you what happened
With the tape recorder on
That's exactly what
You're going to tell me, right?
Because you always tell the truth
Now, one last thing
We need to know - again, tell
The truth - where'd you get the gat?
- I found it
- Where'd you find it?
- In the bushes
- Where in the bushes?
I'm not turning it on yet
Where in the bushes?
- What bushes?
- The bushes near my building
Tyrone, you gotta help me out here
And your mama
The truth
OK. I borrowed it by accident
From who? Remember
You always tell the truth
I borrowed it by accident
From Strike
Strike?
Motherfucker!
All right, son. All right
You did the right thing
I was tryin' to give it back to him
But he doesn't speak to me any more
I keep trying...
But he keeps iggin' me
All right, son
I'm gonna put the recorder on now
You state your name
And you tell the story, relax
Just the way you told it to me
- Your name?
- Tyrone Jeeter
Oh, shit
Fuck that nigga up, man!
What the fuck you doing?
You ruined that boy's life
You fuckin' parasite!
I had nothin'
To do with that shit!
I'm tired of excuses!
Tired of excuses
- Mommy!
- You know nothin'!
"It's not my fault."
I'm not hearin' that shit!
It's motherfuckers like you
Mugged Rosa Parks
- Who the fuck is Rosa Parks?
- Who the fuck is Rosa Parks?!
- It's hard on the brothers
- You stupid, ignorant motherfucker!
Brothers?! Brothers! Is this the way
You take care of your brothers, huh?
Real brothers take responsibility
I'm gonna make damn sure you do
I won't be fuckin' around
I'm done with that
Done with it? Done with that?
You bet you are
You are done from these streets
You're gone from this project
And you're gone from New York
You hear me?
Oh, shit!
Come on, you son of a bitch!
Yo, why don't you stomp
That nigga too, man?
- Come on, man
- Get back! Get back!
- Gonna shoot everybody?
- Get the fuck back!
Come on! You want somethin'?
You got it, man! You got it! What?
Get up
Get up, get up, get up!
If I ever see you again
I'm going to kill you!
I'm gonna shoot you in your dome
Put a gun in your hand
And say you tried to raise up on me
For this beat down you just got
Do you understand? Do you understand?
Shit!
He wants to fly
But his wings won't let him go
He wants to travel
But don't wanna go so low
Oh-oh, Daddy, when I grow up
I want to be a silent hero...
Ah, look who's here!
I was just comin' to get you
Rodney or Andre?
Rodney! Take a number, you're next!
What'd you think
You was gonna do? Become president?
Yo, man! Why did Tyrone
Do that stupid shit for?
The boy did it for you
He was protecting you
Rodney ain't no fool
He sent Errol after you
And this poor fuckin' kid
Stepped into the breach
David and Goliath
Now he's a 12-year-old murderer
Way to go, Strike
Yo, don't lay that on me, all right?
Don't lay that on you?
- I had nothin' to do with Tyrone
- You had nothin' to do with it?
Can you look yourself
In the fuckin' mirror and tell me
You had nothin' to do with Tyrone?
Why the fuck you have to come
Shake my hand anyway?
Didn't I tell you not to play me?
Did I not tell you that?
I don't give a fuck what you said!
You can't put this weight on me!
Nah, why should you carry
The fuckin' weight?
You must be a wonderful
Fuckin' guy
Everybody tryin' to protect you
- Tyrone, Victor
You know what? They all went down
Protecting you from the same guy
And he's still out there
I'm the only one
That can protect you now
That's right. Me. Me
So you tell me how Rodney
Pressured you into cappin'...
Oh, man!
..Darryl Adams
And we'll drop him down a hole
Don't tell me Rodney
Pulled the trigger if he didn't
All's you gotta do now
Is tell me the truth
Did you shoot Darryl Adams?
No, man, no. Damn
- Who did?
- Scientific
- Who the fuck is Scientific?
- He's with my crew
- Did you see him kill Darryl Adams?
- No
- Did he tell you he killed Darryl?
- No!
- Did he tell anybody?
- I don't know! Why you sweatin' me?
It was Errol Barnes!
Get up!
Get up, you fuckin' lyin' cocksucker!
You crazy?
I'm gonna hand-feed you
To fuckin' Rodney myself!
I swear to God!
It was a nigga named My Man
My brother said My Man would do it
- My Man?
- I didn't have the heart to do him!
- I didn't have the heart to do 'im!
- Victor said My Man would do it
We was in Kool Breeze and shit
A-a-and Victor
He just told me
He was like, he said, "My Man"
Maybe Victor was so drunk
He did tell My Man to do it
Bullshit, bullshit!
Let's go see Rodney
Rocco
If you don't get your hand
Off my son, you better...
- Victor called me from the bar
- You ain't gotta tell him nothin'
Victor called me from the bar
Mom? I think I'm gonna
Do somethin' bad
Ma, I can feel it
Look, I'm just tired, that's all
I'm just sick and tired
And somebody's gotta pay
Somebody's gotta pay
He came back into the house
An hour later
Victor! Baby, what's wrong?
Oh, Mama, I shot somebody!
I shot somebody
He was throwin' up all night
I didn't even know that other boy
Was lyin' dead in the parking lot
The next morning...he says
That he can't get out of bed -
His legs are cramped, he can't walk
Mama, let me tell you
It was just like a dream
Like somebody else was pullin'
The trigger, you know?
And that's what happened
Mommy, I swear, I'm gonna help Victor
What is going to happen to my son?
Did you get the money from Sharon?
- Huh? For the bail?
- She wouldn't take it
My son Victor...
Said it was self-defence
Believe him!
Shit!
Shit
"Bitch...you is dead."
Motherfucker stole my bags, too
Yo, Strike. Your boy Rodney
Took a piss in your car
So, where do you want to live, Ronnie?
I don't know, man. You tell me
We's goin' to the Port Authority
Bus Terminal
Please, Rocco, man
Take me to Penn Station
Same difference
Self-defence. Self-defence
Victor is pleading self-defence
So, what's up with Tyrone?
Does he get bail?
No bail on juveniles
His mother has him until the trial
So, how much time is he gonna get?
Maybe a half-year
In a youth house, if he's lucky
Yo, Rocco, before I get out, man
Just answer me this one question
Why was you so gung-ho
About all this shit, man?
Most cops...
Brothers killin' other brothers
Ain't no big thing. Blas, blas
What made you care about me, my
Brother Victor, Darryl Adams, Tyrone?
Huh? What made you give a shit?
If I ever see you again
I'll book you on charges
Of criminal solicitation
And conspiracy to commit murder
I'll let Andre beat you down again
Then pick up Rodney
On the same charges
And I'll make sure you two
Share the same cell
The same fuckin' bed
Do you understand me clearly?
Yeah, I understand you clearly
I just wanted to say thanks, for
Gettin' me outta town, that's all
It ain't mine, man
I stopped doin' that
Get the fuck outta the car

Thank you very much, sir
Have a pleasant and good day
Final Call newspaper! Get your latest
Edition of your Final Call newspaper!
How about you, sir?
"I'll kill you."
I guess somebody read his shirt
The wrong way, huh?
Whoo!
Right through his fuckin' mouth
Another stain on the sidewalk
- Hal! Lunch
- Another dead motherfucker
DMF. All right
Well, Hal, let's go to work
- Take it away, Lieutenant
- OK. Catch you next time
Hey, guys
They should blow these projects
To Timbuktu
Why bother? They kill themselves
Anyway, like a self-cleaning oven
No fuss, no mess
That's how the Nubians do it
Cycle of shit
- Take it easy, guys
- Take it easy
What the fuck happened?
One snap, that kid
Scientific got shot up
What's a Scientific?
That could be you next
Mr Scientific
Nothin' you ain't seen
Before, eh, fellas?
Did you see anything over there?
Back in the early 1900s
When trains ran on batteries
When people had no electricity
In their houses...
After World War II, right?
- Tyrone
- Huh?
- You know I love you, don't you?
- Yeah
- After World War II, right?
- Yeah
When people started getting
Electricity in their houses
They made these - the new ones
Wanna hear a whistle?
Here is my hand
For you to hold
Here's a part of me
They have not sold
I've wandered far
I've had my fill
I need you now
Do you love me still
Only you have seen
The hidden part of me
Call me foolhardy
If you will
I loved you when
Do you love me still
So many smiles
And lies surround me
Empty expectations
Faceless fears
Sometimes this life
Is a bitter pill
I love you now
Do you love me still
You have been mine
Since time untold
Our love is immortal
Don't you know
Others will come
And they will go
But I loved you young
And I'll love you old
Only you have seen
The other side of me
Call me naive, I think you will
But I loved you then
Do you love me still
Here are the eyes
That only see you
Here's a mouth
That only calls your name
Here is a song
They cannot kill
I love you now
Do you love me still
