Don't lose the magic
Don't lose the magic
First time I laid my eyes on you
You were like a star in the night
Heaven must have sent your love
You were shining so bright
I was blinded by the passion
Want to feel your love tonight
I wanna go wherever you go
And I know love will follow
Oh, there's this magic in you
The way that you touch
Everything you do
My hearts keeps on telling me
This night will be full of ectasy
Don't lose the magic
Let's keep this all to ourselves
Don't lose the magic
Don't want to give to no one else
Oh, there's such magic in you
The way that you touch
Everything you do
My hearts keeps on telling me
This night will be full of ecstasy
Don't lose the magic
Let's keep this all to ourselves
 don't lose the magic
Don't want to give to no one else
Don't lose the magic
All of my love is for you
Don't lose the magic
All of my love comes shining through
Don't lose the magic
Don't lose the magic
Don't want to give to no one else
Don't lose the magic
Don't lose the magic
Don't lose the magic
Don't lose the magic
Oh, there's such magic in you
The way that you touch
Everything you do
My hearts keeps on telling me
This night will be full of ecstasy
Don't lose the magic
Let's keep this all to ourselves
Don't lose the magic
Don't want to give to no one else
Don't lose the magic
All of my love is for you
Don't lose the magic
All of my love comes shining through
