Southside on the track, yeah
Yeah
Cut the bullshit, I'm not with it
Call your main bitch, she let me hit it
Haha, ha
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
Diamonds got dripped in a lake 
I don’t be goin' on dates 
She got an ass, but it's fake 
He savin' hoes, need a cape 
Lil' mama's head supreme 
But I'm still rockin' this Bape 
All I know is two guns, nigga
If you a plate, you get ate 
Had to put a bitch on pause 
Me and my dawgs break laws 
21 gang 'til I fall 
You could get hit in the jaw 
The chopper can hit all of y'all 
Your brother, your goldfish and dog 
Most of my niggas just rob 
They cut off and hand you your balls 
Hit your BFF, I’m petty 
Can’t leave the streets, I ain't ready 
Me and my hood got married 
And my wedding ring was a machete 
Need me a Keisha like Belly 
Dissin’ me, got a nigga's homeboys buried 
They don't come outside, they scary 
When we start spinnin' niggas’ blocks, they telling 
Got your baby mama in a yolk 
I don't smoke weed, I sell dope 
Ain't no back and forth, it's smoke 
Pull up on you and your folks 
Try to give me head, she choke 
We call you a rat 'cause you spoke 
All these tennis chains like I'm in a tennis game
Y'all niggas wearin' gold ropes 
Killers out the 6 
Got 'em all hired 
Ex-girlfriends 
Got 'em all fired 
Don't you cross the gang, dawg
We're like barbed wire 
Stackin' up these M's
I'm a habitual car buyer 
Actin' Hollywood, I kicked her out on Wilshire 
Got a model and she tighter than a grill plier 
Sneak and steal my flow, lot of these rappers slick biters 
I'm 4L gang for L, dawg, and we got big rifles 
Let me pop my shit 
Keep a big Glock on my hip 
One up top, my shit 
I don't like to cock my shit 
Y'all niggas gossip and shit 
No more beef, we drop that shit 
Y'all niggas talk that shit 
Never had a payment, I bought that shit 
VS1 on my wrist 
Can't put my tongue on no bitch 
'Cause I still kiss my kids 
Ho, you need to fix your wig 
All my brothers did a bid 
When they came home, we was rich 
Fuck 40 acres and a mule
They got 50 racks and a brand new Sig 
Lil' boy, get up out the way 
Lil' boy, we didn't come to play 
And I got a partner named Dre 
You can get beats by Dre 
You can get hit by K 
K hit you, that's your last day 
Glock 27, that's bae 
Stick the 30 in it, had a baby 
My strippers got S-Class 'Cedes 
Ride me slow like you drivin' Miss Daisy
I ain't go to school 'cause I was too lazy
Had to cut her off 'cause she was too crazy
Moncler jacket, a letterman 
I gotta keep a Beretta, man 
She screamin' and scratchin' and yellin', man 
I got her in a falsetto, man 
Had to put a bitch on pause 
Me and my dawgs break laws 
21 gang 'til I fall 
Me and my dawgs break laws 
21 gang 'til I fall 
Me and my dawgs break laws 
You could get hit in the jaw 
The chopper can hit all of y'all 
Your brother, your goldfish and dog 
Most of my niggas just rob 
They cut off and hand you your balls
