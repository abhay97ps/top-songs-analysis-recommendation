I confess to have a willingness
And wanting for you
To have you here by me, here by me
And all my life through
You run around
You run around
Run around baby
Run around baby
Someday maybe we'll have a love
One day you say that
Someday you may
Be my girl
Hand in hand we walk
Though the land we walk
Around the world
But right now
But right now
You run around
You run around
Run around baby
Run around baby
Someday maybe we'll have a love
You'll be with me
'Til eternity and be mine
Sent from above, will
Be my love 'til the end of time
But right now
But right now
You run around
You run around
Run around baby
Run around baby
Someday maybe
We'll have a love
I confess to have a willingness
And wanting for you
To have you here by me, here by me
And all my life through
