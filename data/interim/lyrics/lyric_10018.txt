LA - here's to you
For being the kind of place a man can do his due
Out here the hippies skip, and they get their kicks
Bumpin' all night long, out on Sunset Strip
To the music of the brother man, who's got himself a plan
And makes him gain a boogie, man
Down at the Disco... 9000
You better get down early, it's gonna be crowdy
Down at the Disco... 9000
People from coast to coast are talking about it, about it
Oh there's another man, he's got a boogie man
And he wants to be the king, of all the land
But his game is weak, and the brother plays for keeps
Cause you can't aim step to the boogie beat
And the way you play the game, let's get funky or spicy man
And the only king of disco men
It ain't nothing but a party
A place where you can get down
With some bad chicks, and some dynasty
Sixteen stories off the ground
Down at the Disco... 9000
Down at the Disco... 9000
Down at the Disco... 9000
Down at the Disco... 9000
It ain't nothing but a party
A place where you can get down
They got some bad chicks, and some dynasty
Sixteen stories off the ground
Down at the Disco... 9000 
Down at the Disco  9000 
Down at the Disco  9000 
I tell you where I'm going 
Down at the Disco  9000 
I tell you where I'm going 
Got a lot of sun  9000 
Down at the Disco 
Now I walk to the disco  9000
