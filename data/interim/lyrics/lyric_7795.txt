Please hold, hold me so tight
All through, all through the night...
I've waited, waited so long
For your kisses and your love
Please come, come to me
From up, from up above
I need, need you so much
Wanna feel your wa-arm touch
Mm dooby do, dahm dahm, dahm do dahm ooby do
Dahm dahm, dahm do dahm, ooby do
Dahm dahm, dahm do dahm, ooby do
Dahm dahm, dahm ooh dahm
