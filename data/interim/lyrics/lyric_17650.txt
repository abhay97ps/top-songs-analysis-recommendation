I lay beside you in the warmth of the night
I can fell you breathe, I can hear you sigh, so softly
Tell me now baby, this feeling won't change
That it's a lasting love, not a passing phase, darling
I need to know I can depend on you
I need someone who's gonna see me through
Chorus:
There when I need you
Tell me you care
Make me believe you
Promise you will stay by my side
Through the good times, through the bad times
If you just swear, that you'll be there
Bring me your kisses, for the rest of my life
Baby fill my days , and light my nights, with your love
I'll always be, will be there for you
So won't you tell me now
That you'll be there too, darling
And every morning when the sun will rise
I wanna see love shining in your eyes
Tell me you'll still be mine
There when I need you
Tell me you care
Make me believe you
Promise you will stay by my side
Through the good times, through the bad times
If you just swear, that you'll be there
Be there, be there, of your love I can be sure of
I have all I need baby
As long as I have your love
I wanna be the one you reach for each night girl
So every night till the end of time
Baby be there
There when I need you
Tell me you care
Make me believe you
Promise you will stay by my side
Through the good times, through the bad times
If you just swear, that you'll be there
Just swear
There when I need you
Tell me you care
Make me believe you
