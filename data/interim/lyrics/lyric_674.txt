Culture Power45 ft. Fatnice - “THIS ”
This is it.  Yeah.  Get up on this right here.  And it goes a little something like 
This
The dopest promotion you heard from my lips.  This
The type of righteousness got you moving your hips
Hey, Ms. DJ, don’t delay this
Cue it up and add this to the mix.  This
Right here I came to share, and tear
Prayers from the layers of the atmosphere.  This is
Breathable air from a pharaoh’s heir.  This
Here relax your hair like a barber’s chair.  This
Is it, the shit like an IMAX flick.  You know
The name, so it’s time to get down with this.  Written
On the hilltop in the 2-1-5th, but you could
Play this sound Orange Mound or Old Cliff.  This
The rhythm—let it hit ‘em.  The slugs gonna get ‘em.  This’ll
Have you digging planets like pendulum.  This is
Second to none.  I’m still number one.  I got
Knowledge of self.  I’m ‘bout to give y’all some of this

This is
No surprise, no disguise.  This’ll
Open up your eyes like the sunrise, sure
To pop, sureshot sure to shock like
Digging for the prize in the cereal box.  This
The weather that’ll set ya on a beach in the Bahamas, reading
Texts from my momma and Elijah Muhammad.  See?
This is a promise.  With the mic, I’ll pay homage to all the
Prominence that rock through space like a comet.  This is
My belief—through my release—that I can
Manifest life with the words I speak, so with this
Thought in mind, these lyrics are mine.  Before you
Get ‘em, they done ran through the Apache Line.  This
Is for you and yours.  I implore
That this is what you’re missing, so explore the door.  I
Insist, I enlist, I permit your hypo-
-thalamus to just listen to this
