I ain't no hater or nothin'
But he can't love you like I can, trust me
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
As the clock strikes twelve
I'm sitting here wonderin' how the hell did I let you leave
And, baby, I know that I did my share of things to deceive you
I'm just tryna get an understanding of what to do
'Cause I'm halfway going crazy, girl, they can't fade me 
He can't love you like I love you
Baby, you know it too
And you should never wanna be with a man if he can't be a man
And do the things to you like I can 
I'm telling you, he can't love you like I love you
Baby, you know it too 
And you should never wanna be with a man if he can't be a man
And do the things to you like I can 
As I stop, and I wait, and I think
That I never met someone who make me feel like I'm ready to love
So I gotta do what I gotta do just to keep you
Keep you here with me, baby
Now I feel it's time for me to say
That I need you, boo
And I can't go a day without your lovin'
Baby, I can't live without you
I know that you know 
No matter where you want it, baby
Ain't no ifs, whats or buts or maybes
And I know that one day you'll see, hey
He can't really love you like I love you 
He can't love you like I love you
Baby, you know it too
And you should never wanna be with a man if he can't be a man 
And do the things to you like I can 
I'm telling you, he can't love you like I love you 
Baby, you know it too 
And you should never wanna be with a man if he can't be a man 
And do the things to you like I can 
He can't
He can't love you, girl
He's never gonna love you, girl
Like I love you, girl 
He can't 
He can't love you, girl
He's never gonna love you, girl 
Like I love you, girl 
He can't
He can't love you, girl
He's never gonna love you, girl 
Like I love you, girl
He can't 
He can't love you, girl
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
He can't love you like I love you 
Baby, you know it too 
And you should never wanna be with a man if he can't be a man 
And do the things to you like I can 
I'm telling you, he can't love you like I love you 
Baby, you know it too 
And you should never wanna be with a man if he can't be a man 
And do the things to you like I can 
He can't love you
He can't love you like I love you
Baby, you know it too 
And you should never wanna be with a man if he can't be a man
