I wake up to a cold sweat to a clock that says it's only 3AM
Thinking that I felt you, when I really only dreamed of you again
I'm clingin' to your pillow, like a dreamin' man would hold on, when I feel the flood of memories rushin' in
And I flashback...Aww back to the time you were mine and we lived in a love song
And I flashback...Aww chasin' the sun we would run with a dream we could grow on
Everything that we touched...turned to love
My cigarette has burned down, to my fingers, and it brings me back to now
And I'm searchin' through the ashes, for the answers to the where, the why and how
Did I ask for too much lovin', or did you need too much freedom? Did we both want more than heaven would allow?
And I flashback...Aww back to the time you were mine and we lived in a love song
Oh I flashback...Aww chasin' the sun we would run with a dream we could grow on
Mmmmmm...
Summer day...runnin' in the rain
Winter night...thinnin' in my brain
Flashback...Aww back to the time you were mine and we lived in a love song
Oh I flashback...Aww chasin' the sun we would run with a dream we could grow on
Everything that we touched...turned to love
Flashback...Summer day...runnin' in the rain
Flashback...Winter night...thinnin' in my brain
Flashback...Summer day, winter night...
Flashback...Summer day, winter night...
Flashback...Summer day, winter night...
Flashback...Summer day, winter night...
