Every night when I'm all alone
All I do is call you on the phone
It rings, ting a ling
And this is what we do
Oh, well, we're kissing on the phone
Ooh, ooh, kissing on the phone
Ooh, ooh, when we're all alone
All were doing is
Kissing on the phone
Every kiss is a kiss of fire
I'm so afraid that
We're burning the wire
Oh, gee, baby, what you do to me
When we're kissing on the phone
Ooh, ooh, kissing on the phone
Ooh, ooh, when we're all alone
All were doing is
Kissing on the phone
Oh, well, we're kissing on the phone
Ooh, ooh, kissing on the phone
Ooh, ooh, when we're all alone
All were doing, we're
Kissing on the phone
When we are kissing on the phone
Ooh, ooh, kissing on the phone
Ooh, ooh, when we're all alone
All we're doing is
Kissing on the phone
When were all alone
When were all alone
