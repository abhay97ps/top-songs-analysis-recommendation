Since you've gone
The moon, the sun, the stars in the sky
Know the reason why I cry
Love divine once was mine
Now youve gone
Since you've gone
My heart, my lips, my tear-dimmed eyes
A lonely soul within me cries
I acted smart, broke your heart
Now you've gone
Oh, what I'd give for the lifetime I've wasted
The love that I've tasted
I was wrong now youve gone
Oh, what I'd give for the lifetime I've wasted
The love that I've tasted
I was wrong now you've gone
