We connect
When we're together it's so perfect
Boy, you shock me
With your white hot love
I start to overload
I explode when we connect
We connect
When we're together it's so perfect
Boy, you shock me
With your white hot love
I start to overload
I explode when we connect
It's no exaggeration, not imagination
You're the finest boy around
Playing with temptation, overnight sensation
With a boy from the wrong side of town
Give me your love and affection
Dance with me tonight
Give me all of your attention
Dancing in love's light
We connect
When we're together it's so perfect
Boy, you shock me
With your white hot love
I start to overload
I explode when we connect

Dance with me tonight
Give me all of your attention
Dancing in love's light
