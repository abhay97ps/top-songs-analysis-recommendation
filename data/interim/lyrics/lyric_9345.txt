This is it
This time i know its for real
And i can't explain what im feeling
Im lost for words
Im in a daze
Stunned and amazed
By your lovin'ways
This is it
This time i know its for real
And i can't explain what im feeling
Im lost for words
Im in a daze
Stunned and amazed
By your lovin'ways
You smile at me
And suddenly
The wheels of love begin to turn inside of me
You said hello
I felt a glow
Right then and there i knew id never let you go
Cause i know, i know.....
This is it
This time i know its for real
And i can't explain what im feeling
Im lost for words
Im in a daze
Stunned and amazed
By your lovin'ways
The touch of you
Is something new
Nobody ever made me feel the way you do
It's heavenly
It's ecstasy
The way you make me feel when you make love to me
Can't you see, can't you see....
This is it
This time i know its for real
And i can't explain what im feeling
Im lost for words
Im in a daze
Stunned and amazed
By your lovin'ways
This is it
This time i know its for real
And i can't explain what im feeling
A touch of you
Is something new
Nobody ever made me feel the way you do
It's heavenly
It's ecstasy
The way you make me feel when you make love to me
Can't you see, can't you see....
This is it
This time i know its for real
And i can't explain what im feeling
Im lost for words
Im in a daze
Stunned and amazed
By your lovin'ways
This is it
This time i know its for real
And i can't explain what im feeling
Im lost for words
Im in a daze
Stunned and amazed
By your lovin'ways
