They say, before we met
How perfect we would be
There's no question, there's no answer
My forever mine, my forever mine
Sweetly spoken lines
Erase all those bad times
How long I've longed
For the longing to stop
My forever mine, my forever mine
Take me in your arms
Whisper words like always
Stay until you go
Live forever, love forever
My forever mine, my forever mine
The memories are there
To prove how real or rare
Maybe just a place in time
My forever mine, my forever mine
Take me in your arms
Whisper words like always
Stay until you go
Live forever, love forever
My forever mine, my forever mine
Take me in your arms
Whisper words like always
Stay until you go
Live forever, love forever
My forever mine, my forever mine
My forever mine, my forever mine
My forever mine, my forever mine
My forever mine, my forever mine
My forever mine, my forever mine
My forever mine, my forever mine
