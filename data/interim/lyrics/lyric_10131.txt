Don't want to see no movie
Don't turn on no tv
You see I got a condition baby
That's been worrying me
I've been neglected too long baby
While you're loving someone else
It's time I take the time out
To get a little lovin for myself
Loving you
That's all that's on my mind tonight
I can't let you go
Till you love me right
Honey, loving you
That's all that's on my mind tonight
I can't let you go
Till you do it to me right
You can call your other woman
Tell her you all tied up tonight 
Cause when I let you go baby
It's going to be broad daylight
If she still want to see you
See you when I get through
She's welcome to all of the loving
You gonna have left in you
Cause loving you
That's all that's on my mind tonight
I can't let you go
Till you love me right
Honey, loving you
That's all that's on my mind tonight
I ain't gonna let you go
Till you do it to me right
My mother's got the children
They're gonna spend the night
I disconnected the telephone
And I turned down the lights
I know you know how to love me
You used to be an expert
I fixed you a good dinner baby
Let me be your dessert
Honey loving you
That's all that's on my mind tonight
I can't let you go
Till you love me right
Honey, loving you
Can't you see that's all that's on my mind tonight
I ain't gonna let you go
Till you do it to me right
Baby, loving you
That's all that's on my mind tonight
I can't let you go
Till you love me right
Honey, loving you
That's all that's on my mind tonight
I can't gonna let you go
Till you do it to me right
Oh baby

Oh baby 
Oh baby 
Love me right
