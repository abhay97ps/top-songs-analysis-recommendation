Sometimes you feel insecure
Trust me babe I understand 
Even with no manicure
Just know that I'll still hold your hand 
You look so good when you walking by
Sexy comes in every size
Keep wearing that, you ain't playin'
You got yourself a new man

I call that baby fat 
'Cause you sure look good to me
I think
You're so beautiful 
Give the world a show 
Go up down, up down, up down
Go up down, up down, up down
Shake it fast, its yours
I say, you're so beautiful 
And I don't care who knows 
Go up down, up down, up down
Go up down, up down, up down
Shake it fast
'Cause it sure look good to me

The ladies got a thing for the Hakeem
What I'mma do with you? Damn you so beautiful
How do I get you on my team?
You can be natural with a wig on
Chocolate, Caramel, or a Red bone
So confident, so classy
I should kiss you for the hell of it, no chapstick
Can't help it, I love all women
Big, small, medium, and tall women
Aww man, every one of ya' look good to me
Ain't gotta be a beava' to get wood from me, get it?
Where the hell do ya' come from?
Shot me like a bullet, where did you get a gun from?
Landed on your planet in another dimension
Lookin' at you got me standin' up at attention
You got me goin'
