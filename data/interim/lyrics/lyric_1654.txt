If I can see this one night through
Maybe I'll get over you
And realize our love was never right
But I may not live to see tomorrow
I may die of a broken heart tonight
If I'm around when daylight breaks
I may find the strength it takes
To love again and make things
Come out right
But I may not live to see tomorrow
I may die of a broken heart tonight
I tell myself tomorrow's
Gonna be a better day
But tomorrow seems to be
A century away
If I survive the morning dew
Maybe I'll find someone new
And start again to build
A brand new life
But I may not live to see tomorrow
I may die of a broken heart tonight
No, I may not live to see tomorrow
I may die of a broken heart tonight
