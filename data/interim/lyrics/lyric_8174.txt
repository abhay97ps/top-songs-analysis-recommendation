Da da da da....
Tell her
Tell her she's lovely
Tell her
She knows how to suffer
People wanna figure that
They're the only ones
Who really are alone
People wanna figure that
They're the only ones
Who really are alone
People are so beautiful in love
People are so wonderful to love
People wanna think that
They're the only ones who
Really are alone, ooh
Thinking a little bit over
Trying to know one another
Waiting a little bit longer
Thinking a little bit over, yeah
Tell her
Love is a song
Sing out, sing out
All night long
Tell her
Tell her she's lovely
Tell her
Tell her she's lovely
Tell her
Tell her she's lovely
Tell her
Tell her she's lovely
Tell her
Tell her she's lovely....
