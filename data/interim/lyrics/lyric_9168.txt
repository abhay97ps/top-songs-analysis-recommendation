Uh huh uh huh she meant nothing to me just another one night stand
She was easy as pie and I had her eating out of my hand
Had her eating out of my hand
She was easy to touch smiling as I came on strong
She was easy as pie and I knew it wouldn't take me too long
Knew it wouldn't take me too long
Now here comes morning and my way of thinking has changed
Oh she came on so tender but look who surrender
When the lady wasn't playing no games
Now I'm easy as pie the lady had herself a plan
And it's easy to see that she's got me eating out of her hand
Now I'm easy as pie...
Got me eating out of her hand hmm hmm
