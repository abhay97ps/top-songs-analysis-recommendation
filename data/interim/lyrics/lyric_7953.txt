Come live with me and be my love
Share my bread and wine
Be wife to me, be life to me, be mine
Come live with me and be my love
Let our dreams combine
Be mate to me, be fate to me, be mine
With these hands I'll build a roof
To shield your head
And with these hands
I'll carve the wood for a baby bed
Come live with me and be my love
Share my bread and wine
Be part of me, the heart of me, be mine
I'll try to do my best for you
I promise you
I'll laugh with you, I'll cry with you, my whole life through
Come live with me and be my love
Share my bread and wine
Be part of me, the heart of me, be mine....
