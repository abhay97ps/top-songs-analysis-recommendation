Take some of this candy sweet
From my little bag of tricks
And walk on down the street awhile
Follow me through my door
I'll lead you by the hand, my love
And take you to the top
By morn, you'll say forget the clock
And do it to me once again
You hair is long and full and soft
Upon my pillowcase
Dusk has fallen once again
It's time for us to part
