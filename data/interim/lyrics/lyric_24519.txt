Different vibe
This my vibe, nigga
All the bitches like it
Okay, so I got the ambiance just where I want it 
And if you get paid, it's solely based on your performance 
My ego is enormous like my crib in California 
If you ain't got no heart, man you gonna need a donor
Now I said I'm from the corner of the ATL 
Where we got that clientele, avoid paper trails 
Broke so many bales down that I'm shell shocked 
I held Glocks, sold rocks by the mailbox 
Got a vibe, make a yellow chick turn her neck 
Got a vibe, make a cougar wanna spend a check 
Got a vibe, make an Asian want hibachi 
Got a vibe, make Italian want Versace 
Carbon copies get declined, I'm the pioneer
Beat that pussy up, I need riot gear
Any volunteers?
Gas in a Ziploc, now that's loud and clear
This one outta here, this is our year
