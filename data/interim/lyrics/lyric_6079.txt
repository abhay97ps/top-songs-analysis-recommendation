Come on and take me in your arms and make me love you
Make me know how much I'm thinking of you
Come along and do it
There's really nothing to it
Baby if you try
Baby take me in your arms
If loving yous a crime
Then I guess I'm guilty every time
And I always will because this heart of mine needs you so
Maybe I'm a fool, but I don't know why you wanna play it cool
And my love is getting stronger, so don't be cruel, I need you so
Come on and take me in your arms and make me love you
Make me know how much I'm thinking of you
Come along and do it
There's really nothing to it
Baby if you try
Come on and take me in your arms and make me kiss you
Make me know how much I'm gonna miss you
Come along and do it
There's really nothing to it
Baby if you try
Come on, take me in your arms
I've just seen her face and the feeling that I've never felt inside
Makes this heart of mine just melt inside every time
And what can I do when I've tried so hard to get through to you
Somehow you won't let me steal into your heart
Come on and take me in your arms and make me love you
Make me know how much I'm thinking of you
Come along and do it, there's really nothing to it
Baby if you try
Come on and take me in your arms and make me kiss you
Make me know how much I'm gonna miss you
Come along and do it, there's really nothing to it
Baby if you try
