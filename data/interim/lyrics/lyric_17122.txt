Alone
You and I intertwine
Refreshing conversation for the mind
As we stare
We both seek and hope to find
Real love purified
Use your heart and not your eyes
Baby, just relax and ride
If you got time then I got time
Free your thoughts and watch them fly
Use your heart and not your eyes
I sigh as I watch you sleeping there 
So easily I did things I'd never dare 
I say to myself, "I'm glad that we share
Real love purified", oh
Use your heart and not your eyes
Baby, just relax and ride
If you got time then I got time 
Free your thoughts and watch them fly
Use your heart and not your eyes
Use your heart
My goodness, how it seems like yesterday 
She crossed you hurt you in the strongest way 
You've hurt so long, reward come to those who cry
Real love purified
Just a second
I look at my watch's dial
And you love me, pampered me like a child
As we lay, I close my eyes and I smile
At your real love purified
Use your heart and not your eyes
Baby, just relax and ride
If you got time then I got time 
Free your thoughts and watch them fly
Use your heart and not your eyes 
Use your heart and not your eyes 
Baby, just relax and ride
If you got time then I got time 
Free your thoughts and watch them fly 
Use your heart and not your eyes 
Use your heart and not your eyes
Baby, just relax and ride 
If you got time then I got time 
Free your thoughts and watch them fly
Use your heart and not your eyes
