Lookin' through the window
The window to your heart
Oh, baby, yeah
I can see it's cloudy
The rain's about to start
Lookin' through the window
It seems I caused your fears
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And that little doubt, girl
And now it's bringing tears
Just remember whatever makes you feel that way
Don't you worry 'cause I'm gonna stay
Right by your side 
To keep on lookin' through the window
Lookin' in your eyes
Lookin' through the window
Seems like the only way, yeah
I can know your feelings
If you still love me today
Just remember whatever makes you feel that way
Don't you worry 'cause I'm gonna stay
Right by your side 
To keep on lookin' through the window
Lookin' in your eyes
Lookin' through the window
The window to your heart
Ah, ah...
Lookin' through the window
The window to your heart
Za ta ta da da da da ah, da da da da da da ah ah
Za ta ta da da da da ah, da da da da da da ah ah...
