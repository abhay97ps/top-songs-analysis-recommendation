It's raining again
What time is it?
 Man, I can't believe he done stood me up again
 I don't deserve this
What kind of fool does he think I am?
 Time after time, it's evolved
But what for?
 Huh, you know what?
I think it's time I look for Mr. Do Right
I worked all week long
I need a man whose back is real strong
Someone to fulfill my intellect 
And sexual desires
Now please don't get me wrong 
I don't mean to come on strong
It's been a while since I've been satisfied 
And these feelings, I can no longer hide
I used to be in love
But it was oh, so long ago
My mind and body's craving
For a real man to give me some love
But now that you're here with me
There's a smile upon my face
'Cause loving you is so damn easy
And you're sure 'nuff drivin' me crazy
Can't someone stop this rain from falling on my face?
I'm lookin' for Mr. , Mr. Do Right 
Someone who can do it all night
When will you learn playing with fire really burns?
I'm searching for Mr. , Mr. Do Right 
Someone who can please me through the night
I sit here waiting 
But you just won't call, no
My mind is so confused 
But you don't seem to care at all
Now Lord knows I've tried 
To keep our love alive 
So I sing this song for you
'Cause it seems like the right thing to do
Used to be in love
But it was oh, so long ago 
My mind and body's craving
For a real man to give me some love
Now that you're here with me
There's a smile upon my face
'Cause loving you is so damn easy
And you're sure 'nuff drivin' me crazy
Can't someone stop this rain from falling on my face?
I'm lookin' for Mr. , Mr. Do Right 
Someone who can do it all night
When will you learn that playing with fire really burns?
I'm lookin' for Mr. , Mr. Do Right 
Someone who can please me through the night, oh-ooh
You used to love me , hold me
I need a strong man 
I need a Mr. Do Right
You don't hold me like you used to 
My mind and body's craving 
For Mr. Do Right , Lord knows I've tried
Mr. Do Right 
Don't keep me waiting 
Anticipating , ow 
Ooh

I need a man  whose back is real strong, ow
