Hey girl, what can I do with you?
When you take this old heart and tear it in two?
Is it asking so much for you to be true?
I'm an easy-goin' man who takes all that he can
But I tell you
It's not easy lovin' you, baby
It's not easy wantin' you so
It's not easy lovin' you, baby
But it's harder, girl, to let you go
It's harder, girl, to let you go
Girl, I give everything I've got inside
How much more do you need to keep you satisfied?
I put up with so much, Lord knows I've tried
But in spite of all the pain I try not to complain
But I tell you
It's not easy lovin' you, baby
It's not easy wantin' you so
It's not easy lovin' you, baby
But it's harder, girl, to let you go
It's harder, girl, to let you go
It's not easy lovin' you, baby
It's not easy wantin' you so
It's not easy lovin' you, baby
It's not easy wantin' you so
It's not easy lovin' you, baby
