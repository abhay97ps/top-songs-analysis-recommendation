Yeah 
We tear it up, tear it up, tear it up
Yeah
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap 
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack 
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack 
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap 
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap 
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack 
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack 
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap 
Fendi knapsack, while I'm spittin' Fendi facts 
I don't want you back, you a thot, you a nat 
Just like his bitch ass, that fuck nigga will get clapped 
Put a pause on that, you still broke, you ain't back 
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack 
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack 
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack 
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack
I could never change, gotta stick to my routine
I'ma hit it once, then you know I gotta leave
Got addictive personality, I turned into a fiend
Okay, my money sky blue, but my new coupe is slime green
My boys whip work 'til the white turn all tan 
Saw a minivan followin' my brand new Lamb' 
I had a F and an N in my hand 
All my bitches tens, no, I do not fuck no fans
I was checkin' my DMs, found out she was a man 
I can't DM, never, ever again 
Lucien on my vision, that's the only thing that's tran 
Okay, okay, nigga, let's get it
Got your bitch on my top just like a fitted 
I don't want it no more, then I gotta clip it
Balmain jeans, on the front got the zipper
My ice game got cold, got sicker
I'm a Leo like lion, I'm Simba
Stand on my money, I'm tall like a center
June and July cold just like December
It's too low, then the car, I lift it
I know baby girl miss my drip, yeah
Girl, your breath stink, need a spearmint, many 
You need to go and take a minute
But your ass fat, lemme go for the finish
Overseas, I'm eatin' croissants
Told a fuck nigga, "Don't touch my crumpet" 
She a lil' thot, can't wife no bird
Four years, I ain't touch no chick
Whip back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back 
Bentley, Hellcat, new Lambo and Maybach 
I can't talk on the phone, think my shit is tapped 
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap 
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack 
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack 
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap 
Fendi knapsack, while I'm spittin' Fendi facts 
I don't want you back, you a thot, you a nat 
Yes, that's them racks, that's them racks, that's them racks 
Your jeans, they too fat, man, them shits, they relaxed
I got on Dior, and my skinnies, they all black
If we serve the sack, then we take that shit right back 
650 for a hat, 6666 hundred for a jacket
Tried to hold me tight, but I didn't hug her back 
'Cause she tried to snatch out my pocket with the racks 
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap 
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack 
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack 
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap 
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap 
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack 
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack 
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack
