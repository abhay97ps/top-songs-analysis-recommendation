Fooled Around And Fell In Love
Ó°
Henry Lee Summer
I must've been fooled by a million girls
I love 'em and I leave 'em alone
I didn't care how much they cried, on sir
They'er tiers left me cold as a stone
*I've fooled around and fell in love
I've fooled around and fell in love
I've fooled around and fell in love
I've fooled around and fell in love
Used to feel that that I'd see the girl that I like
I fill in my book and I write down her name
The grass got a little greener on the other side
I just tear off a page, hey...
Free on my own
That's the way I used to be
Oh since I met you baby
Love got a hold of me
