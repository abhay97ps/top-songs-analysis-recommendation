Time is never time at all
You can never ever leave
Without leaving a piece of youth
And our lives are forever changed
We will never be the same
The more you change the less you feel
Believe
Believe in me
Believe, believe
That life can change
That you're not stuck in vain
We're not the same
We're different
Tonight 
Tonight, so bright
Tonight 
And you know you're never sure
But you're sure you could be right
If you held yourself up to the light
And the embers never fade
In your city by the lake
The place where you were born
Believe
Believe in me
Believe, believe
In the resolute urgency of now
And if you believe there's not a chance
Tonight 
Tonight, so bright
Tonight 
We'll crucify the insincere tonight 
We'll make things right
We'll feel it all tonight 
We'll find a way to offer up the night tonight
The indescribable moments of your life 
The impossible is possible tonight 
Believe in me as I believe in you
Tonight...
Tonight, tonight...
Tonight...
Tonight...
