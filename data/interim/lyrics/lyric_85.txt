Here's to you
Here's to me
Here's to a happy anniversary
Here's to days gone by
And those that are to be
Oh, here's to a happy anniversary
And if I have my way
One day a long time from now
I'll say
Here's to you
And here's to me
And here's to a happy anniversary
And if I have my way
One day a long time from now
I'll say
Here's to you
Here's to me
And here's to a very happy anniversary
