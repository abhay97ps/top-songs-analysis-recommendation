I've been working as a temp
At the local factory
I hope they hire me on full time
I've got shoes to buy
And a mouth to feed
I drive a buy here, pay here truck
It ain't new, but it is for me
It ain't much but it fires right up
And get me from A to B
What puts the dirt underneath my nails
What keeps the calluses on my hands
Family man
They're a world my world revolves around
My sacred piece of solid ground
The flesh and bone that gives me strength to stand
They are a fire in my drivin on
The drive behind my comin home
The livin, breathin, reason that I am
A family man
There's dirty shirts to wash
Dishes in the sink to do
And there's how many times
Does 17 go into 52
There's bedtime prayers to pray
Sleep tights and I love you's
And then there's a pair of eyes
I get to lose myself into
What keeps me keepin the faith
What makes me believe I can
Family man
They're a world my world revolves around
My sacred piece of solid ground
The flesh and bone that gives me strength to stand
They are a fire in my drivin on
The drive behind my comin home
The livin, breathin, reason that I am
A family man
There's a fire in my drivin on
The drive behind my comin home
The livin, breathin, reason that I am
A family man
A family man
