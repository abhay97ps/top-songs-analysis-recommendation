Please stay with me now
Don't you let me go
I'll make it somehow
I got to let you know
That I'll make it
Somehow, some way
Though I wait on the day
What I'm doing's gotta pay
Some way, somehow
My baby, when he cries
It's 'cause something's on his mind
This world is full of lies
You and me are one of a kind
The good Lord will stand behind every step
We are blind to fate, that's life, that's life
Stay, stay, stay, stay 
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Get it fixed, but you can't make it work
Where there's pain, there's got to be hurt
And the green grass grows from the dirt
Yeah, that's a fact of life alright
The good Lord stands behind every step
We are blind to fate, that's life, that's life
Stay, oh won't you please
Stay, stay 
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay 
Stay, stay 
Stay, stay 
Stay, stay 
Stay, stay 
Stay, stay 
Stay, stay 
Stay, stay 
Stay, stay 
Stay, stay
