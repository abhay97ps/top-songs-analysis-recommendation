Lit on the low
Its Young Donar now!
Yeah
Dont tell me to be waiting i'l be rushin oh
Im so infatuated wit your body woe
How dare u be merciless and let me fall?
Way u looking at me got me enamored
I never been in love with somebody lol
Come take advantage on me don't you lose it no
Seems like all these feelings I cannot control
So wine and dine wit me we can eat it up
How can we be starving
When we got some to feed each other
Ooh don't be selfish
And give me what u got from mother
I won't hesitate
I'll give you what I got from father
So don't delay
Somebody could just take over
Aye why you chillin
I am gettin illy
Running out of patience
Think I'm going silly
Come settle wit me like a attic
I ain't got no ceilings
You know im better when wit me girl
Aye dont you leave me
Imagine the way you'll be laid on my chest
Late in the night I be suckin your breasts
Doing it like we got done with the rest
Don't care about them they wanted to mess
Im tryna be wit u girl do not reject
Yea i been placin all these numbers deck
Dont tell me to be waiting i'l be rushin oh
Im so infatuated wit your body woe
How dare u be merciless and let me fall?
Way u looking at me got me enamored
And i been on my way tryna find you girl
Its so hard to rely on a lonely life
I can not be on this weird sh*t for life
So f*ck it imma try out till I make it right
All my friends going lit tonight
Sippin on a dirty sprite
I'll be on the drank pour the pint
When i am rife
Freaking on the party and we do this for one more time
You dont need to hurry just keep be waiting on the line
I dont take no losses
I gotta rep the closet
Put designers on me not that shit that make me nauseous
Always on the lowest
You know I'm bout that guap
It's time to get the dime walk on water feel like Moses
I ain't gotta waste no time on it
Hyped up always high my nigga
We ain't really got enough so we be on time
We gone do the slime my nigga
I'm loving the way that she riding when she get down my nigga
So lemme be having fun when I got no plan my nigga
Dont tell me to be waiting i'l be rushin oh
Im so infatuated wit your body woe
How dare u be merciless and let me fall?
Way u looking at me got me enamored

Partying wit my homies at the crib you know
Sipping on a drank got it for the low
So baby just come over don't you tell me no
Don't tell me to be waiting Il be turning up
Partying wit my homies at the crib you know
Sipping on a drank got it for the low
So baby just come over don't you tell me no
