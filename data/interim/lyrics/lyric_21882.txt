You think I'm pretty
Without any makeup on
You think I'm funny
When I tell the punchline wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things
Were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You'll be my Valentine, Valentine
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I 
You make me  teenage dream
I can't sleep 
Don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
 this is real
Don't ever look back, don't ever look back
We drove to Cali
And got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and
Built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you
My missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, 
You make me  teenage dream
I can't sleep 
Don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
 this is real
Don't ever look back, don't ever look back
I'm a get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Uh, oh, woah 
Uhhhhhhh... 
 feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back 
Don't ever look back 
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
Don't ever look back 
Don't ever look back 
I'm a get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
