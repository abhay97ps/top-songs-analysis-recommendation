Mama told me not to waste my life 
She said, "Spread your wings, my little butterfly 
Don't let what they say keep you up at night 
And if they give youâ€”, shh, then they can walk on by-y-y
My feet, feet can't touch the ground
And I can't hear a sound
But you just keep on running up your mouth, yeah 
Walk, walk on over there
'Cause I'm too fly to care, oh, yeah
Your words don't mean a thing, I'm not listening
Keep talking, all I know is
Mama told me not to waste my life
She said, "Spread your wings, my little butterfly"
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And they can't detain you cause wings are made to fly
And we don't let nobody bring us down
No matter what you say, it won't hurt me
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
These wings are made to fly 
I'm, firing up on that runway
I know we're gonna get there someday
But we don't need no ready steady go, no
Talk, talk turns into air
And I don't even care, oh yeah
Your words don't mean a thing, I'm not listening
Keep talking, all I know is
Mama told me not to waste my life
She said, "Spread your wings, my little butterfly"
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And they can't detain you cause wings are made to fly 
And we don't let nobody bring us down 
No matter what you say, it won't hurt me 
Don't matter if I fall from the sky 
These wings are made to fly
I don't need no one saying, "Hey, hey, hey, hey"
I don't hear no one saying, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey"
You better keep on walking, I don't wanna hear your talking, boy
You better keep on walking, I don't wanna hear your talking, boy
Your words don't mean a thing, I'm not listening
They're just like water off my wings
Mama told me  not to waste my life 
She said, "Spread your  wings, my little butterfly"
Don't let what they say  keep you up at night 
And they can't detain you 
'Cause wings are made to fly 
And we don't let nobody bring us down 
No matter what you say, it won't hurt me
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
These wings are made to fly
And we don't let nobody bring us down 
No matter what you say, it won't hurt me
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
These wings are made to fly
