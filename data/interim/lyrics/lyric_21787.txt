No Good, two-timing, lies coming out of your mouth
Cheating, mistreating games that you play brought you down
Broke my heart, tore it apart, look who's got the last laugh now
Don't you come crawling back, begging please on your knees, baby if you're missing me
Well, you can hear me on the radio
You want to turn me on, turn on your stereo
You can sing along, while they're playing our song
How you done me wrong, baby crank it up
Until you blow the speakers out your Chevy truck
So listen Romeo, when you're feeling kind of low
Let me tell you where to go
Turn On The Radio!
Try to call, twitter me, text until your fingers bleed
Oh! The DJ's the only way you're ever going to hear from me
If you're reminiscing, and you're missing me this much, and you really want to stay in touch
Well, you can hear me on the radio
You want to turn me on, turn on your stereo
You can sing along, while they're playing our song
How you done me wrong, baby crank it up
Until you blow the speakers out your Chevy truck
So listen Romeo, when you're feeling kind of low
Let me tell you where to go
Turn On The Radio!
Turn on the radio!
Whoa!
Turn on the radio
Turn on the radio
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Well, you can hear me on the radio
You want to turn me on, turn on your stereo
You can sing along, while they're playing our song
How you done me wrong, baby crank it up
Until you blow the speakers out your Chevy truck
So listen Romeo, when you're feeling kind of low
Let me tell you where to go
Turn On The Radio!
Turn on the radio!
Whoa!
Turn on the radio
Turn on the radio
Oh! Oh! Oh!
