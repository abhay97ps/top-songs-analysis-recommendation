OH!
Mama, come here quick
And bring that licking stick
Mama, come here quick
And bring that licking stick
Mama, come here quick
And bring me that licking stick - horns
Mama, come here quick
And bring me that licking stick
Mama, come here quick
And bring me that licking stick
People standing
Standing in a trance
Sister out in the backyard
Doing the outside dance
Come and telling me the other day
She didn't wanna be a drag
I don’t know what she's doing
I think she's got a brand new bag
Mama, come here quick
And bring me that licking stick
Mama, come here quick
And bring that licking stick
Now looka here
Junior don’t kill me
With the lazy strokes
When he take his feet right off the ground
Doing the Mashed Potatoes, and then he begin to slide
Call himself doing the James Brown
Sister says the dance you're doing is the latest thing
People now begin to talk
She jumped back in, that soulful stride
Baby, now she's doing the Camel Walk
Mama, come here quick
And bring me that licking stick - whoop her
Mama, come here quick - get it
And bring that licking stick
Mama, come here quick
And give me that licking stick
Sister, get out there with your bad self
Ha, one more time
Mama, come here quick
And bring that licking stick
Maceo, all right, bring your licking stick
Licking stick, licking stick
Licking stick, almighty, licking stick
HO! Licking stick, ha, licking stick
Licking stick
Bobby, I like the way this sound 
Wanna try it one more time? 
One more time? 
Licking stick, ha, licking stick
