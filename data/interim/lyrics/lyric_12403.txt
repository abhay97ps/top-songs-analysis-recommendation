Midnight blue - so lonely without you
Dreams fed by the mem'ries
Oh let the music play
Midnight blue - those treasured thoughts of you
Gone now and forever
Please
Let the music play
Midnight
Midnight -
I forgave you
Couldn't save you
Drove you from my mind
Midnight blue - so lonely without you
Warm words from a fantasy
Oh let the music play. '
Midnight blue - the tears come flowing through
I'll never forget you
Please
Let the music play
Midnight
Midnight - . ..
Midnight blue - those treasured thoughts of you
Gone now and forever - please
Let the music play
