We'll be shadows in the moonlight
Darlin I'll meet you at midnight
Hand and hand we'll go, dancin' through the Milky Way
And we'll find a little hideaway
Where we can love the whole night away
We'll be shadows in the moonlight right up 'til the light of day
Ooh, the night is young
Baby, so are we
Glad, I'm gonna make you glad you came
Ooh, you won't need a thing
Just bring your love for me
And darlin' I will do the same
There'll be shadows in the moonlight
Darlin I'll meet you at midnight
Hand and hand we'll go, dancin' through the Milky Way
Ooh, you won't need a thing
Just bring your love for me
You'll be glad you came
Just wait and see
We'll be shadows in the moonlight
Darlin I'll meet you at midnight
Hand and hand we'll go, dancin' through the Milky Way
And we'll find a little hideaway
Where we can love the whole night away
We'll be shadows in the moonlight right up 'til the light of day
