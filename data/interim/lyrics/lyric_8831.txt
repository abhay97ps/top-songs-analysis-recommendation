If I hear you knocking hard up on my door
Ain't no way that I'm gonna answer it
'Cos cheating is one thing and lying is another
And when I say it's over that's it I'm gonna quit, yeah
Now I ain't complaining, just tryin' to understand
What makes a woman do the things she does?
One day she'll love you the next day she'll leave you
Why can't we have it just the way it used to be?
Why can't we have it, baby?
'Cos I'm a man, I got my pride
Don't need no woman to hurt me inside
I need a love like any other
So go on and leave me, leave me for another
Good lovin' gone bad
Good lovin' gone bad, bad, bad
Good lovin' gone bad
And baby, I'm a bad man
Now I'm a man, I got my pride
Don't need no woman to hurt me inside
I need a love like any other
So go on and leave me, leave me for another
Good lovin' gone bad
Good lovin' gone bad
Good lovin' gone bad
And baby, I'm a bad man
Good lovin' gone bad
Good lovin' gone bad
Good lovin' gone bad; I'm a sad man
Don't stand in my way 'cause baby, I'm a bad man
