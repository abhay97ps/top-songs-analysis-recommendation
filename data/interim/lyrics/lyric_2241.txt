Burn up that quarter mile
Just tuned my car, now she really peels
A lookin' real tough with chrome reverse wheels
A blue coral wax job sure looks pretty
Gonna get my chick and make it out to Drag City
Yeah, I'm goin' to Drag City
Goin' to Drag City
Goin' to Drag City
Goin' to Drag City
Burn up that quarter mile
The DJ's sayin' on my favorite station
The Drag City races are the fastest in the nation
Wheels are the wildest and the stockers are pretty
I'll get my honey, grab some money, split to Drag City
Well, I'm goin' to Drag City
Goin' to Drag City
Goin' to Drag City
Goin' to Drag City
Burn up that quarter mile
'Round the drag way thick exhaust fills the air
The final teams tachin' up and action everywhere
Checkered flags, wheel stands, sure sounds pretty
To hear the cheers bring your ears out to Drag City
Yeah, I'm goin' to Drag City
Goin' to Drag City
Goin' to Drag City
Goin' to Drag City
Burn up that quarter mile
Burn up that quarter mile
Listen to 'em whine
Listen to 'em whine
Listen to 'em whine
Listen to 'em whine
Listen to 'em whine
