(...wild in the streets... wild in the streets...
Wild in the streets... wild in the streets...)
Well in the heat of the summer
Gonna call up a plumber
To turn on the steam pump to cool me off
With the newspaper writers
And the big crime fighters
I still need a drugstore to cure my cough
Running wild in the streets
Running wild in the streets
Running wild in the streets
Running wild in the streets
You got a fan called Shady
And a Midnight Lady
And two Queen Mary's to beat the band
You better not touch us
You'd best believe us
Your teenage jive is gonna work out a mess
Running wild in the streets 
Mrs. America tell me how is your favourite son?
Do you really care what he has done?
Running wild in the streets...
