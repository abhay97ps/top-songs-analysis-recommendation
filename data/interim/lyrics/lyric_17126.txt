So what if your jeans are torn
They've been torn since Bros were cool
I wanted you for a little while
You got it wrong by a million miles
Big deal, what a thrill, what a let down
Kissing in your car when I should've been out
I want the Prodigy really loud
I want it all right now
Over and over, I feel it
Boyfriend you're alone
You must be out of your mind
Jellyhead, you've really blown it
Over and over, I feel it
Boyfriend you're alone
You must be out of your mind
Jellyhead, you've really blown it
In the slow lane, never change the way that I feel
Go home, never know, never be real
'Cause not one thing you said was true
I'm gonna find somebody new
Make up, break up, always the same
Get out, what about you and me say
I've been hanging around you too long
When summer comes I'm gone
Over and over, I feel it
Boyfriend you're alone
You must be out of your mind
Jellyhead, you've really blown it
Over and over, I feel it
Boyfriend you're alone
You must be out of your mind
Jellyhead, you've really blown it
I wanna be flying in the clear sky
Wanna be diving in the blue
I gotta be out in the evening
Jellyhead, without you, without you
Over and over, I feel it
Boyfriend you're alone
You must be out of your mind
Jellyhead, you've really blown it
Over and over, I feel it
Boyfriend you're alone
You must be out of your mind
Jellyhead, you've really blown it
 Over and over, I feel it
 Boyfriend you're alone
