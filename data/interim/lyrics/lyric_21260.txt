Smooth talking
So rocking
He's got everything that a girl's wanting
Guitar cutie
He plays it groovy
And I can't keep myself from doing something stupid
Think I'm really falling for his smile
Get butterflies when he says my name
He's got something special, he's got something special
And when he's looking at me, I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special, he's got something special
I can hardly breathe, something's telling me
Telling me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one, he could be the one
He's lightning
Sparks are flying
Everywhere I go, he's always on my mind
And I'm going crazy about him lately
And I can't help myself from how my heart is racing
Think I'm really digging on his vibe
He really blows me away 
He's got something special, he's got something special
And when he's looking at me, I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special, he's got something special
I can hardly breathe, something's telling me
Telling me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one, he could be the one
And he's got a way of making me feel
Like everything I do is perfectly fine
The stars are aligned when I'm with him
And I'm so into him
He's got something special, he's got something special
And when he's looking at me, I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special, he's got something special
I can hardly breathe, something's telling me
Telling me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one, he could be the one
