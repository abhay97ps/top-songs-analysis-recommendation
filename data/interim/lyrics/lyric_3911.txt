I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need
Open up your arms 
And let me walk on in
Open up your heart 
And let me live again
When you left, you left with me
A dream no longer reality
I live in the shadows of our past
With this love that was born to last
I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need
The only time I'm happy 
Is when you're on my mind
Every day I live
More of the love to you I give
I've been a thousand places
Seen your smile on a thousand faces
No matter what I try to do 
I'm always dreaming of you
I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need
Every girl that passes by
I see your sparkle in her eye
Right away I stop and stare
Close my eyes and see you there
Whenever I feel almost free
Old memories start taking hold of me
I love you now so much more
Than I ever did before
I guess I'll always love you
I guess I'll always love you
I guess I'll always love you
