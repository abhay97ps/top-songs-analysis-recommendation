Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody 
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine 
Thirty bottles, yeah, the bill is on me 
Been livin' fast, no, I can't take it slowly 
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody 
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine 
We on a bender, we ain't gettin' no sleep 
We turned the hotel lobby to a party
I'm whippin' a foreign, I can't whip no Beetle 
I rock that Saint Laurent over my beater 
I like to stunt like I'm Evel Knievel 
But, it don't mean nothin' without all my people 
When I step up on stage, hands up to the sky 
Every little thing I do, they always analyze 
Gave that bitch a little blow and then she come alive 
Started dancin' on the table, like she had on mine 
I don't fuck with nobody , yeah, you hardly know me 
What you take me for , no, I can't save your soul 
I don't fuck with nobody, yeah, you hardly know me 
Please just leave me alone 
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody 
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine 
Thirty bottles, yeah, the bill is on me 
Been livin' fast, no, I can't take it slowly 
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody 
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine 
We on a bender, we ain't gettin' no sleep 
We turned the hotel lobby to a party
Made a hundred bands, saw all your hands out 
No, my friend, can't do no handouts 
All these rappers, all sound the same now 
Sayin' I'm to blame, now y'all see me on the TV 
Multimillionaire by the time I'm 23 
Gettin' no sleep , ragin' for a week 
I hit number one and I ain't even hit my peak 
I just had to tell 'em
I don't fuck with nobody, yeah, you hardly know me
What you take me for, no, I can't save your soul
I don't fuck with nobody, yeah, you hardly know me 
Please just leave me alone 
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody 
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine 
Thirty bottles, yeah, the bill is on me 
Been livin' fast, no, I can't take it slowly 
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody 
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine 
We on a bender, we ain't gettin' no sleep 
We turned the hotel lobby to a party
We ain't sleepin', we ain't sleepin', we ain't 
We ain't sleepin', we ain't sleepin' tonight 
We ain't sleepin', we ain't sleepin', no way 
Pour that drink, 'cause we ain't sleepin' tonight
