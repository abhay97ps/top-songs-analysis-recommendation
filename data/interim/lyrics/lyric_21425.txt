I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us, and we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try, and try, and try, and try
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
And mommy, you were always somewhere
And daddy, I live out of town
So tell me, how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me, why am I in tears?
Woah, so far away and now I just need you here
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go?
When there's no road to get to your heart
Let's start over again
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
