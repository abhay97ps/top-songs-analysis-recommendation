My daddy told me
That boys may say some things that aren't true
Yeah, they promise many sweet things
That they never intend to do
Whoa, you say your love is strong
And you'd never do me wrong
But let me tell you that
My daddy told me
To open up my eyes and not be blind
Well, 'cause every time I look at you
Everything you do seems so fine
Whoa, I love you so but I have to let you go
Unless you get out and get a job
Whoa, get out and get a job
I'm gonna wait 'til you pass the test
'Cause my daddy knows best
Oh, my daddy knows best now, oh
He doesn't want me to make, no, no, no, no, no, no
The same mistakes, no, no, no, no
He says, "Romance without finance
Can be a nuisance"
I need your loving but my daddy told me
Yes, he told me that our love is fine
Whoa, but don't let it mislead you
'Cause daddy also said that love is blind
While you're in pool rooms
You should be in school rooms
And get out and get a job
Whoa, get out and get a job
I'm gonna wait 'til you pass the test
'Cause my daddy knows best
Oh, I don't care what you say
We've got to do it his way
Don't say that he's mean
I'll have to tell him everything
