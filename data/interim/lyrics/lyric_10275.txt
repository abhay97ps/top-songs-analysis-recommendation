You don't know how much I love you
But I love you like the sun
I'd like to put my arms around you
And run, run, run, run away
Let's run, run, run, run away
Let's run, run, run, run away
If you knew how much I miss you
I miss you more each day
I'd really like to come and see you
We could run, run, run, run away
Run, run, run, run away
Let's run, run, run, run away
Summer's comin' and it's getting warmer
Tell me spring is just around the corner
I'm sitting watchin' all the flowers
Birds are singin' getting louder and louder
Here I am, missin' you
Here I go, I'm lovin' you
Run, run, run, run, runnin', here I go I'm wanting you
Run, run, run, run, runnin', here I go I'm needing you
Run, run, run, run, runnin', here I go I'm loving you
Run, run, run, run, runnin', run, run, run, run, run away
If you knew how much I need you
Oh and I need you like the air
If someone should take you from me
I would run, run, run, run away
I'd run, run, run, run away
Let's run, run, run, run away
Summer's comin' and it's getting warmer
Tell me spring is just around the corner
I'm sitting watchin' all the flowers
Birds are singin' getting louder and louder
Here I am, missin' you
Here I go, I'm lovin' you
Run, run, run, run, runnin', here I go I'm wanting you
Run, run, run, run, runnin', here I go I'm needing you
Run, run, run, run, runnin', here I go I'm loving you
Run, run, run, run, runnin', run, run, run, run, run away
You don't know how much I love you
But I love you like the sun
I'd like to put my arms around you
We could run, run, run, run away
Come on, baby, let's run, run, run, run away
Come on, baby, let's run, run, run, run away
You don't know how much I want you, run, run, run, run away
You don't know how much I need you, run, run, run, run away
You don't know how much I love you, run, run, run, run away
You don't know how much I love you, run, run, run, run away
Really like to come and see you,  run, run, run, run away
Really put my arms around you,  run, run, run, run away
One more time, just one more time now,  run, run, run, run away
