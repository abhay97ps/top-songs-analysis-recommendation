Electricity
Eye to eye
Hey don't I know you?
I can't speak
Stripped my senses
On the spot
I've never been defenseless
I can't even make sense of this
You speak and I don't hear a word
What would happen if we kissed?
Would your tongue slip past my lips?
Would you run away?
Would you stay?
Or would I melt into you?
Mouth to mouth
Lust to lust
Spontaneously combust
Room is spinning
Out of control
You act like you didn't notice
You brushed my hand
Forbidden fruit
Ring on my finger
Your such a moral, moral man
Would you throw it away, no question?
Will I pretend I'm innocent?
What would happen if we kissed?
Would your tongue slip past my lips?
Would you run away?
Would you stay?
Or would I melt into you?
Mouth to mouth
Lust to lust
Spontaneously combust
What would happen if we kissed?
I struggle with myself again
Quickly the walls are crumblin'
Don't know if I can turn away
What would happen if we kissed?
Would your tongue slip past my lips?
Would you run away?
Would you stay?
Or would I melt into you?
Mouth to mouth
If we kissed
Would your tongue slip past my lips?
Would you run away?
Would you stay?
Or would I melt into you?
Mouth to mouth
If we kissed
Ooh
If we kissed
Ooh
