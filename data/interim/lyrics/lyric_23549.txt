Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I feel the blood rushin' throughout ya body
You see the scars painted over my skin
I'm always numb to the topic of lovin'
I fell in love with the subject of sin
I don't have to remind you, it's my need to confine you
I see your face every time I'm with somebody else
Can't you see that I want you? 
I don't have to remind you 
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
I'm in control, when you give me your body, yeah
I feel our souls burnin' up when I'm, inside of you and I
And I'ma leave a mark, just to remind you, where you belong, baby
Give me your all, scream as loud as you want
I don't have to remind you, it's my need to confine you
I see your face every time I'm with somebody else
Can't you see that I want you? 
I don't have to remind you 
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
