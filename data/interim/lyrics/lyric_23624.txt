Ooh ooh that's my song ho
Ooh ooh that's my song ho
Ooh ooh that's my song ho
That's my song ho, that's my song ho
Hit me in my whip, that bitch nasty
Bad bitch, but her attitude nasty
Ooh ooh, she the swoop don't kiss her, that bitch nasty
Hold that lookin' for some thots, bitch I'm nasty
Nasty, nasty, nasty 
Nasty, nasty, nasty 
Nasty, nasty, nasty 
That my fucking song, that my fucking song
Rolex on, got my chain on

Hey that my favorite song
Ain't you that sangin' nigga? Yeah bitch now turn it on
Hit me in my whip, that bitch crazy
She gon' suck me up until my eyes get lazy
Told that bitch I don't have the gas
But, who give a fuck? I'mma great bait
Hit me in my whip, that bitch nasty
Bad bitch, but her attitude nasty
Ooh ooh, she the swoop don't kiss her, that bitch nasty
Hold that lookin' for some thots, bitch I'm nasty
Nasty, nasty, nasty 
Nasty, nasty, nasty 
Nasty, nasty, nasty 
New York, shearling leather coat, it's for any weather 
Please try me, try me please I'll have niggas severed
That is in half, in a whip lab
I might knock a nigga off and take a milk bath
They keep on calling me, calling me Dro
I'm in the business with swoll
46 cars is so nasty, I drove that thing straight to the club, woah
European shoes, tell em' size forty-three
Not too saggy, not too skinny, jeans D&G
Hold up, Crips they meet me at Crucial
Bloods they meet me at Brucial
And I got Tokyo, Tokyo oh ho them bitches some cougars
Blue Turquoise Cooper
Yeah that thing nasty
Don't let these super models fool you
These hoes here trashy
Hit me in my whip, that bitch nasty
Bad bitch, but her attitude nasty
Ooh ooh, she the swoop don't kiss her, that bitch nasty
Hold that lookin' for some thots, bitch I'm nasty
Nasty, nasty, nasty 
Nasty, nasty, nasty 
Nasty, nasty, nasty
