I'm lookin' back, over my shoulder
Thinking of days gone by
One more fool takin' someone for granted
How could I be so blind?
And I didn't believe that you'd really leave me
When it felt so right
I let you slip away from my love, baby
I let you get away
I let you slip away from my love, baby
I let you get away
They say there's a reason
For all the pain in our lives
I guess I believe it's true
But where was I to leave me, now that I know
The reason that I lost you
I could've given you more
Could've loved you better
But I missed my cue
And I let you slip away from my love, baby
I let you get away
I let you slip away from my love, baby
I let you get away, let you get away
I let you slip away from my love, baby
I let you get away
I let you slip away from my love, baby
I let you get away
You walked right out of my life, baby
And left me staring at a lonely,lonely,lonely night
I lost the best thing I ever had
That day you walked away
I let you, I let you, I let you slip away from my love
Slipped away from me, girl
Ohh, wanna moon rise with you so
Yeah, yeah, ohh, ohh
You got away from my love, girl
Let you get away, yeah
I let you get away, yeah
