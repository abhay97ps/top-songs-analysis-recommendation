Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
It's like a brand new love affair
No one watching us could be aware
We don't share a brand new love affair
Saw you, saw you last night
It was like the time when we first met
I held you, I held you so tight
Like I did the night we won't forget
First time that I held you near
Felt my troubles disappear
That first day of our brand new love affair
Oh, oh
It's like a brand new love affair
It's like a brand new love affair
'Cause we're still holding hands
And we're still making plans, oh
I still get butterflies
Each time I look in your eyes
It's like a brand new love affair
No one watching us could be aware
That we don't share a brand new love affair
Look closer, look closer tonight
Love gets sweeter every single day
Love's stronger, it's stronger tonight
Our love is gonna last us all the way
First time I held you near
Felt my troubles disappear
That first day of our brand new love affair
Oh, oh
It's like a brand new love affair
Ooh, it's like a brand new love affair
'Cause we're still dreaming dreams
And we're still scheming schemes
How can we go wrong
Now our love's so strong
It's still like a brand new love affair
No one watching us would be aware
We don't share a brand new love affair
It's like a brand new love affair
No one watching us would be aware
That we don't share a brand new love affair
It's like a brand new love affair, oh, oh
Like a brand new love affair
It's like a brand new love affair, oh, oh
