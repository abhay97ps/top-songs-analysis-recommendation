If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me
All the things that we've been through
You should understand me
Like I understand you
Now baby, I know the difference
Between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothin'
To upset our happy home
Oh, don't get so excited
When I come home a little late at night
Cause we only act like children
When we argue fuss and fight
If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me
If you don't know me, baby
No you won't
We've all got our own funny moods
I've got mine, woman you've got yours too
Just trust in me, like I trust in you
As long as we've been together
That should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together
Or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair
When we can't see eye to eye
If you don't, if you don't know me, baby
If you don't know me by now
No you won't
