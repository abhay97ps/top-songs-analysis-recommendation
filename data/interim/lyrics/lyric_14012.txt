Rock, rock, rock...
It's time to jam, y'all
Freeze! Get up against the wall!
And let's rock, hey
Ooh, ooh, yeah
No longer will I do
All the things that I used to do
Stood by your side in innocence
For my love was just for you
Well, I'm a big girl now
With big needs and desires
So don't you come around
If you can't take me higher
I like to rock a lot, so my love won't wait
I like to rock a lot, that's how it is of lately
I like to rock a lot, I'll take a pair and a spare
I like to rock a lot, big boy, are you out there?
Rock, rock, rock...
Oh, yeah, I like to party
Yeah, ooh
I think it's my turn this time
Not a soul gets burned
Games never had no place with me
Jamming is my concern
Just give me one good man
To keep me satisfied
Have you gone underground
And if so, where will you hide, sweet thing?
Hey!
I like to rock a lot, so my love won't wait
I like to rock a lot, that's how it is of lately
I like to rock a lot, I'll take a pair and a spare
I like to rock a lot, big boy, are you out there?
Step on the funk now
Well, well
Raise the funk, y'all
It's time to rock with Re-Re
Yes, it is!
Rocking is my soul's desire
And I am going to set you on fire!
I tried to warn you
I tried to warn you
Yeah, yeah
I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it
