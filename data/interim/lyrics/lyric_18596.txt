Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends
I'm looking' down the barrel of Friday night
Riding' on a river of freeway lights
Goodbye city I'm country bound
Till Monday rolls around
Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends
Working in the grind is an uphill road
Punching that clock and carrying that load
I bust it all week and then I'm free
The weekend belongs to me
Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends
Give me some fresh air give me that farm
Give me some time with you in my arms
Far away from the hustle and the pressure and the noise
Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends
Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends
Where the blacktop ends
Where the blacktop ends
Where the blacktop ends
