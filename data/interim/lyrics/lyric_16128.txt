Yeah, this song...is for all the  in the house
We want you to get up
We gon' rock this mutha one time, ha ha, ah yeah
Here we go
Hey...hey... hey hey hey
Ski-doody-doom-da-nah  ski-doody-doom-da-nah
Ski-doody-doom-da-nah  ski-doom-dah
Bottoms up, it's too hot in here
Where's the fire truck when you need one
I want a firm foundation, a knockout derriere
I can't believe that my eyes are gasping for air
Unlike before, so much to explore
All I need and more, I'm gonna hit the floor
No kids in the candy store, get a lollipop at the door
I won't be no more, I'm gonna hit the floor
A bedrocker  anytime
Gotta keep, gotta keep it on the level
Lay it low , with feet sky high 
When you drive a wide load, you better go for what you know
Unlike before, so much to explore
All I need and more, I'm gonna hit the floor-oor-oor-oor
So much to explore, I'm gonna hit the floor
I'm gonna hit the floor, I'm gonna hit the floor
Earthquake shakes whenever you move
The word heartbreaker describes you
Nice full back, there just waitin' to score
A stallion to break, so whatever it takes
Got my boots, got my hat, got my ridin' pants
To enhance the romantic circumstance
With you, you, ahh, is all I want
Here we go, I'm gonna hit the floor, so much to explore
I'm gonna hit, I'm gonna hit, I'm gonna hit the floor
Come on, I'm gonna hit the floor
I won't be no more, I'm gonna hit the floor
I like, I like, you like, I like, you like
I like, you like, I'm gonna hit the floor
Soon as I hit the door, I won't be no more
I won't get, you sexies gonna walk in the door
 Lord have mercy
 Come on, come on...
 Let me ride, come on, let me ride
However you want , however you need it 
However you want it , I'm gonna heed it 
However you want , however you need 
I'm gonna give it 
Just let me rule, let me rule, let me rule it
Gonna hit the, gonna hit the floor
Earthquake shakes whenever you move
The word heartbreaker describes you
Nice full back just waiting to score
I tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna hit the floor
Gonna hit the floor
Everybody come on, I'm gonna hit the floor
I want you to join me, hit the floor, come on
Grab me a lollipop at the door
Don't waste time, gonna hit the floor
Wild for a derrierre
Ooh, I'm gasping for air
Feet sky high 
Earthquake shake 
Real heartbreaker 
Ow, oh, I'm gonna hit the floor
Oh, oh, oh...oh, oh, oh, oh...
I'm gonna hit the floor
Come on, I'm gonna hit the floor
Gonna, I'm gonna hit the floor
I'm gonna hit the floor
