You know the definition of a balla
 That's me
C-H-I-N-G to the Y
Let me explain it to you though
I'm a balla  high, roller baby 
Shot caller  ain't nobody this crazy 
You a hater  why you tryin' to play me 
Fake player  ain't nobody killin 
Girl I know you do the nasty 
I could tell when ya  walked past me 
And your proud I looking flashy
Errrthings on your mind
Just ask me
I know my errrrelated stuff wasky 
Carrots all in the dezzy
It's a habbit 
Wurrs my cash
Outside I gotta Benz and Jag 
Is she down for gettin dirty with a 'get it' boy
All I need is one night just hit it boy
After the club we can checkin at five-star telly
Get a suite an let me put somethin in your belly
What's your name sheena
 that you was shelly
Don't matta four o'clock
Just be ready
Foreva solja probably won't come back from your momma
Must we think that's where ya get your back from
I'm a balla  high, roller baby 
Shot caller  ain't nobody this crazy 
You a hater  why you tryin' to play me 
Fake player  ain't nobody killin 
Now I know we keep it crackin ask 'em and brit 
The girls on us so dirty who you rollin wit 
From Magic City to the pink slip in the Lou 
Them chicks love the diamonds that I get from rob jewels
We been in the spot maaaan hang up flirtin
We be surrounding by girls man and I ain't burpin
All I know is money cash, sex, and j
And I got all three no I don't play 
Chicks call me Drama King like KaySlay 
Cause in the bed I bring it  night and day
Lettin rounds off in 'em like an AK
You leavin wit me tell me is it free or do I have to pay, 
I'm a balla  high, roller baby 
Shot caller  ain't nobody this crazy 
You a hater  why you tryin' to play me 
Fake player  ain't nobody killin 
I like them black, white, Puerto Rican, or Haitian
Like Japanese, Chinese, or even Asian 
Don't matter what colour on this occasion, 
Like smoke take a hit of what I'm blazin
I said to god it's me girls praisin'
Meet me at about 6 at the days inn
5 of 'em, 1 of me, I'm feelin caged in
I'm a pimp, I'm gonna keep on playin
You know I love 'em for that one night, 
I could take on ten with my one pipe, 
Knock 'em all like a bowlin pin on site, 
Make 'em soak, change, girl lookherre you better get your mind right
I'm a balla  high, roller baby 
Shot caller  ain't nobody this crazy 
You a hater  why you tryin' to play me 
Fake player  ain't nobody killin
