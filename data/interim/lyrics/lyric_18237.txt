Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh
There are times
I swear I know you're here
When I forget about my fears
Feeling you, my dear
Watchin' over me
And my hope seeks
What the future will bring
When you wrap me in your wings
And take me
Where you are
Where you and I will breathe together
Once again
We'll be dancing in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
And you'll be smiling back at me
Only then will I be free
When I can be
Where you are
And I can see your face
Your kiss, I still can taste
Not a memory erased
Oh, I see your star
Shining down on me
And I'd do anything
If I could just be right there
Where you are
Where you and I will breathe together
Once again 
We'll be dancing in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
And you'll be smilin' back at me 
Only then will I be free
Then will I be free
So take me where you are
Now baby, there were times when selfishly
I'm wishing that you are here with me
So I can wipe the tears from your eyes
And make you see 
That every night while you are dreamin'
I'm here to guard you from afar
And anytime I feel alone
I close my eyes and dream of where you are
Where you and I can breathe together
Once again 
We'll be dancing in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
And you'll be smilin' back at me 
Only then will I be free
Then I will be free
Baby, I still believe
Oh, I've got to believe
I will touch you that sweet day
That you take me there
Where you are
I still believe
Oh, I've got to believe 
I will touch you that sweet day
That you take me there
Where you are
Oh, where you are
I still believe
I've got to believe
I still believe
I'll always be waiting here
That sweet day yeah
Only wanna be where you are
I still believe
