If you're livin' for the moment
Don't stop, and celebrate the feelin'
Go up, if you're livin' for the moment
Don't stop, 'cause there ain't no ceilings
Go up
We're made for now
Not tomorrow
Made for now
Look around
We're made for now
Not tomorrow

Look around 
We're made for now 
Everybody move your body, everybody
Everybody move your body, everybody 
We're made for now
Everybody move your body , everybody 
Everybody move your body , everybody
If you're livin' for the moment
Don't stop, try to celebrate the feelin'
Go up, if you're livin' for the moment 
Don't stop, 'cause I break those ceilings
Go up
Love is in the rhythm now, we're
Dancing with a whole new meaning
Love is on the way to fill you up
We're made for now

Arriba la raza, estamos en la casa
Dale suelta en banda to' lo que te atrasa
Muévete eso rápi-rápido
Muévete eso rápi-rápido
We don't stop it, no te escapas
Yo soy volcán pero tú eres lava
Seguimos lighty, lighty, prendí'os
Vívelo hoy, que mañana se acaba
