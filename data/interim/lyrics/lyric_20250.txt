Mi amor I'm not sure of the right words to say
Maybe these simple words will do best to best explain
What I feel in my heart
What I feel more each day, oh
How to make you see
How to let you know
How to say how to say how I love you so
With words you understand
Words that get right through to your heart
Here's the place to start
Tu amor, I will always be
Tu amor, means the world to me
Estarás siempre en mi corazón
You're the one in my soul
And I live for tu amor, tu amor
Mi amor, love you more with each look in your eyes
Maybe these simple words will do best to best describe
What I feel in my heart
What I'll feel for all time, oh
How to make you see
How to let you know
How to say how to say how I need you so
With words you understand
Words that get right through to your soul
Words that let you know
Tu amor, I will always be
Tu amor, means the world to me
Estarás siempre en mi corazón
You're the one in my soul
And I live for tu amor, tu amor
You're the one that I need in my arms
Believe me these words I say
Are words that come straight from my heart
How do I make you believe
Nothing else means as much as what you mean to me
Tú eres la única en mi alma 
Yo te quiero 
Te adoro 
Tus labios 
Tus ojos 
Mi amor...
Tu amor, I will always be
Tu amor, means the world to me
Estarás siempre en mi corazón
You're the one in my soul
And I live for tu amor, tu amor
