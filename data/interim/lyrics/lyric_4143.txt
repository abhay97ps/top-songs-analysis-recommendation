I'm coming home I'm coming
I'm coming home I'm coming home
Home, I'm coming home
Coming home from across the sea
Home, I'm coming home
No more marching and fighting for me
I am soldier
A coming home soldier
No purple heart
Do I wear on my chest
I'm just a soldier
A coming home soldier
I know that I
I've done my best
I'm coming home I'm coming
I'm coming home I'm coming home
The girl I left behind
Has been waiting patently
She said, she didn't mind
Cause helpin keep our land free
I am soldier
A coming home soldier
No purple heart
Do I wear on my chest
I'm just a soldier
A coming home soldier
I know that I
I've done my best
I'm coming home I'm coming
I'm coming home I'm coming home
