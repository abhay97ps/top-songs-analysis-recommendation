I'd like to make a long-distance call
To a number West LA
I've been trying to reach it all day
But no one answers
Tell me why
Was I so unkind?
I hope he's still on that line
I'll make it up to him
If he hasn't changed his number
If he hasn't changed his mind
I know it's late
But please let it ring
Another time or two
Or three
He'd be hurt if he knew it was me
And I was waiting for him
Why was I so unkind?
I hope he's still on that line
I'll make it up to him
If he hasn't changed his number
If he hasn't changed his mind
Lonely person to lonely person
Oh, tell me, why was I so unkind?
I hope he's still on that line
I'll make it up to him
If he hasn't changed his number
If he hasn't changed his mind
