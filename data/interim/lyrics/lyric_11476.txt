Underneath the streetlights
Running with the fools
Scared that they might see you
For how you really are
Following the rich kids
And screaming with the drunks
You get caught between them
Everything is lost
I know you know we go down
I know you know we go down
I know you know we go down
I know you know we go down
I know you know we go down
I know you know we go down
Searching for the answers
It's something you can feel
Bedroom window steam clouds
Winter accolades
You're caught up in the moment
You blame it on the times
I swear bridges burned down
You say that it's fine
I know you know we go down
I know you know we go down
I know you know we go down
I know you know we go down
I know you know we go down
I know you know we go down
Love don't lie down
Love don't lie down
Before you go away
Before you go away
Love don't lie down
Love don't lie down
Before you go away
Before you go away
Love don't lie down
Love don't lie down
Before you go away
Before you go away
I know you know we go down
I know you know we go down
I know you know we go down
I know you know we go down
I know you know we go down
I know you know we go down
