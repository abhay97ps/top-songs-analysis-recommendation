Ba da da.....ba da da
Ba da da.....ba da da da
Well, I'm the son of a traveling man
And though I'm partially shackin'
Railroad whistles and freighter horns
Turn me on, and I'm packing
Seattle, Savannah
Orlando or anywhere
Chicago, St. Louis
Sheboygan, I'm going there
Though I know that I love you
And the feeling's so good
If you love me too
I'm warning you
Don't count em forever
We can have a ball together
But if fun time??? come admitten' comes a feeling
I'll be splitting
Tacoma, Pomona
Don't know where
I'm heading for
There's one thing I'm sure of
Just as soon as I get there, baby
I'll be feeling like
Traveling on once more
Baby, now that you understand
Well, there's no reason for sorrow
You know, I'm the son of a travelin' man
Here today, gone tomorrow
From Boston to Charleston
Wherever the four winds blow
I'm restless, I'm ready
There's a rainbow for me to follow
Anywhere that it leads me
I must go!
Milwaukee, Muskegon
Miami, the heart is there
Atlanta, New Orleans
Columbus or anywhere
Biloxi or Philly
Toledo I'm going there
