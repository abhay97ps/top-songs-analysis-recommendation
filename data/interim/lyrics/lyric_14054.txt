Another holiday
Well, you're walking straight ahead
But you're looking to your right
Got your eyes down low
But you hold your head high
A hola-hola-ho and a hola-hola-hey
Another holiday
Beach, the sun and sand dunes
Takes me far away
Distant lands are not so far away
I don't know why we don't go
Take my hand I'll show you the way
Pack your bags and sail away
Well, I hate my job
And I got no car
And my aching feet
Won't take me that far
A hola-hola-ho and a hola-hola-hey
Another holiday
Kiss me in the moonlight
Listen to the waves
Distant lands are not so far away
I don't know why we don't go
Take my hand I'll show you the way
Pack your bags and sail away
A-hoo a-ha-ha, a-hoo-hoo
A-hoo a-ha-ha, a-hoo-hoo
A-hoo a-ha-ha, a-hoo-hoo
A-hoo a-ha-ha, a-hoo-hoo
Another holiday
Distant lands are not so far away
I don't know why we don't go
Take my hand I'll show you the way
Pack your bags and sail away
