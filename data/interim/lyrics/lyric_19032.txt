She says don't stare at me
She's afraid that I might see
Those 5 extra pounds she talks about
Man, I don't know what she's talking about
She looks through magazines
With every page she dreams of
Looking like somebody else
I wish she wasn't so hard on herself
Then she falls asleep with just my t-shirt on
But even when her hair's messed up and her make-up's gone
Chorus
You can't hide Beautiful
You Can't hide wonderful
There's nothing that she has to do
It just comes natural
She makes it look easy
I love what she does to me
No way to disguise
The way that she shines
You can't hide beautiful, oh no
She can take a simple dress
Put it on and turn some heads
Man Everytime she moves she gets me
She doesn't even know she's sexy
And the way she thinks sometimes
Out of no where blows my mind
She makes me laugh and makes me dream
I love the way she looks at things
A little piece of heaven god gave to this world
She might think she's just an ordinary girl
"But" Repeat Chorus
You can't hide Beautiful
She's so beautiful yeah yeah
Ohhh ohhh ya can't ya can't ya can't hid beautiful
