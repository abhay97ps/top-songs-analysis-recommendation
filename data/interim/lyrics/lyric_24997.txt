Mm, mm
Ain't nothing to it, real one
Ain't nothing to it, boss
Ain't nothing to it  real one
Ain't nothing to it  boss
Heh, I paid the cost
Who gon' take it all? 
I record then I ball 
I ignored a lot of calls 
You ain't talkin' 'bout nothin', I ain't got no time
Got that dinero on my mind
Ohh, I got real problems just like you 
Tell that bitch, "I don't like you" 
Ain't nothing to it, real one
Ain't nothing to it  boss
Ain't nothing to it  real one
Ain't nothing to it  I boss
Ohhh, real one
Uh, I'm a boss
Oh oh oh oh ohhh, oh yeah
Let me get 'em, B, yeah
Hundred million crib, three million watch, all facts
No cap; false nigga, you not a boss, you got a boss
Niggas getting jerked, that shit hurts, I take it personally
Niggas rather work for the man than to work with me
Just so they can pretend they on my level, that shit is irkin' to me
Pride always goeth before the fall, almost certainly
It's disturbing what I gross 
Survey says you not even close 
Everybody's bosses 'til it's time to pay for the office
'Til them invoices separate the men, from the boys
Over here we measure success by how many people successful next to you
Here we say you broke if everybody is broke except for you
Boss!
Ain't nothing to it, real one 
Ain't nothing to it  boss 
Ain't nothing to it  real one 
Ain't nothing to it  I boss
Ohhh, real one
Uh, I'm a boss
Oh oh oh oh ohhh, oh yeah
Ain't nothing to it, I bossed up out my momma whip
My great-great-grandchildren already rich
That's a lot of brown chil'ren on your Forbes list
Frolickin' around my compound on my fortress, boss 
Ohh, I be ridin' 'round with my seat reclinin'
Droppin' my daughter off at school every morning
We slammin' car doors
I be true ballin' on these bum whores
You ain't talkin' 'bout nothing, I ain't got no time, boss
Chill, tell them paps they gotta relax 
Toes in the sand, momma gettin' fat 
Ain't nothing to it  real one 
Ain't nothing to it  boss 
Ain't nothing to it  real one 
Ain't nothing to it  I boss
Ooh, real one
Uh, I'm a boss
Oh oh oh oh ohhh, oh yeah
Ohhh, ohh, I'm a boss
