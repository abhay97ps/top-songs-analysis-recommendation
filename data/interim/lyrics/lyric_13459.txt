Slippin' away
Silently we took the night
He pulled the shades
Locking out the neon lights
The room was dark
Our shadows danced in perfect time
I held on
To what was for this moment mine
We're on the edge
Reachin' the point of no return
Caught in a web, daring to touch
Is it the love of the danger
Or the danger of the love
You know I'm not afraid of your night moves
You know I'm not afraid of your night moves
Dangerous games we play
But you know I'm not afraid
Secret ways
Always having to pretend
We play the game
Outraged innocence
Stealin' away
Silently into the night
Separate ways
Strangers in the mornin' light
We're on the edge
Reachin' the point of no return
Caught in a web, daring to touch
Is it the love of the danger
Or the danger of the love
You know I'm not afraid of your night moves
You know I'm not afraid of your night moves
Dangerous games we play
But you know I'm not afraid
You know I'm not afraid of your night moves
You know I'm not afraid of your night moves
Dangerous games we play
But you know I'm not afraid
You know I'm not afraid of your night moves
You know I'm not afraid
You know I'm not afraid of your night moves
You know I'm not afraid
You know I'm not afraid of your night moves
You know I'm not afraid...
