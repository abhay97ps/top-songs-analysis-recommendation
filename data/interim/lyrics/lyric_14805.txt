Gentlemen, let's broaden our minds!
Lawrence
All hail the new king in town
Young and old, gather around
Yeah
Black and white, red and green
Funky
The funkiest man you've ever seen
Tell you what his name is
Partyman, partyman
Rock a party like nobody can
Rules and regulations - no place in his nation
Partyman, partyman
Party people - say it now:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Somebody holla if you want to party
"Ladies and gentlemen, no pictures, please!"
Get it up, oh yeah
Partyman, partyman
Get it up, get it up
"Ooh, I love purple"
I rock the party, I rock the house
I rock the whole world, north, east and south
In the west:  seventeen horns blowing
Partyman, partyman
Get it up
All hail the new king in town
Ain't nothing but a muffin
We got to lot to butter to go
And if it break when it bend
You better not put it in - uh
Giddy up 
Partyman
Partyman
Partyman

Partyman
Young and old, gather around
Everybody hail the new king in town
