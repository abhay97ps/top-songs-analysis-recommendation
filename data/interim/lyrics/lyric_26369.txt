Ol' Sunoco Charlie drives an '87 Harley
Sells gasoline and what you drink 8 to 3 AM
Got a tattoo for the Corps and ex wife number four
Hummin' along, schoolin' you on the songs on his station
He could be another one cussin' the government, nah, but he smiles
Got hundred reasons not to, but he's the poster child for
Happy is as happy does
Grab a six string, find a rope swing
Hang a palm tree in your truck
Drink a beer just because
Steal a slow dance in a rain storm
And a kiss from who you love
Laugh and live with a half-full cup
Yeah, happy is as happy does
Some find it in the scripture or a Polaroid picture
Or flip a coin, heads, you're goin' to Tucson, Arizona
But it damn sure ain't in the lookin' back on the stuff you never did
Sometimes, you're gonna feel that, but life is better when
Happy is as happy does
Grab a six string, find a rope swing
Hang a palm tree in your truck
Drink a beer just because
Steal a slow dance in a rain storm
And a kiss from who you love
Laugh and live with a half-full cup
'Cause happy is as happy does
She's a long way from the old her
In this mountain dive in Boulder
Every pickle jar, crinkled dollar
Takes her another mile high
Happy is as happy does
Grab a six string, find a rope swing
Hang a palm tree in your truck
Drink a beer just because
Steal a slow dance in a rain storm
And a kiss from who you love
Laugh and live with a half-full cup
When it's all black clouds, find the sun
'Cause happy is as happy does
Happy is as happy does
Laugh and live with a half-full cup
