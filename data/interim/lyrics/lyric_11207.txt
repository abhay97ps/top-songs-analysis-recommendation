I just can't pretend no more, I keep running out of lies
Loving you is killing me inside
Every time I find the words to end it, something in your eyes won't let it
Shandi, tonight must last us forever, forever we say goodnight and go home
But you know me very well, and I know you, you can't tell me goodnight
We've been holding on so tight, we're afraid to let it go
Shake it loose, we both could use the ride
Here's another mess I got myself in, and when you touch me you ain't helping
