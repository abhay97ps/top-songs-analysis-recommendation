Huh, well
Talkin' 'bout love
Love
Talkin' 'bout sweet sweet love
All over the world
Spread it all over the world
Hey
Mmm, yeah
Come on, y'all, let's get together
Let's, let's sing for love
Listen
Love is the key to life
The thing that makes it right
Why we can't be one I'll never know, no, no, no
Love is the key this time
And there's know doubt in my mind
If you really wanna be free
Love is the key
Love is the key, that's so real
It's the kind of thing you can feel
We can make things nice if we let it be, oh
Love is the key, you know I'm right
Oh, it makes you feel so dynamite
If you really want to be free 
You can believe love is the key
Come on, come on, come on
Alright, alright
Oh, love is the key to life
The thing that makes it right
Why we can't be one I'll never know
Love is the key, I know I'm right
Oh, it makes you feel so dynamite
If you really want to be free
You can believe love is the key
If you really want to be free
You can believe love is the key
If you really want to be free
You can believe love is the key
If you really want to be free
You can believe love is the key
If you really want to be free
You can believe love is the key
