Something?s got me upside down
And I never been like this before
Something?s got me goin? in and out
And I never moved like this before
Something?s glowin? ?round my eyes
And I never looked like this before 
Something?s brought this girl to life
And I never felt like this before
And I?m sure that was something that happened to me

And I never opened up before 
Something?s got me mystified 
And I never lost my cool before

And I never lost like this before 
Something?s got a hold of me
And I never  touched like this before
And I know that was never is happening to me
