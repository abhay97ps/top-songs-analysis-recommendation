A man can walk proudly
Down in the street
A man's not ashamed of what he believes
He knows how to laugh
He knows when to cry
He knows it's best to live
He's afraid to die
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
A man searches
For the key to success
He'd rather be sure
Than take a wild guess
He knows how to love
He knows how to hate
He knows when to move
He knows just when to wait
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
A man can be angry
And still hold his tongue
A man don't give up
Till the battle is won
He knows how to win
He's not ashamed to lose
He knows his destiny
Is his alone to choose
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
Just what is a man?
