Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign car driving dude with the road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone
Some beach, somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and a warm breezes a blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere
I circled the parking lot trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of nowhere a Mercedes Benz
Came cruising up and whipped right in
Some beach, somewhere
There's nowhere to go when you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot señioritas smiling with long dark hair
On some beach, somewhere
I sat in that waiting room
It seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said doc's ready for you
You’re not going to feel a thing we'll give you some Novocain
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb
Some beach, somewhere
There's a beautiful sunset burning up that atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing
In the salty evening air
On some beach, somewhere
On some beach, somewhere
