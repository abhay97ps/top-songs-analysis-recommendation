Hook:
Light-speed, isn't quick enough
Even then I can't be everywhere at once
I can't get enough
Of these bright things
Addicted to the wisdom and the knowledge that this life brings
It's a sight to see
When you look back and your past is just a blurry scene
A result of your thirst for dreams
My urgent needs are catchin up with me
Take time to slow down, and just feel the breeze
Verse 1:
I keep runnin like I'm bein chased by somethin
But you'd never know that viewin me through your assumptions
I lose gumption livin up to my own expectations
Build anticipation for my train to come into its station
But it falls off the track, any time my thoughts turn black
So I smack them back and practice that
Like whackin a mole back in its hole I can't be taxed
Or tolled, when I'm maxin out on my goals
Matter of fact what's passed as fact is old
I'm actin out to break molds
A quitter never wins, a winner never quits
A rapper's life is picked by the words that he picks to spit
You can live fast, or you can live slow
Either way you gotta get it as you go so
Pick a pace, roll with it, give it everything put your soul in it
Get bold with it, take hold of it
Make gold of every scene Chris Nolan-it
You can live your life quick like lightning
But the truth is
Hook:
Light-speed, isn't quick enough
Even then I can't be everywhere at once
I can't get enough
Of these bright things
Addicted to the wisdom and the knowledge that this life brings
It's a sight to see
When you look back and your past is just a blurry scene
A result of your thirst for dreams
My urgent needs are catchin up with me
Take time to slow down, and just feel the breeze
Verse 2:
Unclear coal-concepts to defined diamond dreams
The pressure that I go through just clarifies what I see
Yea I'm movin through the Millennium I'm a Falcon on this beat
My plans just sprouted wings no more travelin on my feet
Now I'm up, up, up in the air, sparklin and flowin like a cup of Perrier
I run, run, run really rare cause I'm runnin as a cub with the strength of a bear
Was runnin like a hairy hare oh so scared, now it's all au contraire
I Dare to wear my heart bare see the world through sound
But no Devil when I stare
A rock will break under the force of a water drop
The catch is that the drop can never stop or switch its spot
So find a rock you want to break and take it to the top
No matter what you've gotta give it all you've got
So look around, look within, gather up a team and hook em in
Read a book or ten, do somethin new, I don't care what you do
You just gotta be you
I chose sprinting over crawlin on my knees
But still I gotta remember to feel the breeze cause
Hook:
Light-speed, isn't quick enough
Even then I can't be everywhere at once
I can't get enough
Of these bright things
Addicted to the wisdom and the knowledge that this life brings
It's a sight to see
When you look back and your past is just a blurry scene
A result of your thirst for dreams
My urgent needs are catchin up with me
Take time to slow down, and just feel the breeze
Verse 3:
Ace in the hole when I drive my dreams I follow through
And if I don't get the green I need, I'll chip and follow too
All in the chips are out straight-flushed the doubt and followed suit
Beat the house and left mine too, got a condo, bought a new
Microphone now I'm likin home, might not condone, another place to roam
Down right getting crazy vocals spike when I write in a frightful tone
Then I bring it back, elastic strap, gotta know when to defend and attack
There's a time for that, and a time for this, a time to rap
And a time to sit
Really life is just each person's path to find the truth
Each person's path is peppered with prices of path-abuse
Abuse your path and your path abuses you
That's the price you pay for laughin at the path that chooses you
So choose right, give it a little time
Mix it let it sizzle in the skillet of your mind
Really it's a riddle that's really a little dry
But hidden in the middle is a really different life
If you find it, be sure to live it wisely, take time to feel the breeze
If you choose to live at light-speed
