One boy, one special boy
One boy to go with, to talk with and walk with
One boy, that's the way it should be
One boy, one certain boy
One boy to laugh with, to joke with, have Coke with
One boy, not two or three
One day you'll find out
This is what life is all about
You'll need someone who
Is living just for you-ou
One boy, one steady boy
One boy to be with for ever and ever
One boy, that's the way it should be
That's the way it should be
That's the way it should be
