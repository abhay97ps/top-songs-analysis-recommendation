They say he likes a good time 
He comes alive at midnight 
My mama doesn't trust him 
He's only here for one thing, but 
Yeah, a little bit older, a black leather jacket
A bad reputation, insatiable habits
He was onto me, one look and I couldn't breathe, yeah
I said, if he kissed me, I might let it happen 
I swear on my life that I've been a good girl 
Tonight, I don't wanna be her
They say he likes a good time 
He comes alive at midnight 
My mama doesn't trust him 
He's only here for one thing, but 
Look, I'm the type to make her turn on her daddy 
DaBaby make her forget what she learned from her daddy
I don't be tripping on lil' shawty, I let her do whatever she please
I don't be kissing on lil' shawty, she don't be kissing on me either
She came with you, then left with me
I went up a point, let's call it even 
Don't like the car she in, gon' end up buyin' her a new Bimmer 
That girl know what she want, she make me take it off when she see me 
She say I make her wet whenever my face pop up on TV
I had to say, "No disrespect, gotta do it safe or you can keep it"
Pop star, I'm fresh up out the trap and I'm going Bieber
She know I'm a call away, she can drop a pin and I'd come meet her
Stand next to me, you gon' end up catchin' a fever 
I'm hot
I swear on my life that I've been a good girl 
Tonight, I don't wanna be her
They say he likes a good time 
He comes alive at midnight 
My mama doesn't trust him 
He's only here for one thing, but 
My, my, my, my, my oh my
My mama doesn't trust you, baby
My, my, my, my, my oh my
And my daddy doesn't know you, no
My, my, my, my, my oh my 
My, my, my, my, my oh my 
They say he likes a good time 
He comes alive at midnight 
My mama doesn't trust him 
He's only here for one thing, but
