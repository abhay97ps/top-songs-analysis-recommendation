Tay Keith, this too hard 
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
I don't got a heart, but fuck it, I'm paid
Lil A beat a body, he fresh out the cage
I'm still the same nigga from minimum wage
They tryna keep up, so they stalkin' my page
They do what I say, they tryna get saved
They line up for me like they coppin' the J's
I told her get right, start acting your age
Can't believe you tried it, bitch, you played
Wanted a diamond choker, soon as her time was over, bitch, you played
She wanna ride the Rover, told her her Uber was closer, bitch, you crazy
She tried to show out in public, I cut the bitch off like it's nothin', bitch, you played
She must've thought I was stupid, I knew she was fuckin' my cousin 
I don't got a cold, I'm sipping on Hi-Tech
A deuce of that yellow, I'm straight out the projects
The first nigga played with me, he got shot at
A hundred some shots flipped the car, that's a car wreck
I really don't need to be speaking on that 
But fuck it, you know how I be when I get 
High off the motherfuckin' medicals 
Get in the booth and go federal 
They copy my style, I had to go get that 
Like, boy, give my motherfuckin' shit back
She wanna chill, but this ain't no kickback 
Pass her to my teammate, I assist that
Straight to the jet, then I'm gone 
Land in a new timezone 
All the hoes pressed, niggas lookin' stressed
They can't accept that I'm on 
I don't got a heart, but fuck it, I'm paid
Lil A beat a body, he fresh out the cage
I'm still the same nigga from minimum wage
They tryna keep up, so they stalkin' my page
They do what I say, they tryna get saved
They line up for me like they coppin' the J's
I told her get right, start acting your age
Can't believe you tried it, bitch, you played
Wanted a diamond choker, soon as her time was over, bitch, you played 
She wanna ride the Rover, told her her Uber was closer, bitch, you crazy 
She tried to show out in public, I cut the bitch off like it's nothin', bitch, you played 
She must've thought I was stupid, I knew she was fuckin' my cousin, bitch, you played
She out here wildin'
Tellin' her friends I'm buyin' her, flyin' her, bitch, you childish
I never mind 'em
I'm getting mine, I'm one of the flyest, got no stylist
Pop my shit, Rolls truck my driveway
Racks like books, I ain't been to no college
VS my teeth, I come through smilin'
Brand new Lam', we come through wildin'
Couldn't get it up, now this shit just pilin'
Everybody drip, turn the hood to an island
Last name rich, first name not Roddy
That ain't my hit, can't claim that body
That ain't my ho, damn sure ain't my side bitch
Wish I would take lil' ho shopping
Soon as I do it, this foreign'll copy
Still in the hood, I can never get cocky
I don't got a heart, but fuck it, I'm paid
Lil A beat a body, he fresh out the cage
I'm still the same nigga from minimum wage
They tryna keep up, so they stalkin' my page
They do what I say, they tryna get saved
They line up for me like they coppin' the J's
I told her get right, start acting your age
Can't believe you tried it, bitch, you played
Wanted a diamond choker, soon as her time was over, bitch, you played

She tried to show out in public, I cut the bitch off like it's nothin', bitch, you played
She must've thought I was stupid, I knew she was fuckin' my cousin
Bitch, you played
