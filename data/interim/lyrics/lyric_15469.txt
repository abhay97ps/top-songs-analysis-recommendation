Tell me what's wrong with you now
Tell me why I
Never seem to make you happy
Though heaven knows I try
What does it take to please you?
Tell me just how
I can satisfy you, baby
You're driving me wild
Break up to make up
That's all we do
First you love me, then you hate me
That's a game for fools
When I come home from working
You're on the phone
Talking about how bad I treat you
Now tell me I'm wrong
You say it's me who argues
I'll say it's you
We have got to get together
Or baby, we're through
