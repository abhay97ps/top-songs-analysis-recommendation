Diamond rings, pearls and things
Trips in December
Things we do for love
Fancy cars, the credit cards
Do you remember?
Things we do for love
Romantic places in my mind
Hoping someday I would find the perfect one
And I could share
And then that day you walked inside
And no longer could I hide my love
I had to take you there
Sailing on a cruise at night
Gaze into the ocean under moonlight
Taking you to paradise
OOOOHHHHHHHH, YEAH! YEAH!
Diamond rings, pearls and things
Trips in December
Things we do for love
Fancy cars, the credit cards
Do you remember?
Things we do for love
I showered you with gifts of love
But it was never enough
To bring you closer to me
Tricking money was no thing
The simple pleasure that you bring my way
Takes me back to the day we were
Sailing on a cruise at night
Gazing to the ocean under moonlight
Taking you to paradise
OOOOHHHHHHHH, YEAH! YEAH!
Diamond rings, pearls and things
Trips in December
Things we do for love
Fancy cars, the credit cards
Do you remember?
Things we do for love
