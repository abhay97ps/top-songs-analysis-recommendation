Baby, baby you're no good
Never treat me like a lover should
And I know in the end
You're gonna leave me, my friend
But I go on, oh, when you kiss me
And I go on when you hug me
You're gonna break my heart, I know
And if I played it smart I'd go
But I'm so wild, wild about you baby
Baby, baby every day
I take my mind up and away
But I find love is blind
One kiss and I change my mind
Yes, I go wild, when you kiss me
And I go wild, oh, when you hug me
Because I love you so, I try
But if you ever go I'd die
But I'm so wild, wild about you baby
Yay, yay, yay
Oh, I'm oh, you drive me crazy
Can't think of anything, I'm a wild
