Your baby loves you now so don't make her blue now
You'd better start bein' true now I'm telling you why
Because if you break her heart somebody's gonna come along
And he'll steal her away from you somebody like me
Let me tell you friend I'm not botherin'
But I think it's such a sin if you don't treat her right
Because if you break her heart...
She wants to be held tight now each and every night now
You'd better treat her right now I'm telling you why
Because if you break her heart somebody's gonna come along
And he'll steal her away from you somebody like me
I hope you listen to now each word that I've told you now
Please friend you'd better do now and you won't have alone
Because if you break her heart somebody's gonna come along
And he'll steal her away from you somebody like me
Will steal her away somebody like me...
