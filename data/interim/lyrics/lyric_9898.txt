Doodle-oo-do etc...
Every new day she's a shining sun
Where the waters flow where the rivers run
Every new road that I walk along
I can see your face and tries it really strong
But all I do know is I love you
And I want you to be happy
All I know is I love you true
And I want you to be happy
Every new smile that I see so wide
Keeps reminding me of a new-born child
And every new room that I come into
I can see your face, baby no mistake
But all I do know is I love you
And I want you to be happy
All I know is I love you true
And I want you to be happy
Doodle-oo-do etc...
Every new moon I see that's shining up above
Makes me think of you, you are the one I love
Every new star burning in the skies
Gonna fill my need make me testify
But all I do know is I love you
And I want you to be happy
Yeah all I know is I love you true
And I want you to be happy
Doodle-oo-do etc...
