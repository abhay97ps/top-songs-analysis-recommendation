Devil you
When will you ever learn
I said now devil you
Someday you're gonna burn
Devil you
You never ever come home
All the time you spend wandering you might as well be on your own
I said now devil you
You were my one desire
I said now devil you
You used to light my fire
Devil you, we can't go on this way
Always gone in the night
I never see you in the day
And all the morning's when I'm sleeping sound
You knock knock knock knock knock knock
Till the door falls down
And all the men you hang around with
Now Devil you
Devil you
What you do
Devil you you're really into sin
If you tell them all somebody's gonna turn you in
And all the morning's when I'm sleeping sound
You knock knock knock knock knock knock
Till the door falls down
And all the men you hang around with
Now Devil you
Devil You
What you do
