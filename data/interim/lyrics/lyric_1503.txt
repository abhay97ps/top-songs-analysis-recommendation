She just got here yesterday
Things are hot here now, they say;
There's a big change in town
Gals are jealous, there's no doubt;
Still, the fellows rave about
Sweet, sweet Georgia Brown!
And ever since she came
The colored folks all claim, "Say,"
No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown
Two left feet, oh, so neat
Has Sweet Georgia Brown!
They all sigh, and want to die
For Sweet Georgia Brown!
I'll tell you just why
You know I don't lie, not much:
It's been said
She knocks 'em dead
When she lands in town!
Since she came
Why it's a shame
How she cools them down!
Fellows she can't get
Are fellows she ain't met!
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her
Sweet Georgia Brown!
No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown
Two left feet, oh, so neat
Has Sweet Georgia Brown!
They all sigh, and want to die
For Sweet Georgia Brown!
I'll tell you just why
You know I don't lie; not much:
All those gifts some courters give
To Sweet Georgia Brown
They buy clothes at fashion shows
With one dollar down
Oh, boy! Tip your hat!
Oh, joy! She's the cat!
Who's that, Mister?
'Tain't a sister!
Sweet Georgia Brown!
