Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Oh, honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off of me
Oh, Honey when you knock on my door
Ooh I gave you my key
Ooh Ohh
Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Ooh ooh
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Ohhhh oh
I gave you my heart
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
And nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us
And now it's up to us babe
Ooh, I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh, you put the sparks to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights
Ohh Ohh
Nobody knows it
But, when I was down
I was your clown
Ohh Ohh
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Ohhhhh oh
I gave you my heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Oooh Ohh
I gave you my heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my heart
Oooh Ooooh
