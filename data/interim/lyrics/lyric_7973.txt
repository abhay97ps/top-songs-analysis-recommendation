If loneliness surrounds you
And rain clouds always hang around you
And wakin up each day gets you down 
And if the life that youre leading
Seems hollow, then maybe what youre needing
Is someone to turn your world around
 Come take my hand and walk with me 
 Let me teach you how to smile
 And Ill show you skies where gentle breezes blow
 Yeah, hey
And Ill take you where peaceful waters flow 
If you let me Ill take you where peaceful waters flow
 Mmm, hmm
Now if the sunshine hurts your eyes, boy
Then its time for you to realize, boy
Beyond this moment theres
A better day , mmm, hmm 
And if you let me
Ill guide you, mmm
Ill always be there, right there beside you
Reaching every step of your way
 Come take my hand and walk with me awhile
 Yeah, hey, hey
 Let me teach you how to smile
And Ill show you skies  where gentle breezes blow
 Hey, yeah, hey, hey, hey
And Ill take you where peaceful waters flow 
Hey, hey, if you trust me, Ill take you there where peaceful waters flow
 Mmm...hmm...
