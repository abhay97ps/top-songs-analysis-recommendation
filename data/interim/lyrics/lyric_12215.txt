I learned when I was a young boy
You turn your cheek you get slapped
I take the punches I can't slip
And I give it right back
Even if I win girl, you know it really won't mean too much
What I want baby most of all is the only thing I can't touch
If I give you my heart would you love me forever
Would you pick up the pieces if I stumble and fall
If my world falls apart could you keep it together
If I can't have you I don't want no one at all
Just because I'm so quiet
Just because I don't cry
The hardest lesson to learn girl
Is how to take it inside
There's leather and jewels to soothe me
But it really isn't what I need
There's an aching hurt inside of me
And it's the kind of thing you don't see
If I give you my heart would you love me forever
Would you pick up the pieces if I stumble and fall
If my world falls apart could you keep it together
If I can't have you I don't want no one at all
Now the years are unwinding
But I still feel the hurt
I've been fighting my whole life
For the privilege to work
Now I've stopped and looked around me
There's nobody left to blame
If I don't have you to hold me girl
All of my work's in vain
If I give you my heart would you love me forever
Would you pick up the pieces if I stumble and fall
If my world falls apart could you keep it together
If I can't have you I don't want no one at all
