Baby, I'm back
And right away I thought I'd come to you
To see if the love that we knew before
Has passed the test of time
Time, that changes almost everything
Can sometimes let us see the better side
If the feelings we once shared
Let's go 'round again
Maybe we'll turn back the hands of time
Let's go 'round again
One more time
Baby, I know that you think
I will be different now
Inside of me nothing has changed
So, I'm asking you again, please
There's no one else that could have brought me back
And no one that ever could set me free
From the memory I kept within my heart
