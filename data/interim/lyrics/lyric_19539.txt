Im in a spin
Im giving in
Im living in a daydream
When I saw u ur smile shone through
& touched me like a sunbeam
Im inside out
Im crazy about the way u make my 3 feel
Im head over heels
Im fallin more each day
How did you know I've been waiting to touch you and tell you how I feel?
I'm walking on clouds
I'm spellbound about you
I can't believe you're real
How did you know I've been thinking about you and dreaming of your kiss?
How did you know?
How did you know?
I'm in a spin, I'm giving in
I'm living in a daydream when I saw you, your smile shone through and touched me like a sunbeam
I'm inside out
I'm crazy about the way you make my heart feel
I'm head over heels
I'm falling more each day...
How did you know
I've been waiting to touch you and tell you how I feel?
I'm walking on clouds
I'm spellbound about you
I can't believe you're real
How did you know I've been thinking about you, and dreaming of your kiss?
How did you know?
