I saw a friend as I walked down the street
He said "Let's sit down
Get a load off our feet"
We found a table inside a cafe
I smiled as we ordered and wondered what he had to say
He said "I'm sorry
I just found out"
I asked him what he was talking about
He said it's no secret 
We've all heard the news
You're taking it great
You don't even look like you're blue
Why, oh, why was I the last one to know?
Thought our love would do nothing but grow
It's all over town
I was the last one to know 
I left my friend and walked out on the street
My head had been high
Now I looked at my feet
My friends all look sad 
As I passed them on by
My friends were all sad
I was the last to know why 
Why, oh, why was I the last one to know?
Thought our love would do nothing but grow
It's all over town
I was the last one to know 
Mmmmm to know 
Mmmmm to know 
Mmmmm to know
