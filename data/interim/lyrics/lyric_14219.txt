My family's saying you're the kind I can do without
They think I'm too young
To know what love is all about
I guess they love me
And they're just trying to help
But sometimes I'm better off with no advice
Don't they see the tears I'm crying
Are oh, so real
No one can understand
Cause no one knows the way I feel
How can I forget you
When you make me feel so fine
How can I forget you
'Cause when I close my eyes
You're all I see
I go on dreaming
Every night I make a wish
That maybe someday
We can make a life out on our own
It'd be so easy to run away with you
I'm getting so confused
I need to spend some time alone
Don't they see the tears I'm crying
Are oh, so real
No one can understand
Cause no one knows the way I feel
How can I forget you
When you make me feel so fine
How can I forget you
'Cause when I close my eyes
You're all I see
Don't they see the tears I'm crying
Are oh, so real
No one can understand
Cause no one knows the way I feel
How can I forget you
When you make me feel so fine
How can I forget you
'Cause when I close my eyes
You're all I see
