All of the ladies attending the ball
Are requested to gaze
In the faces found on the dance cards
Please then remember and don't get too close
To one special one
He will take your defenses and run
So we change partners
Time to change partners
You must change partners
Again
This is how most of our ladies grew up
At the country club dances
They learned how to handle the boys
Gently but firmly, they learned to say no
There were four more young men
Who were waiting in the color and the noise
So we change partners
Time to change partners
You must change partners
Again
All of the ladies attending the ball
Are requested to gaze
In the faces found on the dance cards
Please then remember and follow your list
Cause the dear things get hurt
And the broken hearts make you feel hard
So we change partners
Time to change partners
You must change partners
Again
