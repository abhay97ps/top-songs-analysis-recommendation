Had myself a tall one
Waitin' at the bar
Wasn't gonna leave here
'Til I had her in the car
Moon was growing bright
Stars were standing still
Waiting for my baby
In the cold December chill
I been achin'
From desire
Blood runnin' like a ragin' river
But her heart's on fire
Couldn't write a letter
'Cause I don't know what to say
Couldn't write a song
'Cause I don't know what to play
Come a little closer
Better hold me tight
Gonna roll on down the highway
And rock on with my baby all night
