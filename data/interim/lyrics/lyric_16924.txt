Where have you gone, my Rosealia?
Into the crowd, he'll never find ya
If you walk real fast
And you stay down low
So many times, so many chances, this one could be your last
You say no, no, no, the fighting has left you tired
You say no, no, no, but the fighting goes on
Put on your mask, wearing your cape
Put on your mask, my Rosealia
Put on your mask, wearing your cape
Put on your mask, my Rosealia
What has he done, my se√±orita?
His kind of love is going to kill ya
Do you fake a smile
When you dodge the blows?
So many times, so many chances, this one could be your last
You say no, no, no, the fighting has left you tired
You say no, no, no, but the hurting goes on
Put on your mask, wearing your cape
Put on your mask, my Rosealia
Put on your mask, wearing your cape
Put on your mask, my Rosealia
Jealousy can rip your heart out
And jealousy can turn a hand into a fist
You say no, no, no, the fighting has left you tired
You say no, no, no, but the fighting goes on
Put on your mask, wearing your cape
Put on your mask, my Rosealia
Put on your mask, wearing your cape
Put on your mask, my Rosealia
Put on your mask
Wearing your cape, hey hey
Put on your mask
Wearing your cape
My Rosealia
My Rosealia
