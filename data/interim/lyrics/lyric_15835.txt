Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free
Brother and sister together we'll make it through
Some day a spirit will lift you and take you there
I know you've been hurting
But I've been there waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out whenever I can
'Cause
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
We all are a family that should stand together as one
Helping each other instead of just wasting time
Now is the moment to reach out to someone
It's all up to you
When everyone's sharing their hope
Then love will win through
'Cause
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
