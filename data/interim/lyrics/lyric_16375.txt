I've been miles from nowhere crossed and doubled back
Time is a healer and i've done my time

Tomorrow's comin' and you'll never know
The love that you lost may be found

People tellin' me to let her go
Don't let it turn you around
Tomorrow's comin' and you'll never know

I've been miles from nowhere
Crossed and doubled back
Time is a healer And I've done my time
No, I ain't seen love like that
No, I ain't seen love like that
So many faces, 
No one compares
I ain't seen love like that 
Ain't seen love 
No I ain't
