First time i felt it
I think I was five years old
I was scared, had a nightmare
Mama was there for me to hold
Daddy he was different
He never said it much
But I heard him loud and clear
When he brought home that ball and glove
And it took on a brand new meaning
I wasn't just a boy no more
When she moved in next door...
Where you from?
What's your name?
Wanna go to my game?
Got the keys to my dad's old truck
Turn the radio on
Still remember the song
We held hands and there it was
Love....
The page just kept on turning
There i was with someone else
First time in my life time
I wasn't livin for myself
I knew i wasn't fallin
Anywhere I fell before
This place was different
It was deeper it was more...
Then it took on a brand new meaning
Yeah it was strong and it was true
Knew what I had to do...
Found a ring
Hit my knees
Couldn't talk
Couldn't breathe...
My heart had me all choked up
Said "I do,"
As we cried
Wedding bells
Waved good bye
The whole church knew it was
Love....
Then it took on a brand new meaning
When the docter said "It's time to watch your miracle arrive."
Thank the Lord
Cut the cord
Take her home
Help her grow
And complete the circle of
Love......
