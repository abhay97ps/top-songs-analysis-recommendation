Ooh...
La de la de la
La de la de la
Ooh... Ooh...
Talkin' to you on the phone
I like the way you talk to me
And that little girly voice
I've gotten to know you
And you might be sublime
I've always wanted a girl like you
Darling, that's no lie
Love me for life
Oh, I wish that you'd be mine
And only mine
It feels so right
And won't you tell me right now
Will you be my girl
Ooh...
La de la de la
La de la de la
Whoa, whoa...
These last few days have been
Beautiful and bright
I want you to be part of my life
It work out fine
Never imagined
That you would feel for me
'Cause I thought that I was the only one
Who fell this way
Love me for life
Oh, I wish that you'd be mine
And only mine
It feels so right
And won't you tell me right now
Will you be my girl
Tell me who's gonna my day seem brighter
If you're gone, if you're gone
Love me for life
Oh, I wish that you'll be my lady, my lady
I love you, girl
It feels so right
And won't you tell me right now
Will you be my girl
