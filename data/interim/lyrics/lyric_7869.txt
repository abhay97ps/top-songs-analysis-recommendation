I can't sleep nights, wishing you were here beside me
Can't help feeling that's the way it ought to be
You know we could run away
But I couldn't bear to hear the things they'd say, oh no
Baby, let's pretend that tonight could live forever
If we close our eyes and believe, it might come true
Baby, let's pretend we could always be together
But for now just let me spend the night with you
Somehow, someday, things are gonna be so different
Don't cry, someway I promise it'll be alright
So now that we're all alone
I couldn't bear to leave and take you home, oh no
Baby, let's pretend that tonight could live forever
If we close our eyes and believe, it might come true
Baby, let's pretend we could always live together
But for now just let me spend the night with you
So take me now, my love can't wait
We're almost there now, darlin', darlin'
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Baby, let's pretend that tonight could live forever
If we close our eyes and believe, it might come true
Baby, let's pretend we could always live together
But for now just let me spend the night with you
Baby, let's pretend that tonight could live forever
If we close our eyes and believe, it might come true
Baby, let's pretend we could always be together
But for now just let me spend the night with you
