Ladies and Gentlemen, the golden age of rock and roll...
Everybody hazy, shell-shocked and crazy
Screaming for the face at the window
Jeans for the genies, dresses for the dreamies
Fighting for a place in the front row
Ohhh, Ohhh, Ohhh
Ohhh, Ohhh, let's go
Well you getta little buzz, send for the fuzz
Guitars getting higher and higher
The dude in the paint thinks he's gonna faint
Stoke more coke on the fire
Ohhh, Ohhh, Ohhh
Ohhh, Ohhh, Whoooa
The golden age of rock and roll will never die
As long as children feel the need to laugh and cry
Don't wanna smash - want a smash sensation
Don't wanna wreck - just recreation
Don't wanna fight - but if you turn us down
We're gonna turn you around gonna mess with the sound
The show's gotta move, everybody groove
There ain't no trouble on the streets now
So if the going gets rough
Don't you blame us
You ninety-six decible freaks
Ohhh, Ohhh, Ohhh
Ohhh, Ohhh, Whoooa
Ohhh, Ohhh, Ohhh
Ohhh, Ohhh, Whoooa
Ohhh, Ohhh, Whoooa
Ohhh, Ohhh, Ohhh
Ohhh, Ohhh, Whoooa
Ohhh, Ohhh, Whoooa
That's all
