You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this cryin', nobody's gonna
Heal me if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out 
Get down, get down, get down, get down 
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now
'Cause all I ever wanted was love
Hey yeah, hey yeah 
Hey yeah, hey yeah 
Hey yeah, hey yeah
All I ever wanted was love
Hey yeah, hey yeah 
Hey yeah, hey yeah 
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah 
I want your stupid love, love
I want your stupid love, love
Now, it's time to free me from the shame
I gotta find that peace, is it too late or
Could this love protect me from the pain?
I would battle for you 
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out 
Get down, get down, get down, get down 
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now
'Cause all I ever wanted was love
Hey yeah, hey yeah 
Hey yeah, hey yeah 
Hey yeah, hey yeah
All I ever wanted was love
Hey yeah, hey yeah 
Hey yeah, hey yeah 
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah 
I want your stupid love, love
I want your stupid love, love
I don't need a reason 
Not sorry, I want your stupid love
I don't need a reason 
Not sorry, I want your stupid love
Hey yeah, hey yeah
I want your stupid love, love 
We got a stupid love, love 
I want your stupid love, love
I want your stupid love, love
