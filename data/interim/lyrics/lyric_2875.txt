I'm packing up my memories
And I'm gonna move
On out of your heart
Turning in my keys
And I'm gonna move
On out of your heart
Cause there ain't
Room enough for two
And sharing your heart
With someone new
Will never do
It's getting mighty crowded
I'm telling you
It's getting mighty crowded
Gonna take these dreams of mine
And I'm gonna move
On out of your life
Stop wasting my time
And I'm gonna move
On out of your life
Cause there ain't
Room enough for three
In dreams that were
Made for you and me
And so you see
It's getting mighty crowded
It's too crowded for me
It's getting mighty crowded
I'm saving you the trouble
Of putting me down
Start on the double, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna shop around
Find myself another heart
Where I can live all by myself
Gonna find myself a heart
I don't have to share with nobody else
Cause you didn't treat me
Like you should
And sticking around this neighborhood
Is just no good
It's getting mighty crowded
It's too crowded for me
It's getting mighty crowded
I'm packing up my memories
It's getting mighty crowded
It's too crowded for me
It's getting mighty crowded, mm hmm
It's getting might crowded
