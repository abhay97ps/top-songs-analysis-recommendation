Tell me why
It always has to end
It seems the loving is over
Before it ever begins
It happens every time
My heart gets in the way
And now you're blowing my mind
I just can't find my way, lady
And if you see me crying
Just touch my hand
Don't pass me by
Cause girl, I am trying to find you
I need you, lady
Cause girl, I am searching for you
And will you help me find my way?
And girl, I am searching for you
And will you kindly show your face?
Girl, I am searching for you
My heart is crying more and more
You know what I'm searching for
A love that will last, last forever more
Please tell me why it has to take so long
To find a special lover with a heart made of gold
You know I need you now
I just can't take anymore
You touched my lonely heart, girl
You know that you got the cure, lady
And if you see me crying
Just touch my hand
Don't pass me by
Cause girl, I am trying to find you
I need you, lady
And if you see me crying
Just touch my hand
Don't pass me by
Cause girl, I am trying to find you
I need you, lady
Girl, I am searching for you
Will you help me find my way?
Girl, I am searching for you
And will you kindly show your face?
Girl, I am searching for you
My heart is crying more and more
You know what I'm searching for
A love that will last
Last forever more
Girl, I am searching for you
Girl, I am searching for you
Girl, I am searching for you
Girl, I am searching for you
Girl, I am searching for your love
