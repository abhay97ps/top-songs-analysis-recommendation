One
Baby I'm waiting
One
Baby I'm waiting
Baby I'm waiting
Baby I'm waiting
I'm waiting
One more night show me things that I never knew
This night it felt right to be near you
One more night give me all I want and some more
Oh Baby I'm waiting
Oh Baby I'm waiting
Some thing in your eyes told me to stay
I don't know where
I'm sayin' goodbye
But this day makes me sad
Oh baby I do
One more night this time
I hold your body very close to mine
You make me feel the tenderness you have inside of you
So tell me the reason why
This one more night
Show me things that I never knew
This night it felt right to be near you
One more night give me all I want and some more
One more night show me things that I never knew
This night it felt right to be near you
One more night give me all I want and some more
Oh Baby I'm waiting
Oh Baby I'm waiting
Oh Baby I'm waiting
Oh Baby I'm waiting
Oh Baby I'm waiting
Oh Baby I'm waiting
Yeah yeah yeah
I won't say goodbye
To hear your heart beat close to mine
Caught up in your magic and your passion
Oh baby I see why
One more night
Show me things that I never knew
This night it felt right to be near you
One more night give me all I want and some more
One more night show me things that I never knew
This night it felt right to be near you
One more night give me all I want and some more
Oh Baby I'm waiting
Oh Baby I'm waiting
Oh Baby I'm waiting
Oh Baby I'm waiting
Oh Baby I'm waiting
Oh Baby I'm waiting
Yeah yeah yeah
