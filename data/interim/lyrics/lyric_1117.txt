Lonesome number one
Just call me lonesome number one
Although no titles have I won
Surely must be lonesome number one
Every love I've had has faded like a dew
And every one I wanted has wanted someone new
Heartaches hang around and always come
Surely must be lonesome number one
Lonesome number one
Just call me lonesome number one
Although no titles have I won
Surely must be lonesome number one
Seems I'm always losing love just won't come near
Just when love gets close it always disappears
Sorrow always keeps me on the run
Surely must be lonesome number one
Lonesome number one
Just call me lonesome number one
Although no titles have I won
Surely must be lonesome number one
Surely must be lonesome number one
