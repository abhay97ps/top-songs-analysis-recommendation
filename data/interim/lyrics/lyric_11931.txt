Sing a simple song
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ooh baby
And it takes me there
I'm talkin' talkin' talkin' talkin', talking in my sleep
I'm walkin' walkin' walkin' walkin' walkin' in the street
Times are passing
I grow older
Things are happening fast
All I have to hold onto
Is a simple song that lasts
Let me hear you say
Ya, ya ya ya ya
Let me hear you say
Ya, ya ya ya ya
Hah hah hah hah hah
Sing a simple song
Try a little do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do
Do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do
Do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm livin' livin' livin' life with all its ups and downs
I'm givin' givin' givin' love and smilin' at the frowns
You're in trouble when you're right, it's hard for you to smile
A simple song might make it better
For a little while
Let me hear you say
Ya, ya ya ya ya 
Ooh, let me hear you say
Ya, ya ya ya ya 
Ah, oh
I love you, I love you baby 
I love you, I love you baby 
I love you, I love you baby 
I love you, I love you baby
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm talkin' talkin' talkin' talkin'
I'm walkin' walkin' walkin' walkin'
I'm livin' livin' livin' love
I'm livin' loving who I'm lovin'
Everybody sing together
Ya, ya ya ya ya 
Bring it people, sing it baby
Ya, ya ya ya ya 
Ooh, la-dee-da-do
I'm on people, I'm on
Everybody sing
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Well, ah
I love you, I love you baby 
I love you, I love you baby 
I love you, I love you baby 
I love you, I love you baby
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Everybody sing together
Ya, ya ya ya ya 
Sing it for me, don't let up
Ya, ya ya ya ya
Sing it every hour
Ya, ya ya ya ya
Sing it people, sing it
Ya, ya ya ya ya

Ya, ya ya ya ya
