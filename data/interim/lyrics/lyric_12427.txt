Oh, that summer was a killer, all right
Sleeping in the back of the car at night
We had no money, we came through
You had me, baby, I had you
Out on the open road all over America
Had it made, we were getting it right
Making love on a West Coast summer night
Summer night 
Summer night 
We had it made and we knew it all
We could never stumble
Never take a fall
We had the world at our fingertips
We were golden, we couldn't miss
Out on the open road all over America
Had it made, we were getting it right
Making love on a West Coast summer night
Summer night 
Summer night 
Out on the open road all over America
Had it made, we were getting it right
Making love on a West Coast summer night
Whatever became of the summer of love
Did we get hard or did we grow up
Had it made, we were getting it right
Making love on a West Coast summer night
 we were making love
On a west coast summer night
Summer night 
West Coast summer night
We were making love
On a West Coast summer night
