Come and sing a simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung before
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
We, the people here, don't want a war
Hey, there, Mister Black Man can you hear me
I don't want your diamonds or your game
I just want to be someone who knows to you as me
And I will bet my life you want the same
Come and sing a simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung before
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
We, the people here, don't want a war
Seven hundred million are you listening
Most of what you read
Most of what you read is made of lies
But speaking one to one, ain't it everybody's sun
To wake to in the morning when we rise
Come and sing a simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung before
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
We, the people here, don't want a war
No doubt some folks enjoy doing battle
Like presidents, Prime ministers and kings
So let's all build them shelves
So they can fight among themselves
And leave the people be who love to sing
Come and sing a simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung before
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
We, the people here, don't want a war
Come and sing a simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung before
Speaking one to one, ain't it everybody's
Ain't it everybody's sun
To wake to in the morning when we rise
When we rise
