There's a sale on our gabardine suits today
They're all thirty percent off from yesterday
There's Fortrel polyester, leather, wool and tweed
Just a Visa or Mastercard is all you need
We've got every color, we've got ev'ry shade
We're located next door to Willy's Fun Arcade
We got every fabric that was ever made
But I'm known in this city as the King of Suede
We got portly and regular and extra-long
We got tailors to fix it, if it comes out wrong
We got all kinds of sweatshirts, you can take your pick
With the collars ripped off, like in that Flashdance flick
Our prices are low, my staff is underpaid
You can buy off the rack or have it custom made
And it's all guaranteed to never shrink or fade
Cause of my reputation as the King of Suede
If you need a tuxedo for your junior prom
We can get you the best one that's made in Taiwan
We got jackets with patches on the elbows, too
And we'll sell 'em all factory-direct to you
Well, I never made it past the second grade
It took all of my life for me to learn this trade
But my friends are all thinking that I've got it made
Cause I'm known the world over as the King of Suede
There's a two-for-one sale on our three-piece suits
Check out our suede pajamas and our suede-covered boots
You can try on our suede underwear if you choose
Do what you want, but don't step on my blue suede shoes
King of Suede
Don't miss out on our giant liquidation sale
Look for our color catalog in next week's mail
There's a sale on our double-knit slacks today
It's the same old sale as yesterday
Thirty years in the same location I have stayed
There I am, right next door to Willy's Fun Arcade
I got tough competition but I'm not afraid
Cause it's my destiny to be the King of Suede
King of Suede
King of Suede
King of Suede
I'll always be King of Suede
I'll always be King of Suede
