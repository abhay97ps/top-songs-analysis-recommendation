Though you broke my heart
Though we're far apart
After all this time
You're still on my mind
I've lost count of the hours and I've lost track of the days
In fact, I've lost just about everything since you went away
Everything that is except the memories you left me
And that's one things that no one can mar
I don't know who you're with, I don't even know where you've gone
My only hope is that some day you might hear this song
And you'll know, I wrote it especially for you
And I love you wherever you are
This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire
For every day it burns hotter and every day it burns higher
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker
Not even with all of these tears
My friends all think, I'm crazy and maybe I am
But I'll carry this torch just as long as I can
For someday you might just decide to come home
And I want you to know, I'm still here
