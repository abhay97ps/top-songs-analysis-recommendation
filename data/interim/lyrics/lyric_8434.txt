I remember the day it was April twentieth
That you came my way, we've been together ever since
So glad that you stayed you're the best part of my day
And every night, I'd meet you on the patio
And we'd take a flight
And all of them were magical we don't ever fight
And I've never felt so right
And I love every single thing you do to me
And I love the way you smell and look so beautifully
And I wanna thank you for choosing me and I
I think I'm addicted
I said I think I'm addicted
I think I'm addicted ohhh
I think I'm addicted
Or maybe just lifted
I said I think I'm addicted
I think I'm addicted ohhh
I think I'm addicted
Yea girl we're just lifted
Can I take you to an island out in Maui Wowee
Blue dreams got me seeing new things
I'm not looking at any other girl you're pretty in every color
You and me purple blue and green like a mood ring
I love you and you love me purple and green Barney
Three little words three little birds Marley
Don't worry about a thing I'll let the three birds sing
When I wake up in the morning gotta have you first thing I'm addicted
I said I think I'm addicted
I think I'm addicted ohhh
I think I'm addicted
Or maybe just lifted
I said I think I'm addicted
I think I'm addicted ohhh
I think I'm addicted
Yea girl we're just lifted
I said think I'm addicted
I think I'm addicted ohhh
I think I'm addicted
Or maybe just lifted
I said I think I'm addicted
I think I'm addicted ohhh
I think I'm addicted
Maybe just lifted
