I'm from out the gutter, middle finger, Zone 6
Turned sixteen and I got my first stick 
Fuck the other side, catch a body, sendin' hits 
You call that shit extended clip, we call that bitch a dick 
Bitch, I'm mad ballin', all my diamonds mad flawless
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious
I got mad dick, turnin' these hoes into mad stalkers 
I got mad dick, turnin' these hoes into mad stalkers 
Mad Max with me, I'm Biggs 
Run through the Draco, we got cigs 
Bustin' all on your bitch face 
Make the bitch play with my kids 
Steak and shrimp, shot him in the ribs 
Baby bottles, ain't no bibs 
Twenty models all gon' kneel 
Breathin' with this water like gills 
I done got a Lowe boat on the low note 
And I got an eighty-pointer that'll choke throats 
Sipping on hi-tech, Four Lokos 
Wrist brr, fur coat way to go ho
Don't pass out, pop an Addy 
Won't smoke niggas in the attic 
Rackades, the bankroll in the mattress 
I got, drip sauce like relish 
Diamonds slippin', drippin', I'm a problem 
Heated my flow with the marble 
Stand on the stove, cook it all up 
Trap on the North with the Gualas 
I made so many millions, could have bought a helicopter
Do the surgery on the coupe like a doctor 
Heard that nigga poppin'? Call the goblins 
Gang, gang, nigga, fuck the opposite 
Bitch, I'm mad ballin', all my diamonds mad flawless 
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious
Bitch, I'm mad ballin', all my diamonds mad flawless 
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious
Bitch, I'm mad ballin', all my diamonds mad flawless 
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious 
I got mad dick, turnin' these hoes into mad stalkers
I got mad dick, turnin' these hoes into mad stalkers 
Hold on, let me kick my shit 
Audemar drownin' my wrist 
Put a double G on my kids 
Put a double G on your bitch 
I'll probably leave you before I leave the lean
Lil' bitch, don't play with my sip 
I ain't even fuckin' round with no stylist
I got too much drip 
You know you too much, bitch 
You got too much hips 
When she suck me off, she got too much lips 
4L gang, got a whole lot of choppers, lil' nigga
We'll shoot the shit 
Ran up a whole lot of M's, lil' nigga
I'm tryin' not to lose this shit 
Rims staggered, bad bitch, I'ma bag her
On my face, it's a dagger, private flights, I'm a jetlagger
Bitch, you ain't got no standards, where's your manners?
Hundred choppers, roll the window down, MC Hammer
Bitch, I'm mad ballin', all my diamonds mad flawless 
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious 
Bitch, I'm mad ballin', all my diamonds mad flawless 
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious 
Bitch, I'm mad ballin', all my diamonds mad flawless 
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious 
I got mad dick, turnin' these hoes into mad stalkers 
I got mad dick, turnin' these hoes into mad stalkers 
If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
