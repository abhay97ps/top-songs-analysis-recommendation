I've tried so many times
To erase your memory from my mind
Yet it doesn't ever last for long
I see your picture
Then I hear your voice
Our love must be stronger than before
Every time I see your eyes
Touch me
Every time I hear your voice
Hold me
Here I stand defenseless
As I look into your eyes
There's nothing left to say or do
You fill my head with promises
And all your pretty lies
Would it be so wrong to want you by my side?
Every time I see your eyes
Touch me
Every time I hear your voice
Touch me
I'm captured by my senses
Lost in your reverie
Our love must be stronger than before
Every time I see your eyes
Oh, hold me, babe
Every time I hear your voice
Touch me
Every time I see your eyes
I wanna hold u, baby
Every time I hear your voice
Hold me
Kiss me all over
Every time I see your eyes
Kiss me, baby
