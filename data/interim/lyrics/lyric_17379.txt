He's got the best of me
It's such a price to pay
He's got the best of me
See, I've been thinking it over
It's all just a little too much
You see I got this four leaf clover
It's gotta bring a little luck
Yeah
 uh huh
Yeah 
 uh huh
So I let go of all of the big deals
I let go of the bitter dream
You see the girl in the pretty white picture
Well it's never what it really seems
Yeah
Uh huh
Yeah
Uh huh
My mind is always racing
And my body's on overload
You've got my heart in the middle of a feeling
I've got no place to go
Yeah
Uh huh
See, I've been thinking it over
It's all just a little too much
You see I got a four leaf clover
It's gotta bring a little luck
I'm running
But I got nowhere to be
But I'm all right
I'm running
It's got the best of me
But it's all right
'Cause see, I've been thinking it over
It's all just a little too much
You see I got a four leaf clover
It's gotta bring a little luck
Oh yeah
Said, I've been thinking it over
It's all just a little too much
You see I got a four leaf clover
It's gotta bring a little luck
Uh huh
Said, I've been thinking it over
It's all just a little too much
Said I've got a four leaf clover
It's gotta bring a little luck
