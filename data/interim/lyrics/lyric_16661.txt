Don't 'cha know that you're so fine, hey yeah-yeah?
Baby, baby, baby, baby 
Think about you all the time, hey yeah-yeah
Guess it's time to say, baby, baby
How you make me feel when you come to mind
I can't keep my cool, baby, baby
I can't hold it inside
I can't wait each day just to see you walk
Trying to move in close to get to where you are
Not trying to be rude, baby, baby
Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained, so I'm tellin' you
Baby, baby, baby, baby 
Don't 'cha know that you're so fine, hey yeah-yeah? 
Baby, baby, baby, baby 
Think about you all the time, hey yeah-yeah
Words just ain't enough, baby, baby
But that's all I can use to state my intentions
Hope it gets to love, baby, baby, yeah
It's a perfect situation
'Cause we fit together like a hand in glove
Just to be with you is all I'm thinkin' of, whoa-yeah
What else can I say, baby, ooh, baby?
We are alone, and I'm singin' this song to you, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby 
Don't 'cha know that you're so fine, hey yeah-yeah? 
Baby, baby, baby, baby 
Think about you all the time, hey yeah-yeah 
Baby, baby, baby, baby 
Don't 'cha know that you're so fine, hey yeah-yeah? 
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Think about you all the time, hey yeah-yeah
