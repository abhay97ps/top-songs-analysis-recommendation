I can't remember when I've felt this high
Must be something special about the way you're loving me tonight
You know that I can't remember when I've felt this right
Loving you the way I do
Has made me feel like a shooting star
Shining bright and shining far
And I wonder how I ever got alone
Without you
There's something very special about you
You're all I ever think about it's true
Baby it's you
I'm talkin about you
I was sitting back and watching my life go by
Until you came along and picked me up
Oh and now I'm starting out a brand new life
And ev'rything I say and do is all because of you boy
You've given me a new joy
And I wonder how I ever got alone
Without you
There's something very special about you
You're all I ever think about it's true
Baby it's you
I'm talkin about you
Now I'll never have to sit around and cry no more
Baby ever since you walked in through my door
And now I know as long as I have you
I'll always know that ev'rything that's good and new
Is all because of you boy
You've given me a new joy
And I wonder how I ever got alone
Without you
There's something very special about you
You're all I ever think about it's true
Baby it's you
I'm talkin about you
