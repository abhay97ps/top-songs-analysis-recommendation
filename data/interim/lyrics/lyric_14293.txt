We were ring-around-the-rosy children
They were circles around the sun
Never give up
Never slow down
Never grow old, never ever die young
Synchronized with the rising moon
Even with the evening star
They were true love written in stone
They were never alone
They were never that far apart
And we who couldn't bear
To believe they might make it
We got to close our eyes
Cut up our losses into doable doses
Ration our tears and sighs
Oh, you could see them
On the street on a Saturday night
Everyone used to run them down
They're a little too sweet, they're a little too tight
Not enough tough for this town
Couldn't touch them with a ten-foot pole
No, it didn't seem to rattle at all
They were glued together body and soul
That much more
With their backs up against the wall
Oh, hold them up
Hold them up
Never do let them fall
Prey to the dust and the rust and the ruin
That names us and claims us and shames us all
I guess it had to happen someday soon
Wasn't nothing to hold them down
They would rise from among us like a big balloon
Take the sky
Forsake the ground
Oh, yes, other hearts were broken
Yeah, other dreams ran dry
But our golden ones sail on, sail on
To another land beneath another sky
(Let other hearts be broken
Let other dreams run dry)
But our golden ones sail on, sail on
To another land beneath another sky
Beneath another sky
Hold them up
Hold them up
Hold them up
Hold them up
Hold them up
Hold them up
(Hold them up
Don't let them fall)
