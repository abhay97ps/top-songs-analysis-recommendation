Ooh, I know you're probably thinkin' what's the use
I promise it's the little things that you do
That make me wanna give it all to you
You know I do, baby
You soothe me
You hold it down with every word you speak, oh babe
Baby
Been a minute since I had something so sweet
If you're gonna keep speaking my love language
You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feeling anxious
That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearning what ain't right
I want you to keep speaking my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night
Why would I double back or do the same thing twice?
A question, something that I can't deny
Leavе my baggage at the door, I'll claim you mine
All minе
You soothe me
You hold it down with every word you speak, oh babe
Baby
It's been a minute since I had something so sweet
Mmm, oh hey
If you're gonna keep speaking my love language
You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feeling anxious
That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearning what ain't right
I want you to keep speaking my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night
Baby, pardon my French, but could you speak in tongues?
Never lost in translation 'cause you know what I want, boy
Treat it just like Givenchy , it's expensive to taste
Ain't no need to remind ya, it's AG in your face
If you're gonna keep speaking my love language
You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feeling anxious
That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearning what ain't right
I want you to keep speaking my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night
Head over my shoes like woah
Know you like an inside joke
Running 'cause you're just my speed
'Less you want it in slo-mo 
I'm not what you had before 
Your ex-girlfriend don't want no smoke 
I ain't tryna sign no lease
I'm just gon' make you my home
