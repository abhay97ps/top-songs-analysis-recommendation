Down down down down be doo be doo
Down down down down be doo be doo
He lives in my neighborhood
When he walks by, he looks so good
Want to get to know him 
Wish that I could show him 
I want to love him so bad
You know it's drivin' me mad
'Cause when I look in his eyes
I can see it, paradise
So I can't help it
I want to love him so bad 
I know his name, his name is Jim
I can't be blamed for lovin' him
I could make him happy 
If he'd only let me 
I could make him happy 
If he'd only let me 
Down down down down be doo be doo
