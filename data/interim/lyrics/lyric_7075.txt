You'll never find just what you want
By running up that hill
Past is all so far behind
You'll never get it back
The present's there - it's set you know
You're dealing with it now
I'd love to help you with it
But I really don't know how
I guess it's what we're hoping for -
Just a little truth
I guess it's just an open door
We'll hide you out in a secret place
You'll never know you've been
We'll cover you with what you love
You'll last until the spring
The future's where it's gonna be
In times to come to mind
No more sitting back and waiting
For things to unwind
I guess it's what we're hoping for -
Just a little truth
I guess it's just an open door
We'll hide you out in a secret place
You'll never know you've been
We'll cover you, with what you love
You'll last until the spring
I guess it's what we're hoping for -
Just a little truth
I guess it's just an open door
We'll hide you out in a secret place
You'll never know you've been
We'll cover you, with what you love
You'll last until the spring
We'll hide you out in a secret place
You'll never know you've been
We'll cover you, with what you love
You'll last until the spring
