We were having such a good time, baby
Oh, yes, we were
Then you went and spoiled the whole thing, baby
In front of everyone
You're telling me I was wrong
And that all night long
I was staring at someone else
Well, even if you were right
There's no need to fight
There's no need to get upset
Don't you get so mad about it
Don't you get so mad about it
Don't you get so mad about it
Don't you get so mad about it, hey
You should learn to control your feelings
Respectably
‘Cause arguing in public is embarrassing
It's always the same thing, baby
Accusing me out of jealousy
I never will understand
Why you make so much out such a little thing
It's all so crazy now
Somehow it's got to change
Take a look at yourself
Carrying on this way
I know you care about
The love we're building here
So why get all upset
It's just not worth it
Listen to me, my dear
Don't you get so mad, baby
Whoa, whoa, ho, baby
Don't you get so mad about it
Whoa, ho, oh…
Don't get so mad now, baby
Ho, don't you get so mad about it, babe
Don't you get so mad
Don't you get so mad about it, babe, no
Woo, ooh, ho
Don't get so mad about it
There's no need to get upset
Darling, please don't forget the love we had
Oh…
