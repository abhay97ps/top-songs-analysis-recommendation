Ay
Yeah, yeah
Ay
I got the Higher Brothers
Hey, what's up 
Shoutout to the Higher Brothers
Yeah, we higher, we higher, we higher, we higher
Smoking on dope like yahh
Going on tour like yahh
Counting them bands like yahh
Hitting your bitch like yahh
Smoking on dope like yahh
Going on tour like yahh
Counting them bands like yahh
Hitting your bitch like yahh
The radar picked up the black cab, look J. Mag heading straight for us
Playing air guitar like a rockstar, the show is lit, guess how many tickets we sold
Chinese rappers in America, we see you watching the Higher Brothers' Asians multiplying
I’m melting this cold expression like I’m holding a winning ticket
This world ain’t nothing but good and bad, brothers like to see who’s the strongest
We got the swag and the cool, lock down the trophy and next season you’re the star
TRAP TRAP TRAP T.R.A.P, unstoppable Higher Brothers
Basic bitches don’t dare to look, stealing the breath from 10,000 shorties
My verse was uploaded to Google yeah, baseball clothing with the logo yeah
Don’t care who hates me, got bitches waiting for me at the five-star hotel
I feel rich cus my pockets are full yahh, this weekend I’ll buy more shit online yahh
I guess I can’t be sober so I’ll stay in this dream bro, you can’t stop me, play my game
Start the engine when the music drops, can’t censor a freestyle
The driver’s stuck but he can’t help but move
It’s like he’s hit with the magic power
I got my red boxing gloves on, throwing blows like a cannon
If you get hit don’t say I’m rude, I got so many styles for you to pick
You’re worse than your lyrics, you’re forced to play leapfrog on the playground
It’s my empire I get to make it when it’s hard no one dares to fake it
More money for me, savage Asian dreads look so fly on screen
Making money with a conscience, my movie’s about to hit the big screen
Shooting from the harbor to the church, in your next scene you’ll be kissing the floor
A fist straight to the chest, what are your last words?
Slide it in my bag and bounce the fuck out
Dealers and savage aesthetics, I’ll get that Oscar
Smoking on dope like yahh
Going on tour like yahh
Counting them bands like yahh
Hitting your bitch like yahh
Smoking on dope like yahh
Going on tour like yahh
Counting them bands like yahh
Hitting them licks like yahh
Prices are rising, put your money in the safe
Playing shows everywhere, we’re also buying gear
Supreme, Bape, my whole team is ballin'
Everyone wanna join the squad, all of us in CDC are legit
J. Mag, DZ, Psy.P, MaSiWei, Melo, we don’t just rap in Mandarin, we rap with that Sichuanese chill flow
No discount on Gucci and Chanel
Just wait till your hooked, when you make hip hop your life you’ll be more like me
We’re like the Warriors, the enemy always sells himself out, we ruling like pharaohs
Athena smiles at me but we ain’t reached our dreams yet
Higher Brothers are the hot shit, now every city loves us
These niggas dogs they just bite, call the jeweler for the ice
I don’t have no wife, only want her for the night
Balling my last name is Rice, out in Chengdu eating rice
Fans going out on site, Miley Cyrus with the white
I got the plug for the weed, out on tour counting hundreds
No I don’t fuck with the lean, young nigga get the money
Young nigga ball, fuck it I want it all, stop screaming gang gang, you’re a fraud
Broke niggas always talking about they ball, I pull up in the coupe, bitch I got the sauce
I turned my dream into reality, she sucked the fucking devil out of me
I think that bitch name was Melanie, diamonds dancing to the melody
Bitches love me like I’m Jodeci, oh god I’m in love with me
Oh god I’m in love with me
I brought the Higher Brothers with me, shooting till the clip is empty
Time is up bitches
Don’t use us a reference, it’s 70% hard work and 30% luck
In the rap Olympics, if you ain’t getting better you getting worse
After watching the program, we’re the finale
It ain’t nothing I can do, I fucked that bitch and her aunt too
Can’t fall asleep the night before the war, aliens don’t come to die
I’m cooking your favorite melody, add a lot more sauce
Smoking on dope like yahh
Two cities in one day by air like yahh
Oh my Cadillac like yahh
Fucked up like yahh
Smoking on dope like yahh
Going on tour like yahh
Counting them bands like yahh
Hitting your bitch like yahh
Smoking on dope like yahh
Going on tour like yahh
Counting them bands like yahh
Hitting your bitch like yahh
