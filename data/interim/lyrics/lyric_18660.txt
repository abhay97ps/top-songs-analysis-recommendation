Oh man! Look at that girl, right there!
Goodness gracious! That girl fine, man!
Look at it, she just too fine! She know she fine too!
She is banging!
She's off the hook!
She looks good, you're right
Hey, I bet you, can't nobody get that girl
Chris, I can get her
You can't get that girl, Mike
I guarantee you can't get that girl!
Watch me get that girl
I bet you never-Neverland, you can't
I can get her
All right! Shomon, then, Shomon!
Watch
I don't think they're ready for this one
Darkchild, I like that
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain these things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels so right 
I've searched for the perfect love all my life 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels like I 
Have finally found her perfect love is mine 
And I finally found, come on, girl
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give 
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine 
You rocked my world, you know you did 
And everything I own I give 
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I 
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for all my life 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find
Such a perfect love that's awesomely so right 
You rocked my world, you know you did 
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find 
Someone like you to call mine 
You rocked my world , you know you did
