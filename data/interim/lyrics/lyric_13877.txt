Baby, tell me are you serious
Hey, boy
You got me so delirious
Oh, uh
Why don't you stop playing games
Ooh, boy
Do you think you'll ever change
Baby, I don't know what I should do
No, about you
You sure make me feel like loving you
Ha, you sure do
Come on, baby
Don't tell me
Your heart belongs to someone else
Baby
I just can't be killing myself
No, no
You got me going round and round
Honey
I can't seem to settle down
Baby, I don't know what I should do
No, about you
You sure make me feel like loving you
Ha, you sure do
Come on, baby
Talk, talk about serious
Talk, talk about serious
Breaking hearts was my claim to fame
And I don't know if I'm gonna change
But if I'm really gonna be your man
I gotta change my ways if I can
Talk, talk about serious
Talk, talk about serious
You and me right from the start
Everything was fine then I broke your heart
So I'm telling you now
Like I told you then
If we can't be lovers
Let's just be friends
Baby, I don't know what I should do
No, about you
You sure make me feel like loving you
Huh, you sure do
Come on, baby
Breaking hearts is my claim to fame
And I don't know if I'm gonna change
But if I'm really gonna be your man
I gotta change my ways if I can
Talk, talk about serious 
Talk, talk about serious
 You and me right from the start
 Everything was fine then I broke your heart
 So I'm telling you now like I told you then
 If we can't be lovers let's just be friends
Talk, talk about serious 
Talk, talk about serious
