My daddy taught me in this country everyone's the same
You work hard for your dollar and you never pass the blame
When it don't go your way
Now I see all these big shots whining on my evening news
About how they're losing billions
And it's up to me and you to come running to the rescue
Well pardon me if I don't shed a tear
Cause they're selling make-believe
And we don't buy that here
Cause in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
While the boss man takes his bonus pay and jets on out of town
And DC's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground
While they're living it up on Wall Street in that New York City town
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
Well that old man's been working in that plant most all his life
Now his pension plan's been cut in half and he can't afford to die
And it's a crying shame, cause he ain't the one to blame
When I look down to see his calloused hands
Well let me tell you friend it gets me fightin' mad
Because in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
While the boss man takes his bonus pay and jets on out of town
And DC's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground
While they're living it up on Wall Street in that New York City town
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
While they're living it up on Wall Street in that New York City town
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
In the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
They're shuttin' Detroit down
