Green grass 'round my window
Young leaves that the wind blows
Yes, it's springtime, golden sunshine
And we're glad, my little love and I
Now that summertime is nigh
Carefree kissin' couples
Dream away all their troubles
'cause it's springtime, golden sunshine
While the bluebirds sing their magic song
We will love the summer long
All the winter we've been waitin'
Girl and I anticipatin'
What we're gonna do with summer overdue
Now it's here, we're out together
So the weatherman had better
Do his best to make a show
And bring the sunshine out to grow the
Green grass 'round my window
Young leaves that the wind blows
Yes, it's springtime, golden sunshine
While the bluebirds sing their magic song
We will love the summer long
We will love the summer long
FADE
We will love the summer long
