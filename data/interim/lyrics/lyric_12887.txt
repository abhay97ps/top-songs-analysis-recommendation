Close your eyes
'Cause there's something that I have to tell you
We will stand still
And make choices
And our hands will help our voices
Don't ask why
We will never understand it
It's frightening
No defenses
It's like lightning to the senses
It comes straight from the heart
Into your life
All of that waiting
Has turned out all right
Straight from the heart
Into your soul
The power of love
Is something you can never control
Tell no lies
And if you feel the need
Then say so
It's as though you're afraid of laughter
'Cause you know what's coming after
It comes straight from the heart
Into your life
All of that waiting
Has turned out all right
Straight from the heart
Into your soul
The power of love
Is something you can never control
Now it's time to leave
The road that leads you nowhere
You must go where a love unspoken
Can repair what has been broken
It comes straight from the heart
Into your life
All of that waiting
Has turned out all right
Straight from the heart
Into your soul
The power of love
Is out of control
Straight from the heart
Into your life
All of that waiting
Has turned out all right
Straight from the heart
To your soul
It's out of control
Straight from the heart
Into your life
