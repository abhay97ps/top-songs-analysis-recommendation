If your sweetheart
Sends a letter of goodbye
It's no secret, you'll
Feel better if you cry
When waking from a bad dream
Don't you sometimes think it's real
But it's only false emotions
That you feel
If your heartaches seem
To hang around too long
And your blues keep
Getting bluer with each song
Remember, sunshine can be
Found behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down
And go on and cry
If your heartaches seem
To hang around too long
And your blues keep
Getting bluer with each song
Remember, sunshine can be
Found behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down and
Go right on, baby, and cry
