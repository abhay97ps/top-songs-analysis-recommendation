Always said you were a Youthquaker, Edie
A stormy little world shaker
Warhol's darling queen, Edie
An angel with a broken wing
The dogs lay at your feet, Edie
We caressed your cheek
Stars wrapped in your hair, Edie
Life without a care
But you're not there
You're never there
Caught up in an endless scene
Paradise a shattered dream
Why'd all the shit you took, Edie
Your innocence dripped blood, sweet child
Sweet little sugar talker
Paradise dream stealer
Warhol's Darling queen, Edie
Innocence dripped blood, sweet child
Why did you kiss the world goodbye
Ciao Baby
Don't you know paradise takes time
It takes time, but you're not there
Fade away now
But you're not there
Ciao Edie
