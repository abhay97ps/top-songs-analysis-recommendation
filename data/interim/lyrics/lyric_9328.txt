Inside, outside, up and around
Love set me up and love let me down
What a game, feel like I?
One day sun, next day rain
And you ask me if I even care
Don't you know the answer
Rainy day blues never felt this way
I wanna stay with you
For the rest of my life
I wanna live with you
For the rest of my life
I wanna stay with you
For the rest of my life
And when I give my loving to you
You're giving little to me
Somehow someway you changed my point of view
Good times, bad times, happy or sad
Being in love is better than being alone
I might have had my doubts
But nothing to write home about
I wanna stay with you
For the rest of my life
I wanna live with you
For the rest of my life
I wanna stay with you
For the rest of my life
I wanna stay with you
For the rest of my life
I wanna live with you
For the rest of my life
I wanna stay with you
For the rest of my life
