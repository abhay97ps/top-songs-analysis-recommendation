Everybody's always waiting on Friday
Watching that clock and sitting on go
Whatcha' say we find a little warm sunshine
An open umbrella on the patio
I don't need a reason or a happy hour
Ain't hangin' 'round for a fireworks show
Get a head start, a little sip of somethin'
Off and running, here we go
One, two, three, here we go
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling alright
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Blame it on the work day
Blame it on the heatwave
Blame it on the tick-tock movin' too slow
Blame it on any old thing you want to
Ready, get set, baby, here we go
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling alright
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Day drinking, d-d-d-day drinking
Day drinking, d-d-d-day drinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling alright
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling all right
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
