I think you wanna come over
Yeah, I heard it through the grapevine
Are you drunk? Are you sober?
Think about it, doesn't matter
And if it makes you feel good, then I say do it
I don't know what you're waiting for
Feel my temperature rising
There's too much heat, I'm gonna lose control
Do you want to go higher? Get closer to the fire?
I don't know what you’re waiting for
Come join the party, yeah
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started, yeah
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
Boy, you got a reputation
But you're gonna have to prove it
I see a little hesitation
Am I gonna have to show you
That if it feels right, get on your mark
Step to the beat, boy, that's what it's for
Put your arms around me
When it gets too hot, we can go outside
But for now, just come here, let me whisper in your ear
An invitation to the dance of life
Come join the party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
You look familiar
You wanna dance? Yeah
I guess I just don't recognize you with your clothes on
What are you waiting for?
Come join the party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
Come join the party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
Boy, you got it
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won’t do
Let's get it started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
Boy, you got it
'Cause anybody just won’t do
Let’s get it started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
