Walking the line
I'm walking the line
Treading thin ice
Time after time
I go for the best
End up with much less
I need the real thing
Forget all the rest
Oh, yeah
All right
Started out good
Working out bad
All the sweet love turned sour and sad
A face and name
It's always the same
So tired of playing love's foolish games
Tell me why love passes me by
Cold love
Cold love
Another shot of rock 'n roll love
Cold love
Cold love
Whatever happened to that good old love?
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
Hope in the dark
Love in the light
I'll keep on looking for someone who's right
I'm out for the best
Can you stand the test?
I need the real thing
No more and no less
Tell me why love passes me by
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
