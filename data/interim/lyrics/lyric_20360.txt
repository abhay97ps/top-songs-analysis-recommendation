You don't know my name
You don't know anything about me
I've tried to play nice
I want to be in your game
The things that you say
You may think I never hear about them
But word travels fast
I'm telling you to your face
I'm standing here behind your back
You don't know how it feels
To be outside the crowd
You don't know what it's like
To be left out
And you don't know how it feels
To be your own best friend
On the outside looking in
If you could read my mind
You might see
More of me than meets the eye
And you've been all wrong
Not who you think I am
You've never given me a chance
You don't know how it feels
To be outside the crowd
You don't know what it's like
To be left out
And you don't know how it feels
To be your own best friend
On the outside looking in
I'm tired of staying at home
I'm bored and all alone
I'm sick of wasting all my time
You don't know how it feels
To be outside the crowd
You don't know what it's like
To be left out
And you don't know how it feels
To be your own best friend
On the outside looking in
You don't know how it feels
To be outside the crowd
You don't know what it's like
To be left out
And you don't know how it feels
To be your own best friend
On the outside looking in
