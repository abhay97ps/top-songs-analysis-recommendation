Tryna get demons up outta me 
Turn to a beast, eat your arteries 
Deceasing opponents so properly 
Unleashing the dark side what got to me 
We come to take this shit over 
Foot on the gas, hear the motor 
Switchin' my thoughts, I'm bipolar 
I stare in the eyes of a cobra 
Say you want smoke, come get it 
You wanna play dumb, I'm wit' it 
I'm about to take over the city 
I came with my committee, gang with it 
Came for the bag and the profit 
Lookin' for the wave when we got it 
Nigga, you ain't scare nobody 
Bop-bop, that's a whole body 
Cold case, cold-cold case
On the dark side, if you keep cold, it's a cold case
Cold-cold case, cold-cold case
In my right mind, I can ride right 'til I road rage
Cold-cold case, cold case
Skeleton on my left wrist, in that soul place
Cold-cold case, cold-cold case
On my knees, thanking God that he got me through the pain
Danger, danger
I don't fit in, I'm a stranger
Believer, believer
I can take out all the evil
Empowerment to all my people
I can prove to you I'm a leader
Run through the money, no Visa
Forgive me 'cause my life illegal
Searchin' for the bag and the prize 
On a mission lookin' for them bad guys
Can't run no play over my head, I'm real wise
Look at his eyes, wide, think he traumatized
Take me as a joke, I'ma hang 'em on the rope 
'Cause where I'm from, we don't play like that on Nawfside 
Better not freeze 'cause we know you're gon' choke 
Talk behind my back but your shots backfired 
I know you tried but you never could survive
I see the fear that's in your eyes 
Run like Forrest, they tryna hide
They criticize in disguise 
They know I can only tell the truth 
They know all you do is tell lies 
I'm about to take over the city, tell me you just with it
'Cause I know my squad gon' ride 
Cold case, cold-cold case
On the dark side, if you keep cold, it's a cold case
Cold-cold case, cold-cold case
In my right mind, I can ride right 'til I road rage
Cold-cold case, cold case
Skeleton on my left wrist, in that soul place
Cold-cold case, cold-cold case
On my knees, thanking God that he got me through the pain
Danger, danger
I don't fit in, I'm a stranger
Believer, believer
I can take out all the evil
Empowerment to all my people 
I can prove to you I'm a leader 
Run through the money, no Visa
Forgive me 'cause my life illegal
Come on, say you want smoke come get it 
You wanna play dumb, I'm with it 
Lookin' for the wave when we got it 
Bop-bop, that's a whole body 
Danger, danger
I don't fit in, I'm a stranger
Believer, believer
I can take out all the evil
Empowerment to all my people
I can prove to you I'm a leader
Run through the money, no Visa
Forgive me 'cause my life illegal
Danger, danger
I don't fit in, I'm a stranger
Believer, believer
I can take out all the evil
Empowerment to all my people
I can prove to you I'm a leader
Run through the money, no Visa
Forgive me 'cause my life illegal
