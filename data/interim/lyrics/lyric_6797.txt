I play and sing
Dawn
When they ask me for my autograph
I catch you in the corner of my eye
And I know that smile upon your face
Means we made it girl, you and I
From the hard life on the south side
To the spotlight here on the stage
Now watch me play
Hear me sing la-la-la la-la-la-la
I play and sing for you la-la-la-la
Hear the applause
Without you, no telling where I'd be
Singing me a different song
Breaking rocks for ten or twenty years
But you wouldn't let me go wrong
Standing by me 'cause you love me
Now darling, this one's for you
Now watch me play
Hear me sing la-la-la la-la-la-la
