Ah yeah!
Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street
They're dancing in Chicago 
Down in New Orleans 
Up in New York City 
All we need is music 
Sweet music 
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swinging, swaying, records playing
Dancing in the streets, Oh!
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there, so come on
Grab a guy, grab a girl, everywhere around the world
There'll be dancing, dancing in the streets
 It's just an invitation, across the nation
A chance for the folks to meet
There'll be laughing and singing, music swinging
Dancing in the streets
Philadelphia, PA 
Baltimore, in D.C. now 
Can't forget the Motor City 
All we need is music 
Sweet music 
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swinging, swaying, records playing
Dancing in the streets, Oh!
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there, so come on
Grab a guy, grab a girl, everywhere around the world
Wow!
Hey hey hey!
Ow yeah, ow!
Dancin', they're dancin' in the street
Way down in L.A. everyday
Dancin' in the street
San Francisco Bay 
They do it everyday now
Across the ocean blue  me an' you
Dancin' in the street
