Ooh, girl, you know like I know, uh-huh
What your lovin', girl, has done for me
You're like a Mona Lisa hangin' on the wall, uh-huh
You're a lovely sight, a lovely sight to see, mm-hmm
The way you give me your sweet love
Any place and time
When you look at me, I get weak in my knees
I'm so thankful that you're mine
Your sweetness is my weakness, yeah
Girl, your sweetness is my weakness, yeah
Sweetness, yeah, is my weakness, well
Your sweetness 
They all think that I'm a fool, uh-huh
For lovin' you, for lovin' you this way
But as sure as I am, I don't give a damn
About what the people, what the people say
Other girls try to imitate you
Out with the other boys, uh-huh
But I'm the only one 'round here
Who's got the real McCoy
Sweetness, girl, that's my weakness, uh-huh, uh-huh
Your sweetness, ooh, is my weakness, huh
Your sweetness, girl, is my weakness, ooh yeah
Your sweetness is my weakness
Lord, your sweetness is my weakness
Lord, your sweetness, girl, is my weakness, mm
Sweetness is my weakness, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Sweetness, weakness, yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
My weakness is your sweetness, yeah
Your sweetness is my weakness
Your sweetness is my weakness, yeah, yeah
Sweetness is my weakness, yeah , yeah 
Sweetness is my weakness, yeah , yeah
