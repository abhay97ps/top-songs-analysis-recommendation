Lonely Lonely
The "L" is for the laughter, we shared from the start
"O" is for the only girl in my heart
The "N" is for the night, you told me we were though
For you had found somebody new
"E" is for the end of my world, a place I shared with only you
Empty, my world is dark
Loneliness has just begun
The "L" is for the Love that was meant for me only
And "Y" Why did you leave me lonely
Lonely
