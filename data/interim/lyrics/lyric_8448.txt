Ya git up
Ya git down
Ya git lost
And then ya get found
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Ya git a laugh
Ya git a cry
Get 'em all before you die
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Come on, sit down, git down
A-come on, sit down, git down
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
All the ladies
Hypnotize you
And all your friends
Well, they just patronize you
Don't gotta look for God
He's just sittin' here
And I think He's got a plan
But it's not too clear
You git the truth
Ya git a lie
'nough to make a grown man cry
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
You git the light
You git the dark
Fall in love
It breaks your heart
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Come on, sit down, git down
A-come on, sit down, git down
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Come on, sit down, git down
A-come on, sit down, git down
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Come on, sit down, git down
A-come on, sit down, git down
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Come on, sit down, git down
A-come on, sit down, git down
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Now you might think
It's confusin'
With all you got
Well, look what all you're losin'
But it's just life
And it just goes on
So quit with your complainin'
Soon enough you will be gone
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Come on, sit down, git down
Come on, sit down, git down
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Come on, sit down, git down
Come on, sit down, git down
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Come on, sit down, git down
Come on, sit down, git down
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
