Stand or fall
The love you have
Is all you have to give
As long as you live
On your own
You're never all alone
There'll be a light to guide you on
Remember that love is there
You made it this far, baby
Don't let it go
This is the moment for you know, ohh
'Cause our love lasts forever
I'll never let us drift apart
I'll be there for you
Comes a day
Feels so feels away
So far to go
You should know by now
You're free
How we used to be
You've got the power
Do whatever you desire
You're gonna bet to win
You're a survivor
Whoa, oh, oh
I swear wherever you have to go
Darlin' know
'Cause our love lasts forever
I'll never let us drift apart
I'll be there for you
My heart is gonna be at home
Whoa, oh, oh
Oh, my love
Wooo, oooh
'Cause our love lasts forever
Oh, I'll never let us drift apart
'Cause our love lasts forever
My heart is gonna be at home
Woo hoo
Whoa, oh, oh
'Cause our love lasts forever
I'll never let us drift apart
Woo hoo
Whoa, oh, oh
