All of my life, it seems I've waited for this day
All this time, I've been searching 'cause I never knew
You could make me feel this way
So much love
You captured my heart and my soul
And, baby, I'm losing control
I don't ever want to let go of what you give me
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise you'll always stay
Promise you'll never run away from my love
Promise me, promise me
If you could guarantee that what you say is true
Every day of my life I'll be there through the night
And I'll give myself to you
So much love
I cherish the moments we share
The feelings that won't disappear
The magic you bring when you're near
Don't take that from me
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise you'll always stay
Promise you'll never run away from my love
Promise me, promise me
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise you'll always stay
Promise you'll never run away from my love
Promise me, promise me
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise you'll always stay
Promise you'll never run away from my love
Promise me, promise me
Baby, promise me
That you'll stay with me
You'll never run away from my love
Say you'll never leave
Won't you tell me that
You'll never run away from my love?
Promise me
