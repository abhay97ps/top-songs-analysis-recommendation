Hello Josephine
How do you do?
Do you remember me baby
Like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me
And holler "hoo hoo hoo"
I used to walk you home
I used to hold your hand
You used to use my umbrella
Every time it rained
You used to cry so mucyh
It was a cryin' shame
You used to live over yonder
By the railroad track
When it rained you couldn't walk
I used to tote you on my back
Now ...
(something like: "you're tryin' to make believe
It was for tears like that")
