I remember back a long time ago
In the days of my childhood
In the evenin' when the sun's sinkin' low
Walkin' in the wildwood
Skippin' and flippin' through the flowers
We'd go hand-in-hand
Lookin' back on all the happy hours
Anybody could understand
You and me, babe
Just got to be now
Birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together
Like birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together now, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
You and I didn't have a lot of friends
Didn't have too much to say
So they never did let us join in
All the games that they used to play
Seems like it was only yesterday
Down at Lincoln Junior High
I remember what the kids used to say
As we'd go strollin' by
You and me, now
Sure 'nuff, tryin' to be now
Birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together
Like birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
Got to be together, now
Time goes rollin' by
And they say that you and I
Will go our sep'rate ways
But birds of a feather
Will always be together
Sure 'nuff, now
Your folks didn't want me hangin' 'round
Said that I was bad for you
So we'd meet on the other side of town
Down a long, dark avenue
But they can't keep the two of us apart
Long as you really love me
I got a feelin' way down in my heart
And that's the way that it's gonna be
You and me, babe
Sure 'nuff got to be, now
Birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together
Like birds of a feather
Birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together
Like birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together
Like birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
Got to be together
Like birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together
Like birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
Oh, got to be together now
