Riding on the subway, watching all the people stare
Everyone just listens, they won't do any talking 
They just sit there waitin', waitin' with their eyes
Don't ask any questions, you won't get an answer 
Everybody seems to have a good time
Nobody goes stepping out of line
Everyone's agreed that everything will turn out fine
Moving through the city, making all the rounds
Trying different places, didn't like the faces 
Rollin' in the gutter, throwin' up my pride
Belly full of whiskey, was it hard to swallow 
Everybody seems to have a good time
Nobody goes stepping out of line
Everyone's agreed that everything will turn out fine
Everybody seems to have a good time
Nobody goes stepping out of line
Everyone's agreed that everything will turn out fine
Everyone's agreed that everything will turn out fine
Everyone's agreed that everything will turn out fine
Fine , fine 
So fine  fine 
Fine , fine 
Fine , so fine 
Oh no
