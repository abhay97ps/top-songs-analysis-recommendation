There's a little boy out in the driveway his basketball in hand
Saying Daddy could we play a little one on one
You pat him on the back and say not now son I'm a busy man
His sister's out on the sidewalk setting up a lemonade stand
Hey daddy don't you want to buy a glass from me
You say maybe later can't you see I'm a busy man
You got to go got to run hit it hard and get it done
Everyone can see you're going far
You got responsibilities a crazy schedule that you keep
And when you say that time's a wasting
You don't know how right you are a busy man
There's a women in the bedroom crying saying I thought we had plans
You say honey I'm sorry I'll make it up
When the job slows down and I'm not such a busy man
Have you ever seen a headstone with these words
If only I had spent more time at work
There's a call one day from the office they need you down in Birmingham
You say no way the weekend's mine
I got plans with the kids and a date with my wife I'm a busy man
You got to go got to run take a break and have some fun
Those that love you most say you've come far
Got some new priorities in that schedule that you keep
And when you say that time's a wasting
Now you know how right you are a busy man
