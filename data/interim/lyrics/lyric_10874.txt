You said you'd never fake it
You swore we'd always make it last
And it sounded so real
And I fell into your love trap
Blind, yes, I was the perfect fool
I believed every word
And it never occurred to me
Is this a game?
Are you just playin'?
Will I be losin' you?
Oh, am I a victim of love, victim of love?
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only usin' me?
Victim of love, victim of love
What a fool you made of me
My friends warned me about ya
I laughed, how could I doubt your love?
Then I saw you with him
And my world crumbled around me
I felt life slip away from me
There's a void inside me
Where my heart used to be
So now, this was a game
You were just playin'
And now I'm losin' you
Oh, I'm a victim of love, victim of love
Well, you took me for a ride
Victim of love, victim of love
Well, I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
You were only usin' me
Victim of love, victim of love
What a fool you made of me
Oh, am I a victim of love, victim of love?
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only usin' me?
Victim of love, victim of love
What a fool you made of me
So now, this was a game
You were just playin'
And now I'm losin' you
Oh, am I a victim of love, victim of love?
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only usin' me?
Victim of love, victim of love
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only usin' me?
Victim of love, victim of love
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
