People say I’m cocky
30 rounds inside I feel glocky
Try to copy & paste my style Lil nigga that is not me
Head good like an extra O on God got me screaming god lee
Let a nigga try me
Put em on the iv
Serving Eddie Caine
Call that shit 5 heart beat
Been gone for 4 seasons now I’m kickin shit at the four seasons
Came up serving pieces
Now me n my niggas at neimens
We buying thousand dollar sneaks while niggas sneak diss
Pull up with the g6 ooh now it’s the remix
I’m tryna ride foreign cars
Fuck on foreign Broads
Pull up designer down
People looking at me like a foreigner
Thank god I beat the odds
Popping bars reminiscing being behind them bars
Use to snatch chains on silver star
Now chains on my neck I’m a star

Hard work ... pay off
Hard work ... make jays call
Mad that I’m getting money shit that’s they fault
But bullshit over priorities that’s they lost
Some say I’m ignorant
Some say I’m stuck in my ways
Nigga I’m stuck in the streets
Serving stop signs and 4-ways
I don’t need a job keys turn the nob
Fuck minimum wage
All these rappers feminine says
Cavity too Fake
I make fashion statements to understand you might need a translation
Nigga I’m far from basic go broke it’s back to the basics
E-pass when you coming thru heard you making payments
Serving cement on the motherfucking pavement
