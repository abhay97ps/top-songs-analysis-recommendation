If you got it, it ain't no question
No, it ain't no room for guessin'
No more than emotionally invested 
Showin' you all my imperfections, oh
If I let you, you'll take me for granted, yeah 
If I'm worth more than you could manage, manage, yeah
Open with me, oh, we could be honest
Closer to me, oh, givin' me silence
Promise that you won't let me fall, oh, oh
Holdin' me tight, lovin' me right, givin' me life
All night you could be 
Tellin' me lies, makin' me cry, wastin' my time
The wholе time, so just be
Careful what you takе for granted, yeah
'Cause with me know you could do damage
You , you could do damage
You , you could do damage 
Yeah, uh
Worry 'bout it, I'm puttin' pressure 
You'll only kept me if I let you
No, we ain't doing this just for pleasure
Either learn me or I'm a lesson, gone, no
If you want me don't take me for granted, yeah, yeah
If I'm worth more than you could manage, baby
Oh, you're fallin' for me, oh, baby, I've caught it
Ooh, we could be whatever you wanna call it
Promise that you won't let me fall, oh, oh
Holdin' me tight, lovin' me right, givin' me life
All night, you could be 
Tellin' me lies, makin' me cry, wastin' my time
The whole time, so just be
Careful what you take for granted, yeah
'Cause with me know you could do damage
You , you could do damage
You, you could do damage
Oh, you could do damage
