Even if you see my scars, even if I break your heart
If we're a million miles apart, do you think you'd walk away?
If I get lost in all the noise, even if I lose my voice
Flirt with all the other boys, what would you say?
Could you?
Could you?
Could you love me anyway?
Is it for better or for worse, or am I just your good time girl?
Can you still hold me when it hurts, or would you walk away?
Even if I scandalize you, cut you down and criticize you
Tell a million lies about you, what would you say?
Could you?
Could you?
Could you?
Could you love me anyway?
Could you? 
Could you? 
Could you?
Could you love me anyway?
Could you?
Could you? 
Could you? 
Could you? 
Could you love me anyway?
Could you? 
Could you? 
Could you? 
Could you love me anyway?
Could you? 
Could you? 
Could you? 
I can't stay here in the world, could you?
Could you? Could you? Could you?
