The moon was yellow and the night was young
A smile brought us together and I was wondering whether
We'd meet again someday
The moon was yellow and a song was sung
That vocal inspiration gave me the inclination
To give my heart away
Here we are, is our romance to continue?
Will it be my luck to win you?
May I look that far?
My love is mellow and my hopes are strong
Around that cupid fellow
Behold, the moon is yellow
And the night is young
Will it be my luck to win you?
May I look that far?
My love is mellow and my hopes are strong
Around that cupid fellow
Behold, the moon is yellow
And the night is young
