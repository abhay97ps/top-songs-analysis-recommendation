Hey, who is that 
Better calm down around here
Hey girl, whatever you want... I got
Hey yeah
Everything you want from me 
I'm gonna give it all to you
Baby if you please, tell me your desires
Of your heart 
One thing I can see
You're in need of lovin'
I can give it to you 
Don't lower your expectations
So you can say that you're just-
Someone in love
Baby, 'cause in my estimation
You should get all that you want
And it's my pleasure just to give it to you
Everything you that you want from me 
I'm gonna give it all to you 
Everything you that you want me to be 
I'm gonna be there just for you
Girl, it's a possibility
That you've been lonely for too long 
Well I've got remedy for your frustration
In the words of this song
This song baby
Come closer my love, I'm already near
To keep you satisfied
It's me that you need
You can get it all from me
You don't have to worry
'cause I'm gonna give it to you
Everything that you want from me 
I'm gonna give it all to you 
Everything you want me to be 
I'm gonna be there just for you 
Everything that you want from me 
I'm gonna give it all to you 
Everything you want me to be 
I'm gonna be there just for you
Hah ah
Whoa whoa
Everything
Everything
The love you deserve 
All you want in life 
You are the one, only in my eyes
And that's enough for me to say - baby
