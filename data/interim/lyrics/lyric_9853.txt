The sky is burnin'
I believe my soul's on fire
You are, I'm learnin', the key to my desire
Waiting for the van to arrive
The prisoners were lined up outside
Jumped a wall, hitched a ride, and now I'm here to stay
Love you baby anyway
The sky is burnin'
I believe my soul's on fire
You are, I'm learnin', the key to my desire
Ran across the country fields in all the rain
They had guns and dogs and everything
Swam the river tryin' to lose my trail
But they caught me; under the bridge, whoa yeah!
The sky is burnin'
I believe my soul's on fire
You are, I'm learnin', the key to my desire, oh yeah
Oh, yeah
The sky is burnin'
I believe my soul's on fire
You are, I'm learnin', the key to my desire
The judge said this man's a danger to humanity
We're gonna lock him up and throw away the key
Now baby, your love has sent me to jail
But I'd rather die than see you with another man
Yeah it's burnin', baby
Mmm mmmm
I believe my soul's on fire
I believe my soul's on fire
Working on the railroad every day
But they can't keep me here
And I'm not gonna stay
I got to get outta this place
Out to see you, baby
Yeah it's burnin'
Yeah, burnin'
I believe my soul's on fire
Oh, burnin'
Ah, yeah, ah oh ...
