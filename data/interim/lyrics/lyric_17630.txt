It should've been different, but it wasn't different, was the
Same old story, "Dear John," and so long
It should've fit like a glove, it should've fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring, a token of true love
Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble
So now you're thinkin' 'bout all you're missin' how
Deep you're sinkin', 'round and 'round and draggin' down
Why don't you cash in your chips, why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss, chalk it up to better luck
Could've been true love, but it wasn't
It should all add up, but it doesn't
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble
Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There is your trouble
