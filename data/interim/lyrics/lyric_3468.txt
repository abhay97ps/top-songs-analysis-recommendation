I can't get used to
Not having you to
Take me out on a late
Sugar, sugar, would ya would ya
Tell me where I made my mistake
Because
Yes I do
AinÂ´t no use denying
I'm doin a lot of crying
Over you
Sweetie, sweetie, tell me tell me
Where did i go wrong
Because...
Yes I do
Baby baby
Oh yes I do
I really miss you
Since you been gone
We had a love
Oh so strong
Why won't you come on back?
Why won't you come on back?
Come on back?
Where you belong
Because...
