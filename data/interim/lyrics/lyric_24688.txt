Southside 
Pull up and wreck , pull up and
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
Pull up with the spark, hit you in the dark 
Tear your ass apart when you swim with sharks
I'm in the car like Tony Starks 'cause I'm that smart 
Doin' 106, then park like I'm in my yard 
And motherfuck the camera time, I need family time 
I need "go see Uncle John in Atlanta" time 
I'd probably never get it, but it's cool to fantasize 
Just like I do by old girl and these hands of mine 
Grippin' on the titties, ass, and her thighs 
Honestly, I'm over her and her lies
Cartier over my eyes while I analyze
Okay, me and lil' Metro, rockin' new retros
Take off your dress, ho, that's the new dress code 
Too blessed to stress, that's my manifesto 
Fuck the professor, I'm too professional
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, we take no disrespect
I ain't takin' disrespect, lil' nigga 
Put a couple holes in your neck, lil' nigga 
Fuck a diss song, get you stressed, lil' nigga 
Got a shoestring 'round my TEC, lil' nigga 
Got a Mulsanne and a 'Vette, lil' nigga 
Brand new Carbine one-five and it's red, dog 
I ain't tryna fuck you, I just want some head, dog 
Straight up out the Six and we don't shoot at legs, dog 
Zone 6 niggas love to see the white meat 
I put codeine all in my ice tea 
Take a nigga bitch and then I make her wifey 
Take a nigga bitch and then we do the nasty 
All these diamonds drippin', now she wanna bite me 
She broke up with that nigga, now he wanna fight me 
Fox 5 Gang, we don't do no fightin' 
This Glock gon' knock a nigga down like Tyson 
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, we take no disrespect 
How a nigga changed and still stayed a hundred? 
I ran towards change while y'all ran from it 
Y'all wanna ball, I'm Stan Van Gundy
She wanna hang with me and 'Ye, she know that's good company
I like my skies Carolina blue and white
True one, false move and that could paralyze your life 
So understand, I'm the overanalyzin' type 
Panoramic views while I'm pannin' out my life 
And I grew up playin' GoldenEye 
So I'm used to stickin' to the mission while they takin' shots
When you this high, you disconnect a lot 
Sometimes I separate myself to connect the dots 
Only way I'm goin' back is goin' back home 
I don't drink tap water, but got tapped phones 
Dior on my suit, I'm the troop
Money come around, I'm never out the loop 
Kiss the bottom of my boot 
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, we take no disrespect
I’m talkin' FN’s and TEC’s, Rollies, Pateks
I heard that, you snitch, you got police on text
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, we take no disrespect
