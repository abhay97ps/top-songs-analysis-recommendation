Yeah, ooh
Metro on these
Boominati wave, uh
(We've done it with robotic arm on the space shuttle
We’ve done it with direct launch of modules)
Prepare for lightspeed
Bought a spaceship, now I'm a space cadet 
Big white mansion is my habitat 
Aim a lot of sticks like it's laser tag 
Fuck a rich bitch, havin’ rich sex 
Smoke a lot of trees, need a weed plant 
Addicted to codeine, where the lean at? 
Sleepin' on these G's, it's a beanbag 
Got Rick Owen jeans, cost a cool rack 
Check came from my fans, life is fantastic 
I was broke as hell, sleepin' on the mattress 
I felt like it's Hell, wasn't nobody happy
Hot shells droppin' out the semi-automatic 
Ran it up, bought a condo, got a new addy 
Got the VVs with a Vlone jean jacket 
They can’t see me, even if you had 3D glasses 
Bad bitch in the bikini, she from Calabasas 
Got a pocket full of bleu cheese and some green relish
I’m a psycho for these hundreds, got a cash fetish 
I've been studyin’ these hundreds, I'm a mathematic
And this love make me wanna buy my dad a Caddy
'Cause the love got me geeked up, I don't need an Addy
Dracos let these niggas know we war-ready 
Expensive clothes on my bitches, we ain't ball-cappin'
Alien, feel like I'm livin' on my own planet
Bought a spaceship, now I'm a space cadet 
Big white mansion is my habitat 
Aim a lot of sticks like it's laser tag 
Fuck a rich bitch, havin' rich sex 
Smoke a lot of trees, need a weed plant 
Addicted to codeine, where the lean at? 
Sleepin' on these G's, it's a beanbag 
Got Rick Owen jeans, cost a cool rack 
Chanel shoes overseas, they was patent leather
Shop in Tokyo, Japan, they the best ever
Blueberry t-shirt, sleeve on leather
Hard-top turn the vert, ride in any weather
You ain't gotta bend down, this ain't the propeller
Me and Wheezy spent a dime coppin' Gucci sweaters
Steady drippin', nigga drownin', I cannot help him
It's the Boominati, guys, we are not the devil 
Got Colombia and ties out in Mexico 
Wash the Benz a hundred times, still smell dope 
Got some pants from Philipp Plein feel like velcro
A bitch fine and love shoppin' at Rodeo 
I be iffy, don't want cop if it's a day old
Ain't stingy, my bro Gunna get a payroll
I just want the pretty women and the pesos
I can only hear the engine in this Lambo
Bought a spaceship, now I'm a space cadet 
Big white mansion is my habitat 
Aim a lot of sticks like it's laser tag 
Fuck a rich bitch, havin' rich sex 
Smoke a lot of trees, need a weed plant 
Addicted to codeine, where the lean at?

Ooh, ooh
