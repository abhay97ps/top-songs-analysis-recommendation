A word's just a word
‘Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away
We've all got a gift
Yeah, something to give
To make a change
Send it on 
On and on 
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part 
Reach your heart 
Just one spark starts the fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make us strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Just smile 
And the world 
Will smile along with you
That small act of love
That's meant for one will become two
•If we take the chances•
*To change circumstances*
Imagine all we can do, if we
Send it on 
On and on 
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part 
Reach your heart 
Just one spark starts the fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make us strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Send it on 
There's power in all of the choices we make
So I’m starting now, there's not a moment to waste
A word's just a word
‘Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away
Send it on 
On and on 
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part 
Reach your heart 
Just one spark starts the fire
With one little action, the chain reaction will never stop
Make us strong 
Shine a light, and send it on
Send it on 
On and on 
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part 
Reach your heart 
Just one spark starts the fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will help things start
Make us strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Shine a light, and send it on
Shine a light, and send it on
