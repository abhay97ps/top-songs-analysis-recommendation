Lately all the flowers seem to be so plain
Can you call a rose by any other name?
Just this morning I took a stroll through your garden
I watched the sunrise and it made me think of you
The way you talk to the flowers and make them grow
And in the middle of all these flowers
There's one single stem red rose
It stood out from the rest, the fairest of them all
It made me think of what you asked me
Can you call a rose by any other name?
Lady your body moves like poetry
Like a diamond in the raw
You shine for me
No one else can hold candle to you, girl
'Cause you're everything I need in my world, lady
Lately all the flowers seem to be so plain 
Can you call a rose by any other name 
Here inside your garden it's like I feel I'm changed 
Can you call a rose by any other name? 
And now, I got a song for you, boy
Telling the world about the joy inside my garden
In the shade, baby
'Cause my world was spinning 'round
Until you made my love come down
Never gonna let you go, no
I'm never gonna let you go
Lately all the flowers seem to be so plain
Can you call a rose by any other name? 
Here inside your garden it's like I feel I'm changed
Can you call a rose by any other name? 
 Anything you want
 Anything you need
 I can make it better
 Just for you
Anything you want, baby 
I can make a change 
Can you call a rose by any other name?
Come on and play with me
Your flower 
Are you strong enough to be my man?
That's my man, never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go
Lately all the flowers seem to be so plain
Can you call a rose by any other name?
Here inside your garden it's like I feel I'm changed
Can you call a rose by any other name?
 Anything you want
 Anything you need
 I can make it better
 Just for you
 Just for you
Anything you want, baby 
I can make a change
Can you call a rose by any other name? 
There's one thing, there's one thing, there's one thing I know
A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose
There's no other flower in my heart that grows
A rose is a rose
A rose is a rose
Oh, my flower
My rose, my flower
Growing, growing
Yes, you are
Growing, growing, growing, growing, growing
Yes, you are
Oh
Yes, you are
Oh, sing that song
