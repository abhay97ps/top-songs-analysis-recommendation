Once a girl I knew, all alone and unprepared
Everyone she knew, running scared
Then she found him or maybe he found her
His were gentle words she had never heard before
He said, "Lisa, listen to me
Don't you know where you belong?
Darling, Lisa, you can tell me
You've been silent for too long."
Once another man took her on a younger day
All a young girl can do is pray
Then she found him or maybe he found her
His were gentle words she had never heard before
She had never heard before
He said, "Lisa, listen to me
Don't you know where you belong?
Darling, Lisa, you can tell me...
You've been silent for too long."
He said, "Lisa, listen to me
Don't you know where you belong?
Darling, Lisa, you can tell me...
You've been silent for too long."
