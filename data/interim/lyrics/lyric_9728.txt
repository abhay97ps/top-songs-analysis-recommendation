Baby, baby with your hard luck story
You need a place to show the win
You'd still be waiting for me at the airport
While my ship was coming in
And New York, you're keeping me dancing
So, don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
So, don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
So, don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
So, don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
New York, New York, you keep me dancing, dancing
New York, New York, you keep me dancing, dancing
I'm so glad I saw your ad on every avenue
I'm so glad I saw your ad in every place we drove
It's a town so nice, they had to name it twice
New York, New York
It's so hot, so hot, like an old soft shoe
Don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
Don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
Don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
Don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
New York, New York, you've got me dancing, dancing
New York, New York, you've got me dancing, dancing
New York, New York, you've got me dancing, dancing
Don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
Don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
Don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
Don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
New York, New York, you keep me dancing, dancing
New York, New York, you keep me dancing, dancing
Dancing the night away
Oh, what a joy at the Barefoot Boy
The Glove remains the place to be
At 12 West the sound's the best
I guess you can come in your jeans
But I still prefer getting dressed up
But I still prefer getting dressed up for Regine's
Don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
Don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
Don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
Don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
New York, New York, you've got me dancing, dancing
New York, New York, you've got me dancing, dancing
New York, New York, you've got me dancing, dancing
New York, New York, you've got me dancing, dancing
New York, New York, you've got me dancing, dancing
New York, New York, you've got me dancing, dancing
Don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
Don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
Don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
Don't you beware, don't you beware, keep on dancing
New York, New York, you keep me dancing, dancing
New York, New York, you keep me dancing, dancing
