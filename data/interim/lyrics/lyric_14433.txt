Shoulder to the wheel
For someone else's selfish gain
Here there is no choosing
Working the clay
Wearing their anger like a ball and chain
Fire in the field
Underneath the blazing sun
But soon the sun was faded
And freedom was a song
I heard them singing when the day was done
Singing to the Holy One
Lead me on, lead me on
To a place where the river runs
Into Your keeping, oh
Lead me on, lead me on
The awaited deliverance
Comforts the seeking, lead on
Waiting for the train
Labeled with a golden star
Heavy hearted boarding
Whispers in the dark
"Where are we going--is it very far?"
Bitter cold terrain
Echoes of a slamming door
Chambers made for sleeping forever
Voices like thunder in a mighty roar
Cryin' to the Lord
Lead me on, lead me on
To a place where the river runs
Into Your keeping, oh
Lead me on, lead me on
The awaited deliverance
Comforts the seeking, lead on
Man hurts man
Time and time, time again
And we drown in the wake of our power
Somebody tell me why
Lead me on, lead me on
To a place where the river runs
Into Your keeping, oh
Lead me on, lead me on
The awaited deliverance
Comforts the seeking, lead on
Lead me on, lead me on
To a place where the river runs
Into Your keeping, oh
Lead me on, lead me on
The awaited deliverance
Comforts the seeking, oh, lead on
Lean on me
Lead on, lead on
It's the comfort I'm seeking
