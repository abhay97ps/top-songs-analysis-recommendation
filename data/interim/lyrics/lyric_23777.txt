Rollin' in the coupe, yeah
Yeah
Get it
Get it, get it, hey 
Cook it, cook it , huh 
Yeah
My dope in the bushes 
My dope in the bushes 
I know how to cook it 
My bitch good looking 
My bitch good looking 
My bitch good looking 
My dope in the bushes, I know how to cook it
Yeah 
Yeah, yeah 
I did the digital dash 
I fucked that bitch on the passenger 
I gave that junky a blast 
I sell that dope to your mama, though 
Hot on the street like thermometers 
You rats'll never be honorable 
They know I'ma keep that my word 
I hustle the first to the first 
These bitches be naggin' the kid 
They get on my motherfuckin' nerves 
I showed up with racks and they love me 
I'm smokin' that pack and on muddy 
Taliban on these hoes 
Give a Xan' to these hoes 
Got 'em playing with they nose 
I sleep on a beach off the avenue 
I came to your city with revenue 
I put in work, it was evident 
I slide on your ass in a seven-deuce 
Come back on your bitch in a six-trey 
Chevy, Mercedes, I keep 'em comin' 
Fuck all these bitches, I keep 'em comin' 
I pull up right now, I'm parallel 
I hit your block with them swangers 
My niggas ain't nothin' but some bangers 
I sit in the trap with the gangsters
These niggas can't come around here 'cause it's dangerous 
I be hangin' 'round here and I'm famous 
Gotta keep the trigger by my finger 
Hit her sideways when I banged her 
In the driveway on a Perc' 
I was sideways on a Perc' 
Had a stick on me, that's a first 
Got your bitch on me gettin' murked 
I post up and that's confident 
I boast up in a drop six 
Had a Ghost Royce and I pop shit 
I'm a dope boy with that car trip 
I came in the game, I had crack on me 
Got Bape on my back with some Act' on me 
I'm single and shit, now she latch on me 
I told 'em I'm back, I'm a bachelor 
I get focused on millions and everything 
I just took me a trip out to Africa 
See how we came from the mud and the bottom, we did it 
I see how they counted us out, bet they never gon' do it again 
You see why these niggas be hatin', ignorin', I'm goin' right in 
I was born to get this money in this life of sin 
I poured up before they got my dawg on murder again 
See the fire come out the ass on the Lamborghini 
When you say you love a nigga, do you really mean it? 
When I was sleepin' on the floor, you should see how they treated me 
I pour the Actavis, pop pills so I can fight the demons 
I did the digital dash 
I fucked that bitch on the passenger 
I gave that junky a blast 
I sell that dope to your mama, though 
Hot on the street like thermometers 
You rats'll never be honorable 
They know I'ma keep that my word 
I hustle the first to the first 
These bitches be nagging the kid
Fuck it, it is what it is
If you get hit, you get hit
I don't forget or forgive
Told myself never again
I don't let nobody in
Super just showed out again
And we just keep servin' and servin' again and again and again and again
I move the game up, I'm reckless
I'm Harlem shaking through the pressure
I might put Diddy on my next shit
I might could fit you in on Wednesday
I'm not here for no pretend shit
Just walked in with a girl that's making triple what I'm making, what an entrance
That's when you know it's a body
Zone 6, they know it's a body
Kirkwood, they know it's a body
Lil Mexico know it's a body
Scooter in here with the zombies
Gucci get out, it's a problem
I might take Quentin to Follies
You hate your life, just be honest
I got the digital dash
She want a picture with all of my niggas to just make the visual last
But she too embarrassed to ask
I got my foot on they neck and my foot on the gas
You remind me of a quarterback, your shit is all in the past
Esco and Boomin, they got it on smash
And I got the, I got the, I got the, I got the, I
I did the digital dash 
I fucked that bitch in the passenger
I gave that junky a blast
I sell that dope to your mama, though
