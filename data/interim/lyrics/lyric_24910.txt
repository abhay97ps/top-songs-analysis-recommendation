30, you a fool for this one
Oh, C-L-O-S-E
Ear Drummers
Mike WiLL Made-It
One rope in the chain, yeah, lightin' propane, yeah
Dousin' the flame, yeah, bounce for some change, yeah
Gang can't be tamed, yeah, ice in our veins, yeah
Somethin' feels strange, this cup is dangerous
Somethin' ain't right, dawg , we in too easy 
Been here all night, dawg, really, I'm tweakin', yeah 
Lookin' to pipe some, ass in the party, look like a pageant 
If we gon' fight some, beat it and dash it, lawyer do magic 
Love right up my avenue  but thatâ€™s just not up my avenue 
You cried and said, "Look what you made me do" 
It's not my fault that I don't wanna end up screwed 
And everything I'm tryna say, you beat me to it 
And all the ups and all the downs, we have been through it 
Now you're C-L-O-S-E , you're too C-L-O-S-E to me 
C-L-O-S-E 
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me
C-L-O-S-E to me 
I mean, seriously, can I breathe?
C-L-O-S-E
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me
You're too C-L-O-S-E to me 
You're so C-L-O-S-E  
You know I'm a dog and I can't control it 
Wanna settle someday but not at the moment 
I'ma stack up the cake like Obama told me 
Niggas smile in your face and they're not your homie 
Makin' me claustrophobic , bust down the AP and wet the Rollie 
Stop callin' me "brother," you barely know me 
Don't tell me you love me, you gotta show me 
I'm so anti , gotta get paid to go outside 
Blowin' on the strong like "How High" 
Haters still watch from the sideline 
Sremm and La Flame on the incline 
Mixin' up brands, it's drip time 
Stuck to the plan, had to get mine 
Stayed down and it paid off big time
So many, so many drugs
You only get so many, so many tries
So many, so many tries
You only get so many, so many tries
So many, so many tries
You only get so many, so many tries
So many, so many tries
You only get so many, so many tries
C-L-O-S-E 
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me 
C-L-O-S-E to me 
I mean, seriously, can I breathe? 
C-L-O-S-E 
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me 
You're too C-L-O-S-E to me 
You're so C-L-O-S-E
