Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Well, you ain't so big, you just tall, that's all
You got me workin', boss man, workin' 'round the clock
I wanna little drink of water, but you won't let Jimmy stop
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Well, you ain't so big, you just tall, that's all
Well, I'm gonna get me a boss man, one gonna treat me right
Work hard in the daytime, rest easy at night
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Well, you ain't so big, you just tall, that's all
