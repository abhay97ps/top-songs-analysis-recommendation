When they swing that way to the right, you swing to the left, you heard?
Papiyerr
Woo, damn
I ain't been broke in a minute, don't get offended
Tore off the bow in a Bentley, fucking your ho in her kidney
Fuck up the city, I do not dance, I jiggy
Gun is tucked under this Fendi
I like it, I spend it, I just came right out the jeweller
The ice on my neck, and my wrist, and my fist, I ain't finished
I was just workin' at Denny's, came back and counted some millions
I ain't no regular civillian
Red, yellow, green, look like my neck a chameleon
Ugh, okay, spin it, ugh
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I hit his bitch, he offended
I'm in Givenchy and Fendi
They let me finish
I cut that Chevy for four day
My scammer bussing bottles off the '08
I cannot cuff, she fucking on my brozay
I'm just gon' fuck her, treat her like a throwaway
Ooh, damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I'm at the mall out in Venice
I need it, swiping the digits
Calling up Kelz, he did 250 on biddie
It ain't no biggie, uh
Moncler, kick it
Fucked that lil' bih, made a viddie
She wanna leak it
She wanna send it
Ayy, fuck that bitch, my face wasn't in it
Damn, bitch do scams on bitty
Bands in my hands look pretty
Hit another band on the 'gram, I'm litty
When I was broke, man, she fronted, but then I got rich and I hit it
Homie, I don't dance, I jiggy
Weed is so strong, I feel like I'm Popeye off the spinach
I cut the corner and bend it
Bitch, I'm a menace like Dennis
Don't sell me pussy, I need a percentage
If you gon' fuck me, this shit is expensive
Nordstrom Rack, swipe my gift
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute, ayy 
I ain't been broke in a minute, damn 
I ain't been broke in a minute 
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute 
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute, damn
