I was heading home
I hadn't planned on you
I shouldn't be here now
But tell me what can I do?
The way you're looking in my eyes
Well, I'm beginning to realize it's true
It's you
And baby we've
Gone too far
I'm gonna wake up in your arms
Gone too far
But I can't help it
I'm falling
The way you look at me
The way I look at you
The way you're touching me
The way I'm touching you
You're pulling all the right strings, baby
You're saying all the right things, baby
To me
To me
And I believe we've
Gone too far
Feels too good to turn back now
Gone too far
But I can't help it
I'm falling
You're pulling all the right strings, baby
You're saying all the right things, baby
To me
To me
And don't you know we've
Gone too far
I'm gonna wake up in your arms
Gone too far
But I can't help it
I'm falling
Gone too far
Feels too good to turn back now
Gone too far
But I can't help it
I'm falling
