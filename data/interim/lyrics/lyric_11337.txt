Do you believe that you're on your own
Searching in vain for a closer friend
Love isn't blind, and you're not alone
Those heart-breaking days may have reached an end
Chorus:
I could be good for you, my my
I could be good for you, my my
So you're star-struck, living for the stage
You need a change of luck, that can be arranged
Consider your fate, think about your age
There's no time to wait for your luck to change
What you do now isn't my concern
Just let me know how you survive out there
I want you to know, I may not return
If you care to go, I'll take you anywhere
 - my my my
I could be good for you, I could be good for you
