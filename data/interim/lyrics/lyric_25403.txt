Uh, nobody, you know what I'm sayin', nobody, nobody thought a nigga would be right here, though, you know
That shit make like, that shit make, that shit make a difference in me and you
You was supposed to be here, nigga
Nigga, I wasn't 'posed to be in this motherfucker
Man, you know what I'm sayin'
Give all the glory to God and hard work
But you niggas gotta respect this shit, you know what I'm sayin'
I'm straight from the...
Where I'm at?  Where I go?  How did I get here? 
Walk around with a Smithfield 
I'm from the south, had a gold grill 
Remember doin' shows in Mobile 
Go against me and it's roadkill 
Wakin' up to see the sunrise 
I turned five, I got baptized 
We was livin' up in College Park 
Midnight, heard the gunfight 
Playin' football at Forest Park 
Gresham Park where your moment get defined 
The story of my life 
Way before I ever wrote a rhyme 
Have you ever done time? 
Lookin' at my kids through the blinds 
Confinement mind 
How you feelin' when you face a dime? 
The truth be told 
I'm supposed to be locked up and dead, cold 
In the mind of an old  white man, the black man soul
Felt like I was born on Mars 
Everybody starin' too hard 
They didn't really think I was a star 
Then I fucked around, beat the odds 
How did I get right here? 
Neck, wrist on chandelier 
Made me wanna drop some tears 
Thankin' God that I switched gears 
I'm from another lightyear, I'm a Martian 
One-third of a human, just partial 
I'm the Sergeant, the Captain, the Marshal 
I start to barf, it was too much potion
Too fast, everything in slow motion
I get the cash and my money keep grossin' 
Popped a bottle, champagne, we toastin'
Suicide doors on the coupe when they open 
They didn't believe in me 
Check the stats, number one, you see 
I bet my haters can't breathe
Nigga, don't even compare to me 
Street niggas, we rare, unique 
We can fuck 'em by the pair, by the three 
Chopper soundin' like a snare in a beat 
I'm from the A, I love your ass, it's a peach 
Where I'm from, niggas cash, don't lease 
Where I'm from, the stick's on the backseat 
Where I'm from, police put you six feet
A lot of bums and they sleepin' on the street 
Yeah, yeah, that's at home 
Nigga, go back to your fam' where you dead wrong 
Miss my dawg, dead and gone 
I can hear his voice telling me "Don't go alone" 
Yeah, the money can't fix that 
Dirty money, had to rinse that 
I try my hardest not to look back 
Not too long ago a nigga would've took that 
This for my niggas had to cook packs 
Million dollar trap fall 'cause of one rat 
Yeah, ain't no comin' back 
How I made it out the jungle, yeah, without a scratch 
Where I'm at?  Where I go?  How did I get here?

Confinement mind 
How you feelin' when you face a dime? 
The truth be told 
I'm supposed to be locked up and dead, cold 
In the mind of an old  white man, the black man soul
Baptized at First Baptist Church
The pastor name was Reverend Johnson 
Chastised his shirt and matchin' shoes
But had to front, it never bothered him 
Hurt his pride but he swallowed it 
Dirt is all that he spotted
And in the dirty south where bodies pilin' up
So high, they block the birds and rerouted 'em 
Plenty murderers had observers but
You never heard a peep out of them
So many funerals it ain't enough numerals to keep count of them 
Look, I'm just settin' the scene
Back when I stared at the phone as I'm lettin' it ring
Another collector, they leave us a message
My mama in deficit, must intervene
I bust out the seams, I'm gettin' too big for these britches now
I invest in the dream, I'm destined for green
I got superstar dick for these bitches now
I got superstar dick for these bitches now
And I think about that when I dig 'em out
Where I'm at?  Where I go?  How did I get here?
