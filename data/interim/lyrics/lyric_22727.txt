I see main street closing
Miles of “for sale” signs
And them fields ain’t growing
Fast enough to get us by
I feel the sweet release
Of a Friday night
For a couple of hours we can run this town
Till it runs dry
Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off of your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back
So grab the girl you came with
And set her world on fire
And watch her sway and singing to the music
Until it’s all alright
Yeah
Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off of your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back
I don’t wanna lose this feeling
And I don’t wanna close my eyes
I don’t wanna remember what I’m here to forget tonight
So tip it on back
Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off of your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back
Yeah, I don’t wanna lose this feeling
I don’t wanna close my eyes
I don’t wanna remember what i’m here to forget tonight
So tip it on back
Just tip it on back
Feel the sweet release of a friday night
For a couple of hours we can run this town
Till it runs dry
Tip it on back
