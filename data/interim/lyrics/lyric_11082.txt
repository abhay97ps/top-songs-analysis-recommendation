Now from the morning to the afternoon
I keep myself ready and in tune
Check my stick, I'm workin' great
I'm bein' programmed to please my mate
I get high on your love
I get high
Baby, I'm in love
I get high on your love
I get high on your love
Now a whistle turns me on
And if you notice, bang a gong
Now I work on solar power
And my batteries can last for hours
I get high on your love
I get high on your love
Baby, I'm in love
I get high on your love
I get high on your love
Now a whistle turns me on
And if you notice, bang a gong
Now I work on solar power
And my batteries can last for hours
I gеt high on your love
I get high
Baby, I'm in love
I gеt high on your love
I get high on your love
I get high on your love
I get high
Baby, I'm in love
I get high on your love
I get high on your love
