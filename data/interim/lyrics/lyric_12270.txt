Love is not the thrill
Of the first connection
Love is not the shiver
In the first embrace
Love is never lost
In the first rejection
If you're thinking
Love comes easy
It's going to disappear
Without a trace
Because what love is?
Is that spark that survives
What love is?
It's worth keeping alive
All this fire while rain
Is pouring in from every side
What love is?
Is admitting we're blind
What love is
When we're trying to find
What love is?
Now I know you've been captured
By a vague suspicion
But, baby, you know
That you heard it from a jealous liar
Can we start improving
On our heart's condition?
Can we stop wasting
All this precious fire? Yeah
Because what love is?
Is that spark that survives
What love is?
It's worth keeping alive
All this fire while rain
Is pouring in from every side
What love is?
Is admitting we're blind
What love is
When we're trying to find
What love is?
Is it the fear of living all alone?
Year after year
I just don't know
But I know I want you here beside me
Is it the need to fill empty place?
Where does it lead, I got to know
'Cause only together
Could we ever hope to see
What love is?
It's the pulse in our veins
What love is?
The pleasures and pain
It survives while rain
Is pouring in from every side
What love is?
Not who's wrong or who's right
What love is?
Waiting for us tonight
What love is?
You have to help me to
Find out just what love is
What love is? What love is?
What love is?
