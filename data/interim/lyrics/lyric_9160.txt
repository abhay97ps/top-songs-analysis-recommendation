I know you're getting tired of hearing the same old song
People talking about what's right and what's wrong
But I think I gotta tell you about it one more time
Revolution evolution execution
These are facts of life we gotta deal with them right now
I remember when every man had a friend
He could depend on
But my oh my how times have changed
People can't even recall each other's name
And I'm tired of all this stress and strain
Cause we all gotta stick together
We all gotta stick together
We all Gotta stick together
Well you know it's going to be a scene
If we can't begin loving each other more and more every day
Share in each other's love and trust and pride
As we go through life side by side
Together
Yeah We all gotta stick together
We all gotta stick together
We all gotta stick together
Everybody we should throw away our pride
And we shouldn't hide all the things we feel for one another
Oh it's popular today to say that love is dead
Naw it's fretting that's dead and we're all going to live together one more time
We all gotta stick together
We all gotta stick together
We all gotta stick together
We all gotta stick together
We all gotta stick together
We all gotta stick together
