Wrap It Up 
I've been watchin' you for days now baby
I just love your sexy ways now baby
Ya know our love will never stop now baby
Just put your lovin' in my box now baby
Chorus 2x
Well no more will I shop around now baby
I know I got the best thing in town now baby
I've seen all I want to see now baby
Bring your lovin' straight to me now baby
Chorus 4x  2x 4 measures
Well I'm gonna treat you like the queen you are
Bring you sweet things from my candy jar
You've got tricks you ain't never used
Give it, Give it to me, it won't be abused
Repeat 1st verse, Chorus 4x
