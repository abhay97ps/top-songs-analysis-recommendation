Don't stop!
Keep on doing, what you're doing, baby
Keep on doing, doing, doing, doing what you're doing baby
Don't stop!
I need it and I need it bad, but I don't get it, you know it makes me mad
I'm a more toe'd brother and I don't no mess
When I do my thing I do my best
Keep on doing, what you're doing, baby
Keep on doing, doing, doing, doing what you're doing baby
Don't stop!

I'm gonna give ya satisfaction, hey, cause my love is strong
Keep on doing
Keep on doing, don't stop
Keep on doing, don't stop
Keep on, keep on, don't stop
Keep on, keep on, doing
Yeah, hey!
Keep on doing, doing, doing, doing what you're doing baby
Keep on doing, doing, doing, doing what you're doing baby
Don't stop, hey!
I need it and I need it bad, but I don't get it, you know it makes me mad
I'm a more toe'd brother and I don't no mess
When I do my thing I do my best
Keep on, I said keep on, keep on
