There's a full moon in the sky
It's got a hold on me, I'm hypnotized
Like your love it's getting stronger
Please keep my heart a little longer
Indian Summer is on its way
It's cool at night, and hot all day
Ain't no black clouds filled with rain
Santa Ana wind blew them all to Maine
Baby takes my hand
She says she understands
About the way I feel
She knows this love is real
I'm a wide open space cowboy
I got lazy ways I got some hidden joy
Motorcycle and tons of RPM
Ain't gonna wait around till it's here again
Baby takes my hand
She says she understands
About the way I feel
She knows my love is real
An Indian Summer is on its way
It's cool at night, and hot all day
There ain't no black clouds filled with rain
Santa Ana wind blew them all to Maine
Blew them all to Maine
