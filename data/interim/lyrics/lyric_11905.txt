Loving you so
I was to blind to see
You letting me go
But now that you've set me free
It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you
Oh, didn't you know
It wouldn't be so easy?
You lettin' me go
You can be sure that now
It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you
Oh, though I know I can't
Forget about you
I'm gonna try
To show you how much
You're turning me around
Destroying me
I'll never be
The same as before you
You must realize
You took your love and left me
Quite by surprise
You can be sure that now
It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy about you
Gonna take a miracle 
It's gonna take a miracle 
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy about you
Gonna take a miracle 
It's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you 
It's gonna take a miracle 
It's gonna take a miracle 
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you 
It's gonna take a miracle 
It's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy, crazy, crazy about you, ah, yeah
Gonna take a miracle

To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you 
It's gonna take a miracle
