She falls apart by herself
No one's there to talk or understand
Feels the sting, dries her eyes
Finds herself opens the door and sighs
People see right through you
Everyone who knew you well
Falls apart, might as well
Day is long and nothing is wasted
Runaway, runaway
Wanna hold on to you but you're going away
Runaway, runaway
Wanna hold you tomorrow but you're leaving today
You walk along by yourself
There's no sound nothing's changing
They've gone away left you there
Emptiness is nothing you can share
All those words that hurt you
More than you will let it show
Comes apart by yourself
All is well and everything's wasted
Runaway, runaway
Wanna hold on to you but you're going away
Runaway, runaway
Wanna hold you tomorrow but you're leaving today
Sometimes I feel around
It scares me some I can't be down
All this time to be on my own
In is out to be again
This time will waste another friend
I know where they will know
Where they'll runaway
She's falls apart no one there
Hold her hand it seems to disappear
Falls apart might as well
Day is long and nothing is wasted
Runaway, runaway
Wanna hold on to you but you're going away
Runaway, runaway
Wanna hold you tomorrow but you're leaving today
Runaway runaway
Hold on to you but you're going away
But you're leaving today
But you're leaving today
