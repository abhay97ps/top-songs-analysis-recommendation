I've waited, oh, so long
For you to come to me
What did I do wrong?
It's all a mystery to me
Baby, I feel it too
What am I supposed to do?
Maybe I've just changed
Or could I be wrong for you?
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
Do you mean to say
That after all this time
I waited like a fool
Now who been changing you?!
You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
Come on, child, take me by the hand
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
Stop hanging on the bus, I'm waiting on you
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
Hang on, hang on yeah
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
Come on child, take me by the hand
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
