Every time I leave, she beg for me to stay
But baby girl, I can't
I run the streets all night, run the streets all day
Run the streets all day
And me don't want love, love is for the weak man, yeah
Me cannot trust, me cannot depend
Yeah, yeah 
Yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, mhm
Somehow I keep on losing all my friends
I came to the conclusion it's not them
Where do I go to get some peace? Tossing, turning when I sleep
Change my number every week, I got some pain that's running deep, yeah
I don't shed tears anymore, 'cause love don't live here anymore
I'm sorry, baby girl, I got to go, whether if you like it or you don't
'Cause I've been here too many times before, yeah
I wonder when they look at me, yeah
I wonder what they see
Wondering if they can see the pain underneath
Wondering if they can see the change I increased
Brother really swang it for me
We tear down their whole gang when it's beef
Leave a nigga brains in the street
50K'll have 'em swangin' for weeks
You better have that thang when they creep, yeah
And I can't get no sleep, I got to stay up
I'm in love with the streets, I can't lay up
It's like I feel myself falling, then I wake up, up
I'ma die a paper chaser
My whole life, I been running, baby
Like someone's coming, baby
I have a hard time trusting, baby
Can't trust for nothing, babe
And every time I leave, she beg for me to stay
But baby girl, I can't
I run the streets all night, run the streets all day
Run the streets all day
And me don't want love, love is for the weak man, yeah
Me cannot trust, me cannot depend, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, mhm
That nigga said, "Me don't want love, love is for the weak man"
Hahaha, fuck is wrong with you?
