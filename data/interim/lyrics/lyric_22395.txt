A buh-buh buh buh-buh 
You went to school to learn, girl
Things you never, never knew before
Like I before E except after C
And why 2 plus 2 makes 4
Now now now, I'm gonna teach you 
All about love, dear 
Sit yourself down and take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me
ABC, easy as 123
Oh, simple as do re mi
ABC, 123, baby, you and me, girl
ABC, easy as 123 
Oh, simple as do re mi
ABC, 123, baby, you and me, girl
Come on, let me love you just a little bit
Come on, come on, come on, let me show you what it's all about
Reading, writing, arithmetic
Are the branches on the learning tree
But listen, without the roots of love, let me tell you, girl
Your education ain't complete
T-t-t-teacher's gonna show you 
How to get an A 
Spell "me", "you", add the two
Listen to me, baby, that's all you gotta do
Oh, ABC, it's easy as 123
Oh, simple as do re mi
ABC, 123, baby, you and me, girl
ABC, it's easy, it's like counting up to 3 
Sing a simple melody 
That's how easy love can be
That's how easy love can be
Sing a simple melody 
123, you and me!
Sit down girl, I think I love you!
No, get up girl, show me what you can do!
Shake it, shake it, baby 
Shake it, shake it, baby 
Shake it shake it, baby 
123, baby 
ABC, baby 
Do re mi, baby
That's how easy love can be
ABC, it's easy, it's like counting up to 3 
Sing a simple melody 
That's how easy love can be
I'ma gonna teach you how to sing it out
Come on, come on, come on, let me show you what it's all about
ABC, it's easy, it's like counting up to 3 
Sing a simple melody 
That's how easy love can be
I'ma gonna teach you how to sing it out, sing it out
Oh, oh, oh baby
Sing it out, sing it out, sing it!
ABC, it's easy, it's like counting up to 3 
Sing a simple melody 
That's how easy love can be
I'ma gonna teach you how to sing it out, sing it out
Easy as 123!
