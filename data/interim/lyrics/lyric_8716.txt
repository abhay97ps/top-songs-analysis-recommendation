If loving you is wrong, I don't want to be right
If being right means being without you
I'd rather live a wrong-doing life
Your mama and daddy say it's a shame
It's a downright disgrace
But long as I got you by my side
I don't care what your people say
My friends tell me it's no future in loving a married man
If I can't see you when I want
I'll have to see you when I can
If loving you is wrong, I don't want to be right
If loving you is so wrong, baby
I don't want to be right
Am I wrong to fall, ooh, so deeply in love with you
Knowing you have a wife and two little children
Depending on you too
Am I wrong to hunger for the gentleness of your touch
Knowing you have someone else at home
Who needs you just as much
Am I wrong to give my love to a married man
And am I wrong for trying to hold on to the best thing I ever had
If loving you is wrong, I don't want to be right
If loving you is wrong, I don't want to be right, baby
Oohaaow!
No, baby.  Heh, eh, eh, eh.  Uh, uh
Tell me, baby
Am I wrong to give my love to a married man?
Am I wrong for trying to hold on to the best thing I ever had
If loving you is so wrong, I don't want to be right
If loving you is wrong, baby, I just can't be right
Ohaaow!
I don't wanna be right.  No, baby
I don't wanna be right.  Oh, baby, heh
Ohaaow!  I've been loving you a little bit too long
I can't give up on your loving now
I love you, want you, need you, got to have you
Heeeeeeeeey!  Good god almighty, baby
I love you.  Mmmm, hmmm
I need you.  Let me have you
