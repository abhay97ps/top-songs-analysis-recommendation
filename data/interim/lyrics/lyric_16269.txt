Tell me why? Why must we wait until tonight?
Tell me why? Why must we wait until tonight?
You wanna take a little time
Wanna drink me like a fine wine
Write the book of love line by line
But I want to play with you, ooh...mmmm...right now
Go all the way with you,baby...and show you how
'Cause my body just can't say no
And fingers just won't let go
Tell me why? Baby. Why must we wait until tonight? Oh, yeah
Tell me why? Why, when I've waited all my life?
You're touching me, I'm touching you...
Oooh, what should I do? Now tell me why, why must we wait 'till tonight?
You like to take it real slow
Show me every little move you know
Take a little love and watch it grow
But I want to lay with you...darling
Right now
Make love all day with you baby
And show you how...
Take my body, don't take my time
Take your lips and make them mine
Aaaaw
Tell me why? Baby. Why must we wait until tonight? Oh, yeah
Tell me why? Why, when I've waited all my life?
You're touching me, I'm touching you...
Oooh, what should I do? Now tell me why, why must we wait 'till tonight?
Come on
Come on
'Cause my body just can't say "no"
And my fingers just won't let go
Baby!
Oh tell me why?
Why must we wait until tonight
Tell me baby...yeah
Tell me why, when I've waited all my life - like you know I did
Come on, tell me why...why must we wait until tonight? Come on. Come on
Ohh.Tell me why, why when I've waited all my life. Tell me why
