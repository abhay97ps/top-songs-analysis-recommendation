Think I better let you know
That it's time for you to go
'Cause you're gonna break my heart
Think I better let you know
That it's time for you to go
'Cause you're gonna break my heart
Drop that ghetto blaster
To the Bat Cave, let's go
My head is numb, without thought it was
My heart is numb but you thought it did
When I look in the mirror, it just takes place
'Cause when I see, I see your face
Now you don't know what's going on
'Cause you just think that I've been wrong
But I tell you, babe, what's going on
It is your feeling that's too strong
Think I better let you know
That it's time for you to go
'Cause you're gonna break my heart
Think I better let you know
That it's time for you to go
'Cause you're gonna break my heart
House music all night long
House music all night long
House music all night long
Drop that ghetto blaster
House music all night long
House music all night long
House music all night long
To the Bat Cave, let's go
We knew this love was just a game
I thought you felt, you felt the same
And now it's time for you to say
That I must go my own way
Now here I am, all alone
Waiting for you by the phone
'Cause I can't live without you no more
I only love you and that's for sure
Think I better let you know
That it's time for you to go
'Cause you're gonna break my heart
Think I better let you know
That it's time for you to go
'Cause you're gonna break my heart
Drop that ghetto blaster
To the Batmobile, let's go
My head is numb, without thought it was
My heart is numb but you thought it did
When I look in the mirror, it just takes place
'Cause when I see, I see your face
Now you don't know what's going on
'Cause you just think that I've been wrong
But I tell you, babe, what's going on
It is your feeling that's too strong
Think I better let you know
That it's time for you to go
'Cause you're gonna break my heart
Think I better let you know
That it's time for you to go
'Cause you're gonna break my heart
Think I better let you know
That it's time for you to go
'Cause you're gonna break my heart
Think I better let you know
That it's time...
