I just look at you and I'm hypnotized
Like I'm drowning now, drowning in your eyes
You are beautiful, past imagining
And I want you more, more than anything
And I cannot speak, and I've lost my sight
All my senses gone, lost in you tonight
And I want your love
Be my lady, be my lady, be my lady
Do I ask too much, do I want too much
Want to know you now, want to feel your touch
You just look at me, feel the fire start
Want to make you burn, want to touch your heart
And I cannot speak, and I've lost my sight
All my senses gone, lost in you tonight
And I want your love
Be my lady, be my lady, be my lady, lady
C'mon girl
Got a racing heart and my mind's a roar
Never felt like this, never loved before
And it's dangerous, I would willingly
Burn to ashes now, if you'll stay with me
And I cannot speak, and I've lost my sight
All my senses gone, lost in you tonight
And I want your love
Be my lady, you know I love you now
Be my lady
Won't you be my lady
