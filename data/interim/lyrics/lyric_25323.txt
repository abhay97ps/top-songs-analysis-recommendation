Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Feelin' so good, might smoke somethin' 
Hit it so good, might choke somethin' 
Might pull out, the game so weak
Fuck it, you can go and have both of 'em
Zone 6 nigga, I come from
Neighborhood soundin' like, "Pop, pop" 
Pick 'em up, roll 'em out
All of that drip drip there got young boy drop drop 
Ayy ayy , oh 
Where that money go? 
I was livin' fast 
They gon' watch 'em slow 
All these niggas got six figures, they won't miss an O 
I'm gon' shoot they baby mama if I got the pole, oh, ayy 
Bodyguards goin' through customs 
Both of them boys got handguns
'Cause most of your friends, can't trust 'em
Clout chasin' 
Let me truth on the verse 
If they paid you to do it, you don't gotta ask what you worth
Me and Savage, we came from the dirt
If you rappin' for money, you silly
This shit ain't a milli', this shit is a hundred
The industry savage and most of you average
Ain't 'fraid of no static, I'm bustin', I'm bustin'
He might be an addict, he drinkin' that 'Tussin
He know where you live, where you work, do you trust him? 
Power
The money and the fame make a monster

She below the belt, that's a low blow 
She gon' try and blame it on YOLO 
Niggas out here tryna rap beef 
I ain't givin' no free promo 
He cuffin', he a cop like Robo 
I'ma pass her to the gang like Romo 
Brand new 'Rari, I'm solo 
Finna go shoppin' in SoHo 
You could dump me in the middle of the ocean
I'm still comin' out dry 
You can leave me in the jungle with bears and tigers
I'm comin' out fly 
I'll take the stand for my brother
Put my hand on the Bible, I'm still gon' lie 
You can have all the fame in the world
All the money in the world, won't stop no cry 
Pain and the hunger made a savage 
Came from the bottom, disadvantaged 
Then I started livin' my dreams 
That shit turned me to an addict 
It ain't 'bout the money, you can have it 
Shawty got a booty, I'ma grab it 
In the fast lane, tryna dodge traffic 
But I ain't never dodged no static 
War wounds, I got scars 
Teachers told me I wouldn't be nothin' but I went far 
I could pay your salary for ten years with one car 
All the pain and all the struggle made a superstar 
Power
The money and the fame make a monster
A monster
Power
The money and the fame make a monster
A monster
