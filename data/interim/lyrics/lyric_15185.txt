I still remember the first time
You said that you love me
You held me in your arms and said
You'd never ever leave me
And all this promises you kept
Have erased the past when I once wept
You made my fantasies come true
My heart belongs to you
You're my dream boy
You show me your love in every way
You're faithful to me every day
Now I know that dreams come true
You're my dream boy
My friends told me that I'm real lucky
To have a girl like you
'Cause all the girls I ever had
Their love was never true
And you have brought me happiness
I treasure the day when we first met, yeah
Never ever gonna let you go
Because I love you so
You're my dream girl
You don't neglect me in any way
You make me feel special every day
Now I know that dreams come true
You're my dream boy
You came and filled my heart with joy
And I can smile again
'Cause I found a love that will never end
You say that I'm your dream boy
That I fill your heart with joy
Well, you're my dream girl
You're all I want in this world
You give me the love I need
I know we were meant to be
Talk to me
When you hold me in your arms
I feel so safe and warm
When you look into my eyes
You have me hypnotized
You give me all your love
You're all I'm thinking of
You made my dreams come true
My heart belongs to you
You're my dream boy
You show me your love in every way
You're faithful to me every day
Now I know that dreams come true
You're my dream boy
You don't neglect me in any way
You make me feel special every day
Now I know that dreams come true
You're my dream boy
You show me your love in every way
You're faithful to me every day
Now I know that dreams come true
You're my dream boy
You don't neglect me in any way
You make me feel special every day
Now I know that dreams come true
You're my dream boy
