Bow bow bow bow oop
Ahh ooo oohh waaa oooo
The other night they were playing our song
Hadn't heard it for oh so long
Took me back darling to that time in my car
When you cried all night cause we'd gone too far
Can I ever get you back
Get you back baby
Going to get you back get you back
Get you back get you back baby
Going to get you back get you back
Can I ever get you back
I'm getting tired laying around here at night
Thinking about some other guy holding you tight
He may have money and a brand new car
May even treat you like a movie star
And no matter what he ever do for you
He can never love you like I can do
So if I leave her and you leave him
Bow bow bow oop
 I'll leave her
 and you leave him
 can we baby
 get it back again
 I'll leave her
 and you leave him
