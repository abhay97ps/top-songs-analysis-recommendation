22 million dollars in cash left on the street
The boy who picked up the cash? Went on a mission
It's the most money I've ever felt or touched
Buddah, Huncho, go!
Woo, woo, woo, woo 
I brought my niggas to the bank, then we cashed out
I brought my bitch to the bank, then she passed out 
Woo, woo, woo, yes sir
Woo , woo , yes sir
I do not talk about niggas out my damn mouth 
I pull up on you, pull the trigger, then I air it out 
Woo, woo, woo, yes sir
Woo , woo, woo, woo, yes sir
Skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr 
Skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr
Yeah, whip it like I can't stand it 
Pull up, park and do damage 
Trap house to a mansion 
I put that on my granny 
Grandma, yeah
Grandma
Let me see that lighter 
Fire a nigga ass up, yerr 
Missed his head so I caught him in the ear 
I should face tattoo a hundred tears 
All these rappers wanna make disappear 
In the spotlight lookin' like deers 
'Specially when we pull up pressin' 
'Specially when we pull up flexin' 
'Specially when we pull up checkin' 
150 cash on a necklace 
Young nigga scrapin' them extras 
Movin' 'em blocks, no Tetris 
Wrap 'em a lot like Texas
I brought my niggas to the bank, then we cashed out
I brought my bitch to the bank, then she passed out 
Woo, woo, woo, yes sir
Woo , woo , yes sir
I do not talk about niggas out my damn mouth 
I pull up on you, pull the trigger, then I air it out 
Woo, woo, woo, yes sir
Woo , woo, woo, woo, yes sir
Lil' mama fine as hell, but she actin' saditty 
I'm not Will Smith, but I'm tryna get jiggy 
I can show you how to make a band like Diddy
Get up out yo' feelings 'fore this choppa make you dance like Shiggy 
6 God just like Drizzy 
Shoot you in the back like Ricky 
Seats peanut butter like Jiffy 
Y'all niggas rats like Mickey 
Thick women only, I'm picky 
Yellow diamonds on me, they pissy 
Elliot the one did all my ice, but I'm not talkin' bout Missy 
Pick your side 
One man army, don't need no side 
Rolls-Royce truck 
Your bitch gettin' down on her knees inside 
Y'all gotta put shit together, 'cause your money short, nigga, like Yeezy slides 
The Bentley truck came with them, I ain't even have to put no TVs inside
I brought my niggas to the bank, then we cashed out
I brought my bitch to the bank, then she passed out 
Woo, woo, woo, yes sir
Woo , woo , yes sir
I do not talk about niggas out my damn mouth 
I pull up on you, pull the trigger, then I air it out 
Woo, woo, woo, yes sir
Woo , woo, woo, woo, yes sir
Skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr
Skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr
Yeah, hey! Only God I fear 
It's ten bricks in the Lear 
Draco came with a mirror 
To watch my back 
Heard he got whacked 
The bando back 
Cookin' from scratch 
Heard you the man now
You do the dirt with your hands, huh? 
Get it for a lil' bit of change, feel like you pickin' up cans now 
Satellites on the plane, think the prezi flyin' 
Beep, beep! Fuck it, dead line 
Took your bitch to the bank, now her head's mine 
If I ever have kids, inherit my bread line
