Watch me now
Here I go
All I need's a little snow
Starts me off
Sets the theme
Helps me dream my Christmas dream
Every year I dream it
Hoping things will change
An end to the crying
The shouting, the dying
And I hope you
Will dream it too
It's Christmas, remember
We've got to remember
So light the light
I'm home tonight
I need you to warm me
To calm me, to love me
To help me to dream my Christmas dream
Crazy things said and done
Every single day but one
Every night should, I believe
Be the same as Christmas Eve
Nights should all be silent
Days should all slow down
An end to the hurry
The noise and the worry
And I hope you
Believe that too
It's Christmas, remember
Does no one remember
The whole world needs
A Christmas dream
We need it to warm us
To calm us, to love us
To help us to dream our Christmas dream
The whole world needs
A Christmas dream
We need it to warm us
To calm us, to love us
We need it to warm us
To calm us, to love us
We need it to warm us
To calm us, to love us
To help us to dream our Christmas dream
