{CHORUS}
When I move I move lo key
Vvs they shine on me
Be great like Mohammed Ali
Get packs and send them to my G
Kamakazi they riding for me
Plant a seed watch it grow like tree
Wallahi they know I ain’t sweet
I move and speak indiscreet
When I move I move lo key
Vvs they shine on me
Be great like Mohammed Ali
Get packs and send them to my G
Kamakazi they riding for me
Plant a seed watch it grow like tree
Wallahi they know I ain’t sweet
I move and speak indiscreet

{VERSE}
Devil tired tryna take my soul , kept the shii  soild never fold
It’s a burden so i owe nobody, had to stay down with my G
2 for 3 you could come and get ur own now
Live  fast.....Never try to slow down
They ain’t seen what I’ve seen had to ice out my rings
If u wanna play don’t play around me
I was really in the ally u could ask bout me
Could give 8 fucks if they hating on me
Dolce and Gabbana on me
Walk like a cheque so I know they pree me
Finger in her coochie told her lick it till it’s clean
She a freak I know she won’t leave me
They kappin they ain’t living like it seems
Shine like the sun when it’s up
I gotta get paid that’s a must
No I ain’t taking no losses
Fuck up next I got tired of the wait
Dedicate myself I can’t fail
When I move I leave no trail
No I ain’t tryna stay the same
Toke flight I’m tryna elevate
{CHORUS}
When I move I move lo key
Vvs they shine on me
Be great like Mohammed Ali
Get packs and send them to my G
Kamakazi they riding for me
Plant a seed watch it grow like tree
Wallahi they know I ain’t sweet
I move and speak indiscreet
When I move I move lo key
Vvs they shine on me
Be great like Mohammed Ali
Get packs and send them to my G
Kamakazi they riding for me
Plant a seed watch it grow like tree
Wallahi they know I ain’t sweet
I move and speak indiscreet
When I move I move lo key
When I move I move lo key
Vvs they shine on me
