Hahaha, huh? Hahaha
Tired of niggas cappin' 
Trap House Mob
Niggas frontin' their jewels 
They ain't expectin' this one 
Flex, my bitch love coco 
Woo back, baby , woo 
Let me see some, okay, okay , okay, okay
Look, you cannot say Pop and forget the Smoke 
I'm from the Floss where niggas tote 
They couldn't be Crips, so they turned Folks 
Drivin' through the 'Ville, droppin' the cho 
I gotta laugh, 'cause these niggas jokes 
Dread like, "Who these niggas?" 
"I don't know" , but I'm on go 
And I'm in that Bugatti, movin' two hundred 
Givin' pumps, like, "Who shot ya?" 
Me and Trey, that's four choppers 
Man down , all you see is helicopters 
Paramedics pick him up, they gon' send him to the doctor 
I'm in the hood like an engine, revvin' 
My checks is clearin' , your checks is pending 
And I got a couple gangstas, let me know 
If you want smoke 
'Cause boy I can send 'em 
And I got a bad bitch, ass up 
Face down , yeah, she love doggy style 
And she got a Louis bag , that hold the extendo 
Okay, okay 
Okay, okay
Flex, my bitch love coco 
Woo back, baby , woo
Let me see some, okay, okay , okay, okay 
My bitch love coco 
Woo back, baby , woo
Let me see some, okay, okay , okay, okay 
Got it jumpin out the zoo, seein' red, seein' blue 
Young La Flame, how it moves, Pop Flare how it— 
Braid my hair down 'til I hide my face
Duck away, she wanna lay up and hibernate 
I took a chance, it's a lot to take
I took a right, ended up right away 
She need a chunk, not a piece 
It cost me three for the keys 
Not the work but the V
She let it twirl to the beat
I send the work, bet it reach 
Wearin' pearls, expensive beads 
I only hurl at my peeps 
Cuts, diamond cuts out in public
Two cups of the stuff, now I'm up
Coco Chanel when she tuck it
We bunk, get a nut 
My bitch love coco 
Woo back, baby , woo
Let me see some, okay, okay , okay, okay 
My bitch love coco 
Woo back, baby , woo
Let me see some, okay, okay , okay, okay
