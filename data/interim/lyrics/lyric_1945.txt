Goodnight, my love 
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love 
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me
Before you go 
There's just one thing I'd like to know 
Is your love is still warm for me
Or has it grown cold?
If you should awake in the still of the night
Please have no fear
For I'll be there
You know I care
Please give your love to me, dear, only 
Goodnight, my love 
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love 
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me
And bring you closer to me
