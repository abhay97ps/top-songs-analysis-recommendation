If there was no tomorrow
Then tonight would never end
If we could freeze the hands of time
I would stay here in your arms
And not go back again
'Cause all I want
Is for you to hold me now
And we can make it through
This night together
And all I need
Is for you to show me how
'Cause nothing can stop
This feeling of forever
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh
I've never felt this close enough
Lying here face to face
Far beneath the silver sky
And there's no one around
To chase this night away
The world is ours tonight
As long as we just believe
The feelings that we hold inside are
In every heart that beats
And these feelings of forever
Oh
