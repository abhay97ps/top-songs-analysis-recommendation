Lucretia Mac Evil, little girl, what's your game?
Hard luck and trouble, bound to be your claim to fame
Tail shakin', home breakin,' truckin' through town
Each and every country mother's son hangin' 'round
Drive a young man insane, Evil, that's your name
Lucretia Mac Evil, that's the thing you're doin' fine
Back seat Delilah, that's your sixth big jug of wine woman
I hear your mother was the talk of the sticks
Nothin' that your daddy wouldn't do for kicks
Never done a thing worthwhile, evil woman child
Devil got you, Lucy under lock and key
Ain't about to set you free
Signed, sealed and witnessed on the day you were born
No use tryin' to fake him out, no use tryin' to make him out
Soon he'll be takin' out his doom
What you goin' do, oh
Lucretia Mac Evil
Honey, where have you been all night?
You hairs all messed up baby
An' the clothes you're wearin' just don't fit you right no
Big Daddy Joe's payin' your monthly rent
Tells his wife he can't imagine where the money went
Dressin' you up in style, evil woman child
Oh, Lucy you're just so damn bad
Ah here she comes
Truckin'
Well Lucy
Walkin' down main street lookin'
Lucy wow!
Talk about it!
Where have you been girl?
Stop lying stop lying stop lying
Lucy
Wow!
Tell the truth girl!
