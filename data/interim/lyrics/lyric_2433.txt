Since you left me and you said goodbye
All I do is sit and cry
You went away and left me misery
And that's the way it'll always be
You said you loved me and you'd always be mine
We'd be together 'til the end of time
Now you say it was just a game
But all you're doin' is leavin' me pain
Time goes by and goes so slow
It just doesn't seem true
Only just a few days ago
You said you'd love me, never make me blue
Now you've gone and I'm all alone
And you're still way up there on your throne
Nothin' seems to ever go right
'Cause night is day and day is night
