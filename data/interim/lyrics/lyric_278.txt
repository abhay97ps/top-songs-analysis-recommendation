There's a man in the funny papers we all know
He lived 'way back a long time ago
He don't eat nothin' but a bear cat stew
Well, this cat's name is-a Alley Oop
 He's the toughest man there is alive
 Wearin' clothes from a wildcat's hide
 He's the king of the jungle jive
He got a chauffeur that's a genuwine dinosawruh
And he can knuckle your head before you count to fawruh
He got a big ugly club and a head fulla hairuh
Like great big lions and grizzly bearuhs
 He's the toughest man there is alive
 Wearin' clothes from a wildcat's hide
 He's the king of the jungle jive
He rides thru the jungle tearin' limbs offa trees
Knockin' great big monstahs dead on their knees
The cats don't bug him cuz they know bettah
Cuz he's a mean motah scootah and a bad go-gettah
 He's the toughest man there is alive
 Wearin' clothes from a wildcat's hide
 He's the hullie-gullie king of jive
Thair he goes
Look at that cave man go
Ride, Daddy, ride
Hi-yo dinosawruh
