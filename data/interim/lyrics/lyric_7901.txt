If a fool like you could listen to a fool like me
And if the leaves on the trees could stop shaking in the wind
If a fool like you could listen to a fool like me
Maybe, baby, we could stop long enough to begin
Cryin' with the millionaire is like laughin' with the old street bum
Send him off down to the coliseum, promise him kingdom come
And when the baby cries in the middle of the prayer
He's sayin' hurry up daddy, hurry up because we're almost there
I tell you, if a fool like you could listen to a fool like me
And if the leaves on the trees could stop shaking in the wind
If a fool like you could listen to a fool like me
Maybe, baby, we could stop long enough to begin
Now the tempers get hot, oh and the fingers, they shake
Seems there ain't enough sunshine around to keep a man wide awake
Now when the artist gets mad, he can take up his brush
But when the crippled man loses his faith, well, who's gonna give him a crutch
I tell you, if a fool like you could listen to a fool like me
And if the leaves on the trees could stop shaking in the wind
If a fool like you could listen to a fool like me
Maybe, baby, we could stop long enough to begin
This old overcoat, man, it's seen a lot of rain
Like a junkyard scrap DeSoto, I've been learnin' my pain
An old Heath radio taught me how to sing
Now you just give me a guitar and man I'll forget about everything
And I tell you, if a fool like you could listen to a fool like me
And if the leaves on the trees could stop shaking in the wind
If a fool like you could listen to a fool like me, I tell you
Maybe, baby, we could stop long enough to begin
Maybe, baby, we could stop long enough to begin
Maybe, baby, we could stop long enough to begin
