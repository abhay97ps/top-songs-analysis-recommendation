You old fire, I'm mad with desire
You're my favorite one
You got me cooking with the fever
Got my love running for the sun
Uh uh huh, running for the sun
I feel so high, I feel like
I may go blowing away
 blowing away
Blow, blow, blowing away
My well-meaner
My day-fancy dreamer
Oh, what can it be
Well, it's something like a power
Like a hold and it's holding me
Uh uh huh, and it's holding me
I feel so high, I feel like
I may go blowing away
 blowing away
Blow, blow, blowing away
Blow, blow, blowing away
My long laster
My soft-hearted master
Ain't been born and bred
But he's standing in my doorway
In my mind up above my
Up above, up above my head
Up above my head, up above my head
I feel so high, I feel like
I may go blowing away, blowing away
Blowing away, blowing away
Blow, blow, blowing away
Blowing away, blow, blow
Blowing away...
