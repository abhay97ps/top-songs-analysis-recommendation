Done
The first time I saw you, done
By the first dance was through, I was done
That one kiss I knew
There was nothing I wouldn't do just to give you
That house on the hill with the 4-plank around it
Every last breath 'til the last star is counted
Just say the word, girl
Paint me your perfect
I won't quit 'til the good Lord says my work is done
Like a faded out song on the radio, done
Like the cowboy gets the girl when the credits roll
I'd give you a lifetime of days in the sun
Whatever you need and you want
I won't stop 'til it's done
Done
All the hell I was raising, done
All the careless heart-breaking, done
For the chance that you're taking
I spend my nights praying and all my days chasing
That house on the hill with the 4-plank around it
Every last breath 'til the last star is counted
Just say the word, girl
Paint me your perfect
I won't quit 'til the good Lord says my work is done
Like a faded out song on the radio, done
Like the cowboy gets the girl when the credits roll
I'd give you a lifetime of days in the sun
Whatever you need and you want
I won't stop 'til it's done
You know I won't stop 'til it's done
You need a man you can lean on, done
You need some faith you can hang your dreams on
Check 'em off one by one
And that house on the hill with the 4-plank around it
Every last breath 'til the last star is counted
Just say the word, girl
Paint me your perfect
I won't quit 'til the good Lord says my work is done
Like a faded out song on the radio, done
Like the cowboy gets the girl when the credits roll
I'd give you a lifetime of days in the sun
Whatever you need and you want
I won't stop 'til it's done
Baby, I won't stop 'til it's done
Oh you know I ain't done
First time I saw you, done
