I know I got a bad reputation
And it isn't just talk, talk, talk
If I could only give you everything
You know I haven't got
I couldn't have one conversation
If it wasn't for the lies, lies, lies
And still I want to tell you everything
'Til I close my eyes
Suddenly I'm on the street
Seven years disappear below my feet
Been breaking down
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Suddenly I'm down in Herald Square
Looking in the crowd, your face is everywhere
Been turning 'round
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Don't try to be an inspiriation
Just wasting your time, time, time
You know about the best I'll ever be
See it in your eyes
I know I got a bad reputation
And it isn't just talk, talk, talk
If I could only give you everything
You know I haven't got
Suddenly I'm on the street
Seven years disappear below my feet
Been breaking down
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Suddenly I'm in another place
Looking in the crowd, I think I see your face
Been turning 'round
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now? 
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now? 
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Don't you think I've heard the talk?
Nobody's gonna tell me who to love
Been breaking down
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Suddenly I'm down on Herald Square
Looking in the crowd, your face is everywhere
Just turning 'round
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Been breaking down
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
I'm just breaking down, down, down, down
Been breaking down, down, down, down
Been breaking down, down, down, down
Been breaking down, down, down, down
Been breaking down, down, down, down
