Find yourself another girl
Who will love you
True, true, true
Find yourself another girl
Save her love and
Kisses just for you
Save her love and
Kisses just for you
Well, the very first
Time I fell in love
Got my heart broken there
People would say
When I passed their way
There's a hurt young man
Going there, going there
An unhappy lad going there
Well, one day my mother
Called me to her side
Son, why are you so blue
Mother, I've lost
The girl that I love
Why don't you
Tell me what to do
Mother, won't you
Tell what to do
Well, she said
Find yourself another girl
Who will love you
True, true, true
Find yourself another girl
Save her love and
Kisses just for you
Who'll save her love
And kisses just for you
I can imagine
How you feel, my son
But throw it out
Of your mind
I'm gonna tell you
Kind of truthfully
True love is hard
To find sometimes
It's kinda hard to find
But forget about that girl
That broke your heart
And try to start anew
For if there was a guy for her
There's got to be a
Girl somewhere for you
Got to be a girl
Somewhere for you
You just go on and
Find yourself another girl
Who will love you
True, true, true
Find yourself another girl
Who'll save her love
And kisses just for you
Save all her love
For nobody but you
Well, ooh, ooh
Another love
Ooh, ooh, another love...
