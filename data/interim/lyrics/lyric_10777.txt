Judy was an American girl
She came in the morning
With the US mail
She didn't say nothing
But she looked pretty good to me
Golden hair that shines so bright
Loving eyes that see not sight
She could keep the secrets
That we share in my world of dreams
And a man needs something
When he ain't got nothing to hold onto
And there ain't no telling
When I feel like yelling, "I love you"
Ooooo
It gets lonely in the night
When there ain't no one around
Ooooo
She makes me feel alright
Get my feet right off the ground
She's the girl of my dreams!
She's the girl of my dreams!
Judy does what I ask her to
She makes me happy when I feel blue
She stares with the eyes of a child
And gets me to my knees
Her heart, it never beats in time
'Cept when it's beating close to mine
I keep her from my friends
Locked away with my fantasies
And a man needs something
When he ain't got nothing to hang onto
And there ain't no telling
When I feel like yelling, "I love you"
Ooooo
It gets lonely in the night
When there ain't no one around
Ooooo
She makes me feel alright
Get my feet right off the ground
She's the girl of my dreams!
She's the girl of my dreams!
She's the girl of my dreams!
She's the girl of my dreams!
She's the girl of my dreams!
She's the girl of my dreams!
