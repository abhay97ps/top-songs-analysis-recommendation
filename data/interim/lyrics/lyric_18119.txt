The problem is for many years
I've lived my life publicly
So it's hard for me to find a man I trust
I really trust
And every time I find someone I like, gotta worry about
If it's really me that they see
And I thought you were the one, ohhhh...
Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
I don't have a lot of friends
And sometimes I have to wonder
Is it cash they see when they look at me?
'Cause they're lookin' for a ride that's free
So I made the choice to be
Good to those who are good to me
Don't judge me or think I'm bitter
For the evil does allow me to see I'm just Mary
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that they could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that they could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
The car i drive, the clothes i wear
The diamonds, the furs, and the house
Don't make the woman
Material things don't mean nothing to me
So, I need someone to stand by me and supply my needs
And I'm just plain ol' Mary
Why can't you love the person inside, and stop lookin' outside
Deep inside I wish that they could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that they could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary 
Deep inside I wish that you could see
If I could give you something else
But I can't give you nothing but me all day and all night 
I'm just Mary, Mary, Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
