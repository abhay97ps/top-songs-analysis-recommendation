Come here
I don't know what happened
Where did they go?
Nights like this don’t happen anymore
I need to know
Is it me and did I lose control? 
Lonely overseas, only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go, baby, they don’t know
What we had before, but it fell before our eyes
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down
It's been difficult
I'm just happy there's no flights no more
But it's nights like this that I never ever missed you more
There's a reason what this happened for, yeah 
Lonely overseas, only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go, baby, they don’t know
What we had before, but it fell before our eyes
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down
Bounce
Lonely overseas, only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go, baby, they don’t know
What we had before, but it fell before our eyes
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down
