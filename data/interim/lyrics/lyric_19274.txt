Every one is addressed to me
Every one is

Oh fuck
You can't imagine so many monkeys in the daily mail
And all of them coming anonymously, so they leave no trail
Never thought I'd have an admirer from overseas
But somebody's sending me stationary filled with chimpanzees
Some chimps in swimsuits
Some chimps are swinging from a vine
Some chimps in jackboots
Some chimps that wish they could be mine
Starsky and Hutch chimps
A chimp who's sitting on the can
A pair of Dutch chimps
Who send their love from Amsterdam
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
If I had to guess, I'd say the monkey-sender thinks its great
He's sending me, maybe she's sending me, just to see me get irate
I'm losing sleep and it's gonna be keeping me up all night
I thought it was funny but now I got money on a monkey-fight
Some chimps in hard-hats
Chimps a-working on a chain gang
Some chimps who love cats
Burning rubber in a Mustang
A birthday wishing chimp
A chimp in black, like a goth
A going fishing chimp
A British chimp in the bath
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Somebody followed me even though I packed and moved my home
No matter what they come and they come, they won't leave me alone
Another monkey in the mail could make me lose my mind
But look at me shuffling through the stack until I finally find
Some chimps in swimsuits
Some chimps in jackboots
Some chimps in hard-hats
Some chimps who love cats
I got some shaved chimps
Thats chimps devoid of any hair
I got depraved chimps
Dressed up in a-womens underwear
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Every one is
Every one is
Every one is addressed to me
Every one is
Every one is
Every one is addressed to me
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
