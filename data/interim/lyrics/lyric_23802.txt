Nah, nah, nah
Cake by the ocean
Oh, no
See you walkin' 'round like it's a funeral
Not so serious girl, why those feet cold?
We just gettin' started, don't you tiptoe, tiptoe
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece 
You should be rollin' with me, you should be rollin' with me 
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy 
But you're movin' so carefully, let's start livin' dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm goin' blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean
Goddamn
See you lickin' frostin' from your own hands
Want another taste, I'm beggin', "Yes, ma'am"
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land, dry land, ooh
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece 
You should be rollin' with me, you should be rollin' with me 
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy 
But you're movin' so carefully, let's start livin' dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm goin' blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy 
I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean 
Walk for me, baby 
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
