I used to love the Tenderloin
Until I made some tender coin
Then I met some ladies from Marin
We took the highway to the One
Up the coast to catch some sun
They left me with these blisters on my skin
Don't know what I was on
But I think it grows in Oregon
So I kept on going, going, gone, right through
I drove into Seattle rain
Fell in love then missed the train
That could've took me right back home to you
I've been high
I've been low
I've been "yes," and I been "oh, hell no"
I've been rock 'n roll and disco
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
Oo oo oo...oh oh
Oo oo oo oo ooo ooo
Every day's so caffeinated
I wish they were Golden Gated
Fillmore couldn't feel more miles away
So, wrap me up return to sender
Let's forget this 5 year bender
Take me to my city by the Bay
I never knew all that I had
Now Alcatraz don't sound so bad
At least they'd have a hella fine merlot
If I could wish upon a star
I would hitch a cable car
To the place that I can always call my home
I've been high
I've been low
I've been "yes," and I been "oh, hell no"
I been rock 'n roll and disco
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
I've been up
I've been down
I've been so damn lost since you're not around
I've been reggae and calypso
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
To tell you the truth
I miss everything, everything
It's a wild, wide, beautiful world
But there's a wide-eyed girl back there
And she means everything, everything
I've been stop
I've been go
I've been "yes" and I been "oh, hell no"
I've been rock 'n roll and disco
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
I've been up
I've been down
I've been so damn lost since you're not around
I've been reggae and calypso
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
Oo oo oo...oh oh
Oo oo oo...oh oh
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
Oo oo oo...oh oh
Oo oo oo...oh oh
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
