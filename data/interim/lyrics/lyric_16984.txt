Ooh, ooh
Take a look at me
Take a look at me
And tell me what you see
I need somebody to love me for me
Why don't you take a look at me
And tell me what you see
I need somebody to love me for me
Every time
I look around for someone
To help me out from being down
You’re always there by my side
Never asking for too much
You’re always willing to try
So baby
Take a look
Oh, how bad I need someone
Could you be the one
How I need you, girl
I’m in need of love
Take a look at me
And tell me what you see
I need somebody to love me for me
Why don't you take a look at me
And tell me what you see
I need somebody to love me for me
Can somebody help me out
And tell me is this a dream
Or so it seems
That this is love is rare
Do you really care?
I need to need to know right now
That you'll always be there
Oh, how I need someone
To love me for me
Could you be the one
To set my heart free
How I need you bad
To show that you care
I’m in need of love
Somebody to share
Take a look at me
