Trippin' out, spinnin' around
I'm underground, I fell down
Yeah, I fell down
I'm freakin' out, where am I now?
Upside down and I can't stop it now
It can't stop me now, oh
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashin' down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, I won't cry
I found myself  in Wonderland
Get back on  my feet again
Is this real?  Is it pretend?
I'll take a stand  until the end
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashin' down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, I won't cry
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashin' down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, and I won't cry
