Every time you take a sip
In this smoky atmosphere
You press that bottle to your lips
And I wish I was your beer
And in the small there of your back
Your jeans are playing peekaboo
I'd like to see the other half
Of your butterfly tattoo
Hey that gives me an idea
Let's get out of this bar
Drive out into the country
And find a place to park
Cause I'd like to see you
Out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you
Way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you
Through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks
I know the perfect little path
Out in these woods I used to hunt
Don't worry babe I've got your back
And I've also got your front
Now, I'd hate to waste a night like this
I'll keep you safe you wait and see
The only thing allowed to crawl all over you
When we get there is me
You know every guy in here tonight
Would like to take you home
But I've got way more class than them
Babe that ain't what I want
Cause I'd like to see you
Out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you
Way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you
Through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks
Now, ooo
You never know where one might be
But, ooo
There's lots of place that are hard to reach
I gotcha
I'd like to see you
Out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you baby
Way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you
Through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks
Oh, I'd sure like to check you for ticks
Come on!
