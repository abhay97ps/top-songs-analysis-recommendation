Outside her window
That's where I am
Every night and every day
And outside her window
I cry my life away
There's a jukebox playing
Just a half a block down
Saying I'm going to the river
Gonna jump right in and drown
But I ain't gonna do that, girl
No, no, I'll just on hanging around
Even though it's 
Can't you hear me 
Don't you leave me 
Outside her window
A pretty bird come to play
And I know I cried, I cried a tear
I must have scared that pretty little thing
That pretty little thing away, yes, I did
When I see two young lovers
Walking down the street, yes, indeed
Whoa, how it kills me
When I see their two lips meet
Then I pass my hand right over
Where my heart once used to be
And you know it's 
I wonder, do you believe me 
I don't think you understand me
 oh, yes, it is
I've got to say it
Just one more time now
Soembody help me tell myself
 yes, it is
