Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oh, ohhh, oh, ohhh
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Why you treat me so bad.  
Why you treat me so bad.  
Why you treat me so bad.  
Why you treat me so bad
Why you treat me so bad, baby
Oh girl, I loved you, but you turned and you walked away
I would love you for tomorrow though I know I do today
You told me that you'd never hurt me
Girl, you just tore my life apart
Tell me, baby, why'd you do it?
Won't you bring me back my heart
I tried to understand it, baby
I searched my heart inside my mind
I searched the depths of my heart and soul, baby
There was nothing there to find
You told me that you'd never leave me
Girl, you just went and you told a lie
Tell me, baby, why'd you do it?
Why'd you make me wanna cry?
Why you treat me so bad
I don't know why, baby
Why you treat me so bad
Why you do me the way you do
Why you treat me so bad
I don't know why, baby
Why you treat me so bad
Why you treat me so bad, baby
Boy, let me tell you just how I really and truly feel
You know that I have doubts and issues
Now I'm gonna give you the deal
You tell me that I always hurt you
I don't know what you're talking about
Tried to hold you, tried to please you
But you always seemed to doubt
You have told me that you didn't trust me
And you didn't want me around
You showed somebody else your interest
Now you walk around with a frown
I'm sorry to say I always hurt you
But you know you hurt me too
I'm begging you, baby, I need you back
'Cause I'm still in love with you
Why you treat me so bad
I don't know why, baby
Why you treat me so bad
Why you do me the way you do
Why you treat me so bad
I don't know why, baby
Why you treat me so bad
Why you treat me so bad, baby
I sit here all alone thinking how our love could be
But every time I call you up
You won't get on the phone with me
I just don't know if I can take it
Girl, you make me cop a plea
You got me begging for your loving
Can't you see it's killing me?
I just don't understand you, baby, after all I've done for you
You know we've both been through some changes
Now you say your love is true
Boy, you know how much I love you
But I guess my heart has changed
I'm sorry, baby, can't take you back
I found myself another man
Why you treat me so bad
I don't know why, baby
Why you treat me so bad
Why you do me the way you do
Why you treat me so bad
I don't know why, baby
Why you treat me so bad
Why you treat me so bad, baby
Oh girl
I don't know why you treat me so bad
You do what's right, yeah
I tried to help myself as hard as I can
Oh, oh, oh.  Oooh, oooh, oooh
I gave you everything
Yeah
So bad.  Oh, oh
Why you treat me so bad.  
I don't know why
Why you treat me so bad.  
So bad
Why you treat me so bad.  
Why you treat me so bad
