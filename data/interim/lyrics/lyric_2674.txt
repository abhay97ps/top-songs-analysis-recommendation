Down by the river
Happens  every summer
Young  folks get together
Silly old summertime
Down by the river
Happens  every summer
Young  folks get together
In the silly old summertime
Summer  days are hazy
Summer nights are lazy
Boys all act so crazy
In the silly old summertime
They  know that summertime kisses
Are so sweet, are so sweet, they are so sweet
Fall in love with the boys you meet
In the silly old summertime
Down by the river
Happens every summer
Young folks get together
Silly old summertime
Down where the water's shallow
Underneath the willow
Won't you come and be my pillow
In the silly old summertime
They say that summertime kisses
Are so sweet, are so sweet, they are so sweet
Fall in love with the girls you meet
In the silly old summertime
Betty the parson's daughter
Nobody's hotter
She walk on near the water
In the silly old summertime
Down by the river 
Happens every summer 
Young folks together 
In the silly old summertime
Down by the river
Happens every summer
Young folks get together
Silly old summertime
Down by the river
Happens every summer
Young folks get together
Silly old summertime
Silly old summertime
