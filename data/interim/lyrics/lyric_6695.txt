Baby I need your sweet loving
Baby, oh baby
Baby I need your sweet, sweet loving
Baby, oh baby
Whenever I'm feeling down
And my mind is under the weather
Whenever I'm on the ground
I need someone to get me together
And I dig everything about you
And I'm gonna say I can't live without you
Hey baby you know I'm gonna stay
Baby I need your sweet loving
Baby, oh baby
Baby I need your sweet, sweet loving
Baby, oh baby
I know that I've hurt your feelings
I've lied, and I've even been untrue
Now that my conscience needs some healing
I've found out I'm hung on you
And I dig everything about you
And I'm gonna say I can't live without you
Hey baby you know I'm gonna stay
You know you walk so nice, and you talk so nice
And you're just too much for me
And that's why I gotta tell you that
I dig everything about you 
Baby, oh baby
The way you walk
The way you talk
The way you move
