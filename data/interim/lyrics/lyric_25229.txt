Bandkid the fuckin' movement, you know how the fuck we rockin'
Ayy, we takin' over 2k18 on my mama, nigga
In the back wit' my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up 
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up 
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up 
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up 
Wit' my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up 
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up 
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up 
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up 
Now I'm in the 'Rari switchin' lanes 
Pull up to the strip and they all know my name 
Now I got this bread and my VV chain swang 
I was just broke, steady lookin' for some stains 
And my little brother Midget, free my nigga out the cage 
Sellin' drugs and I get it out, your bitch, I'm gettin' paid 
And I'm in a Masi 'cause I crashed the fucking Range
And I took your bitch 'cause I'm better than your main 
In the back wit' my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up 
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up 
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up 
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up 
Wit' my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up 
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up 
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up 
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up 
Yeah, you know I'm in that brand new space coupe 
Hop up out the van like, "Nigga, what it do?" 
I just fucked yo bitch and then I kick her out my room 
And I'm in a fast car, nigga, vroom, vroom 
I be wearin' Louis fit down 'cause I flex hard
Posted wit' my niggas sippin' Wockhardt 
And we don't give a fuck, we got a cold heart 
Runnin' through the money, nigga, that part 
In the back wit' my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up 
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up 
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up 
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up 
Wit' my niggas, off the Xan, we might act up 
Come with caution 'cause you know we all strapped up 
Your bitch she want me 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up 
But I can't keep her, I just wanna beat her back up
