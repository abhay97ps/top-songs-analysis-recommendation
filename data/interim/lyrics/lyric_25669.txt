Buddah bless this beat
You likin' what you see
Everythin' designer, that’s on me 
That’s water when I walk
Lookin' like you, just tryna fuck, yeah
This drip got you in heat
Just jump in, baby girl, hop on this dick, yeah
You know that I'm on beat 
All this drip got your ass in heat, yeah
Those eyes don't tell no lie, no
Girl, I know that you ready
Girl, I'm not gonna let you down 
I ain't gon' keep you waitin' up
If you throw it, it's gon' get knocked up 
You playin' hide and seek, I'ma find you 
Baby, hold on tight when you ride me 
You know I like to eat, give me options 
If you throw it, it's gon' get knocked up

Super wet, her juice is runnin' down her knee, uh, uh
Your stylist sippin' some lean 
Got you flodgin' with a icy Patek Philippe, oh, oh
Pretty pies inside the mansion by the beach 
Fendi prints all on your bathin' suit, your style is so unique 
Fifty bands inside your room, designer garments for the week 
And that's all on me, I swear, that's all on me 
You actin' like you really want it, you gon' get it
Once I fuck you good, I got you 
In your feelings 
Birkin bags and Goyard pouches 
Got you drippin' 
Calculus and more accountants 
Countin' digits 
Cherishin' these riches
You likin' what you see 
Everythin' designer, that's on me 
That's water when I walk 
Lookin' like you, just tryna fuck , yeah
This drip got you in heat 
Just jump in, baby girl, hop on this dick , yeah

All this drip got your ass in heat , yeah
Give me directions, I do whatever you want 
Got a fifth of that Hen' just to add to the fun 
You light it up while I'm breakin' you down
You gon' knock out by the end of this round, oh
You got me speechless, girl, that puss' ain't no punk 
Girl, you're the only one that knows what I want 
I'm feelin' this shit, I know you're feelin' it too 
I can go deeper, but that's all up to you, yeah
I wanna get equal
All that ass for my ego
Baby, we gon' keep it simple

You likin' what you see 
Everythin' designer, that's on me 
That's water when I walk 
Lookin' like you, just tryna fuck , yeah

You know that I'm on beat 
All this drip got your ass in heat, yeah
