On the beach in the summertime
Where the happenings are
On the beach
Baby, laying in the sand
You and me
Where the rat race and the city
Seems to fade away to memory
And the heartbroken lovers
Try to wash away their troubles
On the beach
With you and me
On a hot summer day
Yeah, baby, at the shore
Yeah, yeah
On the beach
In the summertime
Where the beautiful people
Still compete
Strolling on the boardwalk
By the sea
Where the flame of love can kindle
And the marriage plans can tremble
When two enchanted lovers
Get a good look at each other
On the beach
With you and me
On a hot summer day
Yeah, baby, at the shore
By the sea
And the cleanness of the air
Seem to cleanse our souls by being there
And the heartaches we once knew
With all our cares and sorrows
Won't have worry till tomorrow
On the beach
With you and me
On a hot summer day
Yeah, baby, at the shore
Yeah, by the sea
Yeah, yeah
Strolling
On the boardwalk
