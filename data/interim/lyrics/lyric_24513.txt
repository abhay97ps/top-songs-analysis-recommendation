They say that I'm yours and you say it ain't that 
And every time it goes I just bring the pain back, yeah
Break ups to make ups that-that's just the way it goes 
Know a lot of men would do you better 
Know that I done put you through whatever 
I know that you care for me, I know what you spared for me
I know you won't wait on me forever 
Real one, I guess I'm just a fool with her
Looking in the mirror like, ain't you scared to lose her?
Why you acting like another man wouldn't choose her?
You know she the only true girl, ooh girl
