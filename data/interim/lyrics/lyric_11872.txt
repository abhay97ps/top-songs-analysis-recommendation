It's funny how you sound as if you're right next door
When you're really half a world away
I just can't seem to find the words I'm looking for
To say the things that I want to say
I can't remember when I felt so close to you
It's almost more than I can bear
And though I seem a half a million miles from you
You are in my heart and living there
And the moon and the stars are the same ones you see
It's the same old sun up in the sky
And your voice in my ear is like heaven to me
Like the breezes here in old Shanghai
There are lovers who walk hand in hand in the park
And lovers who walk all alone
There are lovers who lie unafraid in the dark
And lovers who long for home
Oh, I couldn't leave you even if I wanted to
You're in my dreams and always near
And especially when I sing the songs I wrote for you
You are in my heart and living there
And the moon and the stars are the same ones we see
It's the same old sun up in the sky
And your face in my dreams is like heaven to me
Like the breezes here in old Shanghai
Shanghai breezes, cool and clearing, evening's sweet caress
Shanghai breezes, soft and gentle, remind me of your tenderness
And the moon and the stars are the same ones we see
It's the same old sun up in the sky
And your love in my life is like heaven to me
Like the breezes here in old Shanghai
And the moon and the stars are the same ones we see
It's the same old sun up in the sky
And your love in my life is like heaven to me
Like the breezes here in old Shanghai
Just like the breezes here in old Shanghai
