No!
What a thing to say, you just said no
Help me out on the road
You didn't say anything nice
I slept with you late last night
But you said no!
That's a hell of a thing to say
You oughta know
You told me where to go
I told her she was young and bright
And definitely out of sight
But she said no!
What a thing to say, she just said no
Put her right in my place
I was looking for a night of fun
You really had me on the run
But you said no!
I couldn't believe my ears when you said no
And told me some other night
You really got a man uptight
I thought maybe that we might
But you said no!
No!
What a thing to say, she just said no
She threw me right in the road
I stayed with her late last night
She didn't say anything nice
Just said no!
That's a hell of a thing to say
You just said no
Yeah, she told me where to go
I told her she was young and bright
And definitely out of sight
But she said no!
Yeah, 
I'm looking for a night of fun
You had a man on the run
But you said no
Oh, that's a hell of a thing to say
