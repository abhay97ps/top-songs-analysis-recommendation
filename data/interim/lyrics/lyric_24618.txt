Dear mama 
Love you mama 
And grandmama 
Slatt, slatt, slatt
Dear mama
I don’t wanna sign off 
Out here gettin' commas 
Like my dad, I'm a grinder 
She don’t want me locked up 
Mama, I'm gon' wash up 
Whip my wrist, it lock up 
All my diamonds rocked up 
I don't wanna sign off 
Mama love me so I can do no wrong 
Mama in the trap so this her favorite song 
I'm gon' get them racks, lil' baby, they so long 
Said I wasn't nothin’ but I came in strong 
You got the best advice but I won’t call 
I know I'm grown so I do not need y’all 
And if I get locked up mom change the law 
You fix everything, so that's what I thought 
When I was small, mama made me tall 
Even though I'm daddy's pup she still gon’ wipe my paws 
Don't care about this money, don't care about them cars 
Lose my mama, that's a problem you can't solve 
Dear mama
I don't wanna sign off 
Out here gettin' commas 
Like my dad, I'm a grinder 
She don't want me locked up 
Mama, I'm gon' wash up 
Whip my wrist, it lock up 
All my diamonds rocked up 
I don't wanna sign off 
Now I got the game in a headlock 
Never catch me lackin', run a red light 
Bitch, we talk in codes, we the real slimes 
They tried to break my safe, I had a deadlock 
Mama used to bag in the day time 
Mama got that bag by the night time 
Was on 32nd Street, I was like eight then 
Moved to Francisville and met my real friends 
Mama said, "Stay down there 'fore you get hurt" 
That was way before I was Lil Uzi Vert 
Mama saw me in action, it could've got worse 
I know that my mama, know I'm shootin' first
Dear mama 
I don't wanna sign off 
Out here gettin' commas 
Like my dad, I'm a grinder 
She don't want me locked up 
Mama, I'm gon' wash up 
Whip my wrist, it lock up 
All my diamonds rocked up 
I don't wanna sign off 
Dear mama 
Love you mama
