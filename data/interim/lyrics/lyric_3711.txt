Baby, the raindrops play for me
A lonely rhapsody cause on our first date
We were making out in the rain
And in this car our love went much too far
It was exciting as thunder
Tonight
I wonder where you are?
The windshield wipers seemed to say
"Together, together, together, together"
And now they are saying
"Oh, never, never"
Ooh wee, ooh wee, baby
Rhapsody in the rain
Rhapsody in the rain
Angels keep crying for me, "Don't stop"
Angels keep crying for me, "Don't stop"
Baby, I'm parked outside your door
Remember making love
Making love
We were making love in the storm
Sha, la, la, la, la, la
And then a flash from above
Lightning, lightning
Lightning, lightning
Just like our love
It was exciting, exciting
Ooh wee, ooh wee, baby
Rhapsody in the rain
Rhapsody in the rain
Angels keep crying for me, "Don't stop"
Angels keep crying for me, "Don't stop"
Yesterday
Bring back yesterday
Rhapsody in the rain, rhapsody in the rain
Angels keep crying for me, "Don't stop"
Angels keep crying for me, "Don't stop"
Rhapsody in the rain
Rhapsody in the rain
Rhapsody in the rain
Rhapsody in the rain
