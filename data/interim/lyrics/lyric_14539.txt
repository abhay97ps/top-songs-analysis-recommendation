You better come inside when you're ready to
But no chance if you don't wanna dance
You like a four letter words when you're ready to
But then you won't 'cause you know that you can
You got it
But are you getting it?
You say that love is won when you get some
But then your finger won't trigger the gun
You know you can't stop it, so don't rock it
You know you got it
Hey, but are you getting it?
Ooh, really getting it?
Come get it from me
Every little bit
Every bit of it
Oh, come on live a bit
Yeah, but are you getting it?
Ooh, really getting it?
Come on get it
Yeah
Do, do, do
Uh oh
You try coming on when you need some
But then you don't because you already did
Yeah, you jangle your jewels while you're shaking your
And drive the pretty boys out of their heads
You got it
But are you getting it?
You flash your bedroom eyes like a jumping Jack
Then play it pretty with a pat on the back
Yeah, but are you getting it?
Ooh, really getting it?
Come on, Steve, get it, huh
Take it, take it, take it from me
I got an itchy finger following me
Pull it, pull it, come on trigger the gun
Because the best is a yet to come
I say
Oh, are you getting it?
Oh, really getting it?
Yes, are you getting it?
Whoa, really getting it?
Come get it from me
Every little bit
Every bit of it
Oh, come on live a bit
Oh, are you getting it?
Ooh, really getting it?
Oh are you getting it?
Oh, live a bit
No, live a bit
You've got to live it
Ooh, baby live it
Come on and give it
Oh, come on and give it
Oh, are you getting it?
Ooh, really getting it?
Oh, are you getting it?
Oh, live a bit
Whoa
