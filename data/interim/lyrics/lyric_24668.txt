We don't got no time for these boys, just shut up and bet up 
The Rollie on Ric Flair, my wrist is just wet up 
The plug just called like, "what up?" nigga, don't let up 
The diamonds are yellow today, you gotta catch up, yeah 
Money on the floor and these hoes, these nigga can't pose with us 
Why the fuck you say I owe you? You never growed with us 
Diamonds in the ear got big, lil' nigga, I told you

And I promise I can thumb with a blindfold

Ooh, put her on Perky and Act', I'ma just fuck and forget 
Uh, yeah, mansion it sit on the hill , after my last arrest 
Uh, niggas out here in the field, don't need a mask or vest 
Uh, back to back Lambos, repeat it, you like to run when it's heated 
AR-15 with the coolant, just in case it get too heated 
Hop on the wave and drown, my mama been Cartier bracelet down 
Uh, face it down , dirty my soda, I hate the brown 
Hold it down 'cause the plug is illegal 
Ride around with a dub and a eagle 
I heard that money get evil, prayin' to God to keep me from demons 
She lost in the vibe, surrounded by stars, we got her sucking on semen 
You gotta survive, ain't sparing no lives, F&N pop at your beanie
