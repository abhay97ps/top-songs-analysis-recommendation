It was on a sweet Thursday
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday all had passed
Came the day I'd waited for at last
And you were there, with love to spare
Making it a sweet Thursday
Not like any other day I'd known
Giving me a dream to call my own
A dream that you are sharing too
People meet by some design
Prearranged by laws divine
Yet who is there who can define
Just what mystic fate combined to make you mine
We were only two strangers
But we aren't strangers anymorе
And as I stand and kiss you at your door
I know my life was incomplete
'Till that wondеrful, wonderful Thursday, my sweet
'Till that wonderful, wonderful Thursday, my sweet
