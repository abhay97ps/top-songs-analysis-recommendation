There's a fire
Starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally
I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave
With every piece of you
Don't underestimate
The things that I will do
There's a fire
Starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark
The scars of your love
Remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love
They leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all, 
Rolling in the deep, 
You had my heart inside of your hand, 
And you played it to the beat 
Baby, I have
No story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And it's gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Makin'
A home down there as mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love
Remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love
They leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all, 
Rolling in the deep, 
You had my heart inside of your hands, 
And you played it
With a beating
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow
Into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
, Yeah, we could have had it all
, We could have had it all
, Yeah, it all, it all, it all
We could have had it all, 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hands, 
And you played it to the beat, 
You could have had it all, 
Rolling in the deep, 
You had my heart inside of your hands, 
And you played and you played and you played
And you played it to the beat
