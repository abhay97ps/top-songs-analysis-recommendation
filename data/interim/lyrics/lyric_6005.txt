There can be a new tomorrow
There can be a brighter day
There can be a new tomorrow
Love will find a way
Love will find a way
The days go passin' by and we try to live life so carefree
Wond'rin' what is real, do you feel there's a change that should be?
In the end what will win?
Let's hold on, keep love strong
There can be a new tomorrow
And there can be a brighter day
There can be a new tomorrow
Love will find a way
Love will find a way
We're livin' in a time where you find we must share the burden
It's a heavy load on a road that is so uncertain
It may seem we're chasin' dreams
But let's hold on and keep love strong
There can be a new tomorrow
And there can be a brighter day
There can be a new tomorrow
Love will find a way
Love will find a way
There can be a new tomorrow
There can be a brighter day
There can be a new tomorrow
There can be a brighter day
And there can be a new tomorrow
