BENDER
 Going through the 'bot wash!
BENDER
 Goin' through the robot wash!
C'mon, y'all and sing it with me
'Bot wash! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
'Bot wash, yeah!
BENDER
Ah! Aww!
ELZAR
Hey, I'm Elzar! Welcome to the show! You know, you don't have to drive all the way to Neptune for great Neptunian food. Today we're gonna kick it up a notch as I show you how to fricassee a mouth-watering Neptunian slug. Now while you grease the pan and preheat your oven to 3500 degrees you're gonna separate the yolk from your genetically-enhanced eggplant and then give the whole thing a good blast from your spice weasel - bam!
FRY
Hey, what you watching?
BENDER
Uh, nothing!
LEELA
Is that a cooking show?
BENDER
No, of course not! It was...uh...porno! Yeah, that's it!
LEELA
Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! That's so cute!
BENDER
 Oh, it's true! I've been hiding it for so long.
FRY
It's OK, Bender, I like cooking too.
BENDER
 Pansy!
ELZAR
Of course, your most important ingredient is this baby right there: the Neptunian slug. You can get it in a can but to really do things right you gotta strangle yourself a fresh one. Now this is why you gotta use cast-iron cookware.
HERMES
Bender, man. It has come to my attention that this company has been paying you to do nothing but loaf about on the couch.
BENDER
You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!
HERMES
I'm sorry but if you want to continue drawing a salary you gotta do more than watch the cooking shows all day.
BENDER
Hmm.
FRY
You're gonna be the ship's cook?
BENDER
Yeah! We're gonna kick it up a notch. Bam!
LEELA
I know you like cooking shows but you're a robot, you don't even have a sense of taste.
BENDER
Honey, I wouldn't talk taste if I was wearing a lime-green tank top.
FRY
Bam!
FRY
So this is Little Neptune?
BENDER
Yep. Every chef knows that this is the place to get exotic gourmet ingredients.
LEELA
Among other things.
CRACK ADDICT
Come on, man, don't hold out on me like this!
ORGAN DEALER
Psst! You want to buy organ? Fresh and cheap. Ready for transplant!
FRY
Ooh! What's this?
ORGAN DEALER
Ah! Is X-Ray eyes. See through anything!
FRY
Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.
ORGAN DEALER
Z is just as good. In fact, is better. Is two more than X.
FRY
Hmm, I can see where that would be an advantage. Do you take cash?
LEELA
Fry, you have to be more careful. We're not in the 20th century. You don't know how things work here.
FRY
I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew up in this city. These are my people. What up?
ALIEN
Word!
FRY
See?
FRY
Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat here except human!
LEELA
What's this spice for?
LEELA
Oh! That's ridiculous.  I'll take two pounds!
BENDER
Hey, buddy. I'm looking for fresh slug.
BENDER
Whatever.
BENDER
Yeah, yeah, either one's fine.
LEELA
Hey, have you seen Fry?
FRY
Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes. I'll take the gills.
ORGAN DEALER
Yes, gills. Then, uh, you don't need lungs anymore, is right?
FRY
Can't imagine why I would.
ORGAN DEALER
Lie down on table. I take lungs now, gills come next week.  Nurse!
NURSE
Let's do it.
ORGAN DEALER
You may feel small pain...
BENDER
 Thank you!
LEELA
What the hell were you doing? I warned you to stay away from those guys.
FRY
I'm capable of making my own decisions, Leela. Did you ever stop to think I might be happier with gills?
FARNSWORTH
Good news, everyone...
BENDER
Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.
FARNSWORTH
...you'll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol...
BENDER
Here it comes.
FARNSWORTH
...A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone.
BENDER
Thank you, and good night.
LEELA
Uh, professor, are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone?
FARNSWORTH
Why, of course! It's just a name! Like the Death Zone or the Zone Of No Return. All the zones have names like that in the Galaxy Of Terror!
LEELA
Uh, Professor...
FARNSWORTH
Off you go, pleasant trip.
FRY
 Hey Bender how's dinner coming?
BENDER
Almost ready!
BENDER
Now for a dash of salt! Uh-oh!
LEELA
 Listen, this is Bender's first meal and he's a little sensitive. So let's be supportive, OK?
FRY
Yeah, OK.
ZOIDBERG
Alright.
LEELA
 Oh, dear God!
FRY
That's the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. And I once ate a big heaping bowl of salt!
AMY
Bender, is this salt water?
BENDER
It's salt with water in it if that's what you mean.
FRY
My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna die.
BENDER
There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.
ZOIDBERG
Uh-oh, I shouldn't have bad seconds.
LEELA
OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver and for once in your life be careful. This is my first visit to the Galaxy Of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant one.
FRY
Ow!
LEELA
Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. Just go to the palace, drop it off and come right back.
FRY
Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born! I think I know what I'm doing.
FRY
Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty. Oh, come on! Go down already! Ah!
FRY
Hello? Anybody home?
GUARD #1
The royal bottle is empty!
GUARD #2
You drank our emperor!
FRY
No! It wasn't me!
GUARD #1
You drank our emperor! You assassinated him.
FRY
I didn't mean to. He just looked so cool and refreshing.
GUARD #3
I'm sure he was.
GUARD #1
But now he's gone and your fate is sealed. All hail the new emperor.
GUARDS
 Hail! Hail! Hail!
LEELA
So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything, you drank a bottle of strange blue liquid? It could have been poisonous acid!
FRY
It could have been. But chances were equally good it was an emperor.
MERG
Excuse me, Your Majesty, I am Merg, the high priest. If I might interject?
FRY
You might.
MERG
I humby advise that as your first act you choose a capable prime minister. I suggest Gorgak, the previous appointee.
GORGAK
I will be a forceful and effective adminstrator.
BENDER
You know, Fry, I've often thought about becoming a prime minister.
FRY
I gotta go with Bender.
BENDER
Yes! In your face, Gorgak!
LEELA
That's it, Fry. As your captain I order you back to the ship. You are in way over your head.
FRY
Gee, you think so, captain? I'd better check with my prime minister.
BENDER
Stay the course, pal!
GORGAK
Your Highness, a package came for you.
FRY
Hey, thanks! Wow! This got here just in time.
MERG
This is Your Majesty's harem. You may choose any of these maidens to be your royal consort.
FRY
Umm, how about that one?
MERG
Oh! I didn't realise Your Majesty was into that sort of thing!
FRY
On second thought, I'll take that one.
MERG
LEELA
Does anyone else think it's odd that a shiftless 25-year-old delivery boy could drop out of the sky, kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?
FRY
You don't have to beat around th bush, Leela, we all know who you're talking about...uh, me, right?
AMY
I don't think you have anything to worry about. These people seem really mild-mannered.
ZOIDBERG
They are mild. In fact, you're soaking in one right now.
GORGAK
You touched me in ways I've never been touched before.
MERG
Ah, there you are, Your Majesty. It's time to begin preparing for tomorrow's coronation ceremony.
ZOIDBERG
A fancy dress gala! I'll wear my formal shell.
MERG
Fry will be enthroned tomorrow at the setting of the three suns when we Trisolians enter our nocturnal phase.
FRY
There won't be a lot of long-winded speeches, will there?
MERG
Only one. The absolutely flawless recitation from memory of the royal oath. By you.
FRY
Will there be cake?
ZOIDBERG
Yeah, I know.
AMY
Hi!
FRY
There you go.
GORGAK
And now, get ready to laugh 'till your sides leak with our planet's foremost political satirist, Florp!
FLORP
So what is the deal with people from under the orange sun? They're all... But us guys from under the red sun, we're like... Right? Am I right?
FRY
Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!
LEELA
 Fry, I have to talk to you. You're in terrible danger.
LEELA
You see emperor Plon here? He met his end when he was drunk by emperor Strug. And before he could even wipe his mouth, Strug was drunk by Shwab.
FRY
So?
LEELA
Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was?
FRY
80,000 years?
LEELA
No. One week.
FRY
Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.
LEELA
Every emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And guess who's next?
FRY
Well at least my assassin will get what's coming to him.
LEELA
You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! Half of these emperors were drunk at their own coronation.
FRY
Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself.
LEEL
No, they were assassinated. In fact, the laws says you'll be killed on the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory.
FRY
Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later.
LEELA
That is completely reckless. Don't you ever think ahead?
Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be emperor. And I wouldn't even be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?
LEELA
I give up! You're gonna get yourself killed and this time I won't be here to save you.
FRY
Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby. Now go. Go gather your nuts you nagging grasshopper.
LEELA
That's it! I'm never helping you again! If anyone except you needs me, I'll be in the ship.
FRY
I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me. Quit it!
MERG
People of Trisol, it is my honor to present your new emperor!
FRY
What up?
MERG
Stick to the oath.
FRY
Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant...
FRY
...who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed a soup composed principally of Throm the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule with honor and insanity - uh, integrity!
MERG
Congratulations, Your Highness. I now present you with your royal unisex robe. Long live Fry the Solid!
BENDER
Hey, look. The suns are setting. I can finally switch to hard liquor!
BENDER
Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful! Hey, what's that?
MERG
The emperor Bont! He's still alive.
BONT
Of course I'm alive. Now cut this creep open and drain me out!
FRY
My tummy hurts!
BONT
They're over here, they're running up the stairs.
BENDER
Shut up, you!
FRY
Ow!
MERG
Let us in!
MERG
Fry must die so that Bont may live.
FRY
What am I gonna do?
AMY
We've gotta get the emperor out of your body before they kill you!
ZOIDBERG
Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in a high-speed centrifuge separating out the denser fluid of His Highness.
FRY
But won't that crush my bones?
ZOIDBERG
Oh, right, right, with the bones! I always forget about the bones.
BENDER
Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?
BONT
Forget it! As emperor I refuse to be dripped out through somebody's armpit.
FRY
I could vomit or urinate. Would you feel better about that?
BONT
Slightly. But my favorite so far is the bone-crushing.
AMY
What about crying?
FRY
That's a great idea! Crying.
BONT
Fine. That or the bone one.
MERG
Keep it up, men. The veneer is starting to peel.
GORGAK
Oh, dear!
FRY
It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.
BENDER
I'll make you cry, buddy! You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything.
FRY
What do you mean? I was emperor of a whole planet.
BENDER
Good point. But here's a disturbing reminder: Everyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead.
FRY
These things happen.
BENDER
OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable!
FRY
Phew! That's a load off my mind.
BENDER
Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry.
AMY
You did your best, Bender.
BENDER
Up yours, bimbo!
ZOIDBERG
Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. We should call Leela for help.
BENDER
Cram it, lobster! That is a good idea. I'll go call her.
FRY
She'll never help me. She's still mad that I told her never to help me.
AMY
C'mon. Leela's not the type to hold a grudge.
OPERATOR
Collect call from...
BENDER
I'm not giving my name to a machine.
LEELA
I'll accept.
BENDER
Fry's in trouble...
BENDER
...and he needs help. Now, I don't like you and you don't like me.
LEELA
I like you.
BENDER
You do? Look, are you going to help or not?
LEELA
I don't know why I should. I mean after what he...
BENDER
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What is it you like best about me?
AMY
Is she coming?
BENDER
I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.
FRY
What the hell is that?
BONT
It's the Juice-A-Matic 4000. It'll strain my juices from you while filtering out the pulp. By which I mean your shredded remains.
ZOIDBERG
Of course! Why didn't I think of that!
FRY
This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.
BENDER
Wait a second. Here comes Leela.
AMY
Oh, no. They have her totally outnumbered.
FRY
I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.
BENDER
You do? Hmm.
FRY
Is she alright?
BENDER
I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, they're swarming all over her.
FRY
No. No!
AMY
What are you talking about, Bender? She's al...  Oh!
BENDER
They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes in the glass under it.
FRY
This can't be happening.
BENDER
It can and, for all you know it is. I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead.
FRY
All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was too proud, too stupid to accept it. I wish I had died instead of her.
LEELA
What are you talking about?
FRY
Leela! You're alive!
LEELA
Of course I'm alive.
BENDER
I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the emperor but you had to go and wreck it by surviving.
AMY
We only got two drops.
BONT
It's only a matter of time now.
ZOIDBERG
I'll handle this!
LEELA
Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let me help you.
FRY
Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to give. I know you just want what's best for me. Ow! What was that for? Hey, come on! That hurt!
LEELA
I know. Amy, get the bottle.
FRY
 Oh, now I understand.
LEELA
Come on. Everybody help out Fry.
FRY
 Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true... ow! Cut it out, Bender! That's a tender area!
LEELA
How we doing, Amy?
AMY
Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.
AMY
OK, it's your turn.
FRY
Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?
BONT
I'm the emperor! Thanks for crying me out.
FRY
Oh, you're welcome.
BENDER
Hey! Save some for me!
THE END
