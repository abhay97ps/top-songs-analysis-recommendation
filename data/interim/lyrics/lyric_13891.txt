I met a man who would be king
He had a dream to see forever
It was a promise in the dark
It was a promise we made together
I was a girl who would be queen
I didn't know the cost of freedom
It was a secret he would share
It was a word we both could believe in
Some kind of hero
Catch me again I'm falling
'Cause I can hear you calling
It's never enough, it's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough, it's never enough
It's never enough
I met a man who had no name
He spoke the language of the spirit
He took a chance for heart and soul
And with a laugh, he dared me to hear it
I met a man who watched the stars
He had the faith behind the reasons
It was a secret he would share
It was a world we all could believe in
Some kind of hero
Catch me again I'm falling
'Cause I can hear you calling
It's never enough, it's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough, it's never enough
It's never enough
I met a man who would be king
He had a dream to live together
It was a promise in the dark
But he was lost in the storm, forever
Now I'm standing here all alone
Now I know the cost of freedom
It's a secret we all can share
And it's a world we all can believe in
Some kind of hero
Catch me again I'm falling
Now and forever calling
It's never enough, it's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough, it's never enough
It's never enough
