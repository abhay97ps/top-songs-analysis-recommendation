You need to get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way, he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at, it's where he..
Where he wanna be, yeah, yeah
New Keyshia
Yes! 
Fire 
I like this one right here
This one for all my ladies, y'all
Holla! Mmm
Let's go!
I don't want'cho man, 'cause I got it like that
But it ain't even gotta be like dat 
Yo' man, he be callin' me back
He say I'm fine and a matter of fact 
He ask how I do that, that fit my jeans over Baby Phat
Listen, I don't know the type of tricks he playin'
But I should warn you, I don't want yo' man 
I understand why you wanna try
To make him stay home late at night
But if he wanna go, he'll be gone, no lie
I can't explain how many times I tried
How many times I cried
Thinkin' about mine and where he might be
Remember when I gave everything I got
Couldn't get deep down inside
How you love someone who didn't love me? 
But now I get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way, he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at it's where he, where he wanna be
If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it go
 If he ain't gonna treat you, the way he should
Then let it go
 If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it go 
If he ain't gonna treat you, the way he should
 Then let it go
When this song come on in the club, they gon' be like
Damn, that's hot
And when they play it in the car, they gon' drop they tops like
Damn, that's hot 
They gon' mix it with Biggie, "It was all a dream" like
Damn, that's hot
Me and Keyshia don't stop, 'til the tick don't tock like
Damn, that's hot
Now understand why I take my time 
Cause you come with alibis 
Tryna get me to see that's where you tryna be
But I don't want your man
Your man's been callin' me , tryna get me to see
That he wants me to be with him
But he ain't the one for me
And if you only knew 
You would, do what you had to 
Finally see that 
You need to get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way, he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at, it's where he..
Where he wanna be, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, uh
Here's a little lesson, Lil' Kim don't stress 'em 
Kick 'em all straight to the curb like Beckham
Broke wit my ex, he with her for now
But little do she know, she's just a rebound 
Callin my phone, she's so outta pocket
I been there before ol' girl, you need to stop it
When he's with you, he's wishin it was me 
You might be where he's at, but I'm where he wanna be, baby
Bay-bay
If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it go
 If he ain't gonna treat you the way he should
Then let it go 
If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you, the way he should
Then let it go
Hands up in the air!
When this song come on in the club, they gon be like
