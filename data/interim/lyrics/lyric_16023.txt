Stand
We all carry the cross and speak what we're taught
Lies and money become the white man's God
We've burned all our bridges one too many times
The time has come now to draw the line
You know you've got to stand, stand
Stand for what you believe
You know you've got to stand, stand
Stand for what you believe
Ohh, You got to
Stand for what you believe
Alright, alright
Ohh, You got to listen now
Express yourself in the face of change
Repress yourself, you surely seal your fate
You got to look inside, the answer lies in wait
Resurrect before it's too late
You know you've got to stand, stand
Stand for what you believe
You know you've got to stand, stand
Stand for what you believe
Stand, stand for what you believe
Somebody rescue me, come down and rescue me
I know the soul of this good man has got to be free
When you stand, stand for what you believe...
You know you've got to stand, stand
Stand for what you believe
You know you've got to stand, stand
Stand for what you believe
You know you've got to stand, stand
Stand for what you believe
So hell, now just Stand, stand
Stand for what you believe...
