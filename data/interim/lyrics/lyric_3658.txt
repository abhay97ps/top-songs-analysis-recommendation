I never met a girl who makes me feel the way that you do
Whenever I'm asked who makes my dreams real, I say that you do
So, fee-fi-fo-fum
Look out, baby, 'cause here I come
And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready, so get ready
I'm gonna try to make you love me too
So get ready, so get ready 'cause here I come
 I'm on my way
If you wanna play hide and seek with love, let me remind you
But the lovin' you're gonna miss and the time it takes to find you
So, fiddley-dee, fiddley-dum
Look out, baby, 'cause here I come
And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready, so get ready
I'm gonna try to make you love me too
So get ready, so get ready 'cause here I come
 I'm on my way
If all my friends should want you too, I'll understand it
I hope I get to you before they do, the way I planned it
So tweedley-dee, tweedley-dum
Look out, baby, 'cause here I come
And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready, so get ready
I'm gonna try to make you love me too
So get ready, so get ready 'cause here I come
 I'm on my way
