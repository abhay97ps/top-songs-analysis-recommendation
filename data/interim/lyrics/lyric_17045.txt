Verse 1 - Darnell
Lady, I hope we can be together soon
Lately, I'm waking up every day at noon
And maybe, all the meaning is just a minute or two
With you, alone with you
And I know we said we wouldn't
Ever overcrowd each other
But now that we are lovers
I just want you here with me
Chorus
I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't wanna be alone 'cuz I don't feel like it's right
I don't wanna be alone, tonight
I want you to come, come and be with me
Let's discover ecstasy
Verse 2 - Darnell
Honey, don't worry you're all I'm thinking of
Funny, how silly we get when we're in love
Money can never be worth a minute or two
With you, alone with you
I know we said we wouldn't
Ever overcrowd each other
But now that we are lovers
I want you here with me
Chorus
I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't wanna be alone 'cuz I don't feel like it's right
I don't wanna be alone, tonight
I want you to come, come and be with me
Let's discover ecstasy
Bridge - Darnell
Sometime, when I be working hard all day
I can't seem to get you out my mind
And my heart has really nothing left to see
I think I'm in love
Chorus
I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't wanna be alone 'cuz I don't feel like it's right
I don't wanna be alone, tonight, oh baby
I want you to come, come and be with me
Let's discover ecstasy
I don't want to be alone, to be alone
I don't want to be alone, to be alone
I don't want to be alone, to be alone
I want you to come, come and be with me
Let's discover ecstasy
I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't wanna be alone 'cuz I don't feel like it's right
I don't want, want to be alone, tonight
I want you to come, come, ooh
I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't wanna be alone 'cuz I don't feel like it's right
