Don't talk, just listen
First of all
I have to be honest with you, baby
I lied
When I told you I never wanted to see you again
Can you 
Just for tonight?
And maybe we can do something like
Make love, watch the sunrise
Or listen to JoJo, K-Ci sing us a verse
Slide, close, baby
Ha, let DeVante feel you
Oh, you feel so sexy and so good
I'm sorry I left you, I left you crying
Since you've been gone, I've been all alone
'Cause all of my tears, you know they left me drowning
Please, baby I'm begging for you to stay at home
Tonight, let's start our love again 
Tonight, we could be more than just friends
 The sun  it is going down
So baby won't you stay for a little while
Baby, won't you just stay?
Baby, won't you just stay?
For a little while
Baby, won't you just stay?
Oh oh, for a little while
Baby, won't you just stay?
Check this out here
Baby, won't you just stay?
So here we are
Just me and you 
Thinking of the things that we used to do, babe, haha
Tonight is yours, lady
Yours and mine 
Let's try again to put our trust on the line
Tonight, let's start our love again 
Tonight, we can be more than just friends
 The sun is going down
So baby won't you stay for a little while
Baby, won't you just stay? 
Baby, won't you just stay?
For a little while 
Baby, won't you just stay? 
For a little while 
Baby, won't you just stay? 
For a little while 
Forget about yesterday
'Cause I want you so bad
Make love to me
Like you never have
My love is coming down
Baby, won't you just stay for a little while
Baby, won't you just stay?
For a little while
I'm sorry I've done you so wrong, so wrong
And I really need you to come back home
I'm on my bended knee
I'm begging you please
No-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no,  no-no-no-no-no-no-no
Come on back, come on back
Come on back, yeah, oh, oh, oh yeah, oh yeah
