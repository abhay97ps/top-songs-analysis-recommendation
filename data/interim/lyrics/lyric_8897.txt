When I'm thinking bout you, baby
There's a bittersweet pain
Way down deep in the secret part of me
It's a sweet, persistent craving
Slowly driving me insane
Way down deep in the very heart of me
It's got me burning with desire
And only you can stop the fire
It's a burning thing
Baby, it's got a hold on me
It's a burning thing
Way down deep in the soul of me
It's a burning thing
Baby, my love for you is a burning thing
When you're not right here beside me
All the world is standing still
Girl, I need what only you can give to me
There's an emptiness inside me
Only you alone can fill
Girl, I need for you and love with me
It's got me going up in flames
And only you can bring the rain
It's a burning thing
Baby, it's got a hold on me
It's a burning thing
Way down deep in the soul of me
It's a burning thing
Baby, my love for you is a burning thing
It's a burning thing
Baby, it's got a hold on me
It's a burning thing
Way down deep in the soul of me
It's a burning thing
Baby, my love for you is a burning thing
It's a burning thing
Baby, it's got a hold on me
It's a burning thing
Way down deep in the soul of me
It's a burning thing
Baby, my love for you is a burning thing
