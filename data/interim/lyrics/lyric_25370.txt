June, you're a genius
Yeah 
Sack coming in and the money don't fold 
Gotta put a stamp on it 
Just hit a play, scrape it off the plate 
Gotta put the camp on it 
Pussy ass nigga always talking that tough shit
Nigga, put a date on it 
Everybody sittin' at the table 'round here, yeah
There's a lot of plates on it
Runnin' through the money and the bitch keep callin'
Hold up, she gon' have to wait on it 
VVS diamond drippin' all over my t-shirt
Reach for it, I'ma put your face on it
Rolls Royce truck on the way, cashed out for it 
Still had to wait on it 
Plug fucked around, sent the wrong damn kind 
Nigga still had to pay for it 
Pack coming in on I-40 
I'ma keep a thirty in my 40 
I'ma buy a Birkin for my shawty 
Nigga did me dirty, ran off on me 
Plug did me dirty, took off on me 
Lil' hitter just folded, got soft on me
I'm from the streets, you gotta pay with your life, I got a way with the white
You just like your father and he was a rat, uh
So that mean he raising a mice, yeah
I had to trap through the night, yeah
I put that pack on a flight, yeah
I shot all them pussies the same night 
Laid in the bushes, a rainy night
Won't put no hoes on no pedestal
Edibles, I'm tryna fuck 'em the same night
I put two hoes on the same flight 
Cooked up ten bricks in the same pot 
I shot four niggas, the same Glock 
Too many you niggas got the same watch
Why you competin' with me, nigga?
We are not playing with the same check
It's murder, more murder for hire
And that shit been stuck on my mindset
Sack coming in and the money don't fold 
Gotta put a stamp on it 
Just hit a play, scrape it off the plate 
Gotta put the camp on it 
Pussy ass nigga always talking that tough shit
Nigga, put a date on it 
Everybody sittin' at the table 'round here, yeah
There's a lot of plates on it
Runnin' through the money and the bitch keep callin'
Hold up, she gon' have to wait on it 
VVS diamond drippin' all over my t-shirt
Reach for it, I'ma put your face on it
Rolls Royce truck on the way, cashed out for it 
Still had to wait on it 
Plug fucked around, sent the wrong damn kind 
Nigga still had to pay for it 
Hundred thousand dollars off a iPhone 
I ain't talkin' show money 
Plug keep calling, we gon' take his ass down 
That'll be some more money 
Labels talking contracts, I ain't signing shit 
Tell 'em that I know money 
I used to shop with a bitch, she got 'em low
She kept it realer than niggas
If she get a number better than these bookings I'm gettin'
I swear that I'm floodin' the city
A rap nigga better not diss me 'cause I run with hitters
Everywhere I go, they with me
Pack comin' in on a back street 
12 ride by, nigga still keep workin'
Gettin' fifty thousand dollars for a show
Knowin' goddamn well niggas still ain't workin'
I been told these folks that I quit 
Knowin' goddamn well nigga still sippin' syrup
Got the trap goin' crazy like the first and the third
Got a lot of cash money, I could still get birds
Get away with my chain, he gon' still get murked
Had an FN on me when I did this verse
If she suck good dick, she gon' leave with a purse
I was really in the streets, you can do your research
Sack coming in and the money don't fold 
Gotta put a stamp on it 
Just hit a play, scrape it off the plate 
Gotta put the camp on it 
Pussy ass nigga always talking that tough shit
Nigga, put a date on it 
Everybody sittin' at the table 'round here, yeah
There's a lot of plates on it
Runnin' through the money and the bitch keep callin'
Hold up, she gon' have to wait on it 
VVS diamond drippin' all over my t-shirt
Reach for it, I'ma put your face on it
Rolls Royce truck on the way, cashed out for it 
Still had to wait on it
