Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day
While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song, the music seemed to come from afar
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live forever more, because of Christmas day
For a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted, "Let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight
And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas day
Oh a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted, "let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"
Oh my Lord, you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord, your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more
Oh my Lord, when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord, a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord, they gathered all around him
To see him and adore
Oh my lord, with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord, there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord, and full of admiration
They realized what they had 
Oh my Lord, they had become to doubt you 
Oh my Lord, what did they know about you? 
Oh my Lord, but they were lost without you 
They needed you so bad 
Oh my lord, with the child's adoration 
Oh my Lord, there came great jubilation 
Oh my Lord, and full of admiration 
They realized what they had 
Oh my Lord, you sent your son to save us 
Oh my Lord, your very self you gave us 
Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us  
And love may reign once more
