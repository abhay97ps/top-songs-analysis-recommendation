Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
An' little girls from Sweden
Dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The Sun may rise in the east
At least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication
Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: is this your chin
Or is that war you're waging?
Firstborn unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Marry me, girl; be my fairy to the world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication
Born and raised by those who praise
Control of population
Well, everybody's been there
And I don't mean no vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
They're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication
Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test
But this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
