First name initial
First name initial
First name initial
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
I wear a first name initial, a great big initial
On a chain ev'rywhere I go
It's your first name initial, a great big initial
Engraving don't you know 
And I wear it to
Show I belong to you
Just you
I love my first name initial, it makes it official
That you're my steady boy
It's your first name initial, a great big initial
Befits my pride and joy 
'cause it's a symbol of
My everlasting love
For you
I wear it at the soda shop, wear it at the record hop
Ridin to a movie in your jeep 
I wear it when I go to gym, wear it when I take a swim
I even wear it when I slee-ee-ee-eep
I wear your first name initial, a great big initial
And though it's your first name
I wish your last name initial and my last initial
Will one day be the same
So ev'ryone can see
That you belong to me
Just me 
I wear it at the soda shop, wear it at the record hop
Ridin to a movie in your jeep (tood-a-loop, tood-a-loop
Tood-a-loop )
I wear it when I go to gym, wear it when I take a swim
I even wear it when I slee-ee-ee-eep
I wear your first name initial, a great big initial
And though it's your first name
I wish your last name initial and my last initial
Will one day be the same
So ev'ryone can see
That you belong to me
Just me
First name initial
First name initial
First name initial
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
