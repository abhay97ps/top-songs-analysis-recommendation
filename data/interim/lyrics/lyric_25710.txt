I just hopped off a private plane and went and hopped on 85 
Go call my chauffeur, bitch, 'cause I don't like to drive
We in Suburbans back to back and we gon' fill 'em up with vibes 
Fill 'em with vibes , get in and ride 
And no, a nigga not blind 
But I keep the stick and I'm firin' 
I ain't met a nigga in life
That's fuckin' with me, say he did, then he lyin' 
Got so many vibes stuffed in the car
We can fuck them hoes six at a time 
I make them hoes say, "That nigga so fine" 
"Girl, he got the dick you can feel in your spine" 
Yeah, that what they say about Baby
You know that them bitches don't play about Baby

Look what God did, took his time with me 
Got a red and white ho like a peppermint 
Book the hotel, take the vibes in

My brother 'nem, havin' three hoes in the king size
I ain't finished yet , get another bitch 
Got her ridin' dick and screamin', "Yeehaw" 
Make me proud, girl, you a cowgirl 
Did a handstand, I'm like, "Wow, girl" 
Got me fuckin' her upside-down , baow, baow

I'm lookin' like, "When?" She lookin' like, "Now"
Some more came in, say they want it too
I tagged in my brother, bitch, I'm out , I know
She wanna fuck with me, but I don't got the time 
I just hopped off a private plane and went and hopped on 85 
Go call my chauffeur, bitch, 'cause I don't like to drive

She wanna fuck on me, but I don't got the time 
I just hopped off a private plane and went and hopped on 85 
Go call my chauffeur, bitch, 'cause I don't like to drive
We in Suburbans back to back and we gon' fill 'em up with vibes 
Let's get on a jet , come give me some neck 
She ain't pickin' up , and her nigga just called, she gon' send him a text
I don't need no doc', bitch, you know I'm a dog, better send me the vet
Ever made you a million? I tell 'em, "Riddle me that," ain't offended me yet
My bitch drink Bacardi, I'm in this bitch feelin' like 'Set , quarter mil' on my neck
One-point-two on the crib, four hundred thou' on the whip, dickin' down your lil' bitch
I'm 'bout to go buy me a coupe 
Pull up, make the doors raise the roof 
Louis V army fatigue 
Hop out with a pole like a troop 
Baby Ray Allen from three 
You leave me open, I shoot 
We like Martin and Pam at the hotel 
We kickin' hoes out, get the boot 
These hoes catchin' bodies, they 'bout it 
We having new vibes in the lobby 
That's wherever we go, ain't no problem 
I just told a bitch no, she was childish 
Pulled up like
She wanna fuck with me, but I don't got the time 
I just hopped off a private plane and went and hopped on 85 
Go call my chauffeur, bitch, 'cause I don't like to drive
We in Suburbans back to back and we gon' fill 'em up with vibes
