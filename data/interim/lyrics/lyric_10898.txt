This girl in her bedroom doing her homework
She's foolin' with the logarithms, she's going berserk
One hand has a cigarette resting on the window
The other one's twiddling with the radio
I dig the talkback, but the hosts drive her nuts
Night time, sounds fine, no ifs or buts
It's just some magic, there's still some fun
If you don't pay too much attention I say
Who listens to the radio?
Who listens to the radio?
Who listens to the radio?
That's what I'd like to know
Who listens to the radio?
Guy's got his transistor wrapped around his ear
He's oblivious to the traffic, it's not really clear
It crackles, it clicks, it pops, it starts
It's blastin' out the top 40 charts
AM or FM, I listen to both of them
Listening to the radio since I don't know when
Everyone's so busy, everyone's got somewhere to go
In the background there's always the radio
Who listens to the radio?
Who listens to the radio?
Who listens to the radio?
That's what I'd like to know
Who listens to the radio?
