Hey, Bruno!
Say, what's up, fellows?
You're hanging out down here with us, under the boardwalk?
Hey, man, I got my lady down here
Let's throw down
Oh, when the sun beats down and melts the tar up on the roof
And the streets get so hot you wish your tired feet were fireproof
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be
 Out of the sun
 We'll be having some fun
 People walking above
 We'll be falling in love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk
Now from the sand you hear the happy sounds of a carousel
Ooohooo, you can almost taste the hotdogs and french fries they sell
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be
 Out of the sun
 We'll be having some fun
 People walking above
 We'll be falling in love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be
 Out of the sun
 We'll be having some fun
 People walking above
 We'll be falling in love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk
