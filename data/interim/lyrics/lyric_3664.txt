Sittin' here lonely like a broken man
Servin' my time doin' the best I can
Walls and bars they're surroundin' me
But I don't want your sympathy
Oh, baby, oh, baby
I just need your tender lovin'
To keep me sane in this burnin' oven
When my time is up be my rebirth
Like I was worth on God's green earth
My rebirth, my rebirth
Baby, yeah, mean it's my rebirth, yeah
Yeah, , yeah 
Yeah, , yeah 
Yeah, baby , baby 
Come on , come on 
Yeah, , yeah
Ice cold water runnin' in my brain
Then they drag me back to work again
Pains and blisters on my minds and my hands
From livin' daily with those canvas bags
Thoughts of freedom they're drivin' me wild
And I'll be happy like a newborn child
We'll be together, girl, you wait and see
No more walls keep your love from me
Yeah!
Can't you feel my love
Baby , baby 
I need you , squeeze you 
Yeah, come on , nobody but 
You do , I love you 
Need you, alright
I said everything's gonna be alright
And if you don't believe what I say just
Just listen, baby
Can't you feel my love?
Can't you see my skill
Can't you yell my love?
It's getting louder
It's getting louder
A little closer, yeah
I said, baby , I need you 
Come on , squeeze 
Please , oh! 
Lord, I love you , I need you 
Yeah, yeah
Right by my side
I need you here by my side
But I can't help it, baby
But I'll be home soon
I'll be home soon
Yeaheah
Alright
Oh!
