When I saw you standing there
I asked myself, "Is she the kind who plays it fair?"
I shouldn't let that bother me no more
Not this playboy who's felt the pain of love before
But how was I to know this feeling
Comin' on would be so strong
It's not turning out the way I planned
Hey, it's all wrong, but you make me wanna
Give you more than you bargained for, girl
And I've just begun to love you
I don't want no other to be my lover
And I've just begun to love you
I never been hooked so easily
Though I tried to stop, I couldn't stop what had to be
You say your old boyfriend let you down
And now he calls, well, baby, you belong to me
And this time I'll make the best of our love
I got ways to keep you mine
I don't wanna move too fast if I can
Make it last, and you make me wanna
Give you more than you bargained for, girl 
And I've just begun to love you 
I don't want no other to be my lover 
And I've just begun to love you
I've just begun
Said it ain't over, baby
I've just begun to love you
I've just begun
Said it ain't over, baby
I've just begun to love you
I've just begun to love you
I've just begun to love you
I've just begun to love you
I've just begun to love you
Give you more than you bargained for, girl 
And I've just begun to love you
I don't want no other to be my lover
And I've just begun to love you 
I've just begun to love you
I've just begun to love you
Girl, I feel it lasting longer, with you it's stronger
And I've just begun to love you
Girl, these words I've told you, I say when we're older
And I've just begun to love you
I feel it lasting longer, oh, yeah
And I've just begun to love you
Each day my love gets stronger
I've just begun to love you
Give you more than you bargained for, girl
And I've just begun to love you
I don't want no other to be my lover
And I've just begun to love you
Give you more than you bargained for, girl
And I've just begun to love you
I don't want no other to be my lover
And I've just begun to love you
