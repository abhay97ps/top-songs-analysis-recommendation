I know we only met just the other day
But I'm hopin' that this love song
Will help me find a way, to say
What are you doin' for the next hundred years
Where are you gonna be tomorrow
Who's gonna wipe away your now and then tears
Which rainbow leads you into your dreams
And if you're lonely on a dark rainy day
How are you gonna share the sorrow
Where will you turn when you want someone to say
It's not as bad as it all seems
You're gonna need someone to help you get through
To understand, take your hand
To keep on loving you
I'd love to love you for the next hundred years
I wanna share you joy and sorrow
I'd wipe away all of your now and then tears
If only I could be part of your dreams
You're gonna need someone to help you get through
To understand, take your hand
To keep on loving you
I'd love to love you for the next hundred years
I wanna share you joy and sorrow
I'd wipe away all of your now and then tears
If only I could be part of your dreams
I'd love to love you for the next hundred
Oh darlin', make me a part of your dreams
