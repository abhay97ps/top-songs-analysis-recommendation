Intro:
Ohh, ohh
Ring, ring, ring, ring
Chorus:
I got nothing left to eat, oh, oh
You won’t make it ring, ring, ring, ring
I can’t met a girl my age
You can’t make it ring, ring, ring, ring
Verse 1:
Who do I meet? I can’t choose
I want to, but Jessica won’t let me
Why showing butts? It will slow down the kids stuff
That is so immature if that’s so stupid where do I start baby
What are you up to baby what?
Two minutes songs can be super tough for business
Don’t give a ring finger lake side what the heck
Want play around until you leave me for a minute
Got nothing to do baby
I want to be a fan of you and the music group
I will end up in jail to get my diet a world
It sames dangerous to not eat for a week, baby
Chorus:
I got nothing left to eat, oh, oh
You won’t make it ring, ring, ring, ring
I can’t met a girl my age
You can’t make it ring, ring, ring, ring
Verse 2:
Nah, Jessica please call my Jessica 
Cause I’m looking at these messages, I have them 
Don’t show your butt that’s not okay
I will drive to a coffee place, without a disgusting person baby
You are also sick mom, crazy
Want to eat bite your, tongue
Bite your tongue you, can’t eat
You made a good sandwich then threw it away
That’s a waste of food, eat some krispy kreme
You can’t prove me wrong now eat it
Once you hit me, no going back
Here is my pop, not in the trash
Chorus:
I got nothing left to eat, oh, oh
You won’t make it ring, ring, ring, ring
I can’t met a girl my age
You can’t make it ring, ring, ring, ring
Verse 3:
Yo used to the store
With all my statue pain, pain
Love me or hate I won’t eat now
Don’t show me your booty just don’t eat for a week
And no one found me, watching Rhett & Link every morning
I love no one to love and nothing left to eat now
I have you now Jess, yeah
I can’t get AIDs or cancer cause I have no cause, yeah
You are all awesome
Ready for a second, a second step in life
I will miss you, you can miss me
All I know is
Chorus:
I got nothing left to eat, oh, oh
You won’t make it ring, ring, ring, ring
I can’t met a girl my age
You can’t make it ring, ring, ring, ring
