When I'm down I make a call
Got the number written on the wall
First it's busy then I try again
Oh, who's she talking to, could it be him?
I got the number and it starts to ring
I get excited and I start to dream
I start to fantasize of memory lane
Then she answers and she says right way
She says I'm home on my own, home all alone
So I got off the phone
 She's ahead of her time
 She's one of a kind
 She's a talented girl
 She's got her head down tight
I have something got to say to you
Amnesia and my train of thought
On the tip, tip of my tongue
I had a vision when I was young
You floated in, we floated up
Through the window and down the hall
I had a smoke and went upstairs
Turned the door and opened the key. She spoke...
I'm on my own, home all alone
So I got off the phone
 She's ahead of her time
 She's one of a kind
 She's a talented girl
 She's got her head down tight
 She's giving me the go
 She's giving me the high sign
 We'll turn off the lights
 Pull down the shades
 Turn on the cam'ra
 And getting ready for action
Turn off the radio
Turn on the video
