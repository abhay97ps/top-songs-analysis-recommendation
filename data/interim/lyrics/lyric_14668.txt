Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah yeah yeah
Ooh, yeah yeah, oh
Ooh baby
Ooh baby, mmm
In this world it's hard, you know
Lovers come and lovers go
People never seem to hold on to what they've got, no no
Some they never stay together
You and I will be no better
We can make it last forever
We can keep this love alive
Through the storm
Through the tears
You and I
I know we can survive
To the day
Through the night
If we try we can keep it alive
We can keep it alive
I know sometimes it's been so tough
We've been so close to giving up
Hey, but our love's so strong
And we keep holding on, yeah
To what we got, ooh ooh ooh
It's easier to walk away
It takes a lot of love to stay
Ah, we've got all the love it takes
We know there's a brighter day
Through the storm
Through the tears
You and I
I know we can survive
To the day
Through the night
If we try we can keep it alive
We can keep it alive
We just gotta be strong
We just gotta be strong
We just gotta be strong together
We just gotta hold on
We just gotta hold on
We just gotta hold on and go through the storm
Yeah yeah, through the storm
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
I know we're gonna make it
Through the storm 
Through the tears 
You and I 
I know we can survive
To the day 
Through the night 
If we try  we can keep it alive
We can keep it alive
Through the storm 
Through the tears 
You and I 
I know we can survive
To the day 
Through the night 
If we try  we can keep it alive
We can keep it alive
Through the storm
Ha, woo
You're right on the one, baby
Yep
We made it
We're outta here
Yes
Sing it
Dee-dee, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Dee-dee, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Dee-dee, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
