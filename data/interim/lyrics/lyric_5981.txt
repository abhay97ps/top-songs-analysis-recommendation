Your kisses take me
To Shangri-La
Each kiss is magic
That makes my little world
A Shangri-La
A land of
Bluebirds and fountains
And nothing to do
But cling to an angel
That looks like you
And when you hold me
How warm you are
Be mine, my darling
And spend your life with me
In Shangri-La
For anywhere you are is Shangri-La
How warm you are
And spend your life with me
In Shangri-La
For anywhere you are is Shangri-La
