I'll pack up all my things and walk away
I don't want to hear another word you have to say
I've been waiting for so long
I just found out there's something wrong
Nothing will get better if I stay
There's no need to explain anymore
I tried my best to love you
Now I'm walkin' out the door
You used me, you've deceived me
And you never seem to need me
But I'll bet, you won't forget me when I go
Seems I've been lost in a dream
Pretending that you care
And now I've opened up my eyes
And found it's all been just a great big fairytale
I've been lovin' you so long
Don't think I'll even know how to forget you
But now the way that things have been
I think I'm better off alone
Than to be with you
You don't love me, it's plain to see
You played around, you broke my heart
Told me we would never part
But that wasn't true
So what else can I do but move on
I've been loving you so long
Don't think I'll even know how to forget you
But now the way that things have been
I think I'm better of alone
Than to be with you
You don't love me, it's plain to see
There's no need to explain anymore
I tried my best to love you
Now I'm walkin' out the door
Oh, you used me, you deceived me
And you never seem to need me
But I'll bet, you won't forget me when I go
Seems I've been lost in a dream
Pretending that you mine
Someday you'll open up your eyes
And realize that a good woman's hard to find
Yes, I've been lost in a dream
Pretending that you care
And now I've opened up my eyes
And found it's all been just a great big fairytale
Move on, got to move on
Move on, got to move on
Move on, got to move on
Move on, got to move on
Move on
Hit it, Nellie
I've got to move on
