Are we really happy with this lonely game we play?
Looking for the right words to say
Searching but not finding understanding anyway
We're lost in this masquerade
Both afraid to say we’re just too far away
From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable
Yet, you're my favorite work of art
I’ll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you
That way I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
There's a somebody I’m longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who’ll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who’s lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me
You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs 
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion 
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
I couldn't bear it without you
Don’t get around much anymore
I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song
Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends
I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, baby, when I say
I won't know sweet music
'Cause I don't get around much
I don't get around much
I don't get around much
I don't get around much anymore
