808 Mafia
Uh, uh-uh-uh, DJ Khaled
We The Best music 
Oh, this what we doin' here, another one 
I'ma have to put my jewellery on for this one
Wraith talk, Wraith talk, oh, we talkin' that Wraith talk
Safe talk, safe talk , here we go talkin' that safe talk
Major key alert Oh, we good now
Major bag alert,  DJ Khaled
I got them keys, the keys, the keys
I got them keys, the keys, the keys
I got them keys, the keys, the keys
I got them keys, the keys, the keys
We go to court, we gon' plead the fifth 
I know the judge, I'ma shoot him some chips 
I got them keys, the keys, the keys 
I got them keys, the keys, the keys
Niggas always askin' me the key
'Til you own your own you can't be free
'Til you're on your own you can't be me
How we still slaves in 2016?
Key to life, keep a bag comin'
Every night another bag comin'
I ain't been asleep since '96
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
I been speedin' through life with no safety belt
One on one with the corner with no safety help
I perform like Josh Norman, I ain't normal, nigga
Just a project nigga out in Beverly Hills, California, nigga
That Wraith talk, that's foreign, nigga
Special cloth talk here
All my niggas from the mud damn near
All my niggas millionaires
We gon' take it there, I swear
You gon' think a nigga's psychic
You ain't seen nothin' like this
I should probably copyright this
I promise they ain't gonna like this
I got them keys, the keys, the keys 
I got them keys, the keys, the keys
I got them keys, the keys, the keys 
I got them keys, the keys, the keys 
We go to court, we gon' plead the fifth 
I know the judge, I'ma shoot him some chips 
I got them keys, the keys, the keys 
I got them keys, the keys, the keys 
Radar, radar, oh, bitches ain't even on my radar 
Radar, radar, oh, you ain't on my radar 
Radar, radar, no, no, you hatin' on my radar 
No, no, you bitches ain't, bitches ain't even on my radar 
I got a bag for lawyers, like, "Fuck your charges!"
Hop out the courtroom, like, "What charges?"
Big pimpin' on your court steps
Case y'all ain't notice, I ain't lost yet
Y'all know it's one of one
Soon as you hear that, "uh-uh", uh 
Y'all know the difference right?
From rap facts and fiction, right? Shit
Real life I'm like HOV, real life I'm life goals
In real life they're like me? In real life I'm like, "No."
My swag different , that bag different 
My wife Beyonc√© , I brag different 
My baby Blue 
I dream in color 
That's too much flavor 
I don't rap to suckas 
God bless you all, I only talk special talk
I only talk special cloth
Said I only talk special, ah!
I got them keys, the keys, the keys
I got them keys, the keys, the keys 
I got them keys, the keys, the keys

I know the judge, I'ma shoot him some chips
I got them keys, the keys, the keys 
I got them keys, the keys, the keys 
Radar, radar, oh, bitches ain't even on my radar 
Radar, radar, oh, you ain't on my radar
