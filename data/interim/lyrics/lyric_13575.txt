You're in my blood, and I can't help but love you
Don't pull away, I tell you that I love you
Have I been cursed, to walk this earth without you
You're in my blood, now I can't live without you
Just take my hand, I can go no place without you
Come a little bit closer, I'd never ever hurt you
Am I the one, to never ever feel your love
Slowly I'm learning, why my heart is burning
Through the dark nights, how we loved, I can't live without you
I want to look and feel your touch, ooh
I must be dreaming, I must be dreaming, I must be dreaming
Take my hand, I can go no place without you
Come a little bit closer, I'd never ever hurt you
Slowly I'm learning, why my heart is burning
Through the dark night, how we loved, I can't live without you
I want to look and feel your touch, ooh
I must be dreaming, I must be dreaming, I must be dreaming
Solo
You're in my blood, and I can't help but love you
Don't pull away, I tell you that I love you
Have I been cursed, to walk this earth without you I can't keep believing, I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming, I must be dreaming, I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming, I must be dreaming, I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming, I must be dreaming, I must be dreaming
