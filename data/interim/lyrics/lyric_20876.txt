Ah, ah, ah
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I... I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you long time
I... I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you long time
You ain't even gotta worry about a thing
I gotcha, babe
And ain't nobody takin' me away
It's not a game, I'm here to stay
See, our love is stronger than any drug
Addictive, just can't get enough
And every time I'm with you, I want some more
Just close the door, and let's explore each other
Long as I know you got me
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
There's no stopping you and me
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
Don't care what no one has to say
They don't understand us like we do
I need you near me night and day
Together there ain't nothin' we can't do
Scoop me up and we can go
To that little spot where no one knows
Spend a little time, just us alone
You can caress my body, and never let go
Long as I know you got me 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin' you long time  
There's no stopping you and me 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
 I'll be lovin' you long time  
I don't want another, ain't gon' never be another
Can't nobody do what you do to me 
Don't want another, ain't gon' never be another 
Can't nobody do what you do to me 
Don't want another, ain't gon' never be another 
Can't nobody do what you do to me 
I'll be lovin' you long as I can breathe 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
Long as I know you got me 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
There's no stopping you and me 
I'll be lovin' you long time  
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin'
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin'
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
I'll be lovin' you long time  
Hey, babe
I'll be lovin' you long time
