How do you keep the music playing
How do you make it last
How do keep the song from fading
Too fast
How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run out of new things
To say
And since you know we're always changing
How can it be the same
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear her name
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day
To make it better as it goes
With any luck than I suppose
The music never ends
