Angela can't make it to the phone
If you care to leave your name and number
She'll give you a ring when she is home
Every time I called her I got the message
Listened to the voice coming down the line
I couldn't speak to a tape recording
I redialed it a number of times
853-5937
Angela can't make it to the phone
If you care to leave your name and number
Please speak clearly after the tone
She'll give you a ring when she gets home
I rang her this morning so very early
Same old message came down the phone
I should go and see if her house is empty
Maybe she's poorly, perhaps she's not home

Angela can't make it to the phone
If you care to leave your name and number
Please speak clearly after the tone
She'll give you a ring when she gets home
She's in Mill Hill, I'm in Bermondsey
It's the end of the earth on the northern line
Makes it so hard for me to see
The one that I love but can never find
Called up a close friend who lives right by her
I got the message he was out too
I got suspicious, are they together?
I've got to find out that this isn't true, oh
