Hop in that whip , I'm 'bout to see you 
I'm like a creature , I'm on the creep 
If I don't get all of my chips, I can't leave just yet 
Get that top, then I dip, I'ma leave her wet 
I put plates on my neck, like tectonics 
I put plates on my whip, it's a rocket ship 
Sip drank, on Hypnotic 
You know our lil' nigga gon' pop shit

Bend her over, pull her tracks out

I really live what I rap 'bout

Because I'd rather take the fast route 
If you wanna make bets then I'm open up TD
She like, "Papi, all I got is Citi"

Light up the smoke like a Dutch in the city

Man down

Poppin' shit on the lot, make him camp out
He was twirlin' back then, he a fan now 
I keep nothin' but blues in these pants now 
Rubber band for these racks and these bands now 
We keep sticks and these drums, like a band now 
My new bitch exotic

You ain't poppin', stop it 
Fresh as fuck, no stylist 
Niggas stealin' styles, jackin', jockin'

Before the grave, turn the money to ashes
