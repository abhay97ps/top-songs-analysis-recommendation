Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to that girl's heart for me
Cupid, please, hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to that girl's heart for me
Now, I don't mean to bother you, but I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing all of my happiness
For I love a girl who don't know I exist
And this you can fix
So
Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please, hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Now Cupid, if you do it, make her love strong for me
I promise I will love her until eternity
I know between the two of us, her heart we can steal
Help me if you will
So
Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please, hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to that girl's heart for me
Cupid
Cupid
Cupid
Draw back that bow
