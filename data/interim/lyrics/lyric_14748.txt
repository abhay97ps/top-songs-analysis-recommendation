It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be, yeah
You've been hangin' 'round my boyfriend
You've been sayin' that he's sweet, yeah
Well, girl, I know that you've been talkin'
Because that talk is on the street
You say that you are gonna steal his heart
Well, sweetie, you ain't gonna get that far
You're after somethin' that don't belong to you
Well, girlfriend, I've got news for you
What are you trying to say, Miss Thang? Huh
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
He ain't never, ever, never, never, never
Never, never, never, never, never, never
Gonna be your man
Ah, oh, yeah
Oh, ooh
Hey
Well, I just ain't the kind of woman
To pick the fruit off of your tree, girl
And you keep sayin' that is your man
But that ain't what he said to me
See, he blows me kisses as he drives away
He sends me roses in the middle of the day, yeah
You think it's you that he's thinkin' of
But I'm the one that he really, really loves, girl
So what am I trying to say? Don't diss me, girl
I said, it isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
He ain't never, ever, never, never, never
Never gonna be yours 
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
Oh, it isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
He ain't never, ever, never, never, never
Never gonna be your man, girl
What are you doin', layin' and hangin' back?
Don't you know it, girl?
Mmhmm, just as I suspected 
You been talkin' that la-la, and that ya-ya
And that yin and that yang, but the man is mine
Hey
He blows me kisses as he drives away
He sends me flowers in the middle of the day, yeah
You think it's you that he's thinkin' of
I know I'm the one that he really, really, really loves
What am I tryin' to say Miss It?
What are you tryin' to say?
Get real
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
He ain't never , ever , never , never , never 
Never gonna be yours 
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
Oh, it isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
He ain't never , ever , never , never , never 
Never gonna be your man
Be your man
That's Aretha
Oh, woah
Ah 
So now, what is this?
Well, you know
And my man is supposed to be interested in you?
That's what I'm saying
You know, I realize that you're under pressure
Yes, I am
That you're suffering from delusions
Well
Don't be ridiculous
I'm not
Get real
You better get real
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be

Never gonna be yours 
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
