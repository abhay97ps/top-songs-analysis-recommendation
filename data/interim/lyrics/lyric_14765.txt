Got a picture of your house
And you're standin' by the door
It's black and white and faded
And it's lookin' pretty worn
See the factory that I worked
Silhouetted in the back
Memories are gray
But man, they're really coming back
I don't need to be the king of the world
As long as I'm the hero of this little girl
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say
How I love the way you move
And the sparkle in your eyes
There's a color deep inside 'em
Like a blue suburban sky
When I come home late at night
And you're in bed asleep
I'll wrap my arms around you
So I can feel you breathe
I don't need to be a superman, ah ah
As long as you will always be my biggest fan
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say
We'll find our way, yeah
Now the lights are goin' out
Along the boulevard
The memories come rushin' back
And it makes it pretty hard
I got nowhere left to go
No one really cares
I don't know what to do
But I'm never givin' up on you
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends say
I know we're gonna find a way
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh oh
It's not too far away
Oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh, oh
Yeah
