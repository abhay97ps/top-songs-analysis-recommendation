Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I knew you when you were lonely
I knew you when you were only
A girl all alone without love
I knew you when 
I knew you when
You were sad and all alone
You didn't have anyone
That you could call your own
I knew you when
Your heart belonged to only me
But that was many tears ago
Now, your love is just a memory
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I knew you when you were lonely
I knew you when you were only
A girl all alone without love
I knew you when 
I knew you when 
We used to have a lot of fun
But someone new could offer more
Now, I'm the lonely one
I knew you when
You were just a scared little girl
I used to be your only love
Before you came up in the world
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I knew you when you were lonely
I knew you when you were only
A girl all alone without love 
I knew you when 
Please 
 Come on back, baby
