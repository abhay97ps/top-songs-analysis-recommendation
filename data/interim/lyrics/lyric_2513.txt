Another cup of coffee, another cigarette
Another hour of mem'ries so hard to forget
How your crazy-lovin' arms held me so tight
Another cup of java, another lonely night
Put a dime in the jukebox, play a sad, sad song
And all the time I'll be thinkin' about the dream that's gone wrong
And where you used to say "Our love is still alive"
Another cup of coffee, another lonely night
But there'll be me, I don't blame you for walkin' out on me
'Cause the way I cheated on you, I deserve this misery
Another love has found you, he's a lucky guy
Another's arms all around you, I'm so sad I could cry
Darling, if you don't come back, I know what's in sight
Another cup of coffee, another lonely night
Whoa, dear, if you don't come back, I know what's in sight
Another cup of coffee, another lonely night
Another cup of coffee, hmmm, another lonely night
