There's life underground
I feel it all around, I feel it in my bones
My life is on the line when I'm away from home
When I step out the door, the jungle is alive
I do not trust my ears, I don't believe my eyes
I will not fall in love—I cannot risk the bet
'Cause hearts are fragile toys—so easy to forget
It's just another day, there's murder in the air
It drags me when I walk, I smell it everywhere
It's just another day where people cling to light
To drive away the fear that comes with every night
 it's just another day
 it's just another day
 it's just another day
 it's just another day
It's just another day when people wake from dreams
The voices in their ears that will not go away
I had a dream last night: the world was set on fire
And everywhere I ran, there wasn't any water
The temperature increased, the sky was crimson red
The clouds turned into smoke and everyone was dead
But there's a smile on my face
For everyone
There's a golden coin
That reflects the sun
There's a lonely place
That's always cold
There's a place in the stars
For when you get old
There's razors in my bed that come out late at night
They always disappear before the morning light
I'm dreaming again of life underground
It doesn't ever move, it doesn't make a sound
And just when I think that things are in their place
The heavens are secure—the whole thing explodes in my face
 it's just another day
 it's just another day
 it's just another day
 it's just another day
There's a smile on my face 
For everyone 
There's a golden coin 
That reflects the sun 
There's a lonely place 
That's always cold 
There's a place in the stars 
For when you get old
