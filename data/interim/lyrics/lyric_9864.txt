Baby, baby, baby, baby, babe

I guess the weekend's over now
And you'll have to make your way
We had a ball of dynamite
Right from the first day
Tell me that you'll call me
Just as soon as you get home
To pacify my heart while I'm alone
I don't like being alone
The things we did this time, my love, we've never done before
You've made some changes in my head
I don't feel the same no more
Tell me it's not make believe
This feeling that you've shown
To comfort me, my love, while I'm alone
I don't like being alone
Doo doo doo
Doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo
Just think the times you left before
And me burnin' up inside
Somethin' I can't see no more
Not from my foolish pride
Please be with me, honey
All the times when you're not home
To pacify my heart while I'm alone
I don't like being alone
Hey hey, I don't like it
Being alone
I can't stand it
Being alone
Ooh baby
Ooh baby baby
Hey
Hey
Alright now, baby
Ooh, I miss you, baby
And all the time, you know I don't like being all alone, baby
Ooh
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby
Can't you see that you're my baby
Hi, hi
Oh
