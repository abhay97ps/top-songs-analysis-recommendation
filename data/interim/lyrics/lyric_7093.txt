Beyond the shadow of a doubt
As the mighty river flows
As the meadow gaily plays
With the wind on summer days
Bout as deep as deep can go
From the canyons to the sky
Like a mother as she cares
For the baby that she bears
Do I love you
Don't you know by now
Do I love you
Must I show you how
Do I love you
Do I have to say
Do I love you
Yes, in every way
About as sacred as a hymn
And a Bible full of prayers
From a whisper to a roar
Very much and even more
And I shall show it with my eyes
And I will share it with the night
If in death, the Lord is kind
You're the last thing on my mind
Do I love you
You should know by now
Do I love you
Must I show you how
Do I love you
Do I have to say
Do I love you
Yes, in every way
Do I love you
You should know by now
Do I love you
Must I show you how
Do I love you
Do I have to say
Do I love you
Yes, in every way
Do I love you
You should know by now
