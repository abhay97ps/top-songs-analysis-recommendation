You say that I'm messing with your head
All 'cause I was makin' out with your friend
Love hurts, whether it's right or wrong
I can't stop 'cause I'm havin' too much fun
You're on your knees, beggin', "Please, stay with me"
But honestly, I just need to be a little crazy
All my life, I been good, but now
I'm thinkin', "What the hell?"
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about
If you love me, if you hate me
You can't save me, baby, baby
All my life, I been good, but now
Whoa, what the hell?
What? What?
What? What the hell?
So what if I go out on a million dates?
You never call or listen to me anyway
I'd rather rage than sit around and wait all day
Don't get me wrong, I just need some time to play
You're on your knees, beggin', "Please, stay with me"
But honestly, I just need to be a little crazy 
All my life, I been good, but now
I'm thinkin', "What the hell?"
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about
If you love me, if you hate me
You can't save me, baby, baby
All my life, I been good, but now
Whoa, what the hell?
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, whoa, whoa
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, whoa, whoa
You say that I'm messing with your head
Boy, I like messing in your bed
Yeah, I am messing with your head
When I'm messing with you in bed
All my life, I been good, but now
I'm thinkin', "What the hell?" 
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about 
All my life, I been good, but now
I'm thinkin', "What the hell?"
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about 
If you love me , if you hate me 
You can't save me, baby, baby 
All my life, I been good, but now
Whoa, what the hell?
La, la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la-la-la-la
