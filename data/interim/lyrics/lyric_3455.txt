Dance with me
Hold my hand
Dance with me
In the grand
When you hear that beat
Loud and sweet
Get off my feet
Would you dance with me?
Dance with me
Real slow
Dance with me
Just look at her go
You ride me high
And that's no lie
Baby, don't poke my eye
Would you dance with me, honey?
Dance with me
Make it last
Dance with me
You're sure a gas
It's a sight to see
What you do to me
You kick my knee
Could you dance with me, honey?
Dance, baby
Ride
Like, what's happening, baby
She sho' is hip
Like hi-o, big daddy
Ride
What am I doing here?
