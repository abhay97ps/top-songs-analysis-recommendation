Turn on that radio
As loud as it can go
Wanna dance until my feet can't feel the ground 
Say goodbye to all my fears
One good song, they disappear
And nothin' in the world can bring me down 
Hand-clappin', hip-shakin', heart-breakin'
There's no fakin' what you feel
When you're right at home, yeah 
Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day and every night
It's the one thing on my mind
Music's got control
And I'm never letting go, no, no
I just wanna play my music
Woo!
Got my six-string on my back
Don't need anything but that
Everything I want is here with me 
So forget that fancy car
I don't need to go that far
What's drivin' me is following my dreams, yeah
Hand-clappin', earth-shakin', heart-breakin'
There's no fakin' what you feel
When you're on a roll, yeah 
Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day and every night
It's the one thing on my mind
Music's got control
And I'm never letting go, no, no
I just wanna play my music
I just wanna play my music
Can't imagine what it'd be like 
Without the sounds of all my heroes singin' all my favorite songs
So I can sing along
Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day
And every night
It's the one thing on my mind
Music's got control
And I'm never letting go, no, no
I just wanna play my music
Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day and every night
It's the one thing on my mind
Music's got control
And I'm never letting go, no, no
I just wanna play my music all night long
Yeah!
