Love will abide
Take things in stride
Sounds like good advice
But there's no one at my side
And time washes clean
Love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me
But I don't know what it means
Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long, long time
Caught in my fears
Blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me
When you never let me near
And I never drew
One response from you
All the while you fell
All over girls you never knew
Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think it's going to hurt me
For a long, long time
Wait for the day
You'll go away
Knowing that you warned me
Of the price I'd have to pay
And life's full of flaws
Who knows the cause
Living in the memory
Of a love that never was
Cause I've done everything I know
To try and change your mind
And I think I'm going to miss you
For a long, long time
And I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long, long time
