Looking for a brighter tomorrow
Hoping that the wind and rain is clear
Laying down by the river
Wearing out my old blue jeans
So many things have come between us
Gotta stand up and move around
I just wanna fall in love again
I don't want our dreams to ever end
I just wanna fall in love again
Ahhh
With you
I still love to go to the river
Ahhh
Just to wash my blues away
And the wind is still blowing
But without you
Oh, the rain don't feel the same
I can see by the tears in your eyes
I don't wanna live on a memory
I just wanna fall in love again
I don't want our dreams to ever end
I just wanna fall in love again
Ahhh
Be with you
With you, yeah
All alone at night
With everything you need
Reflections in the mirror
Is all you really see
You're just someone else
And I can't live on a memory
I just wanna fall in love again
I don't want our dreams to ever end
Say you wanna fall in love again
I don't want our dreams to ever end
I just wanna fall in love again
Ahhh, baby
With you
With you
I wanna fall in love again
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh
