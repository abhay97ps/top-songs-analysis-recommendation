Don't you know that I was sittin' back in Texas
I was playing those rhythm and blues
And then I got a big offer
For more money than I could refuse
I had the chance to make it
Playing anything I wanted to play
But way back in my mind
You know I could hear the people say
Keep playing that rock and roll
Keep doing what you been told
Save your money up for when you get old
Got to keep playing that rock and roll
So I packed up and I made it up to New York
Where my brother was a great big star
Yeah he was doing funky music
Singing and playing guitar
Johnny was making the big time
Everything was going his way
But way back in my mind
You know I could hear the people say
Keep playing that rock and roll
Keep doing what you been told
Save your money up for when you get old
Got to keep playing that rock and roll
Don't you know that I've been doing lots of thinking
I'vе been trying hard to figure it out
But there's a cеrtain kind of music, yeah
Got to make you jump and shout
Now you could call it commercial
If you want to be that way
But way back in my mind
You know I could hear the people say
Keep playing that rock and roll
Keep doing what you been told
Save your money up for when you get old
Got to keep playing that rock and roll
Oh you got to keep on playing
Oh you got to keep on playing
Oh you got to keep on playing
Got to keep playing that rock and roll
Keep playing that rock and roll
Keep doing what you been told
Save your money up for when you get old
Got to keep playing that rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll
To satisfy my soul
