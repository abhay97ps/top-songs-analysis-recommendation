Whoaaaaaaa
Scotty doesn't know that Fiona and me do it in my van every Sunday
She tells him she's in church, but she doesn't go
Still, she's on her knees, and
Scotty doesn't know
Oh, Scotty doesn't know-ow
So don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Fiona says she's out shoppin'
But she's under me and I'm not stoppin'
'Cause Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
So don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know
I can't believe he's so trustin'
While I'm right behind you thrustin' 
Fiona's got him on the phone
And she's tryin' not to moan
It's a three way call and he knows nothing, nothing
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
So don't tell Scotty
We'll put on a show
Everyone will go
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
The parkin' lot, why not?
It's so cool when you're on top
His front lawn in the snow
Laughin' so hard
'Cause Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
I did her on his birthday
'Cause Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty will know
Scotty has to know
Scotty's gotta know
Gonna tell Scotty
Gonna tell him myself
Scotty has to know
Scotty has to know
Scotty has to
Scotty has to
Scotty has to go
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know 
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know 
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't, Scotty doesn't
Scotty doesn't know
Ha ha ha
Aha ha
I should probably let him know
That is so bad, so bad
