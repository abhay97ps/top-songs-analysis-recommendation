Money come in, won't stop
You know Mister Lil Uzi got the guap
You know any time I'm gon' drop
You know none of them songs gon' flop
You know all of them songs gon' pop
I went platinum again, my God
I went two-tone on my drop
Bugatti, that's one-point-six off stock
Don't need no brakes, don't plan on stop
I told that girl, "I only want all the top"
Because punani always fall on my lap 
They know that I got the game all in a lock
He talkin' 'bout bird, we get that by the flock
A Benjamin Franklin always in my knot
I got way too much love right there, right for my block
And as long as my heart beating, it will not stop
I don't know nothin', who done got shot?
All I know I'm just boolin' with my slime 
And if they come get you and you got whopped
Then lil' slime, you gotta do your time
Like never mind that lil' shit 'cause we rich
'Cause right now we livin' and we doin' fine
And I understand why you livin' that life
We from the same hood, that's a nickel and dime
That's all we know
God gave me the opportunity to open doors
I'm up in Starlet's, seen YellowDol take all my dough 
She not even on the pole 
I got that girl from my bro 
Yeah, yeah, you know how this life goes, yeah, yeah 
I'm coming out Starlet's like four 
DQ watchin' the door
He blast at the opps for sure, yeah, yeah 
They ain't even know me and Bubba was close 
Niggas, they plot on the low 
But they all get smoked, sheets and toe, yeah, yeah
Money come in, won't stop
You know Mister Lil Uzi got the guap
You know any time I'm gon' drop
You know none of them songs gon' flop
You know all of them songs gon' pop
I went platinum again, my God

He talkin' 'bout bird, we get that by the flock 
A Benjamin Franklin always in my knot 
I got way too much love right there, right for my block 
And as long as my heart beating, it will not stop
Take the top off the coupe, wear the covers 
If you love me, then come eat my nuts 
Hundred million up now, ain't no trust 
Comme Des Garçons down when we lust
Get the pack in and I ride like the bus 
I had rent you them bands out in custody 
Told a cougar to try not to love on me
Push the bitch to the ground, she was nuttin' on me
She was crying and write me a summary 
Yellow and black the Lam', the bumblebee 
Just like a dog, she come to me 
I put a fish on the wrist 
Parkay, it come with a dish 
My Lambo' is washed, I don't rock Jordans, but today I got some, yeah
Yeah, Chanel is one of the reasons all them notice me
Yeah, it's been a long way to the victory and the nominees
Paris Fashion Week, shit ain't enough for me
I took the drip to Jupiter, never come back to the States
Money come in, won't stop
You know Mister Lil Uzi got the guap
You know any time I'm gon' drop
You know none of them songs gon' flop
You know all of them songs gon' pop
