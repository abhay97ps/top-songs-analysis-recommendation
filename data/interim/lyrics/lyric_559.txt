I love, I love, I love my calendar girl
Yeah, sweet calendar girl
I love, I love, I love my calendar girl
Each and every day of the year
You start the year all fine
You're my little Valentine
I'm gonna march you down the aisle
You're the Easter bunny
When you smile
Yeah, yeah
My heart's in a whirl
I love, I love, I love my little calendar girl
Every day 
Every day 
Of the year 
Maybe if I ask your dad and mom
They'd let me take you to the junior prom
Like a firecracker
I'm aglow
When you're on the beach you steal the show
Yeah, yeah
My heart's in a whirl
I love, I love, I love my little calendar girl
Every day 
Every day 
Of the year 
Whoo!
Yeah, yeah
My heart's in a whirl
I love, I love, I love my little calendar girl
Every day 
Every day 
Of the year 
I light the candles at your sweet sixteen
Romeo and Juliet on Halloween
I'll give thanks that you belong to me
You're the present 'neath my Christmas tree
Yeah, yeah
My heart's in a whirl
I love, I love, I love my little calendar girl
Every day 
Every day 
Of the year 
I love, I love, I love my calendar girl
Yeah, sweet calendar girl
I love, I love, I love my calendar girl
Yeah, sweet calendar girl
