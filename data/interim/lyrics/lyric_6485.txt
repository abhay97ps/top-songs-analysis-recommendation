I remember you
And the things we used to do
Last season in the sun
I remember spring
And the song our hearts would sing
Last season in the sun
Summer morning, summer morning
I remember summer morning
Summer morning in the sun
Summer morning, summer morning
I remember summer morning
When our love had just begun
Now the winter's through
And I'm back again with you
This season in the sun
Now another year
Has gone by and we can fly
This season in the sun
Summer morning, summer morning
I remember summer morning
Summer morning in the sun
Summer morning, summer morning
I remember summer morning
When our love had just begun
Walking, through the sunrise
With the mist upon your hair
Memories we share, we share
Summer morning, summer morning
I remember summer morning
Summer morning in the sun
Summer morning, summer morning
I remember summer morning
When our love had just begun
