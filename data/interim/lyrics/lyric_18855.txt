This time, I'm taking it away
I've got a problem
With me getting in the way
Not by design
So I take my face
And bash it into a mirror
I won't have to see the pain
Pain, pain!
This state is elevating
As the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again!
The hurt inside is fading 
This shit's gone way too far
All this time, I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore
For what's inside awaking 
I'm not, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and 
Oh, I cannot give any more
My mind's done with this, okay?
I've got a question
Can I throw it all away?
Take back what's mine
So I take my time
Guiding the blade down the line
Each cut closer to the vein
Vein, vein
This state is elevating
As the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again!
The hurt inside is fading 
This shit's gone way too far
All this time, I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore
For what's inside awaking 
I'm not, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and 
Oh, I cannot give any more
I'm here to stay 
Bring it down! 
I'm here to stay 
Bring it down! 
I'm here to stay 
Bring it down! 
I'm here to stay 
Bring it down!
Bring it down!
Bring it down!
Bring it down!
Gonna break it down!
Gonna break it down!
Gonna break it down!
Gonna break it down!
Gonna break it down!
Gonna break it down!
Gonna break it down!
Gonna break it!
This state is elevating
As the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again!
The hurt inside is fading 
This shit's gone way too far
All this time, I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore
For what's inside awaking 
I'm not, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and 
Oh, I cannot give any more
Give any more! 
Give any more! 
Give any more! 
Give any more!
