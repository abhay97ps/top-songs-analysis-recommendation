Yeah, yeah 
Woah, yeah, yeah
Sean, what up nigga? 
Yeah  Yeah, yeah
Lil' bitch
Couple riders with them llamas if you pick a bone wit’ me
Put my bitch up on designer, got Balenci' on her feet
My Mama say a couple prayers, keep them demons off me
'Cause I know I’m out here blessed, got so many reasons on me
Yeah, niggas done tried and niggas done died, too many believers around me
Yeah, I know my enemies meeting up, double-teaming on me
Now you know nobody tried that ever got pieces off me
Fucking these hoes 'til they be dying, don't catch a seizure on me
See, Ferg used to move the product in the old school 
Thumbing through paper from last year but it's not old news 
My psycho bitch, she got me shopping up at Whole Foods
Fucking these cougars like a young nigga s'posed to
I got your bitch up on the mattress while I'm flying OT 
I'm sick and tired of all the yapping, little nigga I'm your OG 
My diamonds shining like the ball that drop on New Year’s Eve 
And she countdown to the D, she be like "5-4-3"
Now drop down, you a freak 
Bend it over, touch your feet 
Shake that booty, I know it’s little but unique 
Back that thing up on my nigga from the D 
Okay, back out the hearse, they trapped out the church 
Niggas say my name, okay they asked for the worst 
Me and A$AP Ferg preaching back to back on the verse 
Hit-Boy on the beat so, bitch, you gotta go berserk 
Kill 'em off one-by-one, "Final Destination"
Fuck that medication, I'm sipping cold flu Echinacea 
You done fucked up, I stayed up, sleep deprivation  
They on the search nigga , know your worth nigga 
Tell the DJ bring it back, reimburse niggas 
Alhamdulillāh, my finance advisors been through hell
Oh well, pshh, we on fire 
Brung her back home more times than McGwire, higher 
Trap Lord packed out the risers
Big getting his bread, your pocket on carb diets
I just start up a riot at all the Hyatts
And make them hoes leave right before they cook the omelets 
Drop down , you a freak 
Bend it over , touch your feet 
Shake that booty, I know it's little but unique 
Back that thing up on my nigga from the D 
On God!
Now, drop down , you a freak 
Bend it over, woah , touch your feet 
Shake that booty, I know it's little but unique 
Then throw it back on my nigga from NYC 
Yeah , yeah 
Me and A$AP Ferg preaching back to back on the verse
Hit-Boy on the beat so, bitch, you gotta go berserk
