Ooh, okay
Yeah
ESKRY, turn that shit up, man 
]
Never gave a fuck about the opposition 
That's the reason why PE$O steady winnin' 
When I hop up out the bank, I be laughin', I be grinnin'
'Cause they pay me just to write a couple sentence
I'm with Token and we getting down to business 
I'm with Token smoking, plus the blunt is hittin'
Okay
You know where to find me but the sauce is steady hidden
They be askin' how my music always hittin' 
I got problems tell my goons to go get it 
Had to cut off my old bitch, she was simpin' 
How you talkin' but when I speak you ain't listen 
It's no wonder all these bitches going missing
I'm with Token we in Texas on a mission 
I might dip outta' brown for a minute 
Back in days I ain't had no pot to piss in 
Now I'm winning, now I'm winning, now I'm winning 
Got a five pack of Russian Cream's you know we be smokin'
I'mma split 'em we be rollin' up and missin', uh
Hear the bells they be ringing, it's yo' time of death, early dismissal 
You know PE$O in the back, I'm with Token and we spittin' that crack 
Why it sound like fuckin' murder? Boy, I'm ghost but Token finna' bring it back 
Fuck niggas and I'm never giving dap 
I'mma take yo' bitch, I'mma fuck her from the back 
Now that nigga Token woke and he ain't never took a nap
You get on a song with me and PE$O you gon' have to rap 
We might have to drop the E-P to let these niggas know what's up
'Cause I can hear 'em talking and the chopper had enough
Always got a plan when I'm lifting up the gun
Want to shoot a fuck nigga in his head, shoot his chest, he gon' duck, what the fuck?
You don't wanna' fuck with none of ours
I ain't never been a coward
Wet him up just like a shower 
And I'm gettin' higher than a tower
Smokin' sour, demon PE$O and we walkin' straight through Broward, like
All black nigga hoodie down
Said he had a problem but it's goodie now
It better stay that way before we have to come through nigga, Texas
ESKRY, turn that shit up-
Bitch
Yuh, bitch, bitch
