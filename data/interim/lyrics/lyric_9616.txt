3 AM, it's me again, wouldn't you know?
Things would have to end this way
I did my best the perfect guest knew when to go
Perfect you knew when to stay
Come on, tell me that you love me, dear
I've been feeling down some too
After all, it's time I made it clear
I've been waiting just for you
 Oh, you make me know, baby
 To show you that I care
 Got to have your number, baby
Dodododo....
Can't you see the people who stop and stare
Don't it make you wonder why?
I just happened to be standing there
Can't you see it in my eye?
 You got me acting like a fool, girl
 Stop making like a little school, girl
 Could be your lucky day, baby
Ooooh, it's hot
Ooohooo, it's hot, little girl
Ooooooo talking girl
 Oh, you make me know, baby
 To show you that I care
 Oh, I got down on my knees
Please, please, what can I say?
 Oooh, what can I do
 What can I say, baby?
