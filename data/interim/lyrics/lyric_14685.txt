Oh, yeah
Certain things you do really make me mad, I must confess
The way the streetlight sihlouettes your thighs inside your dress
Wild child in the streets, I think I seen you, but I really don't know
Who knows?
One million miles an hour, headed out to where the down boys go
Whoa, can we rewind to where we've been?
Ooh, I wish you'd take a look and see the shape I'm in
Where the down boys go, go!
Where the down boys go, go
Where the down boys go
Yeah, I wanna go where the down boys go, baby
You comb your hair, put on your shades, you look real cool
You're giving me the runaround, make me feel like a fool
You got a lot of nerve to call me cheap even though it's true
I don't care where we go tonight, take me along with you
Can we rewind to where we've been?
Ooh, I wish you'd take a look and see the shape I'm in
Where the down boys go, go!
Where the down boys go, go
Where the down boys go
Yeah, I wanna go where the down boys go, baby
Certain things you do really make me mad, I must confess
The way the streetlight sihlouettes your thighs inside your dress
Ooh, yeah
Whoa, can we rewind to where we've been?
Ooh, I wish you'd take a look and see the shape I'm in
Where the down boys go, go!
Where the down boys go, go
Where the down boys go
Yeah, I wanna go where the down boys go
Where the down boys go
Where the down boys go
Where the down boys go
Where they go
