"Psycho"
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho 
She lays down on the fresh lawn
She can make everything magical
But she tied one on big time
And it makes me wanna rewind
To back in the days when we were young
When everything was like a loaded gun
Ready to go off at any minute
And you know we're gonna win again  
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho 
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the paranoid Flake-oh
She lays down on the sidewalk
Never very analytical
She is something simply beautiful
Re-appear when you feel magical
To back in the days when we were young
When everything was like a loaded gun
Ready to go off at any minute
Yeah you know we're gonna win again
You're the one, you're the one who is the schizophrenic psycho 
Back in the days when we were young
When everything was like a loaded gun
Ready to go off at any minute
And you know we're gonna win again
You're the one, you're the one who is the schizophrenic psycho!
