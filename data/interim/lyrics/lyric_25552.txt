Please stop what you're doing, yeah, yeah, yeah
FBG FXX with me, it’s more number ones to tend to
I just went out to Morocco to do some recruitin' 
Fuck the government official, we plugged with Putin 
Got two twin sisters, yeah, they squirt, they be shootin' 
Don’t get the squirt-squirt on the shirt-shirt, be a fool 
They drank the wine bar, pop lot of bars, on the move 
I turn the bando to a jewelry store, what I do 
I turned a penthouse to a hotel 
I'm talkin' 54 hoes, had 'em snortin' fishscale 
Had to hit it off a fingernail, oh well, well, well 
Got some bad shit in Israel oh well, well, well 
I can't be tellin' no lies to you, let's jump on a boat 
Went to Lagos, Nigeria, travelin’ coast to coast
Had to treat her like the Coast Guard, had to save a broad 
We got the oil money comin’ in, smokin' out the vapor 
She talkin’ British when they can't understand, but I feel it 
African, gave my bitch a lil' hunnid bands, I can dig it 
Told me she gettin' back to the city, she comin’ to spend it 
Got two twin sisters, yeah, they squirt, they be shootin' 
Don't get the squirt-squirt on the shirt-shirt, be a fool 
I turn the bando to a jewelry store, what I do 
I feed them racks to you like a monster, that's food 
Somethin' like a sponsor, I'm a player, yeah, I tell the truth 
There's nothing I couldn't conquer, oh well, oh well, well 
Got the hottest ones comin' from Brazil, oh well, oh yeah
She see the better side of me, she threw us a party
I got six sons, I'm a don like they last name Marley 
Go lay in the sun, put your hair in a bun, ride it like a Harley 
I got that one-of-one spill, so they record me 
I just went out to Morocco to do some recruitin' 
Fuck the government official, we plugged with Putin 
Got two twin sisters, yeah, they squirt, they be shootin' 
Don't get the squirt-squirt on the shirt-shirt, be a fool 
When I drink codeine, I get in my feelings 
All I wanna see you in the same place as I'm in 
I like takin' ecstasy, it made me a millionaire 
It made me get emotional with the bitches 
I feed them racks to you like a monster, that's food 
Told me she's gettin' back to the city, she's comin' to spend it
