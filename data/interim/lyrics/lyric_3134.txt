Every time he battles here he's mad and upset with the reaction he gets
Like "My opponents only win, because they pander to them
It’s hegemony, nepotism, blasphemous", Greg
I couldn't agree more, and it's about to happen again
’Cause you were amazing in the past, but you'd be bang average middle tier
If Organik didn't interfere when you upped sticks and disappeared, you'd be shit at sports
How's a basketball team like this midget here?
'Cause he's a trailblazer from Portland, that hasn't won shit in years
Son I’ll leave him fuckin’ speechless
Trust me G, that's some achievement
’Cause he been gettin' cheeky wit' it
First, he says I'm undefeated
Now he’s on his podcast, sayin' I can't fuckin' see him?
He mean while on Earth, I'll leave him six feet underneath it
So we about to do that, and your crew can review that
Hi Avocado, hi everyone, even you 'Mac
Now future you can look back, see past you gettin' moved past
While present you's in limbo: there's a sport you'd be good at
Bitch I'm 5'11", stop telling people you're 5 foot 7
His girl's like "Yeah, that's four inches", now that's what you try and tell her
He makes his missus look hench, she's his back-stroker
Make Dolph Lundgren look like a crack smoker
Fuckin' glance over a Wham! shoulder, reverse parks her dad's motor
Knuckles like some damn boulders, hands like a scaffolder
Don't call him small what? Why, he's a small don
Feels like he's been a kid forever like Walcott
Guess that's why you 29, prayin' that your balls drop
Native American, guess they all caught smallpox
I'll keep that to eight bars I don't write that cheap
But he don't hold himself to the same standards the guy has me
Rolls his eyes at the short jokes, but diss my wife it seems
That the height of hypocrisy is 5 foot 3
On a bad day: 5 foot 1
Watch yourself: Shia Labeouf
People think his rhymes are tough, he force 'em like the Ryder Cup
Or choke 'em, have to Heimlich 'em, vers' Arsonal, recitin' stuff
With your phone out, gotta hit them angles so you nice for what?
That's a line from a Drake song, "I prefer Raekwon"
Illmac's a great laugh when you're seeing what the rave's on
DJ playing songs, "Bad And Boujee", Quavo pop
Wheel it up, take it off, Funky Friday, Dave is on
Fredo's gone, record skips, , before the bass'll drop
And Illmac toddles up like, "'Scuse me mister, do you have any Aesop Rock?
'None Shall Pass' is my favorite song"
Wanker
I hate these 'back in my day' ice age spitters
'Cause that envy in their eyes ain't Pai Mei's dinner
Shit I'll turn Mac to street art but mine may differ
'Bout to paint the town red like High Plains Drifter
Usin' them same old techniques that's age-old in battlin'
Like he'll compare a good thing, to a shit thing, and say that's the way Soul's a match for him
Like this the devil incarnate, to a day- old Samaritan
Nas when he made Ether, to Jay Hova practicin'
Ditch weed, my grade's potent, saints go amassing it
Take tokes and make popes at great smoke, the Vatican
So go 'head with that gay shit like it ain't so embarrassin'
But between me and you bruv, there ain't no comparison
He had a couple jokes, about a million rhymes
Some useless multis and, filler lines
Hi Avocado, he's gettin' bodied on Watch 'cause, that round was just killin' time
His name is Soul, Soul
We know how he got his name, it's obvious, how could we not know?
I mean you look at him, the first thought you get is, "He's got soul"
He is the physical embodiment, that's why I'm impressed wit' you
Think, Otis Redding, James Brown, Jed Mitchell
Dog, I'm surprised 9th Wonder ain't flipped you
I mean, come on you guys, he's a, walking soul sample, unauthorized
You know what I think when I hear a Coltrane solo? Some Scottish guy
Fuck off and die, I hit 'em up, get Soul rocked, this go pop, you can get the funk
Tell Soul, train for these lines, 'cause they don't stop till you get enough
I'm off the wall with it, this Scottish Charron
I smiled like a proud dad when you got in the zone, took Don't Flop as your own
Won the title, huh, chip off the old block I suppose
I mean, he earn respect, like Aretha, in his spot at the throne
I said at last, like Etta, when I watched it unfold
Fans traveled miles, like Davis, just to watch when you choke
I said "Let him cook," like Sam, then I promised you'd grow
I guess love is blind like Ray when you're the father of Soul
I know your mom, open palm
So what she raised you alone, I wasn't home and gone
Poppa was a rolling stone, practically wrote the song
Now little Marvin getting killed by pops, he don't even know what's going on
I take it back to the old era {record scratch}
GangStarr droppin' classics with no effort
R.I.P. Guru, this the other half of its known members
I had to, come to Premier to put a scratch on a Soul record
I said I'm back, I'm through talkin'
I win or you lose, the only two options
I got a leg up, flying knee, I Ong Bak him
1, 2 drop him, out cold, shoes on so I drew on him
2Pac, who shot him? Who want it?
I'm out my noodle, the soup ramen, who want it?
I'll swing in a round, who's moshing?
Terrorizing the Brits: shoe bombin'
I'm nuke launching, tool causing a blood bath
I'm the dude droppin' a boom box in
I blackout, fuse poppin', new phone, who's callin'?
Old Soul, new coffin
Tool pop, toe tag, close bag, school shoppin'
I put Soul on ice, the flow too solid
We need classics but, 3D glasses can't get ya' views poppin'
I know what you profit
Despite the fans that put us in the same group watchin'
I'm leavin' with twice the bands, huh, I'm crew hoppin'
Dude, stop it, to be brutally honest
You, fell off against Gem', I'm just droppin' a jewel on him
Your bars bring the white out, huh, dude awesome
Right on bro, I'll slide on Soul like I'm moonwalkin'
Even when you're good, your personality is so bland
It's like hangin' with a mannequin, throw a hat on he's a coat rack
You overcompensate when you battle and you know that
And even named yourself after exactly what you don't have
Soul!
A whole round of Soul flips, and to think I expected 'Mac to write cleverly
Funny how I seen your bars comin' from a mile away, and didn't see you till you were standing right next to me
Fans are like, "This'll be the most lyrical match ever
Can't wait to see whose syllables match better
Find out who has better writtens, they're mad clever"
Alright, let's find out, try not to piss in your pants
You just live in prison, then the system
Everything I ink consistent that you sit and listen
You just inconsistent, hit and missin', split him like an in-
Fuck this gay shit, I brought some different writtens
I mean punchlines chief, I'ma wig him with 'em like a snitchin' Simpson
On cam, you act like your squad's damn Oxfam
Like I got OnlyOne a smoke break battle: 'God's Plan'
Says he unruly, pop cans, he on dance hall tracks
By the end of the night, that red light on him like, like Roxanne
Think Kalashnikov, rinse him off, what straps do you got?
Try bring those curt angles in this match and get rocked
His jaw in his body, like Kurt Angle in his match with The Rock
That mean the former'll spin before the latter'll drop
I don't respect it, and I know that Greg's a total legend
But compare our recent performances and you know I'll dead him
But for his legacy, you feel you have to say this'll be close, forget it
It's pictures you take with the women you date, you force perspective
Doing this one, and she way way in the background hatin'
In flat soles, with her knees bent, threw her back out waitin'
Other guys make you insecure, that's outrageous
You think it's made up, even bitches rock 'Mac foundation
Sendin' emails to plenty of fish, the guy's stressin'
"When will you add 'prefer not to say' to the height section?
You do it for gender," bruv he hates Tinder
And judging from his raps you identify as way bigger
But tryna identify you, I had a full blown seizure
I have no idea who you are bruv, and you don't either
See I'm respected in the scene, because everything I preach, is the energy I keep, whenever that we meet
They're pretendin' that you're street, so they can tell you that you're heat
Bruv you sellin' them a dream, I'ma wrench 'em from their sleep
That's the level that I reach, every set up every scheme
I ain't anyone but me, what you get is what you see
How you ever gonna be, a credible MC
When they're suspending disbelief, every second that you speak?
It's not impressive, it's just weak
It's like tryna spend a Scotch tenner 'cause
You're legal, tender, but 'round here they pretend you're not
So only thing criminal 'bout anything he's done
Is he keeps getting away with pretending to be one
How could I break down a personality, that doesn't come from you
It's like a Human Centipede, the individuals and the fuckin' group
'Cause you're a bunch of people that you, stitch together in some disgusting loop
And you constantly kiss the arse of whoever they put in front of you
I said you put him in a room with Chase, he'll tell him why the beat's hard
You put him in a room with Deems, he's acting like a retard
You put him in a room with Geechi he's talkin' 'bout his weed charge
You put him in a hall of mirrors, shit, I don't know who we are
So call me what you want bruv, is what it is I'm happy 'bout it
I am who I am, you are who you hang around with
That's why you pull the wool and get the crowd buzzing
'Cause you know a little bit about a lot and everything about nothing
Your rhyme style isn't sick
You live the lifestyle of a chick
I am who I hang around with, and uh, right now I'm a bitch
I mean, I ain't gonna talk about the nightlife but he brought up MAC Foundation
I'm not gonna say nothing 'bout her eye line, or bring up no eyesight
But when I lighten up his cheek ooh, that'll be a highlight
Look, watch that tone Jed, 'cause, actin' vexed might get you rocked
Then your lads get slept like bassinets
I mean, these ain't random threats, I'm talkin' any means: Malcolm X
Think extreme grief after death, 'cause, I will hit you, I just haven't yet
First a line hits, then the hands are next
Jab connects, all you see's a body flyin' like, Jazzy Jeff off the mansion steps
Damn it Jed, you are mad awkward
Why he always look like he on a, lonely walk or some shit?
And dress like the default created character on Tony Hawk or some shit
You know what's crazy? What's crazy is it's perfect how that shit relates
'Cause if this was Skate, when you went to attribute strengths you maxed out one specific trait and left charisma blank
You know what rhymes with Jed Mitchell?
Sex symbol
Tries to read the future staring in a meth crystal
Most artists make ideas that are complex simple
You make simple ideas complex, it's a concept that they fed into
That's why I'm on the fence with you
Watchin', tryna, find a bar 'til I, wave an arm like I'm tryna find a cell signal
Jed Mitchell, this'll feel like a mech hit you
Get crippled, neck brittle, chest riddled with holes, when the wind blows it'll sound like a ref's whistle
Death gripped you
He said I can't hold a candle to him, 'til I show up at Jed's vigil
Steady shot, red Gimbal
Pallbearer, dead lift you
Magazine, spread issue
Killshot, Em' dissed you
Y'all think he nice, this someone you respect?
He battled Major then Warhurst and, what would you expect?
Well he choked in the first battle and then rebuttaled it the next
I mean, that's impressive
They even loved it when you said, "I did 28 rounds this year and kept it steppin'
Talk shit about my memory? You're the ones that's been forgettin'
'Cause I forgot one round, you forgot 27"
No, we remember
You know, when you did what you were supposed to
But, let's apply his logic elsewhere and see if it holds true
Air traffic controller
Pullin' an over nighter, forgets a plane's landing, another takes off they both collide, engulfed in fire, no survivors
Lifeless victims, twisted metal, fire engines, living hell for the eyes to witness
Then he shows up to trial, defends himself, wise decision
Fight the system, takes the stand says "I'm not gonna lie, I did it
Talk shit about my memory, it's really you guys forgetting
'Cause I forgot one plane, you forgot-" "Life in prison"
He got caught cheating, told his wife she trippin'
Said "Never mind, I admit it
You caught me this time, but what about all the, times you didn't?"
You are all build-up, no bars, shit you're the setup GOAT
Blanked out a whole round and went and wrote 'til his pencil broke
He's a McGregor fan, perfect
When the pressure's close, protect your neck and throat
'Cause I'll make you notorious for tryna defend a choke
Shit, swing on me, you gettin' cast in the heavens
I'll have Soul, seeing stars, like astral projection
His agent, should ask Caustic, for management lessons
'Cause he had you bookin' out a venue in a matter of seconds
C'mon, even when he's good, your personality is so bland
Up here yelling like you passionate, the fact is that you don't rap
You overcompensate, when you battle and you know that
And even named yourself after exactly what you don't have
Soul!
He's saying I need to bounce back from Gem' like I was wack just before this
Like Checkpoint 3 after getting battered by Caustic
And I don't share that assessment, I thought I smashed it but for this
A couple people said they wanna hear that Raptor performance
You wanna hear that Raptor shit?
That 'no Geneva policies'
That 'whole demeanor bothers me'
That 'joker, fiend, a mockery'
That 'hopeless mediocrity with-' 
So I wrote a little remix that I know you people wanna see
I'm a different sort of legendary, with a modern pedigree
You trippin' on an era we transitioned from successfully
Think he was the best MC, in a form that's dead now he
A, withered corpse a relic we just, digged up from the cemetery
Missin' your identity, drifted from it steadily
Clingin' for it desperately to this distorted entity, a bitter source of enmity
A twisted sort of effigy, a distant thought, a memory just livin' off his legacy
So you must be twisted off the Hennessy, you thought this would be close at all
Steal on him he's splittin' I take the money like Golden Balls
You always reference books, and get the title and who wrote it wrong
Actin' like a know-it-all, 'bout shit that you don't know at all
Like when the towers fell, how did the steel beams melt in 'em
I ain't fuckin' with Alexa, it's gettin' real Orwellian
You wish, this is no longer a scene you're welcome in
And if this was 1984, your style would still be relevant
See that's a old style that you do and they go wild when you use it in '09
But it's losin' it's old shine, now it's useless it won't fly
He just cruisin' this whole time being reduced in a gold mine that was boomin' to bone-dry and in ruins
Now you scrapin' out the barrel but, won't find the solution
And don't try 'cause his hubris is so bright it's consumed him
I'm cosigning the blueprint but don't like how you use it
To coast right through the movement with no sign of improvement
I'm out here snappin' like tourists in Harlem that's on the A train
Snappin' like DJ Khaled when his weight change
Snappin' like a Great Dane, snappin' like a Beyblade
Snappin' like SJWs in a safe space
Grew up called 'Jedi', the prophecy ain't dead and gone
It's young Skywalker, X-wing, upper echelon
You're young Skywalker 'cause you went to school with a helmet on
In the special room with the special kids, stretch him out, get my special on
Bars make the IRA redesign the letter bomb
Been tryin' to get it on, Dave Grohl with the Everlong
Gettin' drawn out from who I mail 'em from
This'll go left, the young fool back out me like Sessegnon
So watch yourself and watch your step
Less time watched together watchin' me with all your friends
Off your head, on the net, now act like I'm not the best
Now act like I'm not a threat
Tell 'em all you're not impressed, you think that we've forgotten then?
Oh you check the common threads what's been said, the compliments
I've gone all red, what blush, aw shucks, stop it Greg
As soon as this battle got dropped he got snider, sneak dissin'
Passive aggressive, he got hyper
Since he not top billin' on King Of The Dot fliers
Throwin' shade should lose that chain off his neck, like Scott Steiner
And saying I bit your Bigg K round in my title match too
Bro, what parts are the same, please describe me a few
Yours is a dream sequence, mine's the afterlife of the dude
Yours's about his anxiety, mine's about him tryna be cool
Yours is metaphor, mine's allegory, he's lyin' to you
So what we down to here then Greg, that the writin' is good?
Well fuck it, let's say me bitin' is entirely true
Congrats, the worst round of my career was inspired by you
Look, I never brought up the third, you bitin' my third round
But that was clever rapping, but question
How can you bite me when the actual event never happened?
Yo, plus you know that was some sick verses, I really like the wordage
Plus it happened in a round where sound doesn't exist: perfect, none of us heard it
Dog, you're just throwin' together a million multis, y'all think when he writes things
He be like "Hmmm, initiate multisyllabic rhyme scheme"
Loosen up, I mean I don't really- I'll put you in a hole that I dug up in the ground
I ain't fuckin' wit' this clown
He brought up Golden Ball 'cause it's no mystery I'm doin' numbers in this round
Got me openin' whisky to my moment of victory
Better knuckle up, you toe to toe with a grizzly
I pull a shank out, get to pokin' his kidneys
When I hold it against him don't, hold it against me
He gotta live in my shadow, winter solstice can miss me
Just cause son is obscure don't mean Soul'll eclipse me
You're not a threat, this so called Scottish vet scrawny body probably a buck twenty sopping wet
If I put hands on him, his cause of death would be, pocket check
Ironic, I'm at your wake talkin' 'bout what got you slept
Watch your step, get ya' body Dhalsim stretched, mop the floor with him, swab the deck
Shotty this ya' greatest? Well I'm not impressed
But I want the best, bring me ya' Soul then I'ma, leave with a GOAT's head like Baphomet
Dog I give a fuck how they rate you ho
Basic flow, in the killing fields that same approach an Achilles' heel, ankle broke
Will it heel? Pray it don't
Bitch I will, cave ya' skull
Don't, make me go, Bobby Flay on Soul
The, blade'll go in, takin' bones out
Bake him slow like fillet of sole
Blade is so big it'll leave his DNA exposed
That mean the machete sprayin' blood everywhere like a Danny Trejo role, play your role
I'm sayin' I'm Satan, yo Shotty, the venue's a little vacant bro
If you want to sell out, you just gotta trade ya' Soul
To hell wit' him
It's cool, I heard his team Shark City, I'm like the Sharks bit who?
I'll slaughter your whole team and make shark fin stew
I mean, I ain't wit' the whoopty whoop
He's just a baby Shark, doop doop dodoop dodoop
I'll knock him off the pedestal they placin' him on
He the biggest in Shark City, what you supposed to be? Megla Da Don
Speaking of, I heard you battled on URL, is it true?
Well, how did that go? Did you win? Did you lose?
I heard someone got bodied, was it him? Was it you?
Man, that shit was horrible Soul
Up there rantin' about beatin' Tony D like that's important to know
You tried to spit your little bars, they was bored with you though
Then four in got stopped like border patrol
The angle was not dope
And don't blame the crowd or act too artistic for the stage that you got smoked
Fuck- excuse my French, he think he Monet but he not close
Just made a terrible impression but maybe I'm paintin' with broad strokes
That shit was great to witness
Exposed his little racist image
I mean I knew he lost when Beasley listed one of his strengths as 'Privilege'
Shit, we in the UK but you ain't safe from gun violence
Amazing, you battle a Gemin1 but he still made it one sided
I mean he went from "I'm 'bout to body a lyricist" to "how they not take me serious?"
The crowd was probably delirious
They had Soul, beside himself, like a out of body experience
Follow me, all this work, tryin' to be they best rapper
Beat Cee Major then Raptor, couldn't even be main event after
Still not the Scottish GOAT, it must be a respect factor
Speaking of BA, they both have Scotland to rep
Both malnourished fiends - is it that hard is it, crack rock, is it meth?
I mean you wanna be him so bad, the last thought in my head
I thought URL taught you, you can't copy respect
Bodied on SMACK, outshined in huge ways
Cooked in Atlanta, outright got souffled
Sucked in Canada, that outlines his crusades
Think Brexit: money ain't worth shit outside the UK
And you wanna know why, you know why?
'Cause even when you're good, your personality is so bland
And that ain't just gonna change with all the multis you scratchin' in your notepad
You overcompensate, when you battle and you know that
And even named yourself after exactly what you don't have
A dick
