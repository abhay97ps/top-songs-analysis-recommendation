30, you a motherfucking fool, nigga
I was twenty-two when I first dropped 
Most influential dude when I first dropped 
The bando named the new spot 
Where them boys from? They ain't from the Hot 
Hotlanta , dirty mango Fanta 
Swept the game like I'm Huncho MC Hammer 
Write my name 'cross the hall of fame banner 
Hit the lights, diamonds flash like a camera 
First met her in some open-toed sandals 
Now-now her attitude like a candle 
That bag make you wanna up your standards 
Way too fat but she ain't got no manners
Lil' bitch , hop on the stick, uh 
Grant your wish, uh , came for licks, uh 
We came to hit, uh , who that bitch? uh 
Poppin' shit, uh , let it rip, uh 
I said this the biggest alley oop 
I'm gon' air it out if I shoot 
It's only one mic in the booth 
Guess it's my night to tell the truth 
Who got the biggest bag in the room? 
Who got the biggest bag in the room? 
Who got the biggest bag in the room? 
Who got the biggest bag in the room? 
I lead the way , follow the wave 
I'm not Beyonc√© , it's bigger than Jay 
All in the studio cookin' up beats , but I'm not Ye 
Blessin' the whole industry but they not tryna pay 
I wanted like ten mill' , that was like last year 
They lookin' like, "Oh, for real?" , wait 'til this year 
Make the bank clear , grandma ain't here 
Fuck your fake tears  Huncho made his 
And I'm humble still 
Niggas been handlin' business and dough before the deal
You livin' a lie, I only provide the real 
Niggas been drownin' they kidneys before they got rid of the seal 
Thinkin' 'bout gettin' a big Bentley and callin' it Shaquille O'Neal 
Thinkin' about wrappin' a Benz yellow, Kill Bill 
Thinkin' that you poppin' but it's Advil 
Think your stage hoppin'? It's a standstill 
Yeah, I go by the name of Huncho
Quavo Huncho 
The hitman, woah
Huncho, let's go
Skrrt, skrrt-skrrt
