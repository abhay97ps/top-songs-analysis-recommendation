Momma house was filled up with bags of Hercules 
Soon as I finished pissin', I put the seat down
Or my momma'd be cussin' my damn ass out
Only child, no siblings, no besties
I couldn't do nothin' right like a lefty 
Bought my momma's first house with the juug money 
Bought my momma's second house with the club money 
Me and momma used to trap out the same house 
Used to eat and go to sleep on the same couch 
Me and momma got busted at the same time 
Went to court and told judge the damn same lies 
I can tell momma proud of her only son
2 Chainz, I have always worn more than one

Got some YGs from the gang, they'll do you for a check
And you know I'm gang gang 'cause that's the only thing I rep
Ayy, momma

Momma taught me how to get that bankroll 
Yeah, vault up in my loft in case the bank closed 
Momma ain't have it all, we wore the same clothes 
I kicked the door, I kicked the door, I risked it all for dough 
I found that .44, it turned me to an animal 
Got that wide load, niggas wasn't even compatible 
Choppa firin', it soundin' just like a rattler
.223 caliber, you ain't in my caliber 
Momma told me pray 'cause they'll keep givin' me these bucks 
Sit on that G6, I'm flyin' high, Aladdin on the rug 
I put Goyard on my momma 
Every nigga, not cha partner, son, when you come up 
All them bitches in your face, son, they are piranhas
Stay up out the way, but beat him if he run up
