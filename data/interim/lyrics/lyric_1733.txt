I had some trouble with my baby
So I had my fortune read
I had some trouble with my baby
And this is what the gypsy said
The gypsy cried, she cried
Gypsy, oh tell me, what is in your crystal ball
Gypsy, oh tell me, will my tears fall
She cried, she cried and said
Watch your step, oooh she'll hurt you yet
Oh no no no no no no no
Watch your step, oooh she'll hurt you yet
Oh no no no no no no no
Gypsy, oh tell me, does she want to marry me
Gypsy, oh tell me, when the wedding's gonna be
She cried, she cried
Listen to what the gypsy said
Oh no no no no no no no
Listen to what the gypsy said
Oh no no no no no no no
Gypsy, say it isn't true
Watch out, oooh she doesn't love you
Watch out, oooh she doesn't love you
Gypsy, say it isn't true
