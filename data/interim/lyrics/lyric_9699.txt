Sometimes
I stop and wonder
Why can't I let myself enjoy
The space I'm in
And all the wonderful places I've been
My arms around the future
And I can think about the past
My aspirations always exceed
My grasp
You got to reach
A little bit higher
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey
Whoa whoa
You've got to grow
Sometimes
Know that you've got to reach
A little bit higher 
To get a hold on all that you desire
Stretch your soul
And you'll never grow old
Mmm no no no
When the habits of a lifetime
Become a painful cage
You want to break out
But you don't know how to change
No no
Well you may have a vision
Or you may have a friend
Who will come to you 
And say these same words again 
You got to reach
A little bit higher
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey 
Whoa whoa 
You've got to grow
Sometimes I sit myself down and I say
You got to reach 
A little bit higher 
To get a hold on all that you desire
Stretch your soul 
And you'll never grow old
Never never never grow old
You've got to reach 
A little bit higher 
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey 
Whoa whoa 
You've got to grow
Gonna find out
You've got to reach 
A little bit higher 
To get a hold on all that you desire 
Stretch your soul
And you'll never grow old 
You've got to reach 
A little bit higher 
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey 
Whoa whoa 
You've got to grow 
You've got to reach 
A little bit higher
To get a hold on all that you desire
