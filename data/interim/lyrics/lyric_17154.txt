Do you wanna float on? Yeah
Do you wanna float on? Yeah
Float on, float on, float on your love
Float on, float on, float on your love
I call my baby's name
She gives me everything
She takes me higher and higher
She plays with my desire
She knows my pleasures zone
And works it all night long
Her love is slow and slick
Told me don't come too quick
Every day I pray our love
Floats on and on and on
Hear me calling out to you, girl
It's all that I can do, girl
Float on, float on, float on, float on
 Float on your love
Float on, float on
 Float on your love
I know what's on his mind
He wants it all the time
He's always at my door
Keeps asking me for more
Says he can't get enough
Sometimes he likes it rough
You know I'm gonna treat him right
Gonna do it day and night
Every day I pray our love
Floats on and on and on
Hear me calling out to you, boy
That's all that I can do, boy
Float on, float on, float on, float on
 Float on your love
Float on, float on
 Float on your love
Float on, float on
 Float on your love
 Float on, float on
 Float on your love
Do you wanna float on? Yeah
Do you wanna float on? Yeah
Float on, float on, float on your love
Float on, float on
 float on your love
 Float on, float on
 Float on your love
 Float on, float on
 Float on your love
