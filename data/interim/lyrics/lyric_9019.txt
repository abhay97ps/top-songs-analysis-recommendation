I'm not a bad person
I don't drink, and I don't kill
I got no evil habits, and I
Probably never will
I don't sing like Elvis Presley
I can't dance like Fred Astaire
But there's one thing in my favor
I'm a millionaire!
And I got more money
Then a horse has hairs
Cause my rich old uncle died
And answered all my prayers!
Having all this money
Is going to bring me down
If you ain't with me honey
To help me spread it around!
I could get myself a nose job
I could diet for a year
But I'll never be Robert Redford
Cause I'm much to fond of beer
Please don't misunderstand me
It's not love I'm trying to buy
It's just I got all this here money
And I'm a pretty ordinary guy
And I got more money
Then a horse has hairs
Cause my rich old uncle died
And answered all my prayers!
Having all this money
Is going to bring me down
If you ain't with me honey
To help me spread it around!
I don't mind if you love me for my money
If you love me for whatever else I got
But 'cept for all this stuff
I'm a lonely Fort Knox
I don't guess I'm doing all that hot
And I got more money
Then a horse has hairs
Cause my rich old uncle died
And answered all my prayers!
Having all this money
Is going to bring me down
If you ain't with me honey
To help me spread it around!
Money, money, money, money
