I believe 
There's something on your mind
Tell me, tell me
Just lay it on the line
I believe 
There's something on your mind
Tell me, tell me
Girl, stop wasting time
You've been acting kinda strange on me lately
Is there something on your mind?
I seem to get the feeling every time I'm near ya
That I'm running out of time
How can you walk away and leave me hanging?
Just leave me hanging on
I know there's something going on
You just can't hide it
Now tell me that I'm wrong
Girl, you can see what's on your mind
We can talk it over
There is no need for you to hide
What you feel inside your heart
Tell me
Tell me girl
Girl, sure wish you would state the situation
What you're taking me through
But baby, I can't imagine what I'd do without you, girl
Let me know
If someone else has taken my place inside your heart
Don't disappear on me without a trace
Don't you know?
Don't you know I believe?
That something's on your mind
Tell me tell me
Just lay it on the line
I believe
That something's on your mind
You better
Love is a feeling that we share
We belong together now
I can understand
How you and me can give up on love
Whoa girl, you can say what's on your mind
We can talk it over
There's no need for you to hide
What you feel inside your heart
I know, I know
Sooner or later
I know that something's on your mind
I got the strange feeling
That something's on your mind
Sooner or later
Something
Something's on your mind
Won't you tell me?
Won't you tell me what it is?
Won't you tell me?
I know, I know
Sooner or later
