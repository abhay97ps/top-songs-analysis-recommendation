Now that I have captured your attention
I wanna steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. TSA, I'm ready for inspection
Sh-sh-show me how you make a first impression
Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow?
Break it down and drop it low, low
'Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights
'Til you can't let me go
I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
If you want me, I'm accepting applications
So long as we can keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Breathe me in, breathe me out
So amazing
Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow?
Break it down and drop it low, low
Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights
'Til you can't let me go
I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
The music's got me going
No stopping 'til the morning
You know I'm ready for it, for it, for it, yeah
The music's got me going
No stopping 'til the morning
You know I'm ready for it, for it, for it, yeah
It's The Cataracs
I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
How do I do it?
It's The Cataracs
