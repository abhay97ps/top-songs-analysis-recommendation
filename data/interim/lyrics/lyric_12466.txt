Maybe this day will be the happy day, when all my hopes will turn out right
Maybe this girl will be the lucky girl who'll come back with me tonight, tonight, tonight
Maybe this girl will be the lucky girl, or it will end in tears
Maybe she'll take me home, or make me run. She was bound to win
She said "oh", "Oh" ,"Oh" Maybe this girl will dance with me "Oh"
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight
May be this day will be the happy day, when all my hopes will turn out right
Maybe this girl will be the lucky girl who'll come back with me tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight a lucky star will shine
Tonight
Over the garden wall, she'll say "Let's go to bed"
"oh", "Oh" ,"Oh" Maybe this girl will dance with me "Oh" "oh" "Oh"
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight
Maybe this girl will dance with me
Maybe this girl will...
