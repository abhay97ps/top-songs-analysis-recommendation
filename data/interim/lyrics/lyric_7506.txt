What is the matter
Now what did you do
Did you go and lose her
Like the others too
Let me tell you something
Here's the way it goes
There's a way to treat em
Everybody knows
Hold her tight
Hold her like a baby
Make her feel
Make her feel real good
Give a chance
Give her time to love you
Don't let go 
If you know 
No one else can touch her
Everybody tells you
She's the one for you
So if I was you, boy
Here's what I'd do
Hold her tight
Hold her like a baby
Make her feel
Make her feel real good
Give a chance
Give her time to love you
Don't let go 
If you know 
No one else can touch her
Hold her tight
Hold her like a baby
Make her feel
Make her feel real good
Give a chance
Give her time to love you
Hold her tight
Hold her like a baby
Make her feel
Make her feel real good
Give a chance
Give her time to love you
