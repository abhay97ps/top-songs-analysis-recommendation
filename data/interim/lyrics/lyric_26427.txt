Yeah
One of the realest shit I ever 
Shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, you know how I'm kickin' it
Rockstar chain all the way to the floor, dawg
Ain't tryna be cool with no rap nigga, I'm fuckin' they ho, dawg
Took two Addys, then counted an M and damn near dozed off
I'm in the stars drivin' myself, I feel like autopilot
Designer Goyard bucket, I'm my own stylist
I done made it out the streets, my brothers still wildin'
Had to go Draco, Draco, Draco, all I could do about it
Soon as it come my way, I can't do nothin' but see about it
I'ma get me a B up out it, started with a milli'
Made it out the trenches, I can't ever plead guilty
Crushed her heart when she found out I crushed her friend
Played it smart 'cause either way, I gotta win
I wear my heart on my sleeve, they ain't real as me
We could've kept it way more cordial, but it's chemistry
You kept me over through the night and boost my energy
I'm thankin' you, I'm thankin' me for curiosity
Coolest thing to do is to be cool with a nigga and fuckin' on his bitch
I know niggas'd do it to me so I'm always gon' send that hit
She said she true and she said she loyal, that's how they come to me
I know what really turn you on and I'ma keep our secret
Rockstar chain all the way to the floor, dawg
Ain't tryna be cool with no rap nigga, I'm fuckin' they ho, dawg
Took two Addys, then counted an M and damn near dozed off
I'm in the stars drivin' myself, I feel like autopilot
Designer Goyard bucket, I'm my own stylist
I done made it out the streets, my brothers still wildin'
Had to go Draco, Draco, Draco, all I could do about it
Soon as it come my way, I can't do nothin' but see about it
Started with a million dollars, go 'head and get me billi'
I'm from the trenches, so the clip least hold a fifty
Crushed ice, Cartier frames, or Chrome Hearts
Niggas ain't solid as they claim, so I play it smart
I'm changin' weather, I'm thinkin' better, I'm peepin' the energy
I left my heart in the streets, so ain't no sympathy
If you ain't with me, you against me, you the enemy
Playin' my cards, sittin' in the stars, this the life I lead
Coolest thing you could do is squash the beef and still send a hit
I know niggas'd do it to me, so I ain't gon' never stop a blitz
She say it's loyalty, no betrayal when it come to me
I know what really turn you on and I'ma keep a secret
Rockstar chain all the way to the floor, dawg
Ain't tryna be cool with no rap nigga, I'm fuckin' they ho, dawg
