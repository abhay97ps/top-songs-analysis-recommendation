Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...
I was young
When I met you
You were my first love
Love was new, oh, whoa
But then you went away
And broke my little heart
I learned to live with pain
While we were apart
Time
Brought us back together again
We became lovers
We became friends
I just wanna thank you
For the love you gave
I just wanna thank you
For the love we made
I just wanna thank you
Just thank you
'Cause even though we're not together
You know that I'll love you forevermore
I look back
On those days
We've gone our
Separate ways
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I still think thoughts of you
A love that we once shared
Will always shine through
Time
Taught us how to let our grow
How it all happened
I still don't know
Whoa... oh... oh
Time
Brought us back together again
We became lovers
We became friends
I just wanna thank you
For the love you gave
I just wanna thank you
For the love we made
I just wanna thank you
Just thank you
Thanks a million, boy
Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh
I just wanna thank you
For the love you gave
I just wanna thank you
For the love we made
Thank you
Just thank you
Thank you, boy
Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh
I just wanna thank you
For the love you gave
I just wanna thank you
For the love we made
I just wanna thank you
Just thank you
'Cause even though we're not together
You know that I'll love you forevermore, whoa
