Why be a big man
You know that you're blue
You know that it's true
Tell her
Tell her
Ahh, ahh, ooh
Tell her for me
I'm tired of crying
You love her
You know you still do
Tell her for me
I'm through feeling blue
Then why do you think of her
The whole night and day through?
Yes, you can say that I'll never cry again
Never beg for another chance
You can say that
I'll never cry again
For an off and on romance
Oh, tell her for me
I'm glad it's over
You don't mean a word that you say
Thank her for dreams that never came true
Now say what you really feel
Why suffer this way
And if she should say
That it's so wrong to part
She'd like to start anew
Please tell her to call
I may just feel that way too
And if she should say
That it's so wrong to part
She'd like to start anew
Please tell her to call
I may just feel that way too
Tell her you love her
Tell her you love her
You know that it's true
You know you still do
