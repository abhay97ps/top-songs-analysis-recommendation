You feel just like a woman should
The night will soon be dawn
You make me feel just like a man should
What were doin just can't be wrong
It burns me like a fire
Sweet pain dont let me go
Ah, you take me so much higher
Than Ive ever been before
Baby, babe, I want you, oh, my babe, ooh;
Take me now, Got to have your love right now
Fire, baby, Im on fire
Oh, you are the good times that I know;
Higher, baby, take me higher
And better times Ill never know
The sun will soon be shinin
Won't shine on me alone
Cause I have you here, my darlin
To call my very own
Lord knows I must be dreamin
Ah, nothing feels this good
Youve given me a feelin
Like no other woman could
Baby, babe, I want you, oh, my babe, ooh;
Take me now, Got to have your love right now
Fire, baby, Im on fire
Oh, you are the good times that I know;
Higher, baby, take me higher
And better times Ill never know
Baby, babe, oh, baby, babe
