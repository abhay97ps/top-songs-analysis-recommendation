One two three
Oh, that's how element'ry
It's gonna be
Come on let's fall in love
It's easy 
Like takin' candy  from a baby
A-B-C 
Fallin' in love with you
Was easy for me 
And you can do it too
It's easy 
Like takin' candy  from a baby
Baby, there's nothin' hard about love
Basicly, it's as easy as pie
The hard part is livin' without love
Without your love, baby, I would die
It's easy 
Like takin' candy  from a baby
One and one are two 
I know you love me and oh,oh
How I love you 
Don't try to fight it
'Cause it's easy 
Like takin' candy  from a baby
One two three 
Oh, that's how element'ry
It's gonna be 
Come on let's fall in love
It's easy
