There's a blizard coming on, how I'm wishing I was home
For my pony's lame, and he can hardly stand
Listen to that norther sigh, if we don't get home we'll die
But, it's only seven miles to Mary Ann's
It's only seven miles to Mary Ann's
You can bet we're on her mind, for it's nearly supertime
And I'll bet there's hot bisquets in the pan
Lord, my hands feel like there froze
And there's a numbness in my toes
But, it's only five more miles to Mary Ann's
It's only five more miles to Mary Ann's
That wind's howling and it seems
Mighty like a woman's scream
And we'd best be moving faster if we can
Dan just think about that barn
With the hay so soft and warm
For it's only more miles to Mary Ann's
It's only three more miles to Mary Ann's
Dan get up you ornery cuss, or you'll be the death of us
I'm so weary, but I'll help you if I can
Alright Dan, perhaps it's best, if we stop a while and rest
For it's still a hundred yards to Mary Ann's
It's still a hundred yards to Mary Ann's
Late that night the storm was gone
They found him there at dawn
He'd-a-made it but he just couldn't leave old Dan
Yes, they found him there on the plains
Hands froze to the reigns
He was just a hundred yards form Mary Ann's
He was just a hundred yards from Mary Ann's...
