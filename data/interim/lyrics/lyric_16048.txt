Nicky's in the corner
With a black coat on
Running from a bad home
With some cat inside
Now where did you find her
Among the neon lights
That haunt the streets outside
She said, stay with me
Beautiful girl 
Beautiful girl 
She wanna go home
From doorway to doorway
Street corner to corner
With the neon ghosts in the city
And she says
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
She's so scared
So very frightened
Anything could happen
Right here tonight
Beautiful girl 
Beautiful girl 
She wanna go home
Stay with me 
Stay with me 
Stay with me 
Stay with me
