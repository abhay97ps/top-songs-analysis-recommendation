I'm kicking my heel together
Free again
I feel like me again
I know without a doubt I'm in love, love, love
And I don't have to make believe
Or feed a guilty conscience
Love set me free
And it do feel good
I just went through this painful thing
Of questions without answers
Kept coming back with nothing for the longest time
My heart kept racing with my conscience
And claiming all my daydreames
Wait out in front of my mind
And that awful gnawing feeling
Like you're gonna die from hunger
You don't find out where you're going
And how to get there
But now it's worth all that confusion
'Cause I found me an answer
And I know love is alive again within me
I'm kickin' my heel together...
I've finally figured out
How yesterdays fit into tomorrows
And I've learned that little doubts
Are just unfinished dreams
And I guess I'll keep on learning the same lessons all over
And nothing is as bad as it seems
And I've just got to accept the fact
That I have to accept the fact
That love goes through changes just like we do
And an occasional distraction a little quiet a little action
And a whole lot of patience will make it grow
I'm kickin' my heel together...
I'm kickin' my heel together...
I'm kickin' my heel together...
