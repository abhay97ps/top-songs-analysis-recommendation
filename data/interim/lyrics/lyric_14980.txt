Blow a kiss from your hand
I'll catch it 'fore it hits the ground
Cry a little for our fears baby baby
I'm so scared there's something wrong
I hid you in the corner of my empty room
Never really cared 'til now
Not standin' in the corner for me anymore
You've done your time
Pass your sentence and I'll pass mine
And when my time is through
Can I still come home to you
Anytime anytime you want me
Anytime anytime you're lonely
You just have to call, 'cos you know I'll be there
Anytime anytime you need me
Anytime anytime maybe you're dreamin'
Wakin' up all alone your heart is screamin'
I know I caused you so much pain
I promise that I'll never hurt you again
Even though the scars remain
With a little time I know we can win
Can't stop this fire
Lost control over my desire
Still, it burns for you
Like it always used to do
Anytime anytime you want me
Anytime anytime you're lonely
You just have to call, 'cos you know I'll be there
Anytime anytime you need me
Anytime anytime maybe you're dreamin'
Wakin' up all alone your heart is screamin'
And after the war is over
And all the fighting's through
Can I make my peace with you
I wanna come home to you
Anytime anytime you want me
Anytime anytime you're lonely
You just have to call, 'cos I'm always there, yeah
Anytime anytime you need me
Anytime anytime maybe you're dreamin'
Wakin' up all alone your heart is screamin'
Anytime, anytime anytime you want me
Anytime, anytime ooh so lonely
So lonely but you know I care, yeah
Anytime, anytime do you need me
Anytime, anytime oh are you dreaming
Wakin' up all alone your heart is screamin'
