Open your hand, I squeeze it tight
I'm putting my trust in you
If you take your time and love me right
There ain't nothing that i won't do
Take me higher and higher
Baby. let's have a ball
Take me higher and higher
Don't let me fall
Don't drop my love
Don't drop my love
Baby, handle me with care
Don't drop my love
Don't drop my love
I'll follow you anywhere
(Anywhere you want now, baby
Heaven knows you're good for me
So I'm letting myself go
In your arms is where i wanna be
Come on and hold me close
Don't you drop
Don't drop my love
Baby, baby don't drop it
Baby, baby now don't drop it
Now don't you drop
Now don't you drop
