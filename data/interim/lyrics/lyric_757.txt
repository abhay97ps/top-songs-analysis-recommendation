I'm a fool to care when you treat me this way
I know I love you but what can I do
I'm a fool to care
I'm a fool to cry when you tell me goodbye
You left me so blue when you were untrue
I'm a fool to care
I know I should laugh and call it a day
But I know I would cry if you went away
I'm a fool to care when you don't care for me
So why should I pretend I'd lose in the end
I'm a fool to care
I know I should laugh and call it a day
But I know I would cry if you went away
I'm a fool to care when you don't care for me
So why should I pretend I'd lose in the end
I'm a fool to care
