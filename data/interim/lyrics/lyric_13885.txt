All I know is the way I feel, oh, yeah
Anything that makes me feel so good just got to be
I can't help myself, oh, no, it's the way I feel, oh, yeah
It's scarin' me to death to think what you could do to me
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
You're the one that I've been searching for
You were so hard to find
When you're near I need nothing more
You're so deep inside my heart
My soul and my mind, ooh, yeah
Lost in space is the way I feel, oh, yeah
You got me sailin' way beyond all my wildest dreams
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
When we're lyin' here soft and warm
All the world is turnin' slow
Nothin' ever came so easy
Wonder just how far, how long
And where it will go, ooh-ooh-ooh...
All I know is the way I feel, oh, yeah
Nothin' in my life ever was so real, oh, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
I know I said it a million times
And it always will be true
All I know is the way I feel
All I need to do
Is to keep on lovin' you, ooh, yeah
All I know is the way I feel, oh, yeah
Nothin' in my life ever was so real, oh, yeah
All I know, all I know is the way I feel, oh-oh...
Nothing in my life, nothing in my life
Never was so real, oh-oh...
Beyond my wildest dreams, to extremes
You turn me on, oh, Lord, whoo, baby
You don't know how much I love you
And I want you, I need you
I got to have you, ooh-ooh-ooh...
