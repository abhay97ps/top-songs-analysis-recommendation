Ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Fee-fi-fo-fum
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
I said nowhere to run
We've gotta make the stand against the devil's gun
Fee-fi-fo-fum
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
Nowhere to run
We've gotta make the stand against the devil's gun
Better make a move now 
You know there ain't no time to lose now
Oh, well, his finger's on the trigger, he's waiting to deliver
Can we ever figure out a way to make the people shout?
Fee-fi-fo-fum
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
Nowhere to run
We've gotta make the stand against the devil's gun
Find a new direction 
Another resurrection, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Now don't wait, hesitate, or it's gonna be too late
 Got to jump out of the fire
He's watching us burn, he's watching us burn
One day we'll learn, one day we'll learn
Fee-fi-fo-fum
Fee-fi-fo-fum
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
Nowhere to run
We've gotta make the stand against the devil's gun
Find a new direction 
Another resurrection, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Now don't wait, hesitate, or it's gonna be too late
 Got to jump out of the fire
He's watching us burn, he's watching us burn
One day we will learn, one day we'll learn
Fee-fi-fo-fum
Fee-fi-fo-fum
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
Nowhere to run
We've gotta make the stand against the devil's gun
Fee-fi-fo-fum 
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
Nowhere to run
We've gotta make the stand against the devil's gun
Fee-fi-fo-fum 
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
Nowhere to run
