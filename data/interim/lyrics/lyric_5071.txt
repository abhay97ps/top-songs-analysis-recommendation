But I'd like to get to know you 
But I'd like to get to know you 
But I'd like to get to know you
Finally I've found
Searching all around
Just was not the answer
One I thought was true
Looked a bit like you
I figured I'd might chance her
But I'd like to get to know you 
But I'd like to get to know you 
But I'd like to get to know you
Hardly need to say
She went on her way
Said it was all over
Well it's been some time
And I guess that I'm just meant to be a
Rover
But I'd like to get to know you 
Yes I'd like to get to know you 
Well I can't promise that I'll spend a day with you
I can't promise that I'll find a way with you
I can't promise
No, I can't promise that I'll love you
But I'd like to get to know you 
Yes I'd like to get to know you 
I'd like to get to know you, know you, know
I'd like to get to know you, know you, know
I'd like to get to know you, know you, know
Yes I'd like to get to know you, know you, know
