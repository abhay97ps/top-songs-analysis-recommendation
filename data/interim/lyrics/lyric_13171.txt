Would I lie to you? 
Would I lie to you honey? 
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar, would I lie to you?
My friends know what's in store
I won't be here anymore
I've packed my bags
I've cleaned the floor
Watch me walking
Walking out the door
 I'll make it, make it
 I'll make it, make it
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you honey? 
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar, would I lie to you?
Tell you straight, no intervention
To your face, no deception
You're the biggest fake
That much is true
Had all I can take
Now I'm leaving you
 I'll make it, make it 
 I'll make it, make it 
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you honey?
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar, would I lie?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you honey?
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar
Would I lie to you?
My friends know what's in store
I won't be here anymore
I've packed my bags
I've cleaned the floor
Watch me walking
Walking out the door
 Watch me, watch me
 Watch me, watch me, yes I will, yeah
Would I lie to you?
