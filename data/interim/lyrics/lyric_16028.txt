Why's everybody still calling me a rapper?
I'm an artist, I just rap for fun, but still do it the hardest
Should've known that I was comin' like the song I did with Marcus
Once I hops in the beat, dispose of the carcass
I remember when I started, people tried to call me stupid
So I took the liberty to level up and go retarded
This ain't mainstream music, I see red when I rap
Don't compare me to these people who see red on a carpet
So I took off to another dimension
Thеre's no birds here in spacе, I ain't seeing ya mentions
Niggas claim I ain't shit then go use my shit
To get them views, notoriety and fucking attention
It's a famine in this industry, a rap recession
The only substance is abuse, let me cut the tension
I'm bringing real rap back
I was sent by the greats and I swore I would fucking protect it
This a killshot, everybody knows it
I'm coming, I'm making noise, but they acting like they ain't hearing me
Independent rapper who got it straight out the mud
When nobody was showing love, pussy nigga, I'm the epitome
Killshot, never took a handout from no one
I got it popping myself and I kept my dignity
Inspired by the greats and then Father, Son, that's a trinity
And I don't give a fuck if you hating or you ain't feeling me
Yeah, these people hate it when you're self-made
It's blue flame when I burst and disperse rage
Don't gotta physically tussle, I let my words play
Knew I was special 'cause the bus I took back in first grade
Mama told me don't listen, they don't know pain
No-names playing with me, but ain't got no game
I don't miss, whatever I drop hits
It's a stretch if you running with me, I sweat propane
Kick it, flip it, I'm skating laps around these fucking gimmicks
I'm wicked, twisted, I'm half insane and diagnosed as gifted
My words vertically exceed the rollercoaster limit
That's why when they try to ride along, they fucking miss it
I'm painting pictures too perfect to pick apart and diss it
They don't got the knowledge, their strength and integrity is missing
I remember days when my streaming numbers were pots to piss in
People tried to talk, but they couldn't see that I had a vision
Eminem done paved a path, Pac saw me in a dream
J. Cole can really hoop, we should play on the same team
Driving down the lane, he could kick it to me for three
Two, one, beating these buzzers and taking straight leads
I'm half amazing, the other half is the energy
Of every great poet, Shakespearian-type MC
Mozart, Bach, Beethoven inspired melodies
Cadence from an angel that's devilish, yet heavenly
Watch how I summon the beast, watch how my mouth is foaming
When I step in the booth and I know I'm 'bout to fuck up a beat
Watch how I slow it down for you
Then bring it back up to Usain Bolt world record speed
Alpha male, better flow, my LMs don't know Ps
So I stay on my Q 'cause they sleeping just like straight Zs
Niggas hate on me, then I see them go try and copy
'Cause I'm spitting these facts, so they printing them like machines
Gimme the mic, gimme the booth, gimme the beat that Lex produced
Gimme the strength to fill the shoes of the greats and deliver truth
Gimme the tools to fuel the youth, replenish, spend then recoup
Then redirect negativity pointed at me to you
Gimme the chance to redo, review, remove any excuse
And push through any obstruction or rule that tries to reduce
My mathematical flow that adds me in every room
But subtracts me from the trash that they've been force feeding to you
Honestly I might quit
I miss my janitor job and the long night shifts
I stick to myself 'cause my touch is Midas
Trust, everything that I touch spreads like virus
I don't give a fuck if you hate or you don't like this
I don't lend flows, my last name ain't Bias
I can't be bought, my music is priceless
And I've been all in their mouth like bronchitis
Niggas be trash, they buy it, I'm so sick of the music climate
Scuba diving, swimming into the mainstream with the sharks and stealing like a pirate
Fucking up giants, David, you're Goliath
Trumping the game, I'll Joe your Biden
Wanna be me, the only thing you'll ever be is Hepatitis
Niggas be talking like I ain't the nicest-meanest flow, it drips Poseidon
Word play concepts blow your mind with triple entend's and perfect timing
I'm in constant rhyming, morning, night, I'm constantly grinding
Who's better? I don't care but I know I'm top five greatest of all time and
Listen, I'm fuckin' here, yeah, it ain't a mistake
And with the shit I've already dropped, I can't be erased
Replaced, removed, and I'ma do whatever it takes
To have a seat at the table with the rest of greats
I ain't focused on the beef 'less we talking some steak
'Cause I got too much at it to step out of my lane
I said it once in the beginning and I'll say it again
I went from stupid to retarded, now I'm going insane
This a killshot, everybody knows it
I'm coming, I'm making noise, but they acting like they ain't hearing me
Independent rapper who got it straight out the mud
When nobody was showing love, pussy nigga, I'm the epitome
Killshot, never took a handout from no one
I got it popping myself and I kept my dignity
Inspired by the greats and then Father, Son, that's a trinity
And I don't give a fuck if you hating or you ain't feeling me
Say less, do more, it's Dax
