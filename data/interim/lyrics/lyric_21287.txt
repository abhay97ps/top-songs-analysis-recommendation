I pinch myself
Sometimes to make sure I'm not in a dream
That's how it seems
I close my eyes
And breathe in the sweetest moments I've ever known
It feels like home
And here I am
I want to be your everything
There you are
Turning winter into spring
And everyone that sees you
Always wants to know you
And everyone that knows you
Always has a smile
You're a standing ovation
After take years of waiting
For a chance to finally shine
Everyone calls you amazing
Yeah, I just call you mine
I fall apart
And just a word from you somehow seems to fix
Whatever's wrong, oh
You reach into the weakest moments
And remind me that I'm strong
You got to know
I'd be a fool not to see or even worse to forget
That you're more than I deserve
And everyone that sees you
Always wants to know you
And everyone that knows you
Always has a smile
You're a standing ovation
After take years of waiting
For a chance to finally shine
Everyone calls you amazing
Yeah, I just call you mine
Nothing makes sense when you're not here
As if my whole world disappears
Without you what's the point of it
And everyone that sees you
Always wants to know you
And everyone that knows you
Always has a smile
You're a dream I've been chasing
After take years of waiting
For a chance to finally shine
Everyone calls you amazing
Yeah, I just call you mine
