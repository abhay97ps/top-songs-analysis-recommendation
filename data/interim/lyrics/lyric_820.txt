Right or wrong I'll be with you
I'll do what you want me to
I believe that I belong
By your side, right or wrong
Right or wrong, it's gotta be
Always you, always me
Won't you take me along
To be with you right or wrong
If it's wrong to love you
It can't be wrong for me to care
If you say you love me
My life with you I'll share
Right or wrong, day by day
All my love, all the way
I believe that I belong
By your side, right or wrong
Right or wrong!!
