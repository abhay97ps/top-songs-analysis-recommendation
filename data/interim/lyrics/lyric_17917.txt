It's not your situation
I just need contemplation over you 
I'm not so systematic
It's just that I'm an addict for your love, yeah 
I'm not the only one that holds you 
I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl 
I'm not the only one that holds you 
I never ever should have told you
You're my only world  
Just think how long I've known you
It's wrong for me to own you
Lock and key 
It's really not confusing
I'm just the young illusion
Can't you see? oh yeah
