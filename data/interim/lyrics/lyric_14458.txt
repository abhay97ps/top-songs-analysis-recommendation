It seems it's getting harder
Yeah, it's so hard to find o lover
Okay, the boys are getting better
But they still fall down under close examination, baby
It used to be essential, yeah
But that was purely elemental
Investigations always led to one way conversations
It took me a little while to get myself acquainted
It just about ready for the right inspiration
Come on, now
Heart don't fail me now
Could he be the one I've waited for?
Oh yeah
Could he be the one being that I miss around here?
He could be the one
Yes, he could be the one
I wake up every morning
Inside my private little jewel box
It's not so bad to be alone
Don't want no substitution
I'd rather be alone than with someone and lonely
It would take much more than strong arms to hold me
Come on, now
Heart don't fail me now
Could he be the one I've waited for?
Oh yeah
Could he be the one being that I miss around here?
He could be the one
Yes, he could be the one
He could be the one
Be the one, be the one
 the one
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
He could be the one
Heart, don't fail me now
Don't mess my mind up
Ooh, don't you fail me now
It's no wonder I'm so tough
Heart, don't fail me now
Don't mess my mind up
I've come too far
I said, heart, don't fail me now
Don't mess my mind up
Ooh, don't you fail me now
It's no wonder I'm so tough
Heart, don't fail me now
I said, heart, don't fail me now
Come on, now
Heart, don't fail me now
Yeah, heart, don't fail me now
Come on, now
Heart, don't fail me now
Yeah, heart, don't fail me now
