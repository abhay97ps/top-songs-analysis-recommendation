Well I see the souls of so many friends
And I see us all back here again
With sandy floors and ceiling fans
A Rastafarian one-man band with songs
That fills my memories like a tip jar
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar
I see tourists at Christmas time
And I taste beers with a hint of lime
I feel lonely because it's not the same
Different faces and different names
Living like pirates out among the stars
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar
Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place
And I see a kid coming into his own
And a man learning to move on
Somehow trying to find his way
A dreamer betting on blind faith
Chasing that sun and following his heart
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar
Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place
A few have moved on back to Maine
Jacksonville and Key Biscayne
Some are still living the dream
Stuck in still life it seems
No matter where they've been
Or where they are
Yeah, I see them here
When I see this bar
When I see this bar
I wonder where we go from here
Life isn't over but it's always near
I think about all the good times that we had
It makes me happy and it makes me sad
How could we be so close, now so far apart
That's what I feel, that's what I see
Yeah we were living like pirates and want to be stars
That's what I see when I see this bar
That's what I see when I see this bar
