Come on everybody!
Clap your hands!
Aw, you're looking good!
I'm gonna sing my song
It won't take long!
We're gonna do the twist
And it goes like this:
Come on let's twist again
Like we did last summer
Yeah, let's twist again
Like we did last year
Do you remember when
Things were really hummin'?
Yeah, let's twist again
Twistin' time is here
Hee, and 'round and 'round and up and down we go again
Oh, baby, make me know you love me so
And then:
Twist again
Like we did last summer
Come on, let's twist again
Like we did last year
Twist, yo!
Who's that, flyin' up there?
Is it a bird? 
Is it a plane? 
Is it the twister? 
Yeah!
Twist again, like we did last summer
Come on, Let's twist again
Like we did last year
Do you remember when
Things were really hummin'?
Come on, let's twist again
Twistin' time is here
Hee, and 'round and 'round and up and down we go again
Oh, baby, make me know you love me so
And then
Comeon, twist again
Like we did last summer
Come on, let's twist again
Like we did last year
Come on, let's twist again
Twistin' time is here
