It's solo, solo everybody
It's solo, e-e-e-everybody
It's solo, solo, everybody
Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop
I never meant to leave you hurtin'
I never meant to do the worst thing
Not to you 
'Cause every time I read your message
I wish I wasn't one of your exes
Now I'm the fool 
Since you've been gone
I've been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause baby you're
The only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more
No more, no more
I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry, but I like to party
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo
It's solo, solo everybody
It's solo, e-e-e-everybody
It's solo, solo everybody
It's solo, solo everybody
It's solo, e-e-e-everybody
It's solo, solo everybody
Every single night I lose it
I can't even hear the music
Without you
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Try to stop myself from calling
But I really wanna know if you're with
Someone new
Since you've been gone
I've been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on 
'Cause baby, you're the only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more, no more, no more
I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry, but I like to party
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted 
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted 
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo
It's solo, solo everybody
It's  solo, e-e-e-everybody
It's  solo, solo everybody
It's  solo, solo everybody
It's solo, e-e-e-everybody
It's solo, solo everybody
Can't do it solo
I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry, but I like to party
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own 
I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted 
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted 
T-t-touch but I got nobody
So I do it solo
It's solo, solo everybody
It's solo, e-e-e-everybody
It's solo, solo everybody
It's solo, solo everybody
It's solo, e-e-e-everybody
It's solo, solo everybody
So I do it solo
