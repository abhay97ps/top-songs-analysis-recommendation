Now have you got yourself a brand new baby?
Don't tell me maybe
Is it so?
I got to know
What's it gonna be?
Him or me?
Him or me?
Him or me?
Him or me?
I can still recall when you told me I was all
Everything you looked for in a man
But I know that it's not true
I've seen the way he looks at you
And I think you're gonna hang me up again
Now have you got yourself a brand new baby?
Don't tell me maybe
Is it so?
I got to know
What's it gonna be?
Him or me?
Him or me?
Him or me?
Him or me?
So if you'd like to be so kind
Would you please make up your mind
I won't share your lovin' with another man
And if you see things my way
Won't you let me know today
But if you decide it's him
I'll change my plans
So now you've got yourself a brand new baby
Don't tell me maybe
Is it so?
I got to know
What's it gonna be?
Him or me?
Him or me?
Him or me?
Him or me?
Him or me
Him or me
Him or me
Him or me
What's it gonna be?
Him or me
Him or me
Him or me
What's it gonna be?
Him or me
Him or me
Him or me
What's it gonna be?
