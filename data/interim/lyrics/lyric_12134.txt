Came a time in my life
I had to be free
From all the lies
That used to be me
And the only way out
Is the only way in
And it's you
I've been waisting my time
But not anymore
I've been through the maze
And it lead to your door
And the only way out
Is the only way in
And it's you
I spent a lot of time at the crossroads
Getting that lonely feeling inside
Suddenly you stopped the rain and you changed the view
Now every where's leading to you
Let's get this thing going
Let's move it along
Let me do all the things
I've been missing so long
'Cause the only way out
Is the only way in
And it's you
Ohoho
I spent a lot of time at the crossroads
Getting that lonely feeling inside
Suddenly you made the rescue, you pulled me through
Now let me do something for you
Let's get this thing going
Let's move it along
Let's do all the things
I've been missing so long
And the only way out
Is the only way in
And it's you
Yeah, the only way out
Is the only way in
And it's you
Yeah, the only way out
Is the only way in
And it's you
Only way out
Is the only way in
The only way out
Is the only way in
Ahaha
The only way in
Only way out
