See the tree
How big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long, wasn't it
I laughed at her
And she got made
The first day she planted it
Was just a twig
And then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart
And kind of dumb, kind of smart
And I loved her so
I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas eve, two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her
When I came home from workin' late
Cause I would know
That she'd been sitting there and crying
Over some sad and silly late late show
And honey I miss you
Oh and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
Oh she wrecked the car
And she was sad
And so afraid I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly
And found her crying needlessly
In the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away
One day while I wasn't home
While she was there and all alone
The angels came
Now all I have is memories of honey
And I wake up nights and call her name
Now my life's an empty stage
Where honey lived and honey played
And love grew up
A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down in the flowerbed
That honey loved
Oh honey I miss you
Miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
Honey I miss you
Miss you
I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
