Love love love, why'd you take so long to come to me? Ah baby
Love love, your love, tell me where you hiding from me
All the time
Each time I try to find someone to take your place
It was all in vain
No, their lips were never quite the same, ah baby
When I was kiss someone new, deep inside I was missing you
Ah baby, you make me fall in love with you
Now I don't know just what I'm gonna do
Ah honey, I looked out into empty space
And all I saw was your sweet face
Love love love, you can't imagine what you did to me, oh baby
And love, your love, every time you smile it goes through me
All the time
Day by day I'm fallin' more in love with you
And that's no lie, cross my heart and honey I hope to die
'Cause I'm not tryin' to mislead you
Believe me, girl, I really need you
Oh, oh baby, you make me fall in love with you
Now I don't know just what I'm gonna do
Ah honey, I looked out into empty space
And all I saw was your sweet face
Ah baby, you make me fall in love with you
I don't know just what I'm gonna do
Ah honey, I looked out into empty space
All I saw was your sweet face
Love love love
Love love love
