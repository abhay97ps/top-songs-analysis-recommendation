Ooh ooh ooh
You said you believed that we'd find love together happily
After all the wrong I've done
You feel that I'm still the one to give your loving to
So bring it home to you
You told me that you'll love me if I'd ever change
Welcome me into your arms again
Come on in out of the rain, hey hey
There's a place in your heart to love me again
Happiness and joy, you bring when you call my name
Come on in out of the rain
I loved no one but you, but I strayed, I know I made you blue
You spoke unto my very soul
You warmed my heart that once was cold
Now I'm so glad to know, oh
You told me that you'll love me if I'd ever change
Welcome me into your arms again
Come on in out of the rain, hey hey
There's a place in your heart to love me again
Happiness and joy, you bring when you call my name
Come on in out of the rain
Some people spend a lifetime looking for love
And I had love right here all of the time
Why did I try to deny it?
Deep inside I just couldn't fight it, you turned my life around
The love I lost is found, so let the rain come down
You told me that you'll love me if I'd ever change
Welcome me into your arms again
Come on in out of the rain
There's a place in your heart to love me again
Happiness and joy, you bring when you call my name
Come on in out of the rain
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby come out of the rain
