Sooner or later love is gonna get ya
Sooner or later, girl, you got to give in
Sooner or later love is gonna let ya
Sooner or later love is gonna win
It's just a matter of time
Before you make up your mind
To give all that love that you've been hidin'
It's just a question of when
I've told you time and again
I'll get all the love you've been denyin'
Sooner or later love is gonna get ya
Sooner or later, girl, you got to give in 
Sooner or later love is gonna let ya 
Sooner or later love is gonna win
You say you'll never be mine
But, darlin', there'll come a time
I'll taste all that love that you've been hidin'
It's just a question of time
Before you make up your mind
And give all that love you've been denyin'
In all the wrong places
All the wrong faces
All this illusion
From all this confusion
Sooner or later love is gonna get ya
Sooner or later, girl, you got to give in 
Sooner or later love is gonna let ya
Sooner or later love is gonna win
Love is gonna win 
It's just a matter of time 
Before you make up your mind 
To give all the love that you've been hidin' 
It's just a question of when
I've told you time and again 
I'll get all the love you've been denyin' 
Sooner or later love is gonna get ya
Sooner or later, girl, you got to give in 
Sooner or later love is gonna let ya
Sooner or later love is gonna win
Sooner or later love is gonna get ya
Sooner or later girl, you got to give in
Sooner or later love is gonna let ya
Sooner or later love is gonna win
