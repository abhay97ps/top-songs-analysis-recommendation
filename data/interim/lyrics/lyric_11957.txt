Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only one?
And didn't I give you everything I could
Well didn't I get it to you now, baby?
After all the love I gave you
There was never enough
Well I'm gonna show ya baby
That this man can get tough
Just come on, come on, come on, come on
And 
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
Break another little piece of my heart and throw it away
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
You know you got it
If it makes you feel good, oh yeah
Out there in the streets lookin' good
And in your heart ya know it ain't right, it just ain't right
Yeah, and ya never, never, never, never hear me
When I cry all night
I keep tryin' to tell myself that I
Can't stand the pain
But then ya hold me in your arms, ooh baby
And I gotta say it again
Just come on, , yeah come on, 
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
Break another little piece off, and just throw it away
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
 You know you got it
If it makes you feel good
Oh, just come on, , come on, 
 Take it baby
Just break my heart again
I don't need it, I don't want it
You can take it, take it, baby
You know you got it
If it makes you feel good
Just , oh yeah, 
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
Break another little piece off and throw it away
Yeah, another little piece of my heart now baby
Take it and break it, take it, take it and break it baby
Another little piece of my heart now baby
Just take a piece and break it off and just throw it away
I don't need it, I never needed it anyway
Take it, break it
