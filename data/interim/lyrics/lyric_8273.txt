Tell me a lie
Say i look familiar
Though i know you don't even know my name
Tell me a lie
Say you just got into town
Even though i've seen you before just hanging around
Tell me a lie
Say you're not a married man
But you don't know i saw you slip of a wedding ring
Tell me a lie
Say you've got no place to stay
But you'd be glad to drop more cause is only your way
Tell me a lie
When you take me home 
I won't live one more spring or night alone
Tell me a lie
Don't worry about my sorrows
You belong of tomorrow
And you won't have to see me cry 
Tell me a lie 
Tell me that you need me
And i'll pretend that is real the way you want me to
Please tell me a lie
When you're lying close beside me
And wispering you hold me sweet words like i love you
Won't you tell me a lie
When i'm net and almost over
Make it easy on us both when it's time for you to go
Come on tell me a lie
Say you'd really like to stay
Tell me just one more lie, you'll be back one day
