This ain't no temporary, typical, tearful goodbye
This ain't no breakin' up, then wakin' up and makin' up one more time
This is gone , gone , gone , gone
Gone like a freight train
Gone like yesterday
Gone like a soldier in the Civil War
Bang Bang!
Gone like a '59 Cadillac
Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back
She's gone , gone , gone , gone
She's gone!
This ain't no 'give it time, I'm hurtin' but maybe we can work it out'
Won't be no champagne, red rose, romance, second chance
This is gone , gone , gone , gone
Gone like a freight train
Gone like yesterday
Gone like a soldier in the Civil War
Bang Bang!
Gone like a '59 Cadillac
Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back
She's gone , gone , gone , gone
She's gone!
This is gone , gone , gone , gone
Gone like a freight train
Gone like yesterday
Gone like a soldier in the Civil War
Bang Bang!
Gone like a '59 Cadillac
Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back
She's gone 
She's gone 
She's gone 
She's gone!
She's gone!
Gone like a freight train
Gone like yesterday
Gone like a soldier in the Civil War
Bang Bang!
Gone like a '59 Cadillac
Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back
She's gone
Long gone, don't be wrong, never comin' back, my baby's gone
She's gone
Wanna get home, sittin' alone, so pack your bags, and now she's gone
Never comin' back, she's gone
No, no, never
No, no, never
No, no, never
No, no, never comin' back
No, no, never
No, no, never comin' back
