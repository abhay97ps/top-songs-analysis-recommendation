I juss don't get it why niggas would have a death wish
This the seventh ball of DB Z granting your wish, bitch
Verse 
You got your bars on repeat and you call that a skill?
You preach on Kontrol beat trynna be Kendrick on this shit
Still your rhyme skill's weak
You still need to grow feet, cuz this circus you trynna run's pharaonic
Twas daal writing your name lyrically Kal, cuz we both know you weak
True definition to your naam Lyrically Mess-IAH
This record a quick sweep
For dirt like ya, you know your act was derp, cuz you know you can't keep up with I
Is you outta your mind?
I can tell from your view that Khusco murdered I, when I got him to rewriting his verse
The picture is now clear that I'm too complex for your ass
And damn right, the track is mine drama queen
I'm only entertained by scary movies like eminem and 5'9"
And if you gon' talk your ass nice on the mic
Probly you should name your single hit without my ass on the line
Lyrically I'm underated
You said, I should stick to beats, you give me that, double complimentary
Your ass on respect mode, still you mouth to test your skill, talking about skill, hell sending you alphabetically
Look, I Ace with beats
See, I'm a rap Dea and you's a lunesta
There's power in my rap's like the Ee
F was you thinking G?
Like Junkie without H, I put L+L on this verse like Cool J
Dropping your K, rising your HBP
Juss this L enough to leave you with Cancer
Dawn of the sun, guess who's playing Eminem at 3AM aNd you ain't got no place to conceal
Oh!!! Perhaps you do, say peace to rap, find yourself cuz you don't belong here
Six different paths heading the same direction
Here's a cue to your ass
Hope you Are ready for hell
I'm skipping the S, cuz there's no peace in this verse
I do double me, cuz it's still T on this beat
You juss a V shape between a woman's legs boy
P.O.W I'mma fuck you up
You should've juss thought of it, before you cross the setup
I don't get it why niggas would have a death wish
This the seventh ball of DB Z, granting your wish
Bitch, when we talk about skill
R.I.P
