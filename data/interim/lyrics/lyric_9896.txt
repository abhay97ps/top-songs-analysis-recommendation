Ooh, look at her standin' there
Tight dress and long dark hair
Ohh, it's good to know
That she's waitin' for me
I always said I'm a one-night man
Tease the little girls and away I ran
But her eyes burned a hole in my heart
I don't know what to say
When I saw her, I was fascinated
I never even hesitated
When I touched her, I went right up in smoke
And when I kissed her, I was blistered, and it's time I spoke
I got to sing it, shout it
Tell the world about it
I can't believе what I'm thinkin' of
Sing it, shout it
Tell the world about it
I think I'm fallin' in love
Ooh, shе looks so good tonight 
There's somethin' special about the light 
Oh, she seems to glow
Like the moon on the sea 
I know I'm late for our rendezvous 
But I just wanna look for a minute or two 
I may never have much in this life 
But at least I'll have a memory 
'Cause she moves with such a sweet precision
Her arms can hold me like a prison
Her lips are all I need to survive
So she blitzes me with kisses just to keep me alive
I got to sing it, shout it
Tell the world about it
I can't believe what I'm thinkin' of
Sing it, shout it
Tell the world about it
I think I'm fallin' in love
She moves with such a sweet precision
Her arms can hold me like a prison
Her lips are all I need to survive
So she blitzes me with kisses just to keep me alive
I got to sing it, shout it
Tell the world about it
I can't believe what I'm thinkin' of
Sing it, shout it
Tell the world about it
I think I'm fallin' in love
I got to sing it, shout it
Tell the world about it
I can't believe what I'm thinkin' of
Sing it, shout it
Tell the world about it
I think I'm fallin' in love
Gotta sing it, shout it
Tell the world about it
I can't believe what I'm thinkin' of
Sing it, shout it
Tell the world about it
I think I'm fallin' in lovvve
