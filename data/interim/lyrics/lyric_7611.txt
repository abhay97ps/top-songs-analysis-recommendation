Girl, you walk around
With your head up in the sky
Yes, you do now
'Cause you hurt so many before
And never had to cry, no
But you better stop, honey
And realize, yeah
That one day soon
You're gonna have to be penalized
Oh
That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sow
You can't let those tears run free
It'll happen to you like it happened to me, baby
That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sow
You can't let those tears run free
It's gonna happen to you
Just like it happened to me, girl
Because you made me cry
You think you're the baddest of them all
Yes, you do now
Well, I hope I'm around, my dear
When he sets you free and you fall, yeah
Then you'll find it's not such a laugh
When tears run 'til you can't see, no, no, no
Your heartaches are gonna come
And so is your misery, yeah
That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sow, na na baby
You can't let those tears run free
It'll happen to you like it happened to me, oh yeah
That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sow
You can't let those tears run free
It's gonna happen to you
Just like it happened to me, girl
Ooh, ooh
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Well, well, come on help me sing it
I say, I say, I say, oh baby
Ooh, na, na, na
But let me tell you something 
Baby, you better stop
And take a real good look at yourself 
'Cause when those heartaches strike 
You're gonna wish you were somebody else 
Oh, that smile that you're wearing 
Gonna turn to a frown, yeah 
You find the one that you love 
Baby, he's gonna put you down 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na 
Oh baby, oh baby, oh
That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sow, na na baby
Na, na, na, na, na baby 
Well, well, well 
You gotta reap just what you sow
You'll get those tears and run free, oh
That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sow, na na baby
You can't let those tears run free
It'll happen to you like it happened to me, oh yeah
