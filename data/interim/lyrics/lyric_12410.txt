Yeah
I need it, I need it
Oh, girl
You know very well
What you are
You’re my sugar thing
My chocolate star
I’ve had a few
But not that many
But you’re the only love
That gives me good and plenty
Juicy fruit 
Juicy 
Juicy fruit
Juicy
Candy rain
Comin’ down
Taste you in my mind
And spread you all around
Here I am
Oh, this love’s for you
Hey, baby
Sweet as honey dew
Close my eyes
Oh, what fantasy
And you’re right here with me
Juicy
Cherry blossom kiss
What you’re givin’
Makes my body rock
Keeps me sizzlin’
Do what you want
I don’t care
I’ll be your lollipop
Juicy fruit 
Juicy 
Juicy fruit 
Juicy
Here I am
This love’s for you
Hey, baby
You’re sweet as honey dew 
Close my eyes
Oh, what fantasy
And you’re here, you're right here with me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Juicy 
Juicy fruit
Juicy
Juicy fruit 
Juicy 
Juicy fruit 
Juicy 
Juicy fruit 
Juicy 
Juicy fruit 
Juicy
