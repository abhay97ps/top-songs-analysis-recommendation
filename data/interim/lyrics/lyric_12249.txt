All we wanted was each other
Nothing more
You were looking for an answer
You were out the door 
I didn't know what you were after
I knew you had to take a chance, girl 
Did you forget about the laughter? 
Say  oh 
Oh no
Ooh, what you're missing could have been yours from the start
You won't listen when it's coming from the heart
Now you're missing me
You'll find that out when we're apart
Had some crazy conversations
You know they seemed so right
Remember how it used to keep us up all night? 
I didn't know what you were after
Maybe there never was an answer 
Did you forget about the laughter? 
Say  oh 
Oh no
Ooh, what you're missing could have been yours from the start
You won't listen when it's coming from the heart
Now you're missing me
You'll find that out when we're apart
I didn't know what you were after
Say  oh 
Oh no
Ooh
Could have been yours from the start
When it's coming from the heart
Could have been yours from the start
When it's coming from the heart
