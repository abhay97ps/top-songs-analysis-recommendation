Yo! 
It's your boy! 
Daddy Yankee!
All my latinos stand up! 
Narcando la historia
Caminen conmigo en esta 
Holla back
You know how we do, man!
'Cause you're the only one for me 
It's the way that you make me feel 
'Cause you're the only one for me 
It's the way that you make me feel 
Straight up you're so bad, baby you hot
In the hood you feel the tension when you walk down the block
That's the reason you in my head, believe it or not
Me and you can run the world like Big Pun and Pac
'Cause you my main homie, my main shawty
Cock back hammers and bang homie protecting our gauge slowly
With a girl like you, forget the nonsense
We don't give a fuck about the chicos and gossip 
Daddy Yankee, you shining right now
Come on, cap me now, I got this game locked down
What you know about big thingsz chrome wheels own deals
Me and you holding it down, it's all real, come on!
'Cause you're the only one for me 
It's the way that you make me feel 
'Cause you're the only one for me 
It's the way that you make me feel 
Yo, la negra tiene tumba'o, cuando camina de la'o
Por la calle ocho sin miedo, we be wildin' out
Switching lanes on the freeway, corriendo por miles
A little foreplay, like Bonnie and Clyde en el crimen
Flossing jewels is not a felony
How am I a playa ma'? Do I look like Bill Bellamy?
No te molestes yo soy tuyo na' mas
I'm not a player, I just crush a lot
Come on!
Tú eres la chica ideal para mí 
Como tú nadie me ha hecho sentir 
'Cause you're the only one for me 
It's the way that you make me feel 
Oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh 
'Cause you're the only one for me 
It's the way that you make me feel 
'Cause you're the only one for me 
It's the way that you make me feel 
Yeah!
All my latinos stand up!
Caminen conmigo
Bust the floor, bossing
Daddy Tankee!
Barrio fino!
And I'm proud to be latin, man
Letting you know who's the real
King of the Jungle!
