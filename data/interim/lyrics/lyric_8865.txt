Drunk and cold
Can't get no help from nobody
I'd sell my soul to find
One more drink left in that bottle
They say that I'm worthless
That all hope for me is gone
Heaven help me
Trying to beat the morning home
Lord, don't let the daylight
Show the shame that's on my face
Just let me hide in my disgrace
My woman's there
I'll be she's sitting there just waiting
She won't ask where
Where I've been or why I'm drinking
She knows it's hopeless
But she keeps hanging on
Heaven help me
Trying to beat the morning home
Lord, I know I've tried many times before
But this time I really mean it, so help me
Trying to beat the morning home
