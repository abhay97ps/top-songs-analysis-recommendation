It's time for you to strike back
They're looking at you
Whitney Houston
Muhammad 2 G
They're watching your every move
Bobby
They're watching you
Why you looking at me
Don't get mad at me
Because I'm still going to be me
Whatchulookinat
Whatchulookinat
I feel your eyes on me
You been telling lies on me
Whatchulookinat
See I don't understand
Why you keep peeping me
When you don't even like me
You're after me and my man
Don't think you're stressing me
Because your lies don't excite me, no no
Never thought, Never thought
Never knew that you would do this to me
Do this to me
 Ruin me
 Be my enemy
Never thought, Never thought, Never thought
 That you
Would act as if you're cool with me
So why you looking at me
Why you looking at me
Don't get mad
 Going to be me
Me, Me, Me
Tell me whatchulookinat
Feel your eyes
Telling lies
Tell me
Whatchulookinat
Oh you know you're wrong
Don't want to respect my song
But it's okay because either way
My following is real strong
You try so hard to show the whole world what I do
Now I'm turning the cameras back on you
Same spotlight that once gave me fame
Trying to dirty up Whitney's name
Never thought, Never thought
Never knew that you would do this to me
Do this to me
 Ruin me
 Be my enemy
Never thought, Never thought, Never thought
 That you
Would act as if you're cool with me
So why you looking at me
Why you looking at me
Don't get mad at me
Because I'm still going to be me
Whatchulookinat
Whatchulookinat
I feel your eyes on me
You been telling lies on me
Whatchulookinat
Why you looking at me
Don't get mad at me
Because I'm still going to be me
Whatchulookinat
Whatchulookinat
I feel your eyes on me
You been telling lies on me
Whatchulookinat
Messing with my reputation
Ain't even got no education
Trying to mess with my concentration
Don't even have a clue of what I'm facing
All you know you need to stop it
Defaming my name for a profit
God is the reason my soul is free
And I don't need you looking at me
Why you looking at me
Don't get mad at me
Because I'm still going to be me
Whatchulookinat
Whatchulookinat
I feel your eyes on me
You been telling lies on me
Whatchulookinat
Why you looking at me
Don't get mad at me
Because I'm still going to be me
Whatchulookinat
Whatchulookinat
I feel your eyes on me
You been telling lies on me
Whatchulookinat
