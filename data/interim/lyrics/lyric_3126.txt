You were only fooling
While I was falling in love
It's a story as old as Adam and Eve
I was making love
But you were making believe
You lied to me with kisses
I've tried to stop dreaming of
But you were only fooling me
While I was falling in love
You were only fooling
While I was falling in love
It's a story as old as Adam and Eve
I was making love
But you were making believe
You lied to me with kisses
I've tried to stop dreaming of
But you were only fooling me
While I was falling in love
While I was falling in love
