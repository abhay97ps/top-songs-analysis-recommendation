If you leave me tonight I will cry
Though you say we will soon meet again
For the hours I've spent here with you
Are like words from a poet's pen
Words like love, and truth, and goodness
Words like Until death us do part
I will never love another
Take my heart, take my heart, take my heart
Yes, the hours I've spent here with you
Are like words from a poet's pen
Take my heart, take my heart, take my heart
