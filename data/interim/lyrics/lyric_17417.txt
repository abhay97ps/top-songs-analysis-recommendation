Vamos a tequila, senorita, Bonita
I really need it now
I ain't got no tengo dinero, caballero
Say can we work it out
First time I meet her, I wanted to greet her
Nobody could've been sweeter
I was wrong should have bought a bombita
But, now she gone
I don't know where she go
Me, I'm frustrated down so and the other men miss her
I guess I surely know that, baby
Where did she gone?
Where the rose bush rise up
Are you wicked than bandolero then better wise up
Or we go, ash to ash and dust onto the dust
You just big up a chest and go loco
Vamos a tequila, senorita, Bonita
I really need it now
I ain't got no tengo dinero, caballero
Say can we work it out
Smile up on the face
Make the next plan
Wiggle the bottom to attract the next man
Rude boys, beware
This one's come fe run the things
Swing them together
Like vendetta the gun things
She lick a shot, sa, to get
She take care of dha freak
And you get the money 'cause her punani popularity
Bum, bye, bye, she make a grown man cry
She just big up her chest and go loco
Come on
Vamos a tequila, senorita, Bonita
I really need it now
I ain't got no tengo dinero, caballero
Say can we work it out
Vamos a tequila, senorita, Bonita
I really need it now
I ain't got no tengo dinero, caballero
Say can we work it out
