With what the young generation's doing
And I'm like, "Yo, man, you really just got to do this shit", like
Worrying about or tryna figure out what they need to think or like it or not
Oh man, you gon' have about five years go by
Next thing you know, you ain't gon' wanna do this shit no more
But you really just gotta do you
Yeah, going by
Goin', goin', gone, gone, gone, gone 
I'm goin' by
Goin', goin', gone, gone, gone, gone
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah 
Goin' by, go
Years go by, where we at right now? 
Thought we, might be able to relax right now 
Pressure on me whenever I'm flatlined down
I can't keep 'em on my back right now
The game called me and said, "Come back right now" 
Put the fire on the fuckin' wax right now, yeah 
She want all the eggs in one batch right now, but 
I can't risk that right now, no
City on fire, that's 'cause of me and Jack, huh 
Fifty deuce got the city loose, goin' platinum 
Spit the truth in the booth, give it to the fandom 
Listen boo, I gotta make these anthems
Anywho, she went ghost on me, Danny Phantom 
Single ladies, romance 'em 
Hold me baby, no ransom
Know me crazy, throwin' tantrums
Know me crazy 
Know me crazy 
Yeah 
Years go by 
Years go by 
Years go by
Listen up , huh
Yeah, show tonight, ho, it's hype, don't you let go tonight 
Baby, get closer right, it was meant for you 
Heard it right, bitches ain't sittin' in for you 
Certified, bonafide, genuine for you, that's 
That's a fuckin' synonym for you
Givenchy, you like 'em? I'll send 'em in for you 
Split it with a nigga, got the dividends for you
You down with it, wood brown, cinnamon for you
Yeah, you don't live for this life, girl, I know 
But this is the life I know 
Yes, it took a little time
Just a grown nigga, but I've grown since then
And I promise, we gon' keep it solid
Keep away all the monsters 
Fuck this nonsense, no dividin', we conquer
It's that anniversary, sing that shit like Tony
Sing this chorus and this verse for me
Bae, it's Gawdtilla
Where you goin'?
'Fore this time go 
Goin', goin', gone, gone, gone 
Go
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
