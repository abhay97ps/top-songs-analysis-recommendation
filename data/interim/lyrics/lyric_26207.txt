.44 Bulldog, make 'em get back 
I ain't with the talk or the chit chat 
All you hatin' ass niggas better sit back 
Or you gon' be the next one to get they shit snatched 
Free Milly Gz out the cage, he was buckin' 
I kicked her out 'cause I'm allergic to the cuffin' 
And I ain't with the talk or discussions 
Know some niggas that'll shoot you for nothin' 
I call Dread, that's the new Tom Brady 
Niggas gettin' no bread 'cause they lazy 
Let me tell ya why the opp niggas hate me 
'Cause all the opp niggas know I be flexin' 
And I did fifteen on my check-ins 
And it's big Louboutin when I'm steppin' 
And it's big .38 for the weapon 
Or I call J.R. with the Wesson 
They call Trav, call me Le Filayo 
Niggas know you got the apes on the payroll 
Niggas slide through ya block with a Draco 
Nigga nun, do a move if I say no 
Dunk on that nigga, Tatum 
All of y'all niggas, dayroom 
Stay with the Zoes, Haitians 
823, sanctioned

Sun out , gun out 
Run down, what now? 
Flossy, the jungle the playground 
Back out the chop, we gon' spray rounds 
Big Fendi bag, no Sprayground 
Aim for your head, we don't spray ground 
Everybody know that I'm GG 
I'm still in the hood, smokin' headlight 
Do you know the '09 to the 2T? 
Posted in the Floss, they be wildin' 
Brodie got locked for the hammer 
Free Rock, get off the island 
'09 to the Glock like dem wayz 
And I keep a chop like sensei 
Niggas move hot, I ain't say nothin' 
'Cause I'ma lay low 'til that day come 
.44 Bulldog, make 'em get back
