Ah
Surrender me a kiss
Let me loose on you inch by inch
The one and only reason is fun, fun, fun
I said "Well baby, we've only just begun"
So don't talk Just kiss
We're beyond words and sound
Don't talk just kiss
Let your tongue fool around
Let's fool around
Ooh yeah
There's people, there's love
You and I both apply to the above
The one and only reason is fun, fun, fun
I said "Well baby, we've only just begun"
So don't talk Just kiss
We're beyond words and sound
Don't talk just kiss
Let your tongue fool around
Ah ha
We're wasting precious time
Don't talk
Kiss
Ahh
And make it mine
The one and only reason is fun, fun, fun
I said "Well baby, we've only just begun"
So don't talk Just kiss
We're beyond words and sound
Don't talk just kiss
Let your tongue fool around
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Fool around
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Fool around
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Fool around
So don't talk just kiss
We're beyond words and sound
Don't talk just kiss
Let your tongue fool around
We're beyond words and sound
Don't talk just kiss
Let your tongue fool around
Let's fool around
Let's fool around
