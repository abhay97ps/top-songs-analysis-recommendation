She's in love with you
That's all she wants to do
She'll never let you down
She'll never fool around
'Coz she's in love with you
So if you see her all alone one night
Walk up to her discreetly, ask her why
And if she replies with words that don't make sense
It may be just because she's shy
Don't take advantage of her lack of understanding
Just because you think you could
Treat her right
Treat her good
Take her home
And make her feel the way she should
'Coz she's in love with you
That's all she wants to do
She'll never let you down
She'll never fool around
'Coz she's in love with you
She's in love with you
That's all she wants to do
She'll never let you go
She may not let you know
But she's in love with you
So if you happen to be out one night
And someone asks you where you're gonna go
Just remember she's not like the other girls
She may not want them all to know
Though she may need a little time
She never wants to stand in line the way they would
So treat her nice
Treat her good
Treat her like you know you should
You may never find another girl like her
'Coz she's in love with you
That's all she wants to do
She'll never let you down
She'll never fool around
'Coz she's in love with you
She's in love with you
That's all she wants to do
She'll never let you go
She may not let you know
But she's in love with you
So take her home and hold her close
Touch her where she feels it most, but be true
And when she's making love to you
She'll do what you want her to
Treat her good
Treat her like you know you should
You may never find another girl like her
'Coz she's in love with you
That's all she wants to do
She'll never let you down
She'll never fool around
'Coz she's in love with you
She's in love with you
