As high as the moon, so high were my spirits
When you sang out my name
And coming from you, it was enough just to hear it
Oh, it rang like the bells did today
But even the sturdiest ground
Can shift and can tremble and let us fall down
Kindly unspoken, you show your emotion
And silence speaks louder than words, oh, oh, oh
It's lucky I'm clever, if I didn't know better
I'd believe only that which I'd heard
In the days of my folly, I followed your lead
I did what Simon said to do, yea
But I won't, won't let melancholy play me for a fool
Oh, no I'm on my way somewhere new, yeah
As far as your lack of something to say, well
Just to tell me goodbye there was no better way
Kindly unspoken, you show your emotion
And silence speaks louder than words, woah, oh, oh
It's lucky I'm clever, if I didn't know better
I'd believe only that which I'd heard, yeah
Well baby, don't keep me up 'till the dawn, no
With those old words that keep leading me on
Well, baby, I know much better than to wait for an answer from you, whoa, oh, oh, oh
Kindly unspoken, you show your emotion
And silence speaks louder than words, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's lucky I'm clever, if I didn't know better
I'd believe only that which I'd heard
Oh, oh, now, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
