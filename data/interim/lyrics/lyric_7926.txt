HEY YOU...get of my mountain
HEY YOU...get of my cloud
HEY YOU...get off my mountain
Your just trying too
Bring me down
And you laugh in my face
Make me feel like a clown
Baby I think I better put you in your place
That kind of action I don't need 
That kind of heartache I can't use 
And that kind of lovin I can do without
So go and play your games with someone new
HEY YOU... get off my mountain
HEY YOU... get off my cloud
HEY YOU... get off my mountain
Your just trying too 
Bring me down
Oh! That kind of action I don't need 
And that kind of heartache I can't use 
And that kind of lovin I can do without
So go and play your game with someone new
HEY YOU.... get off my mountain
HEY YOU.... get off my cloud
Stay off my cloud
HEY YOU... get off my mountain
Your just trying too 
I said your just trying too
Bring me down....
Just tryin, just trying
