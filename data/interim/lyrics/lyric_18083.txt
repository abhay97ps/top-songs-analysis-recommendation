You say you wanna let me go
Well theres on thing that you should know
I'll walk away willingly
And you'll never even hear me leave
I'll go quietly
I'll go silently
But I'll go crazy, without you
Insane with a heart so blue
They'll have to lock me away
And I won't last one day
Without you baby
I'll go Crazy
I never thought I'd see the day
When I have to walk away
But I still think theres a ray of hope
But your the one who's lettin' go
I'll go easily
I'll go where you please
But I'll go crazy without you
Insane with a heart so blue
They'll have to lock me away
And I won't last one day
Without you baby
I'll go Crazy
I'll go and take the blame
I'll go down in flames
But I'll go crazy without you
Insane with a heart so blue
They'll have to lock me away
And I won't last one day
Without you baby
Hey I'll go Crazy
Hey I'll go crazy
Well I'll go crazy
