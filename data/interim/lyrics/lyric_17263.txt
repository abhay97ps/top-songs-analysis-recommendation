Oh, yeah, yeah
I'm not feeling you
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway
You know how I'm living
Playas never been my style
This time you're not forgiven so
Don't try to change my mind
I know you want me
And I know you want me bad
I know you're thinkin' of me
It's my turn not to care
And that's why
I'm not feeling you
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway
I'm not feeling you
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway
Let it go, no flippin' out, my love
I need someone to hold me near
I need a man, don't try to buy my love
I need someone to be right here
Ah, no, no, no
I know you want me
And I know you want me bad
I know you're thinkin' of me
It's my turn not to care
So I
I'm not feeling you
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway
I'm not feeling you
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway
I'm not feeling you
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway
I'm not feeling you
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway
Hey baby
Yeah, I'm alright
How you feelin'?
Come inside
Yeah, come in
Close the door behind you
Yeah, I know
I'm home a little early from work today
Yeah
You miss me baby?
Yeah
I miss you too
I missed you so much I followed you today
Uh huh
Yo son, yo son
Don't raise up son, chill
Sit down son, I'm talkin' to you
But I'm sayin' though
Don't deny it
I saw you
I saw you with your alcoholic secretary
The one with the bad weave
Walkin', holdin' her hand
Playin' yo self as usual
And you know you are known for playin' yo self
Instead of holdin' her hand
You shoulda been putting some lotion on them crusty feet she got
But anyway, I ain't gonna stress that, it's all good
You know your man Big Mike
Yeah, first round draft pick
Big Mike
I know you know him as Mike
But I call him Big Mike
Yeah, why you got yo mouth open boo?
Close yo mouth
'Cause see, he's feeling me
And I am Not .. Feeling .. You
