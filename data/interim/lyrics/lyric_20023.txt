It's 3 AM and I finally say
I'm sorry for actin' that way
I didn't really mean to make you cry
Oh, baby, sometimes I wonder why
Does it always have to come down to you leavin'
Before I'll say "I love you"?
Why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?
I know I'd never let you walk away
So why do I push you 'til you break?
And why are you always on the verge of goodbye
Before I'll show you how I really feel inside?
Why does it always have to come down to you leavin'
Before I'll say "I love you"?
And why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?
Why do I do that to you?
Why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?
Why do I do that to you?
Why do I do that to you?
