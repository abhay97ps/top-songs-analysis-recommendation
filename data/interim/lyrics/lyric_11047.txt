Two veteran lovers french kiss in the doorway
Their ears are cold but their hearts are so warm
A country band playin' down the street a little ways
They're whiskey wild, they keep it up until dawn
Small Paradise
I glad to see everything's alright with you
Alright then hold me tight and kiss me
Small Paradise
A neon sign blinks outside in the pouring rain
It's ladies night, free drinks until ten
Some people walk on by
"Hey girl, don't I know you? Won't you come on in?"
Well, it ain't love, but it ain't bad
Small Paradise
I glad to see everything's alright with you
Alright then hold me tight and kiss me
Small Paradise
Small Paradise
I glad to see everything's alright with you
Alright then hold me tight and kiss me
Small Paradise
Kiss me
