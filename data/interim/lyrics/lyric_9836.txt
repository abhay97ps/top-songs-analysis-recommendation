Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda
I got broads in Kanata
Seventeen and still believing in Santa
I also believe I'm the best in the game so not everything that I believe is bananas
Smash the keys, piano
Crash the whip like I was Princess Diana
Your girl say she loyal she always be with you but that bitch be lying just like the Savanna
She eat the wood, panda
What was her name was it Hannah?
Ariana, or maybe Susannah
Either way I pop that, French Montana
Black and white, bandana
Chilling with bitches in Louisiana
When I hit record it's like pulling the pin and I'm gonna blow up like I tossed a grenada
I'm too damn clever and you're jealous yeah you're sick of it
I'm on the toilet constipated I don't give a shit
I got broads in Kanata and they all love the way I rhyme
And for the broads in Atlanta I ain't gon' give any time
I'll let Desiigner keep the broads in the east
Cause up in Ottawa you know it's gonna be a feast
Every nights a full moon and I'm turning to a beast
Enter gripping the mic, and leave with haters all deceased
Panda, panda, panda, panda, panda
I got broads in Kanata
Fuck drinking lean I'll just sip on the Fanta
Chilling on the veranda
Eating some steak at the Copacabana
Chilling out in the manor
Bitches around me in see through pajamas
When you trip you fall flat on your face and when I trip I land in the fucking Bahamas
You're acting out, drama
I never stop, I just fuck up the commas
Killed from blunt force, yeah that's trauma
Rule the land like the old Dalai Lama
Reinvent music like Marty McFly
Capture your heart and then I'll make your guy
Pissed off at me have him wondering why
I come in and use all the moves I apply
It's just because when I write I learn about my ability
To get the haters pissed off get them thinking about killing me
Cause I've got broads in Kanata and they all know that I am a killer
And just because my skin is vanilla I can't fill my tracks by saying niiii
I can't say it but I grip an A-K like a hose I spray it
Like Santa Claus I sleigh it
And I'm never gonna stop yeah I never halfway it
If you want success better go my way
Like Ice Cube I know it's gonna be a good day
Snatch your bitch up like birds of prey
I'm dAingerous, about to start a doomsday
Panda, panda, panda, panda, panda
I got broads in Kanata
All by myself I take out an armada
The thing that I got over all competition is I'm understood and I got decent grammar
I ain't gonna listen to clamor
I know that I'll nail it as long as I'm hammered
And every time I get to killing these tracks I just know that I got all the bitches enamoured
I got broads in Kanata and they wear sunscreen cause my shit is too hot
Sweet Home Alabama is the type of music that you gotta get taught
Cause even though your boy might rap
He was raised on a lot of different crap
But I don't listen to scream, don't listen to techno and definitely don't ever listen to trap
Where ya ass was at when all the bitches didn't friend me
Where ya ass was at when all you couldn't comprehend me
I got broads in Kanata and I don't need no autotune
I shoot lightning like Tampa
Call me Doug Glatt on the track I'm a fucking goon
Rap game Call of Duty yeah I snipe it on the track
All the lyrics that I say I swear I'll never take them back
Call me Daniel on the track cause when they hear it they say damn
Josh D I'm a blue jay and I just hit a grand slam
Panda, panda, panda, panda, panda
