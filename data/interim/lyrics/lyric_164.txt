It's the hard knock life but never underestimate me
Err,Let me tell you my story
When I was young I always saw my momma crying
Would go like "Fucks wrong with this bitch?"
My dad be sledgin' me like I'm a fuckin' Aussie on the pitch
Would be the untouched at the weddings and fuckin' odd dinners
Fat kid on the block,not to forget Uni brow midget guy
Now all these girls thinkin' I'm attractive
"Oh he's so attractive"
Tables turn so quick,I never knew
Met this guy,thought he had changed my life but then I woke back into the reality,straight went to fap
Want to be a rapper,I have other plans too
Never was this good,now I'm goin' "Ooh"
Met the love of my life,never mind boo
I'm a failure at school
These motherfuckers just don't get me
I'm almost betrayed every fuckin' day
I Give life to my lifeless soul,for a second I thought I was in Seoul,Damn I'm so bored
Despite the fact I love my girl,but I just don't like her
Everywhere I look it's the same old scenes going past me
I don't want to be a victim of reality
Sucidal thoughts is what hype me
I'm not mainstream,bitch I am the man on this street
Getting heat,3rd quarter still can't get my god damn seat
I get what I desire but still something is missing
Shit,I sound like a fuckin' sissy
I love God but do I love God?
I love God but do I serve god?
You see what I did there?
Killuminati,Eyes closed,Illuminati
I just would love to have fun with somebody
Let's throw some party and get naughty
Then Publish as the best nominee
Shit,I ain't gettin' broad
So,I'mma probably go like "Fuck the world"
Struggled all through my life
At the end of the day it's just who you are and who you choose to be
And you are?
I'm the one who keep makin' it like I'm on some focused shit
All this time,I'm just playing my part.I ain't doing shit
Paul Mitchell for my hair,just so your bitch knows
The reason why I'm fresher than your ho
I keep it gold,Head to toe.Who you trying to buy my boy? I'll never get sold
I'm On that same old motto,your girl just cracked up.The fake Manolo might made her wacked up
I'm just fed up,All this shit got me messed up
Just sick and tired of being sick and tired
Heard you said something,it's okay cuz I was just nut busting
Fuck around I was never trusting on you anyways
3 in the morning,I'm on this lavish Airways
I keep doing it like it's my motherfucking job
Only one who made it out through the dark
Youngin's need inspiration but the G.O.V.T just given' em Asprinations
I never get dictated cuz I'm the Adolf.Sagafillini myself
Fuck that,let's get us some wealth
Smokin' loud,riskin' my health
I'm just depressed
I got people on my back,I'm never gonna tell
Jus' when I thought it felt like I was at the end of the road
My boy O,gave me an antidote
100 was the call,we just made it more
He's the day one guy,keep it real,I ain't fuckin' with any other friend
Stop claimin',You never gonna be famous
Only God can judge me,so stop complainin'
Never thought I could fuck with the fairest girl on the planet,I did it
But ain't no love for you hoes cuz y'll crazy
Just check out my wrist
Take a glimpse of my past,I swear you ain't gettin' it even a lil bit of that
No more tears comin' down through my eyes
No love found,No love lost
100mm Hi Top on my feet,0.45 on my gut
Just so if I ever had to bust a nut
I'm out,Fuck
Dirty sprite in my bladder
Straight out the 3rd world,I'm peaceful
Never pulled a trigger
Climbed the ladder like I'm a rat searchin' for some cheddar
Woke up,Livin' my dream
Livin' better than how your grandpa left it
Sprinkled up,I'm high forever
Others abandoned this,I'm still gonna dig it
This for people like me,who go through shit everyday and still make it
Jus' let em' know,You can't fuck with the God's men cuz then you gotta suffer
And that ain't on,isn't it?
