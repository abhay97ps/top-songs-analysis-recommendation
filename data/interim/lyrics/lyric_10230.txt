I get the same old dream same time every night
Fall to the ground then I wake up
So I get out of bed, put on my shoes and in my head
Thoughts are back to the break-up
These four walls are closing in
Think of the fix you put me in
Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong but since you been gone
You've cast a spell, so break it
Doo doo doo, doodoo doo doo, doodoo doo doo, can't take it
And in the night I stand beneath the back street lights
I read the words that you sent to me
I could take the afternoon but night time comes around too soon
You can't know what you mean to me
Your poison letter, your telegram
They go to show you don't give a damn
Chorus
And if you need me back
Baby I'm here whenever you want
Doo doo doo
Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong but since you been gone
You've cast a spell, so break it
Doo doo doo, doodoo doo doo, doodoo doo doo, doodoo doo doo
Ever since you been gone
Since you been gone
Since you been gone
Doodoo doo doo, doo doo doo
Ever since you been gone
