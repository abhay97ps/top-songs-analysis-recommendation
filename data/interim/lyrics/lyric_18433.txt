Ha, ha, ha 
Don't wanna hurt you 
You think you love me, but you don't really know me
Don't wanna hurt you 
Wanna go ride, not a backseat drive
Ahhhhh, ooh - Ay, ay, ay, I need
Ahhhhh, ohh - Something inside that you can't provide me
I'm feeling the itch again
I need to get tricked again
I'm starting to twitch again
I feel the itch again
I'm starting to twitch again
I need to get tricked again
I'm feeling the itch again
I feel the itch again
I-i-itch, i-i-i-i-itch 
I-i-itch , i-i-i-i-itch
Don't want to hurt you 
You can hug me, but you can't really hold me
What I do, and it's crazy
Don't wanna be cold, but I'm out of control
Ahhhhh, ooh - Ay, ay, ay, that's true
Ahhhhh, ooh - Wish I could, but I can't be good
I'm feeling the itch again
I need to get tricked again
I'm starting to twitch again
I feel the itch again
I'm starting to twitch again
I need to get tricked again
I'm feeling the itch again
I feel the itch
I feel the itch again
I-i-itch, i-i-i-i-itch 
I-i-itch , i-i-i-i-itch
'Cause I want to go down wanna feel my heart pound
Don't you know that I get restless
You can't reach where I need scratching
So feel the itch again
Itch
Itch
Ahhhhh, ooh - Ay, ay, ay, I need
Something inside that you can't provide
I'm feeling the itch again
I need to get tricked again
I'm starting to twitch again
I feel the itch again
I'm starting to twitch again
I need to get tricked again
I'm feeling the itch again
I feel the itch
I'm feeling the itch again
I need to get tricked again
I'm starting to twitch again
I feel the itch again
I'm starting to twitch again
I need to get tricked again
I'm feeling the itch again
I feel the itch
Yeah yeah, I feel the itch again
I-i-itch
