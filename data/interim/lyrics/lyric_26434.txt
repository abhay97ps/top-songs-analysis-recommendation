A 'Bama red 4Runner pulled into the party
With a 30-A sticker on the back windshield
Two-tone tank top slippin' off her shoulder
Kinda girl when she steps out, the world stands still
Ooh, I know where this is goin'
I already know it
She's somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
Shе's somebody's problem and somebody's problеm's
About to be mine
About to be mine
Kinda girl once you've had her, you can't stand to lose her
Kinda girl where your friends tell you don't F it up
Kinda girl that goes from tryin' to just to get her number
To slidin' through the summer to talkin' 'bout love
Ooh, I think I'm likin' where it's goin'
I'd like to try me some of
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine
Oh, hey baby, don't just keep me wishin'
Oh, let me get to fixin'
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine
About to be mine
About to be mine
