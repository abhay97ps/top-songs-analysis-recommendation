You got some treasures, I gotta find 'em
We got some secrets, we gotta hide 'em
Look in your eyes, look like some diamonds
I flood her wrist out 'cause she on my timing
She help me with these feelings I've been fighting
Memories hang on my soul like they biting
I really hope when she tell me, ain't lying
'Cause I really want her love, I've been trying
We gotta last long, we gotta stay strong
Ain't no escaping, you're trapped with my love
Addicted to you, like you are my drug
I put the feelings up in the cup and I hold tight onto my mug
All of these feelings, they passing like tidal waves, yeah, they don't let go 
Had to tell my girl a million times, you look better with no makeup
One in a million, yeah, she's unique
How are you feeling? What do you need?
Feelings revealing, now you can be
Happy forever, happy for me
No matter the weather, I'ma treat you better
If you feeling cold, bae, put on my sweater
She liking my swagger, feel like I'm Mick Jagger
Like Polaroid cameras, these thoughts last forever
Unless you gon' burn 'em and try to forget it
Throw them in the trash, act like you don't see me
Act like you don't need me, like DJ, she's scheming
I don't understand the reasons why she being
The way that she being to me
She turn to a demon at three
Man, these racks, it don't mean shit to me
So you can act like it but it ain't it
Look up your sleeves, you got a couple tricks
Love and drugs, swear there ain't no good mix
Feelings for you, swear they getting intense
Swear I thought I couldn't feel this again
You got some treasures, I gotta find 'em
We got some secrets, we gotta hide 'em
Look in your eyes, look like some diamonds
I flood her wrist out 'cause she on my timing
She help me with these feelings I've been fighting
Memories hang on my soul like they biting
I really hope when she tell me, ain't lying
'Cause I really want her love, I've been trying
I know that I'm falling for you
A fairy-tale in the truth
Left me not knowing what to do
Falling for you, man, I feel like a fool
Back then, I feel like the moon
Back then, I was all in my feelings we're controlling
Like yesterday, I remember the moment
Make my way to your love
No bae, I won't forget you
As you make your way to my heart
When you're not around I feel like I miss you
Hope you're not playing my heart, ain't no system
If you playing me like a game then you're winning
Hoping that the scar making ain't trending
'Cause we ain't done once you doing the same thing
You got some treasures, I gotta find 'em
We got some secrets, we gotta hide 'em
Look in your eyes, look like some diamonds
I flood her wrist out 'cause she on my timing
She help me with these feelings I've been fighting
Memories hang on my soul like they biting
I really hope when she tell me, ain't lying
'Cause I really want her love, I've been trying
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Bae, I been trying
Yeah, it's your love that I've been finding
