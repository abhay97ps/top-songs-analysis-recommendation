Lady love will you be mine
I'd gladly give you all my time
For you I'd build a house by hand
And make it strong so it will stand
A lifetime
A lifetime
Time will make love grow 
Teach us to be free 
Love will overflow 
Through all eternity 
Lady love will you be mine
Let your love forever shine
I'll make all your dreams come true
Multiply your love by two
For a lifetime
A lifetime
Time will make love grow 
Teach us to be free 
Love will overflow 
Through all eternity 
Lady love will you be mine
I'd gladly give you all my time
For you I'd build a house by hand
And make it strong so it will stand
A lifetime
A lifetime
Time will make love grow 
Teach us to be free 
Love will overflow 
Through all eternity 
Time will make love grow 
Teach us to be free
