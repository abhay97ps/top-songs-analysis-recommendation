Turn to the east
Watch for the dawn
The night we loved in
Is now nearly gone
Look, here comes the sun
Look, here comes the sun
So I'll kiss you
We'll count to ten, and then
It'll be time to join the world again
Turn to the sky
Rest your head on the sand
The sun reaches high
And I reach for your hand
Look, here comes the sun
Look, here comes the sun
I wish we could stay, another day
Yes, I say
It'll be time to wish the world away
The night we left was such a short time ago
But it's no good to pretend
Sun is here, and says it's time we must go
I wish it would never end
Whoa no, let it never end
Look, here comes the sun
Look, here comes the sun
So I'll kiss you
We'll count to ten, and then
It'll be time to join the world again
Look, here comes the sun
Look, here comes the sun
Look, here comes the sun
