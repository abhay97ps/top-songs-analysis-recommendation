Na, na, na, na, na
I wanna dance with you
There's no reason why
Why I shouldn't try and try
I like to see you move
It makes me feel so right
I can groove with you all night
Mmm
Feels so perfect just tonight
And I been searching
Searching for a guy
I wonder where you are
Get up now
Give this night a try
Don't be cool
Forget it, baby
Let's do something about it
I just saw the way that you looked
There's no reason to hide it
We can do whatever we want
Why not just get started
Don't be cool
Forget it, baby
You don't have to hide it
I wanna dance with you
There's no reason why
Why I shouldn't try and try
I like to see you move
It makes me feel so right
I can groove with you all night
Mmm, feels so perfect
It's so right
'Cause it's time now
To let our feelings flow
Get up and lose control
Just keep moving
Why not let it show?
Don't be cool
Forget it, baby
Let's do something about it
I just saw the way that you looked
There's no reason to hide it
We can do whatever we want
Why not just get started
Don't be cool
Forget it, baby
You don't have to hide it
I wanna dance with you
There's no reason why
Why I shouldn't try and try
I like to see you move
It makes me feel so right
I can groove with you all night
I wanna dance with you
There's no reason why
Why I shouldn't try and try
I need this groove to move
It makes me feel so right
I can groove with you all night
I wanna dance with you
There's no reason why
Why I shouldn't try and try
I like to see you move
It makes me feel so right
I can groove with you all night
