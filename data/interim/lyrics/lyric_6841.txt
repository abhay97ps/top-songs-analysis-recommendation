Let me know who's hitting the sunshine
Take me to the hiding place
It contains smile in the face
Got to fill my empty bowl
Poppy sitting 
Let me take that smoke 
Gold mine
So hard to find
I can’t seem to find that hidden treasure
I've looked everywhere
Can't remember where
Oh, it is
Gold mine
So hard to find
I can’t seem to find that hidden treasure
I've looked everywhere
Can't remember where
Oh, it is
So I sit and rack my brain
But the answer's still the same
Guess I've hidden it away
Forever
Guess I've hidden it away
Forever
