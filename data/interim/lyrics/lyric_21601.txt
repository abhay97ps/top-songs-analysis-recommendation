G5 plane, yeah, I fly it out
Ass on the back, look like ‘Lac sittin' on 28s
No, you can't get her if you ain't got plenty cake
ATL, Georgia, booties look like this size

Like a freak freak freak, uh
She ride it like a roller coaster
As soon as I get her to the top, she screams
I put her out like a light, she'll be out for the night, as soon as I hit her head hit the pillow, sweet dreams
Wake her up about 30 minutes later, calling me to tell me later, "Let's go again"
Red zone, I'ma get her first down, call me Luda Drew Brees, I throw it in
Touchdown, he scores; Ludacris the MVP
With a rack like that and a back like that, Cici, better see-see me
'Cause them legs just keep on going, so I gotta put her to bed
Let the 808 thump and the beat go bump cause she ride it like a thoroughbred
He love the way I ride it, he love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride it, he love the way I ride the beat
Like a freak freak freak, uh
 oh baby, baby, baby
Do you like it up, when I'm up
When I'm down, when I'm down?
 oh baby, baby, baby
He can't stand to look away while I'm whirlin' this around
 oh baby, baby
You like it, now take it up and down
 oh baby
He love it when I twirl this thing all around
He love the way I ride it, he love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride it, he love the way I ride the beat
Like a freak freak freak, uh
