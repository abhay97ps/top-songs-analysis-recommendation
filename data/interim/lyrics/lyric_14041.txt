Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me
And when I'm all alone
I hear the rain on my window
It's just a little thing
But it means so much to me
Our bodies together
While the rain plays a melody
Every raindrop
Makes me think of you
There is nothing that I'd rather do than
Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me
And when I'm all alone
I hear the rain on my window
When it's stormy outside
It's warm in my heart
With you in my arms
And when you're away from me
I wish it would rain
'Cause it's always the same
Every raindrop
Makes me think of you
There is nothing that I'd rather do than
Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me
And when I'm all alone
I hear the rain on my window
Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me
And when I'm all alone
I hear the rain on my window
Every raindrop
Makes me think of you
There is nothing that I'd rather do than
Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me
And when I'm all alone
I hear the rain on my window
Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me
All alone, I hear the rain
My love, here comes the rain
My love, here comes the rain
My love, here comes the rain
My love, here comes the rain
