Uh
Picture me rolling in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, ain't no need to be friends
I don’t fuck with these niggas, ain't no need to pretend
Ain't no trust in a nigga after this
You said you love me, but you’re leaving me
I guess nothing's what it seem to be
I need some happiness again, this life done beat on me
I caught a flight to ease the pain, I switched the scenery 
Through the pain, know I gotta stay focused
'Cause since a kid, this all I wanted
I heard he feed his problem to the vultures
He couldn't take no more so he exploded
Read the book on murder when she wrote it
We hit the street with heat and we unload it
ATR for life, I run with soldiers
Heard he drive his coupe like he stole it
Pray to God that I can see the morning
I pray to God that I can see the morning, uh
And now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake, I
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Can you hear me, mama? I need you now, answer your phone
It's been too much shit going on, uh
These demons want my soul
Life too short to be living in a lie
It's too much pain to be living just to die
Can't feel my pain 'cause I hid it deep inside
I keep my head to the ribbon in the sky, okay 
Ribbon in the sky
Life too short to be living in a lie
It’s too much pain to be living just to die
I keep my head to the ribbon in the sky
Ribbon in the sky
Ribbon in the sky
Life too short to be living in a lie
It’s too much pain to be living just to die 
Uh, ribbon in the sky, okay
Ribbon in the sky
I keep my head to the ribbon in the sky
Ribbon in the sky
Ribbon in the sky, woah, woah, woah, woah
