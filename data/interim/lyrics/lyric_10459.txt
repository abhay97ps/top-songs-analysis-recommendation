I don't know what words to say
But when I see you I know they'll come
They'll be words that finally say
How much I've needed someone
Just one look and then
I'll hear those sweet words pour on in
I will be in love with you
I'll be in love with you
I don't know how lonesome I have been
I live that way day to day
But I long to ask myself
How did I ever live that way?
Just one smile from you
A million others will not do
I will be in love with you
I'll be in love with you
I don't know how to be soft
I've become hard just to survive
But I long to become gentle
Gentleness brings love alive
Take these two strong hands
Soften them darling understand
I will be in love with you
I'll be in love with you
I will be in love with you
I'll be in love with you
