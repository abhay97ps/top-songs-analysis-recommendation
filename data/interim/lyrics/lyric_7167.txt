I used to look at life
In a shade of gray
Til I found some satisfaction
In the things you say
You took me in your hands
And like a piece of clay
You made me a man, now
I'm proud to say
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I'd wake up in the morning
And I'd wanna cry
'Cause all my needed answers
Were just passing by
My feelings getting stronger
Each and every day
Lord, now that I've got you
All I wanna say
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, come on
Hallelujah
Clap your hands
If you want to
Hallelujah
Want you to sing to me now
Hallelujah, sing
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah.......
