You don't know what you've got until you lose it
You gave me you-your love but I abused it
And now I'm sorry for the things I didn't say
`cause I know now I acted in a foolish way
 uh-huh-huh  oh-oh-yeah
You don't know what you've got until you lose it
You gave me you-your love but I misused it
I never knew how lonely loneliness could be
And now I need you, dear, as you once needed me
 uh-huh-huh  oh-oh-yeah
So now if you'd come to this lonely heart you own
I'd give you all my lovin' like you've never known
You don't know what you've got until you lose it
You gave me you-your love but I misused it
And now I'm sorry for the things I didn't say
`cause I know now I acted in a foolish way
 uh-huh-huh  oh-oh-yeah
 uh-huh-huh  oh-oh-yeah
FADE
 uh-huh-huh
