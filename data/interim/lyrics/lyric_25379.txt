You got me some type of way 
Ain't used to feelin' this way 
I do not know what to say 
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one fuckin' look at your face 
Now I wanna know how you taste 
Usually don't give it away 
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"
Break up with your girlfriend 
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' 
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care 
Break up with your girlfriend 
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
This shit always happen to me 
Why can't we just play for keeps? 
Practically on my knees 
But I know I shouldn't think about it
You know what you're doin' to me
You're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah
Actin' all innocent, please
When I know you out here thinkin' 'bout it
Then you realize she's right there 
And you're at home like, "Damn, she can't compare"
Break up with your girlfriend 
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' 
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care 
Break up with your girlfriend 
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend
With your girlfriend
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend
You could say I'm hatin' if you want to
But I only hate on her 'cause I want you
Say I'm trippin' if you feel like
But you without me ain't right 
You could call me crazy 'cause I want you
And I never even ever fuckin' met you
Say I'm trippin' and it ain't right
But you without me ain't nice 
Break up with your girlfriend 
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' 
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care 
Break up with your girlfriend 
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, baby, girlfriend
With your girlfriend
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend
With your girlfriend
