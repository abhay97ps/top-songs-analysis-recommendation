When I first saw you
You were sunshine
You were a smile
That made rainbows
Sad eyes, let me take you home
Come with me
You'll never have to roam
My house would be your home
You're a real fine lady
I know you know it too
You wanna be with me
And I wanna be with you
So why don't we get together
'Cause who's fooling who
You ain't fooling me
And I ain't fooling you
Give me a chance
And I'll show you, baby
One little chance
Just to hold you
Sad eyes, let me take you home
Come with me
You'll never have to roam
My house would be your home
We'll have a good time, lady
Just you wait and see
I'm gonna fall for you
I hope you're gonna fall for me
And after a night together
I know you will agree
I know you will stay
For eternity
Yeah, you were sunshine
You were a smile
That made rainbows
Sad eyes, let me take you home
Come with me
You'll never have to roam
My house would be your home
You'd never have to roam
Yeah, yeah
Give me a chance
And I'll show you
One little chance
Just to hold you
Sad eyes, let me take you home
Come with me
You'll never have to roam
Sad eyes, sad eyes, we're going home
You were a smile
That made rainbows
When I first saw you
Right then I knew
Sad eyes, oh, sad eyes
Sad eyes, take you home
Sad eyes, let me take you home
Sad eyes, you'll never have to roam
Sad eyes
