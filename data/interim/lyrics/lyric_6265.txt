This all started with me not accepting this and you not accepting it
And here this battle stands
Knowing Born couldn't hang in Michael Jackson hands
The shit I rack pack a Stan, grab your fans, they demanded this war
And after this drop, tubes tied we endin' all chances for Born
For some reason this is highly anticipated and I think it's worst they care
But I won't play with Born
See "worst day care" "won't play with born", this means it's over
Tell your legion there was no meant for saving Born
Now I don' care if you choke, you won't be nothing but history after we through
I promise, my four get  a round faster than you
Nigga one punch straight to the mouth, remove gums
Everybody think the DNA tooth jokes funny, 'til they lose one
Then I catch his bitch at the gym, 'bout to workout get lose some
And snatch that bitch right out the stretch, like Soo-Yung
I been in my own lane since the beginning and I walk through it not ran with nothing to hide
They think you nice, now you gassed, put that toughness aside
You have the aura of when Simba first came, cause Born lyin' and gon' get held up to that pride
That same style all these years, well it's my fault for believing this ho changed here
Your fans are like bad mothers, all the shit they been feedin' Born before he got here gon' be the reason he don't make it
But I'm way too much for you to contend with me
You nice but I'm nice and consistent, see? That's your problem; inconsistency
And since then we clash, big mistake, among a number of things
But I'm who they comin' to see, so let a jackass stunt, I'm fuckin' Nuborn up in the street
Wait it's not Nuborn right? It's Born, bitch it's dead and we watched you die, lots of times
You are history
Instead of droppin' the "Nu" you shoulda flipped it, Unborn fits who you was meant to be
I'ma make this a very uncomfortable spot for you Born and that's something you should know
When the whole world watchin' you Born like The Truman Show
And you should know it don't matter to me I'm loaded, just blast yours too
I'm only lookin' at X'n a body like Bad boys 2
I'm that boy in front of his house with a lot of mag clips
But a cocktail will be like inducing labor, we gon' force born out of that bitch
Nigga your life been gettin' exposed on social media, the shit with Daisey? Look closer Born
Even now, everything that's on the 'gram showin' it wouldn't be hope for Born
All that chokin', but that cord got cut and he here
Complications but still Jo Jackson
Against a nigga that would beat the black off you, I'm the real Joe Jackson
Askin' for shit you ain't build fo', well if you with it then fine
I'ma let shit spinnin', won't be nothing but dust like Remember The Time
And even tho' I came in a spot for you Born, I'm hittin' everybody
Loaded the stock and drop the newborn, then I'm droppin' Nuborn
Then the stock drop like Nuborn
If I woulda took you when you begged for it, I would have trashed you worst
You didn't get the hint Nuborn, I helped you develop
Then reeled you in with the ink you bait  does this make sense Nuborn?
The intent was never to battle you
In order to be a steppin' stone you had to road block the direction I'm going
You are a pebble, tryin' to get us to notice the ripple you left in the ocean we don't see you Born
Like Blue Ivy, two bodies three weeks mark, think smart
Who got niggas tryna keep up with that?
You got hands but need arms, it gets deeper than rap
Now you got a blade pulled out on you, you didn't have nothing you can swing at his cap?
You're a moron...oxy...Ozzy
If I was Born  y'all would have seen him pullin' his teeth out a bat
It's body bag at every battle, make sure your homies found one
But do not jump in that bitch yet, cause this is only round one
Gracie figured it out, and tighten shorts like a draw string
Cause we definitely know what a grudge match on any card bring
But Julian is pussy, he been duckin' me all spring
Battlin' bums for roach clips, chips and a soft drink
Well now the green's on par and this is what they scream for like a golf swing
Glad you accept it cause you was gonna duck 'n disguise like Dark Wing
Shoot at you, It's Not Unusual to let aTom sing
Would let you see hawks  but rather deflate him when the Tom ring
Your bitch get shot, joints poppin' when the arms sling
Sparks thing and manage the boxer like Don King
Nigga I'm weapon clutchin'
Come to Detroit pissed 'n  the center I'll press a drum in 
Get crucified, I bet a arm 'll get in 
Then I'm stretchin' something, if I miss the first shot then J see  the second comin'
You're next to nothing, this what the Braves step through
So what's in store, a stock in J's back like great retros
Bustin' his crib, everything in the place left cold
Tonight Shows, I'll interviews with a blazer like Jay Leno
You all a rave, spot a band then it's on site but they don't play Techno
Kannon how you toy with a mega block when you niggas all fake, let go 
The short changed these bums, watch him claim, "Hell no"
You in the Suicide Squad, I woulda Deadshot the Joker that J let oh 
Get your weight up tho', in this moment you gettin' worst it seems
You done drop tiers  from the Goat like the Jordan meme
URL West killed him in Traffic, even Kannon saw the Steams
This old ratchet cookin' niggas like Paula Deen
Run and point with the Thunder like DJ Augustin
Nigga who hard as me? Don't talk to me
Take cover cause Nuborn drawin' on tiers  like the Carter 3
Now that was fire but I got a harder scheme
Nigga tryna cause a scene
For stickin' around like a Lollipop, I'll let the Milli give the Carter 3
I said pardon me, danger causes a lot of death in the larger scheme
No pay attention Danja cause a Lotta death in a larger scheme
You ain't even a scary Carter, call Writers Bloque, hope they ready and prepared to martyr
Magic, wind up catching Deathly Hollows like Harry Potter
For the Green air rose  in this bitch like Black Canary's partner
Cannon fire, blueprint set
Bald heads about 35, spittin' in his face like Danny Myers
They like, "Damn he fire", I would teach him a lesson and force him to quit
But my pupils too blind to see the damage being corny  gets
You don't want the whole magazine, book for the borders and dip
Keep it real cause fake persons don't fly or land oh  this ain't a Florida trip
Squirt at your Honda, Urkel and Myra
Playin' the accordion hit
Thinkin' he Super Bad, I saw them after Gjonaj he'll get exposed when I draw on this dick
Think Sonic, I blew  through different stages torture 'em quick
Well I said that right? And against Gage you took my shit and flip those bars
So fuck this faggot, how about some Nintendo bars?
See it's not a Game Boy, I got this well in hand
Mario Brothers you on mushrooms tryna 1up me with all the extra man
So me and this wannabe Link in the flesh like a Zelda fan
This bitch wanna roll and it's probably arm cannon
But he never blew  metal for real he ain't Megaman
You nice but there's levels fam', on some real shit
You gettin' killed bitch one round down you got two more to deal with
I've never seen a nigga beg to enter what they know would be a fight for they life
It's your fault we don't wanna hear more rappin'
That's typical Joe Jackson, cryin' 'bout not having rights to the mic 
That hammer will get him to God, that's a meal ticket, deal with it
Even waited in between bushes  to run and off his  shit I'm Bill Clinton
I warned you not to mess with me, now everybody get a mess to see
Even in front of this gran' he  get lifted and taken home with no acceptance speech
Your kids are even in this plot, that means I got a hole for his new son
I'm not tryin' to cut the family tree, but with all these planted seeds I can grow 'em a new one
Nigga you suck, it's been 8 years since I first seen you battle Whoever takes this nigga gets nothing
Not cause he garbage but more so cause Born old
That's Benjamin Button
It's six garbage battles, one good performance then you lose again
You started with Lux on 106 & Park now you beggin' for shots, I don't know what direction you movin' in
But that's why this bullshit don't fly straight
Bring that bullshit 'round my way
I'm out the van grippin', can' kickin' like Lil' Chris on Friday
They don't respect you cause don't do shit
Your notebooks full of dry ink, what blueprint to the blueprints
I'm tryna do more than damage a nerve but I want him panickin' first
They knew from the coin toss, Born lost that's an Amber Alert
But you want my advice? Stop shootin', I'm nukin'
Try stoppin' and bombs, the ratchet ate  Born like Octomom
If I woulda told this thirsty, greedy nigga "no"
He would still be tryna get in cheaper at the door
But just to hear me, they willin' the risk givin' you a feature for the show
See this victor' sweet, even got you eatin' of the flow 
Be honest Born, you can barely pay a phone bill off your deposits Born
They all know 35 cents a day it's more than enough to sponsor Born
But I'm a nigga, it's not smart to bother
One pop'll take care of Born nigga, you are the father
But that's not by Maury's grace, with Graz' Maurie it's a lot different
I tell 'em look at this MAC, then have him slippin' with the Daisy's like the bitch took him back
It can get messy here, like jet repair we air TECs
The shots blew  blood like it didn't hit air yet
This the same nigga that got into it with Sco, then got a blade pulled out on him
Silly nigga, you probably pulled out a PPO so he wouldn't kill the nigga
See where I'm from you can't even wave those
That's like the first scene in Django, even with the paper I will come steal a nigga
You are going against me, there's no place to go for survival
Not one of them gone save you, you won't get a quote from the Bible
You 'll get a reenactment, it'll be right off the coast when I drop 'em
And they'll find Born floatin' like Moses arrival
Shot out to "The Crown 2" got some of the best you see rhymin', and no lie I'm honored to be by 'em
But let's be real the fans you see flyin', they mainly came to see JC-Born like the three wise men
Speakin' of three wise men, for this battle I was thinkin', I need advice
Started to pray to Jesus Christ, so I can send my prayer to Jesus Christ
That's when I realized JC career...Jesus Christ
Remind me of, well you guessed it, Jesus Christ
But let me explain
See it's like JC with the savior, far from the average Joe
Perform spectacular feats wherever his travels go
Gained a huge followin' they saw that he had the glow
Til they went across his back tossed a rock at him almost had him stoned
After that ass whoppin' he saw how his traction slowed
You was crucified for gettin' nailed and not performing when it matters most
Top ten classics no, being a victim applies
God has forsaken you, I know that stick in your side
You're top tier? Yeah with a crown of thorns, you live it inside
My second Testament to how from day one you was on a mission to die
You mentioning I? You tryna come and play me?
Nigga please, my name is Joseph I've been sonnin' JC
Brought out the Arsonal, don't fuckin' make me
You'll get the real  Duel In The Desert like battlin' Rum in AZ
You can't upstage me, nigga we the same height
You'll get a tombstone, the wrestle move to the Undertaker, it'll be a grave site
Fuck Julian, I stuck the toolie in
I don't play fight
It starts rainin', men get blasted in the club like gay night
You'll get a buck 50, this chump change payin' the same price
Wesley Snipes you vamp I get a Blade swipe
Pure evil, you chick a get flayed twice or get the butterfly in your stomach like stage fright
Them death threats you make, light
The block's a Monopoly were the pieces on board
Whoever roll die like it's game night
Y'all ain't nice, I mean Danja barely got off nigga
Oops and Danny I torch figures, the rest scared
I ain't tryna force niggas
Now I'm killin' you, shit I'm running through the Bloque like a lost nigga
I say, you're an actual soft nigga fuckin' actor
Would he be with the Tommy? No they ain't Natural Born Killers
Nothing 'bout you says "hardcore" nigga, I ain't feelin' it dawg
Always got the steel in a bar  like the John John nigga
Run in his house, we go hardcore nigga
If I see you I'm dumpin' some on this nigga
If I see you, I see  food
So what I'm dumpin' in your Long John, Silver
Go head, act hard nigga
I run to your spot, hammers and clips load
I hope you plannin' to get low
Out the gate I'll raid  with the juice to buck it over his head like the championship coach
You landed a schizo, can he last so 
I knew this cat'll get tied up
It's even more chances to get roped
If it's war what's the hold-up for?
Like bro' man from the 5th floor
Kannon it wasn't luck how you did your man in to get 
The damage is did tho', I ain't feelin' this bout
My name is still in his mouth, so it's still in your mouth, and it's still in your mouth
See JC I sound like you with that stuttering shit, I said my name is still in your mouth so it's steel in your mouth, and it's stealin' your mouth
You ain't figured it out? You can't compete with this
Nigga you know my slogan, eat a dick
You've wanted this clash forever, well I'm glad that you found me
My rounds be like faces of death, I be trashin' 'em proudly
They all yellin' that shit "look at him you can't even tell he that sick"
Gotta be something magic about me
See we on the same feel but you don't even get mentioned
It's the water boy versus a nigga who got it out the mud dog it's a big difference
But you, I be the first to say it
You punch good but you write simple, the words are basic
I be in the crib fuckin' shit up with the machine, like Urkel made it
Flippin' bodies out the chamber like Urkel basement
You been warned about me, don't mess with it
Gjonaj broke religion down in front of you, the whole lesson is
Joseph would never son JC; that's old testament
But I am a God in this and you are testing a professional
Gettin' boxed by the God for talkin' like a confessional
When dreams turn into nightmares, just so you know the shit on the flyer real
After all that and you can't get a win on a Writer still
Niggas say my name and they want to convince y'all I need the relevance
Well free Boom, I say that cause I cooked Ah Di with the pen too
But Ah Di in the pen and mentioning who Ah Di gave is pen to would be irrelevant
Mentioned or not, I'm the shit regardless
Me and you, different marksman
That last shot didn't even need a name, I guarantee you it hit the target
That's cause I paint pictures
On the polls niggas get boxed with the head shot, I'm wanted for that
But my setups can be explained like snuffin' DNA, but I'll let y'all punch in the gap
Born I'm not around to play, every nigga I know, armed with Ks
And down to shoot like it's laundry day
James Earl Ray, they know I kill King
Don't slip, or Born next to get aired  no prince
With them convincing you this was next to see, you should be mad at the set
Cause what started as a double dare got your career in Jeopardy, You could be Alex Trebek
But you clueless, now they all gotta watch as I bring 'em a black coffin
For all that rap talkin'
One Rose, the ratchet get drawn, I'm Jack Dawson
Why you think my pen ranked where it is? That's cause these souls get moved watching
I'm mood rockin', I hit a target faster than a back to school shopper
And just when they thought they seen it all, they more about to show
And my rifle aim is Bible plague, first Born gotta go
Like quitin' an addiction cold turkey, I dropped the crack with no help
My title solidified I've never slacked so I don't ask for no belt
But sittin' in groups to write a battle, you supposed to write by yourself
I mean do them blogs with your team, but not one nigga in them skits a friend of ya 
You meant to  fight for yourself
Born after 5 fuckin' years it is over with
Overdose from the dopest pen and they know I wrote this shit
Cause every battle turns into a eulogy, my condolences
It's crunch time, so I'ma do what I do best, punchlines
It's about time we collided for the cred', I've been called you out but you was countin' on the bread
Well as long as I make over a band it's  cool, everybody I wanted post to  have a bounty on his head
Whoever doubtin' me is dead so why gamble? I can see no  need
Thinkin' it's all goodie, mob  on him and get a nigga address  like Cee-Lo Green
I'll knock you all the fuck out by myself, I don't need no team
The next day they  applyin' Ice cubes, I'm Debo mean
The Nina I tuck her  it gets Smokey when I squeeze off steam
Bitch nigga the hit gon' squeeze, Iphone message
Picture TECs  I got for this emo' G 
You need your team, cause you haven't gettin' face since
Watch the Bloque tryna fit in the game like Tetris
Why do you exist? Head for the exits
It's a over for you Bloque busters  I can tell from the net flicks 
Go head, set trip, I grab the Glock and pull it
Him and Chilla talkin' like they on the block with bullets
I don't wanna hear you talkin' about the block and bullets
We all know what happened with the Bloque and Bulletz
Well it's the rematch and y'all both blockin' bullets
Stop the bullshit, Brixx got Danny dropped and ousted
Bulletz washed you and Chilla, your stock is drownin'
Even Mike P killed Oops, we got to count it
All these bodies think about it, Yellow Tapes got the Bloque surrounded
You're grounded, you niggas don't worry me
Yellow Tape is around, it's a guaranteed murder scene
Gut punch, leave you lyin' where you stand like perjury
This ain't somethin' you can bypass, emergency
Change of heart, these hands wash him in the Glove like surgery
Nigga stay in your lane, don't merge with me
Try to pull off, I leak with  metal like Mercury
Bar after bar after bar, that's Bourbon Street
But still work the streets, I'm Anchorman with a Brick on the side that's Ron Burgundy
I was baptized to be Born again, word to me
Now I'm covered in the blood of JC, with a box of tithes offerin'
I gotta pay the churches fees
I make a phone call, niggas flyin' with urgency
Let the pilot talk, it's either Nu or lean  a rapper for the Curren$y
Currently me letting you live is a courtesy
 in a Tahoe, drums watin' with a Bongo
You would have dozen niggas we sprayin' 'em pronto
Take five to get scratched off, we ain't playin' the lotto
I'll aim the cannon at a rapper
The mil will be runnin' right through the Six nigga like Drake in Toronto
Touch base with your council I'm sending the worst at you
Either get lower back in your tramp stamp that's a girl tattoo
If J see this I pull a 12  you heard Matthew
Picture the ratchet butt in your face like a hoe tryna thirst strap you
This hearse past due, you 'bout to reach cremation
Everything I earn  ash like a Surf battle
Let me revamp it, even when you locked up word travels
I'll bring the war then  to your cell birds clap you
Basically you still get a Boom behind the pen like a Surf battle
I bet Surf mad too, the nigga the worst
Free my nigga Ah Di, cause when it comes to writin', we know you  are  in the middle of "Surf"
The pistol will squirt, wait I didn't mention you dancin' yet
No worry dude I'm damn impressed
Seriously I don't see nothing wrong
Any nigga that cut a rug like that I'm sure is in the trap cuttin' raw
I mean how could you not believe he let his hammer peel
Judgin' by the pop lockin' and them dancin' skill, shit I'm a fan for real
I know you log in hours on Dance Dance Revolution after you let your iron off
Cause besides being a pure gangsta, I know you got the highest scores
NO, not even in the final four?
Nigga you at least top ten, if he say he not he lyin' y'all
But fuck it don't boo the  God cause I come and lighten  y'all
That's your girl? Well you's get your princess cut like a diamond store
He lyin' hard, this your Empire? Stop, I take out the entire Bloque
If you don't dip low, 'matics  is poppin' Jones off Cam' since we know him and J are  Writer's Bloque
I'm here to retire spots, so face it still or face the steel
The love is love but the hate is real
