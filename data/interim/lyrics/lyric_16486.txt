Hey, little mama
Why you dance so funky?
Yeah, it's that funky
It's that funky Y-2-C
Hey, little mama
Why you dance so funky?
Get on the floor and shake it like a donkey
Shake it to the left
Shake it to the right
Do the funky dance
And shake it all night
Shake the butt
Now you know you going on
Now look at me and shake that big butt
Just do it baby
Jump up and down
Break down to the ground
Yeah it's Big Boy once again
Make that butt go out and in
Now do that funky dance in place
You look so funky
I want to say
Hey, little mama
Why you dance so funky?
Yeah, it's that funky
It's that funky Y-2-C
Funky, funky
Yeah, that's me
I'm dance funky to the beat
I really want the crowd to say
Shakie and shake
That's what I'm doing
Got all them boys over there just oohing
Just because I'm young not old
I bet you think that I ain't bold
Bold enough to show this butt
But you know you got me messed up
I am young
But I have learned
I can do the funky dance all night
Let me show you a little something
Don't you know they call me Tamara?
Feast your eyes on this funky butt
While all them boys out there say what?
Hey, little mama
Why you dance so funky?
Yeah, it's that funky
It's that funky Y-2-C
