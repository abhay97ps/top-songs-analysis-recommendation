The childhood part of my life
It wasn't very pretty
You see, I was born and raised
In the slums of the city
It was a one room shack that slept
Ten other children beside me
We hardly had enough food
Or room to sleep
It was hard times
Needed something to ease
My troubled mind
Mmm, listen
My father didn't know
The meaning of work
He disrespected Mama
And treated us like dirt
I left home seeking a job
That I never did find
Depressed and downhearted
I took to Cloud Nine
I'm doing fine
Up here, on Cloud Nine
Listen, one more time
I'm doing fine
Up here, on Cloud Nine
Folks down there tell me
They say, "Give yourself a chance, son
Don't let life pass you by
But the world of reality is a rat race
Where only the strongest survive
It's a dog-eat-dog world
And that ain't no lie
Listen, it ain't even safe no more
To walk the streets at night"
I'm doing fine on Cloud Nine
Let me tell you about Cloud Nine
You can be what you wanna be
You ain't got no responsibility
And every man, every man is free
And you're a million miles from reality
 I wanna sail upper, higher
Upper, up, up, and away
Cloud Nine
I wanna say I love the life I live
And I'm gonna live the life I love
Up here on Cloud Nine
I-I-I-I-I, I'm riding high
You're as free as a bird in flight
There's no difference between day and night
It's a world of love and harmony
You're a million miles from reality
 I wanna sail upper, higher
Upper, up, up, and away
You can be what you wanna be
You ain't got no responsibility
Every man in his mind is free
You're a million miles from reality
You can be what you wanna be
