You remind me I live in a shell
Safe from the past
And doin' okay
But not very well
No jolts, no surprises
No crisis arises:
My life goes along as it should
It's all very nice
But not very good
And I'm ready to take a chance again
Ready to put my love on the line with you
Been livin' with nothin' to show for it;
You get what you get when you go for it
And I'm ready to take a chance again with you
When she left me in all my despair
I just held on
My hopes were all gone
Then I found you there
And I'm ready to take a chance again
Ready to put my love on the line with you
Been livin' with nothin' to show for it;
You get what you get when you go for it
And I'm ready to take a chance again
Ready to take a chance again with you
With you
