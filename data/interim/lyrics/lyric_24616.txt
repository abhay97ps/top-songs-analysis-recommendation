Hear a lotta hatin' like I'm Horton 
Walk in and my neck got the pointers 
Fuck your bitch only if she got appointment 
Appointment, appointment 
Want it, point it

Nowadays, I think a lot of you
But I really don't wanna bow to you 
I put that dick right inside of you 
Not talkin' Twitter, I follow you
I fuck that girl just like a prostitute 
I cannot lie, girl, I'm lovin' you 
I wish that it was more than one of you
So I can just, um, make a pile of you
Let me tell you 'bout the struggle
Let me tell you 'bout the pain, yeah 
Used to watch shit right in doubles
And I still feel the rain, yeah
Ooh, know what? We don't feel the pain, yeah 
Go to the club, make it rain, yeah 
Rain, rain, go to the club, make it rain
You get wet up like a sink
All of my diamonds, they pink
Jump in the 'Rari, switch lanes
Jump in the 'Rari, switch lanes
Boy, I can do my dash 
Watch me, I won't crash
Better keep up yeah, that's a foreign , hit your girl with endurance 
She like, "I'm okay , 'cause I got insurance" 
Your number, won't store it , call me, I ignore it
