When you asked how I've been here without you
I like to say "I've been fine" and I do
But we both know the truth is hard to come by
And if I told the truth, that's not quite true
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone
Sometimes the cold winds blows a chill in my bones
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Now the face that I see in my mirror
More and more is a stranger to me
More and more I can see there's a danger
In becoming what I never thought I'd be
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone
Sometimes the cold winds blows a chill in my bones
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone
Sometimes the cold winds blows a chill in my bones
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone
