How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many, how many, I wonder
But I really don't want to know
How many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
How many, how many, I wonder
But I really don't want to know
So always make me wonder
And always make me guess
And even if I ask you
Darling, don't confess
Just let it remain your secret
But, darling, I love you so
How many, oh, how many, I wonder
But I really don't want to know
