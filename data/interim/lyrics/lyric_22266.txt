And I finally asked you to dance on the last slow song
Beneath that moon that was really a disco ball
I can still feel my head on your shoulder
And hoping that song would never be over
I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be 18
And beautiful, and dancin' away with my heart
I brushed your curls back so I could see your eyes
And the way you moved me was like you were reading my mind
I can still feel you lean in to kiss me
I can't help but wonder if you ever miss me
I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be 18
And beautiful, and dancin' away with my heart
You headed off to college
At the end of that summer and we lost touch
I guess I didn't realize even at that moment we lost so much
I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be 18
And beautiful, and dancin' away with my heart
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Away with my Heart
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
