Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm

Easy driver, she's a wicked rider
She's smooth and she's skinny
And she's probably mean
Easy driver, pull up beside her
Roll down the window on this fine machine
 don't turn away
 just give me a sign
 don't be afraid
 love is so hard to find
Easy driver, get on up beside her
She don't drive like she knows the way
Easy driver, road's getting wider
There's room to run and she might skate away
Come on back, baby, what you say
 don't turn away
 just give me a sign
 don't be afraid
 love is so hard to find
One lane away from love
The story of my life
Could I be good enough
For your lonely avenue tonight
It's a lonely avenue tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh
 oh, oh, oh, oh
 oh, oh, oh, oh
 oh, oh, oh, oh
 oh, oh, oh, oh
 don't turn away
 just give me a sign
 don't be afraid
 love is so hard to find
Easy driver, she's a wicked rider
She's smooth and she's skinny
And she's probably mean
Easy driver, get on up beside her
Roll down the window on this fine machine
Easy driver, oh oh oh oh
Easy driver, easy driver, easy driver 
Easy driver, easy driver, easy driver, easy driver
