I just can't understand how you could hurt me so
Then turn and walk away, pretending you don't know
Each time I see you out with someone new
I go out of my mind over you
I go out of my mind when you're out of my heart
I can't help lovin' you like I do
My heart breaks up inside with each tear that I cry
And I'm out of my mind over you
Each day I think of all the things we used to do
And all the plans we made that won't be comin' true
It seems that all my dreams are fallin' through
And I'm out of my mind over you
I go out of my mind when you're out of my heart
I can't help lovin' you like I do
My heart breaks up inside with each tear that I cry
And I'm out of my mind over you
