Look in my eyes
And tell me you love, love, love me
Tell me you love, love me
Or darling I'll be gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Look in my eyes
And tell me that you're the one for me
And that our love will always be
Or darling I'll be gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
You still got time so make up your mind
What's it to be? Do you want me?
I don't need much, only your touch
Come and love me please or darling set me free
Look in my eyes
And tell me you love, love me
Tell me you want me
Or darling I'll be gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
