Wagon train of lovin' moving slow
And I can see the peace pipe burning low
You criticize each little thing I do
But listen baby, I've got news for you
There's too many chiefs and not enough Indians around this house
Baby I'm tired of this old game we play called cat and mouse
If you don't give just a little bit more
We're both gonna lose this race
'Cause there's too many chiefs and not enough Indians around this place
Trouble on our happy hunting ground
'Cause you keep stepping too far out of bounds
It's hard to run this reservation right
When you stay on the warpath day and night
Well there's too many chiefs and not enough Indians around this house
Baby I'm tired of this old game we play called cat and mouse
If you don't give just a little bit more
We're both gonna lose this race
'Cause there's too many cheifs and not enough Indians around this place
Look at all the things I have to do
To keep this teepee running just for you
Well time's are tough and wampum's hard to save
Just remember who's the squaw and who's the brave
Well there's too many cheifs and not enough Indians around this house
Baby I'm tired of playing this old game called cat and mouse
If you don't give just a little bit more
We're both gonna lose this race
'Cause there's too many cheifs and not enough Indians around this place
