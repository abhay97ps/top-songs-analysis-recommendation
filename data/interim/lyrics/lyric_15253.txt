Only a fool believes
It's better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all
So I don't wanna take that fall
It's a long long long way down
I'm hurt
Love struck me down again
Enticed me in and pulled the pin
Blew my tender heart sky high
Now in my pain I'm asking why
As I'm crying
Should I give it my last try
Or say goodbye
Love is a killer
A homicidal fiend
Love is a killer
It'll be the death of me
I got a target on my back
For a cupid dressed in black
Love is a killer
It's killing me
Love so sweetly beckoning
I've seen your face
Called your name
I tasted tears you cried
Lived in shadows in my mind
Frozen here in time
Don't leave me here to die
Love is a killer
A homicidal fiend
Love is a killer
It'll be the death of me
I've got a target on my back
For a cupid dressed in black
Love is a killer
It's killing me
You fascinate and yet frustrate
Demand so much of me, yeah
I've had enough
It's tearing me up inside
Cross my heart, hope to survive
You got a smoking gun
Well don't shoot my love, no!
You're a killer
A homicidal fiend
Love is a killer
It'll be the death of me
I've got a target on my back
For a cupid dressed in black
Love is a killer
Love is a killer, no
Love is a killer, no, no
I got a target on my back
For a cupid dressed in black
Love is a killer
It's killing me
