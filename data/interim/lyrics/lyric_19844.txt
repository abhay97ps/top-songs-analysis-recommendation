Shh
Don't say a word, just come over here
I got somethin' I gotta do tonight, listen
Ain't never been a man wantin' anything as much as I want you
The sun don't come up 'til morning so tonight there's no excuse 
Just like the rain outside, I'll make your love come down
So, baby, now it's time
Just can't wait no more
I'm gon' give you what your body's been cryin' for
And if you tell me yes, I'll lay you down
Girl, we ain't gotta rush, let's play around
We'll do it like we never done before
So go and lock that door
Baby, don't worry 'cause I'll be gentle
Come on, baby, turn the lights off, let's get naked 
Come on, baby girl, you know I just can't take it 
Let your panties hit the floor
Let your body steal the show right now
It seems like you're ready
So come on, girl, I just can't wait to see us naked
Us naked, yeah
I know you want this, girl, I see it in your eyes
Don't be ashamed of what you got between those thighs, oh
You know I'm gon' try not to be so excited 
It feels so good to be invited
So, baby, get ready 'cause here I go 
Ooh, ooh
So take off your shoes, I wanna see your toes
Slip off that skirt and that shirt's gotta go
Come out them drawers, girl, you won't be needin' those 
Now you're wearing what I like, baby, let's go
Come on
Come on, baby, turn the lights off, let's get naked 
Come on, baby girl, you know I just can't take it 
Let your panties hit the floor
Let your body steal the show right now 
It seems like you're ready
So come on, girl, I just can't wait to see us naked
Us naked, yeah

Your clothes dont do you justice, so come out of them
So baby take it off, so I can break you off
And give you love, love, love
