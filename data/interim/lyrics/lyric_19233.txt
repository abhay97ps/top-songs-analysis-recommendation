Now, baby, pull the covers back over my head
I don't want to get it up outta this bed
I don't wanna drag it on off to work
That big boss man is really a flirt
We've been lovin' all night
Just about settin' me everything right
Hope it don't get me
I'm gonna live it just as long as I can
I'm gonna make it every part of my plan
Lovin' all night, hangin' on tight
No doubt about it, been lovin' all night
Well, you tell me I'm as pretty as a fresh cut flower
When you show me how you love me in the wee small hours
While everybody's sleeping on around this town
Lovin' all night makes the world go 'round
We've been lovin' all night
Just about hittin' me everything right
Hope it don't get me
I'm gonna live it just as long as I can
I'm gonna make it every part of my plan
Lovin' all night, hangin' on tight
No doubt about it, been lovin' all night
Ain't no use talkin' when you're looking so fine;
When you move your body up a-close to mine
We've been rocking with the rhythm of a beat of our own
Baby, I'm gonna love you 'till the cows come home
We've been lovin' all night
Just about hittin' me everything right
Hope it don't get me
I'm gonna live it just as long as I can
I'm gonna make it every part of my plan
Lovin' all night, feelin' all right
No doubt about it, been lovin' all night
We've been lovin' all night, hangin on tight
Good God almighty, been loving all night, yeah
Mmmmm, been lovin' all night
Been lovin' all night
Lovin' all night, yeah
Lovin' all night
Been lovin' all night
Memmmm. hey, ahh been lovin' all night
