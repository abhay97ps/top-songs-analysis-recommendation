She's fine, so fine
And I think I'm gonna lose my mind
So high, so high
You know you make me wanna
Scream and shout
Yeah
Well, you know I'm like a fool
Who's just got to have a reason
You know that I've found mine
Must have been crazy
Must have been crazy, yeah
Must have been crazy
To have done this so long
This time, it's time
Every singer's got to sing his song
So fine, it's fine
You know you make me want to
Sing along
Oh oh yeah
'Cause you know I'm not a fool
Got to have a piece of Heaven
You know that I've found mine
Must have been crazy
Must have been crazy, yeah
Must have been crazy
To have done this so long
'Cause you know I'm not a fool
Got to find a piece of Heaven
You know that I've found mine
Must have been crazy 
Must have been crazy, yeah
Must have been crazy 
To have done this so long 
Must have been crazy 
Must have been crazy, yeah
Must have been crazy 
To have done this so long 
Must have been crazy 
Must have been crazy, yeah
Must have been crazy 
To have done this so long
