It's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you
Well I know this little chapel
On the boulevard we can go
No one will know
Oh, come on, girl
Who cares if we're trashed
Got a pocket full of cash
We can blow
Shots of Patr√≥n
And it's on, girl
Don't say no, no, no, no-no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go-go
If you're ready, like I'm ready
'Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby
I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you
Oh, I'll go get a ring
Let the choir bells sing
Like oooh...
So what you wanna do?
Let's just run, girl
If we wake up
And we wanna break up
That's cool
No, I won't blame you
It was fun, girl
Don't say no, no, no, no-no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go-go
If you're ready, like I'm ready
'Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you
Just say I do
Tell me right now baby
Tell me right now baby
Just say I do
Tell me right now baby
Tell me right now baby, oh!
'Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you
