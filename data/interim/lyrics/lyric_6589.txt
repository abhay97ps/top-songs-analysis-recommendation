See the light
See the light
See the light
Of my life
Light of my life
Gets brighter day by day
The light of my life
Grows strong in every way
And when she’s by my side
It’s really 
Time or place or weather
See the light
See the light
See the light
Of my life
The light of my life
Is brighter than the spring
The light of my life
She makes me want to sing
Compare her to the fire
And it’s just really higher
You’ll see that what you see
Is so magnificent
See the light
See the light
See the light
Of my life
Now she’s giving herself to me
It’s only right now that you do the same
And if I treat her I’ll play the game
Nobody but me will have to take the blame
But I accept  she may seem
People that don’t know what happened 
Wait til the time comes for you to fall
And open the door
You’ll see the light
See the light
See the light
Of my life
See the light
See the light 
See the light 
See the light
