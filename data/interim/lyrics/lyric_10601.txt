When it hurts too bad
You got to let go
Can't let him know that
He's really gotten to ya
And it hurts so bad
When you're all alone
Those old memories
Keep goin' through ya
And you wanna act nonchalant
But you can't
'Cause he keeps on haunting you
And when it hurts so bad
Gotta try and pretend
He's just a casual friend
Who never meant a thing to ya
Well you can fool your friends
And you can laugh a lot
It's all a cover up
Of what he really means to ya
And you try and act nonchalant
But you can't
'Cause he keeps on haunting you
Yes, and it hurts so bad
Oh, how can it hurt this bad
When it was never planned
But you stole my heart
And here I am
I'm possessed by you
I'm obsessed with you
What I tryin' to say
Is I love you
Now how can I act nonchalant
When all I want is
To spend the night with you
Oh, when it hurts this bad
You got to let go
Can't let him know that
He's really gotten to ya
And it hurts so bad
When you're all alone
Those old memories
Keep goin' through ya
And it hurts so bad
Oh, I know it hurts so bad
Whoa, it hurts so bad
It hurts so bad
I know it hurts so bad
It hurts so bad
