When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break's started
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me
B-Rocka, uh, Darkchild, we back, ha-ha
You'll be right here with me
You'll be right here with me
When your life is goin' too fast
Off the train tracks
I can slow it down
Just when you think you're 'bout to turn back
Scared you might crash
I'll be your ground
When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break's started
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me
When your tears are dry from cryin'
And the world has turned silent
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me
I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me, yeah
When you're trapped and there's just no key 
And you can't breathe, I'll breathe for you
The fire's got you down on both knees
And the walls are closin' in, but I'll be breakin' through
And when you feel alone, I'ma be your home
When others come and go, you know I got you
When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break's started 
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me 
When your tears are dry from cryin' 
And the world has turned silent 
When the clouds have all departed 
You'll be right here with me
I will be here right beside you
Every step you take, yeah
I will be your strength, your shelter
Shield you from the rain
When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break's started
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me 
When your tears are dry from cryin' 
And the world has turned silent 
When the clouds have all departed 
You'll be right here with me 
When you feel your heart's guarded 
And you see the break's started 
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me
When your tears are dry from cryin'
And the world has turned silent 
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me 
I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me, yeah
