Night falls on the city, baby feels the beat
Slick and sexy angel of the street
The queen of all the night birds watch her when she walks
She don't say nothing but, baby makes her blue jeans talk
Baby makes her blue jeans, yes she makes her blue jeans talk
Baby makes her blue jeans, yes she makes her blue jeans talk
You know what she's thinking about and it turns you inside out
She don't say nothing but, baby makes her blue jeans talk
Night time in the city, magic in the air
The action starts at midnight, she'll be there
The queen of all the night birds, a player in the dark
She don't say nothing but, baby makes her blue jeans talk
Baby makes her blue jeans, yes she makes her blue jeans talk
Baby makes her blue jeans, yes she makes her blue jeans talk
You know what she's thinking about and it turns you inside out
She don't say nothing but, baby makes her blue jeans talk
Baby makes her blue jeans, yes she makes her blue jeans talk
Baby makes her blue jeans, yes she makes her blue jeans talk
You know what she's thinking about and it turns you inside out
She don't say nothing but, baby makes her blue jeans talk
She don't say nothing but, baby makes her blue jeans talk
She won't say nothing
She don't say nothing
