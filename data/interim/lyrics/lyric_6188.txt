Such a silly, silly
Silly, silly fool am I
Oh, I'm just a silly, silly
Silly, silly fool am I
Hey, I should have never fallen
Back in love with you
Knowin' how you get a pleasure
Breakin' my poor heart in two
You made it sound so convincin'
When you said, "I'm your woman, you're my man"
Now I really need you
And I sit here a loser again
I guess I'm just a silly, silly
Silly, silly fool am I
Oh, I, I'm such a silly, silly
Silly, silly, fool am I
I should have never trusted
In my heart to lead the way
Now my mind is all busted
That's a fool's price to pay
You made it sound so convincin'
When you said, "You'd never, never go away"
I should have never listened
To anything you had to say
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly
Silly, silly fool am I
Yes, I am, I'm such a silly, silly
Silly, silly fool am I, oh
Such a silly, silly, dilly
Silly, dilly fool am I
Oh, yeah, I'm such a silly, silly, silly
Silly, silly fool am I
Oh, yes, I am, I'm such a silly, silly, dilly
Silly, dilly, silly fool am I, oh yeah
I'm such a silly, dilly, silly, dilly
Silly fool am I, oh
Silly, dilly, silly, dilly, silly
