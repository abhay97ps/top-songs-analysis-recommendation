I'm clumsy
Yeah my head's a mess, cause you got me
Growing taller everyday
We're giants in a little man's world
My heart is pumping up so big that it could burst
I'm trying so hard not to let it show
But you got me feeling like
I'm stepping on buildings, cars, and boats
I swear I could touch the sky
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall
I'll be careful, so don't be afraid
You're safe here, no these arms won't let you break
I put up a sign in the clouds
So they all know that we ain't ever coming down
I'm trying so hard not to let it show
But you got me feeling like
I'm stepping on buildings, cars, and boats
I swear I could touch the sky
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall
You build me up
Make me what I never was
You build me up
From nothing into something
Yeah something from the dust
I'm trying so hard not to let it show
But you got me feeling like
I'm stepping on buildings, cars, and boats
I swear I could touch the sky
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall
