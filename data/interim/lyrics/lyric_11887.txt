There ain't no good in our goodbyein'
True love takes a lot of tryin'
Ohh, I'm cryin'
Let's hang on to what we've got
Don't let go girl we got a lot
Got a lotta love between us
Hang on
Hang on
Hang on
To what we've got
You say you're gonna go call it quits
Gonna chuck it all and break our love to bits
Break it up 
Break it up 
That little chip of diamond on your hand
Ain't a fortune baby but you know it stands
For the love 
Such a love 
Baby 
Baby 
Think it over and stay
Let's hang on to what we've got
Don't let go girl we got a lot
Got a lotta love between us
Hang on
Hang on
Hang on
To what we've got
There isn't anything I wouldn't do
I'd pay any price to get in good with you
Patch it up 
Patch it up 
You've got me cryin' dyin' at your door
Don't shut me out
Ooh let me in once more
Open up 
Open up 
Baby 
Baby 
Think it over and stay
Let's hang on to what we've got
Don't let go girl we got a lot
Got a lotta love between us
Hang on
Hang on
Hang on
To what we've got
