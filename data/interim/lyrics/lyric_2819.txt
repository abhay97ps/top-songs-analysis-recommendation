Your conscience has got a hold on you, uh huh huh

Things that caused me pain, uh huh huh
Things you can't explain
Ain't it the truth now, baby

You got a painful look that's in your eyes, yeah yeah yeah 'cause
You remember when, uh huh huh
I said 'You want me back again'
Ain't it the truth now, baby
Ain't it the truth now, baby
Oh oh oh I know you need my love

When it ain't around
Now you think that you will get me back, uh huh huh
But don't you bet your life on that, no no no 'cause
You did me wrong before, uh huh huh
