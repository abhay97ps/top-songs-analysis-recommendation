Tonight, we're all alone tonight
There's never been a moment
That trembled like tonight
I read your eyes tonight
I see a love I've always known from another time
That once again is mine, I need to know
Are you real?
Do you feel the way I feel?
Could you love, like I love you?
Say you can and say you do
Say you'll stay, by my side
Say it's more than just tonight
Say our love, would never let you walk away 
Say you'll stay, say you're sure
Say my heart was made for yours
Let our love, lead the way
Say you'll stay 
Tonight, I've waited for tonight
I've waited all my life to be here where we are
With you here in my arms
I can't believe, how you shine
Is this moment really mine?
Could you love, like I love you?
Say you can and say you do
Say you'll stay, by my side
Say it's more than just tonight
Say our love, would never let you walk away 
Say you'll stay, say you're sure
Say my heart was made for yours
Let our love, lead the way
Say you'll stay 
Say you'll stay
Forever in my arms
And whenever tears are falling
Girl, I'll kiss them all away
So if you wanna be my lady, say you'll stay
Say you'll stay, by my side
Say it's more than just tonight
Say our love, would never let you walk away 
Say you'll stay, say you're sure
Say my heart was made for yours
Let our love, lead the way
Say you'll stay
