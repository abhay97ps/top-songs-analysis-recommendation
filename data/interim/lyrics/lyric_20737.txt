Born Helena Jane
With a restless soul
She moved west to California
Became a centerfold
But once you change your name
Well the pieces fall
Now she hardly recognizes, her
Herself at all
And there's never any rain
When you want it
A hollow little game
And you've won it
Looking for a thrill
But you've done it all
So long
Put your blue jeans back on, girl
Go home
Remember, Hollywood's not America
So long
Put your blue jeans back on, girl
Go home
Remember, Hollywood's not America
Oh yeah
And everybody here's
From somewhere else
You can make a million dollars
Well, you might lose yourself
And you can take the heat
Will your heart grow cold?
They say acting's just pretending, and
But even that gets old
And there's never any rain
When you want it
A hollow little game
And you've won it
Looking for a thrill
But you've done it all
So long
Put your blue jeans back on, girl
Go home
Remember, Hollywood's not America
So long
Put your blue jeans back on, girl
Go home
Remember, Hollywood's not America
And I know 
What you're doing 
I know that you
You can be anything you want to be
So long
Put your blue jeans back on, girl
Go home
Remember, Hollywood's not America
So long
Put your blue jeans back on, girl
And go home
Remember, Hollywood's not America
Hollywood's not America
It's not America
