Uh-oh, the game in trouble
Started off small, now they payin' me double
Yeah, you can drip check, baby, like Mustard, yeah

Rotate 'em, all these hoes on shuffle
Money team, got a whole M in a duffle
Bitch got the nerve to say she don't like rubbers
She don't know that I know she be fuckin' my brother
Bitch, I ain't goin' out like no sucker, yeah
West Coast, smokin' on Gushers, yeah
Cartier watch, shit busted, yeah

Traphouse geeked up fast

Lil' bruh just put a nigga on Fox, damn
A rock fell out of my watch
I ain't get mad, I just switched out clocks 
Treat a bad bitch like a thot 
Burn her head pullin' off the lot
Water on water, rockin' ice on the yacht
Bought a traphouse and it came with a pot 
The game in trouble like some badass childrens
Did they just really give me 80K for thirty minutes? Yup
And can't nobody tell me how to spend it, bitch
Send it to the hood, let 'em flip it 
She want me to love on her, no way
Ain't José, I don't do what the hoes say 
HD, Blu-Ray, clear shit 
Diamonds on me look 4K 
Married to the money for better or worse
But nah I ain't walked down no aisle 
That lil' nigga fucked up
He'll walk a nigga down with a Kool-Aid smile
Yesterday spent 40K on a necklace
I'm flexin', look close and you'll see your reflection
She a lil' gangster, I like her complexion
She get so wetty, then bust like confetti
If I don't do nothing, that money, I get it
