Every day
A sunny day
Walkin' through the country
Just a breeze
And I feel at ease
Walkin' through the country
Blades of grass
Playin' with my feet
And there's nothin' so sweet
As the way you treat me
Walkin' through the country
Walkin' through the country
You're walkin' through the country
Off with your shoes
Forget those blues
You're walkin' through the country
It's gotta be a groove
The love you'll move
Walkin' through the country, yeah
Beautiful sounds
Flowin' through the trees
Each a different tune
They are tellin' me
You're walkin' through the country
Walkin' through the country
You're walkin' through the country
Sing it!
Mm-mm
Keep walkin', baby
I know there's someone
Someone who needs you
Walkin' through the country together
And love's gonna come to you
Oh, what a groovy, groovy day
A sunny day, huh
Walkin' through the country
Just a breeze
And I feel at ease
Walkin' through the country, yeah, yeah
Blades of grass
Playin' with my feet
And there's nothin' so sweet
As the way you treat me
Walkin' through the country
Walkin' through the country
You're walkin' through the country
Sing it!
Into the country, baby
Oh, and I feel good
Walkin' through the country
Feels good by your side
Oh, yeah
