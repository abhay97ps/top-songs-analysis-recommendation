Okay I forgot about the trash
I didn't trim the long hairs on my mustache
I did buy you a ring I believe it was back in '93
Alright I admit it I forgot our anniversary
But I did pick up the baby this morning at the nursery
That ain't no big thing but it's a gold star for me
You get tired and disgusted with me
When I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked the Lord to try to help me
He looked down from heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient I'm a work in progress
I'm sorry I got mad waiting in the truck
It seemed like hours you getting all dressed up
Just to go to Shoney's on a Wednesday night
I read that book you gave me about Mars and Venus
I think it's sinking in but I probably need to reread it
But I'm starting to see now what you've been saying is right
I know you meant well when you gave me those clogs
But my heels sure get hot down by the muffler on my hog
I'm sure they're stylish but I'll take my boots
I try to do that healthy thing like you want me to do
But that low fat, no fat's getting hard to chew
Now I love your cooking honey
But sometimes I need some real food
Oh honey just be patient now
I'm a work in progress
