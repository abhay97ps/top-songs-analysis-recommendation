Whatcha got
Quit my job, flipped off the boss, took my name off the payroll, screw ya man
Picked up my cell, rang my baby's bell, said I'm three miles from home
I said, "Sugar, won't you put on that sundress I like so much"
Wait out by the road, I'm comin' to pick you up
Throw your suitcase in the back
Done gassed up the Pontiac
Blastin' out to Johnny Cash
Headin' for the highway
Baby we ain't ever comin' back
It's four hundred and sixty-seven miles to the outskirts of Las Vegas
What do you say we go get married by a preacher man who looks like Elvis, yeah, momma
Sugar, don't you worry 'bout tellin' your momma goodbye
We'll send her a souvenir postcard from the wild side
Throw your suitcase in the back
Done gassed up the Pontiac
Blastin' out to Johnny Cash
Headin' for the highway
Baby we ain't ever comin' back
Throw your suitcase in the back
Done gassed up the Pontiac
Blastin' out to Johnny Cash
Headin' for the highway
Baby we ain't ever comin' back, suey
Hear that train a comin', rollin' around the bend
The Man in Black gonna rock your ass again
Na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na na-na-na
