Put down the magazine and get off the phone
There's a place I wanna show you and it won't take long
Take a ride
Take a ride
It's lookin' like we're getting there
Over here, comin' clear
Place that has no rhymes or times or crimes
Just good times
Just good times
Take me away
To a place where the good times, good times roll 
Don't let me stay
In a place where this hate can steal my soul 
Got myself worked up over nothing today
All the trash that's in my head, I gotta throw it away
It's alright
It's alright
It's lookin' like we're getting there
Over here, comin' clear
Place that has no rhymes or times or crimes
Just good times
Just good times
Take me away
To a place where the good times, good times roll 
Don't let me stay
In a place where this hate can steal my soul 
This is it, I'm finally here 
And all the blurry lines are clear 
And everything that I can't see
Seems to make more sense to me
Why the hell can't I just let it go, let it go? Yeah
Take me away 
Where the good times, good times roll 
Don't let me stay 
Where this hate can steal my soul
Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll 
Let the good times roll 
Let the good times roll
