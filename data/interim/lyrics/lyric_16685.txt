This is the operator. I have a collect call from
"Ay this yo' potnah, mayne!"
Who is an inmate in a California state prison
To deny charges, hang up now
To accept charges, press five now
Mmmmm..... welllll
One love 
Ohhhhh  The L, the L, the L, the L
One love 
Welll  The O, the O, the O, the O
One love 
Ohhhhh  And the V, the V, the V, the V
One love 
Welll It's the E, the E, the E, the E 
'Member that game Fat Bank Take Skinny Bank?
Well now we play Skinny Bank Take Fat Bank
That's because it ain't no work bein' offered main
They act like they ain't even thinkin' 'bout us main
I promise I swear the po-po threw my homie in the slammer
Did him bad, wish I had my candid camera, made me mad
Penelopes swarmin' like bees, surveillance binoculars hidden in trees
Reliable sources copping pleas, oh p-uh-please
One for the life, and two for death
Three damn strikes no chances left
Let me tell ya lil 'bout me, E-40 and the C-L-I-C
We used to have to use sheets for curtains, socks for washtowels
I was happy as hell when my cousin gave me his hand-me-downs
This ain't no happy Shirley Temple tale-listic crap
This here is serious, more realistic than Radio Shack
Observe as I strike a nerve, reach out and touch my kind
Open up your photo album, man, and I bet you find
Folks that passed away, potnas that been blasted away
I miss you, spill some liquor, mayne, who got some tissue?
One love  One love
Ohhhh 
One love  One love
Well wellll 
One love  One love
Ohhhh 
One love  One love
Well wellll 
Huh, e'rybody wanna shoot 'em up bang bang
Way I was raised we had to knuckle up and throw them thangs
We got em up and you know I had to check 'em swell
'Cause if I ran home and didn't fight back my mom'd beat that tail
Just received word from my folks upstate
They said uh, they tryin' to, they tryin' to take away our weights
And uh, no more beef and pork, just Muslim books and fish
Walking laps around the yard with my Walkman bumpin' this
Now I'm bouts to get married, is it clever?
Thought it was 'til I got the Dear John letter
Been down for ten months and got a eight-year stay
And I just found out she had her baby yesterday
Ain't nobody been to see me yet, but I ain't gonna worry
Mayne, ya out there ballin', mayne, can you drop a twamp up in my commissary?
Uhh, my family thinks that I'm a thug, homie
When you see my momma, man, give her a hug for me
And tell her
One love  One love
Ohhhh 
One love  One love
Well wellll 
One love  One love
Ohhhh 
One love  One love
Well wellll 
Huh, thinkin' back, you gotta watch your back and play it well
Enjoyed myself when I was out there tryin' to get in that mail
We used to kick it at the Waterfront, the whole Vallejo
Watchin' the pervin contestses between E-40 and Del
That's what we did up under the bridge, fools posted up
Choppin' game, conversatin', gettin' toast up
Leanin' against my Zeniths, convertible tops and who's the cleanest
Them Click boys smobbin' deep in cuts, actin' meanest
The good times, they gone, here in the can is my new home
Guess in order to do some right I had to do some wrong
Picked up a package yesterday and I was HAPPY
It was a box full of goodies from my PAPPY
Tripped me out, ain't seen or heard from Potna Duke in years
Sent me a picture and some fetti, dang near sheddin' tears, huh
See, first you born then you live then you die
One day soon I'll get another try, 1-Luv
One love  One love
Ohhhh 
One love  One love
Well wellll 
One love  One love
Ohhhh

Well wellll
