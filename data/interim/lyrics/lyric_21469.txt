When I get off of work on Friday after working like a dog all week
I go to meet the boys for a cold one at a little joint up the street
They got a jukebox in the corner full of old country tunes
Feed it five dollars worth of quarters is the first thing I always do
'Cause I need a little twang, a little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
Some peddle steel whining like a whistle of an old freight train
To get that foot stomping honky tonking feeling going through my veins
I need a little twang, twang, twang
Well, I like a lot of kinds of music, I try to keep an open mind
Depending on the mood to strike me if I'm gonna stay till closing time
So when I wanna lift my spirits to get me feeling worth a dang
I know I'm gonna have to hear it 'cause I gotta have some Hank to hang
'Cause I need a little twang, a little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
Some peddle steel whining like a whistle of an old freight train
To get that foot stomping honky tonking feeling going through my veins
I need a little twang, twang, twang
'Cause I need a little twang, a little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
Some peddle steel whining like a whistle of an old freight train
To get that foot stomping honky tonking feeling going through my veins
I need a little twang, twang, twang
