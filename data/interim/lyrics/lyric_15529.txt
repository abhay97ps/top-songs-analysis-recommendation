"Bass"
"Bass"
Like 007 I'm on a mission
Makin' people dance, droppin' suckas who dissin'
Keep the crowd movin' 'cause the beat is kinda soothin' to the ear
Yo', I give you what you wanna hear
I could make you dance and make you shout
'Cause I'm all about the M-O-N-E-Y, without a doubt
And I won't stop until I make you rock
So understand that I can make you dance, dance, dance, dance
The beat is on, you know it's hittin'
Get on the floor, don't wanna see nobody sittin'
'Cause I go and flow when I'm on the mic
Make you dance and do what you like
It's a simple calculation like one and one is two
I don't do this all for me, I do it all for you
And I won't stop until I make you rock
So understand that I can make you dance
This beat is hot!
Get up, get into the rhythm
Get, get, get into the rhythm
Get up, get into the rhythm
Make up your mind
This beat is hot!
Get up, get into the rhythm
Get, get, get into the rhythm
Get up, get into the rhythm
Make up your mind
"Bass"
"Bass"

"Let's go!"
I'm a powerful force, of course my lyrics runnin' like a race horce
Strong and fast, don't try to pass, got no way, you'll never last
With the speed I'm usin', sellin' fresh rhymes is what I'm provin'
To be raw, like you never saw, music up to par
And I won't stop until I make you rock
So understand that I can make you dance, dance, dance
I'm a rappin' educator, bustin' rhyme devastator
Like a clock likes to tock, bust a rap and a rock
From the day to the night, there's a rhyme I do recite
And I know you had no clue when I say what I do
So I slow down just a bit
To give enough time to let you hit your cigarette
And I won't stop until I make you rock
So understand that I can make you dance
This beat is hot!
Get up, get into the rhythm
Get, get, get into the rhythm
Get up, get into the rhythm
Make up your mind
This beat is hot!
Get up, get into the rhythm
Get, get, get into the rhythm
Get up, get into the rhythm
Make up your mind
"Here's one that's cool, crazy, improved, super..."
"...And sincerely yours
"Yeah, boy!"
They call me B.G., so listen to my story
I'm not a playboy, but girls adore me
Romeo is dead, B.G. is live
I keep on rockin' 'til I say, bye-bye
I didn't come to teach, but you listen, you learn
Your beat, your ears, your body just yearns
For more of the muse score and the rap
Allow me to make you clap and dance, dance, dance
I'm a terminator, innovator, battle me, eliminator
Make you hot, make you sweat, make emcees get upset
Take control of your soul, make your body wanna roll
Do the type of hype, you like what I write
Never bite, only excite to highest height
'Cause I can do it right
And I won't stop until I make you rock
So understand that I can make you dance
This beat is hot!
Get up, get into the rhythm
Get, get, get into the rhythm
Get up, get into the rhythm
Make up your mind
This beat is hot!
Get up, get into the rhythm
Get, get, get into the rhythm
Get up, get into the rhythm
Make up your mind
