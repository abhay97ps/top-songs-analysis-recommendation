Yeah...
Yeah...
Oooh...
Ooh, ooh...
Ohhh...
Every single day, I walk down the street
I hear people say, "Baby," so sweet
Ever since puberty, everybody stares at me
Boys, girls, I can't help it, baby
So be kind and don't lose your mind
Just remember that I'm your baby
Take me for what I am
Who I was meant to be
And if you give a damn
Take me baby or leave me
Take me baby or leave me
A tiger in a cage can never see the sun
This diva needs her stage: Baby, let's have fun!
You are the one I choose
Folks would kill to fill your shoes
You love the limelight too, now, baby
So be mine and don't waste my time
Cryin', "Oh Honeybear, are you still my, my, my baby?"
Take me for what I am
Who I was meant to be
And if you give a damn
Take me baby or leave me
No way can I be what I'm not
But hey, don't you want your girl hot?
Don't fight, don't lose your head
Cause every night, who's in your bed?
Who, who's in your bed?
Kiss, pookie...
That's it! The straw that breaks my back
I quit
Unless you take it back
Women, what is it about them?
Can't live with them or without them!
Take me for what I am
Who I was meant to be 
And if you give a damn 
Take me baby or leave me 
Take me baby or leave me
Guess I'm leavin'...
I'm gone!
