I'm a big dawg who you wanna be 
Diamonds on my wrist and on my teeth 
I smoke zaza, I'm in La La off them trees 
Took the T-tops off the 'Vette, I need a breeze 
And I do the fuckin' dash like Need For Speed 
I don't need a bitch, what a bitch need 
She was off a X pill, now she want E 
She went up a molly ramp and she went, "Wee" 
Got a pound, know what we doin' today
I hang with them killers, they ruin your day
I'm feelin' good, I'm super today
Been with the gang and we feel like Sly Cooper today
Got a Bentley, but I just might Uber today
Got a beam with me like a Storm Trooper today
Hella stones on me like I'm Medusa today
And I'm blowin' up like I'm a boomer today
I'm a superstar, you a consumer today
All-black whip look like a puma today
I'm a king, I'm with Timon and Pumbaa today
In your dreams, I'm big Freddy Krueger today
Don't make me pop out with that ruler today
Stretch your bitch on my dick, it's like Zumba today
If they like to shoot, I'm a shooter today
Do the drill on a muhfuckin' scooter today
Teach the world, I might become a tutor today
She wan' fuck, I might toot her and boot her today
Call her OVO thing, come from Hooters today 
B-L-double-O-D, I feel booler today 
Play with ice like a muhfuckin' cooler today
Count up a mill' in the Cullinan 
Spent half a mill' for the fun of it 
If we talkin' money, bitch, I got a bunch of it
I'm a big dawg who you wanna be 
Diamonds on my wrist and on my teeth 
I smoke zaza, I'm in La La off them trees 
Took the T-tops off the 'Vette, I need a breeze 
And I do the fuckin' dash like Need For Speed 
I don't need a bitch, what a bitch need 
She was off a X pill, now she want E 
She went up a molly ramp and she went, "Wee" 
Wee
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Oh, ooh, ooh-ooh, wee
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ooh, wee
