Montana
Posty 
Okurr
Ayy, uh huh
From the block, now we're snipin' on the opps like Somalians 
Egyptian cloth on my body, diamonds like 6ix9ine hair 
Now we comin' through the back, we don't go to the concierge 
Now that boy run fashion, Cardi in that Fashion Nova gear 
We started the wave, now everybody lookin' the same
Tell me how you want it 
Shorty buss it down, give us the money, keep the crown
Tell me how you want it
I been around the globe in the Global Express
Ten O's in my net worth, yeah 
Neck work, then the leg work 
We're the stars like the network 
You see the writing on the wall
Hold onto me and I'ma hold ya
You see the writing on the wall
I'll bring it back, bring it back, yeah
Got a lil' mama in my telephone, she jumpin' out the barrio 
Hoes all in my section, I don't want 'em, kick them bitches out like vamanos 
We can work it out, lil' mama, all we need is just a little cardio 
Yeah, she the type of woman if we cannot do it, I will catch a body for 
Call my accountant, bought my bitch new Bimmer, she whip 7-Series, yeah 
I spend whatever, girl, I do whatever to show you I'm serious 
That sound familiar, they just talkin' shit because they feel inferior
Ooh yeah, that's just how we go
You see the writing on the wall
Hold onto me and I'ma hold ya
You see the writing on the wall
I'll bring it back, bring it back, yeah
All the millions make 'em horny, Montana
Cardi, we the hottest out the South Bronx, yeah
Made me holla' for a dollar, got my makeup on your collar
You'll be callin' me tomorrow, yeah
And my diamonds like water, you'll be callin' me tomorrow
Then them dress gettin' shorter 
Make you push a little harder, little faster, little deeper 
'Fore I promise I be keepin' ya
Said, "It's all about the level up", booty like a Jell-O Cup
Bitches hella jealous, wishin' it was them instead of us
I done got hot, dawg, relish, you ain't catchin' up
Gucci, Fendi, Prada, Balenciaga, Margiela, ah
Standin' ovation, the broad of the nation
Me and babe racin the Wraiths, we're adjacent
Wish that we could take the rumors to the bank 
We don't have no more room inside the safe 
But I'ma ball it like a napkin, tap it like it's Jazz-feet
Hold the door for me, then pop me on the ass cheek
Ain't too rich to get it poppin' in the backseat
Next time you want another bitch, you better ask me, ah
Ike and Tina that ass, you better take a bitch you know
Show my name and this pass
And now we're rollin' down the freeway, talkin' 'bout a threeway
Startin' workin' out, but he gon' eat me on his cheat-day off
You see the writing on the wall
Hold onto me and I'ma hold ya
You see the writing on the wall
I'll bring it back, bring it back, yeah
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la , ohh
La-la-la , la-la-la
La-la-la, ohh
