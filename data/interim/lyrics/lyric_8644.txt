When we were children, we played in your backyard
And we pretended whenever times were hard
We built a house up in a tree
And dreamed of how our life would be
But now the tree has died
So I've gotta save you
Jenny, Jenny, dreams are ten a penny
Leave them in the lost and found
Jenny, Jenny, dreams are ten a penny
Get your feet back on the ground
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You dreamed of heroes riding across the sea
In shining armor but all you had was me
While all the time, you never knew
All I could do is dream of you
And still I do today
So God save you
Jenny, Jenny, dreams are ten a penny
Leave them in the lost and found
Jenny, Jenny, dreams are ten a penny
Get your feet back on the ground
Oh, oh, oh
Jenny, Jenny, dreams are ten a penny
Leave them in the lost and found
Jenny, Jenny, dreams are ten a penny
Get your feet back on the ground
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
