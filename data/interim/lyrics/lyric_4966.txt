Jealous love, jealous love of mine, jealous love
Why can't you trust me some time? Look a-here
You be so sweet, yet so kind
You're killin' my love with your jealous mind
Jealous love 
I wanna say it one more time 
You oughta trust me some time 
I take you, baby, everywhere I go
But your good intentions seem to never never show
& every time a pretty girl walks by
I catch you watchin' me, baby, from the corner of your eye
You be so sweet & yet so kind
You're killin' my love with your jealous mind
Jealous love 
I wanna say it one more time  wo wo
You oughta trust me some time 
Just have a little faith, baby, yeah yeah
I'm home from work every day on time
You got your hand in my pocket for that number you thought you'd find
Jealous love 
I wanna say it one more time 
You oughta trust me some time
