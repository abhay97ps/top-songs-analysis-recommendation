I really, I really, whoa
I really need to know
I really, I really, whoa
Or else, you got to let me go, oh
I really, I really
This time I really need to do things right
Shivers that you give me keep me freezing all night
You make me shudder, oh yeah
I can't believe it, I'm not myself
Suddenly I'm thinking about no one else
You make me shudder
I really, I really need to know
Or else you got to let me go, oh
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always
Give me affection
I need your perfection
Cause you feel so good
You make me stutter, stutter
If I could touch you, I'd never let go
Now you got me screaming and I cannot
Shut up, oh, shut up, yeah
Now I am lying on the bedroom floor
Barely even speaking and I cannot get up
Oh and I really, I really, I really need to know
Or else you got to let me go, oh
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always
Give me affection
I need your perfection
Cause you feel so good
You make me stutter, stutter, stutter
You knock me down, I can't get up, I'm stuck
Got to stop shaking me up
I can't eat, can't sleep, can't think
Sinking under, I'm sinking under
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
Give me affection, I need your perfection
Cause it feels so good you make me stutter
You make me stutter
You make me stutter
