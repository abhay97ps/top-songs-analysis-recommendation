Underneath the city lights
There is a world few know about
Where rules don't apply, no
And you can't keep a good girl down
She comes through the club looking for a good time
Gonna make that, shake that, money on a dime
Don't need a suga daddy, she can work it just fine
Up on the table, she'll be dancing all night
Hey, hey, yeah, hey, Babydoll, just come to life
Under the spotlight
All the girls wanna fall in line
We say
He-eh-eh-hey
Here come the ladies 'bout to give a little show
He-eh-eh-hey
Here go the boys, you gotta show a little more, more, more, more
Hit it up, get it up 
Hit it up, get it up 
Hit it up, get it up 
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque
Hit it up, get it up 
Hit it up, get it up 
Hit it up, get it up 
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque
A little bit of naughty, it's a little bit nice
She's a whole lot of glam, sweat, sugar, sex, spice
Shimmy, shimmy, strut, strut, give a little what, what
Up on the tables, we'll be dancing all night
Hey, hey, yeah, hey, everybody just comes to life
Under the spotlight
All the boys wanna fall behind
We say
He-eh-eh-hey
Here come the ladies 'bout to give a little show
He-eh-eh-hey
Here go the boys, you gotta show a little more
Hit it up, get it up 
Hit it up, get it up 
Hit it up, get it up 
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque
Hit it up, get it up 
Hit it up, get it up 
Hit it up, get it up 
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque
Okay girls, let's show them how it's done
It ain't over 'til we say
And weâ€™ve only just begun
Lemme hear you say
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Say yeah-eah-eah, yeah-eah-eah
Say yeah-eah-eah-eah, yeah!
Say yeah, yeah, yeah-eah yeah
Hit it up, get it up 
Hit it up, get it up 
Hit it up, get it up 
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque
Hit it up, get it up 
Hit it up, get it up 
Hit it up, get it up 
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque
