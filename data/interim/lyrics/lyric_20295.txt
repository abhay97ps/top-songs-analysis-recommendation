A little bit of guitar
A little bit of truck
A little bit of hound dog
And a little bit of luck
A little bit of Bacon
A little bit of beans
A little bit of you lovin' up on me
And a little bit of how it supposed to be
A little bit of life
A little bit of backseat
A little bit of moon
A little bit of radio, a goin' boom boom boom
A little bit of sugar
A little bit of spice
A little bit of nasty, A little bit of nice
A little bit of how it supposed to be
A little bit of life
I breath in
I breath out
Yes sleepin all night with the windows down
Up in the mornin' stirin around
Drink a pot of coffee and I head off to town
Work Work, Work
All day long, crank it up, back it up, bring it on home
Supper on the table and I eat me a bite
Then we snuggle on the porch by the pale moon light
A little bit of me and you doin alright
A little bit of life
A little bit of tractor
A little bit of farm
A little bit of cornfield
A little bit of barn
A little bit of come on
A little bit of play
A little bit of yee haw in the hay
A Dixie cup
A homemade wine
A little bit of life
I breath in
I breath out
Yes sleepin all night with the windows down
Up in the mornin' stirin around
Drink a pot of coffee and I head off to town
Work Work, Work
All day long, crank it up, back it up, bring it on home
Supper on the table and I eat me a bite
Then we snuggle on the porch by the pale moon light
A little bit of back porch
A little bit of swing
A little bit of wind chimes goin ding a ling
A little bit of TV
A little bit of couch
Popcorn smellin up the house
Alomode on a little slice of homemade pie
A little bit of Life
I breath in
I breath out
Yes sleepin all night with the windows down
Up in the mornin' stirin around
Drink a pot of coffee and I head off to town
Work Work, Work
All day long, crank it up, back it up, bring it on home
Supper on the table and I eat me a bite
Then we snuggle on the porch by the pale moon light
A little bit of me and you doin alright
A little bit of me and you doin alright
A little bit of life
A little bit of life
