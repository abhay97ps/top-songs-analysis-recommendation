I was sittin' in my basement
I just had myself a taste of something
That I love to taste because it
Seems to make my day
When my friend calls on the phone
And he says I’m glad I caught you home
'cause there's a fool down on the corner
Giving hundred dollar bills away!
He said – time is a-wastin’, so get your motor racin'
But I had another taste and I headed for the door
And I tried to find my hat, and I had a little more
And I had another taste and thennnn...
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and it rolled right by-hi-hi
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned, oh me oh my
A very lovely lady, said that she would be my baby
And we both wound up at my place
For a taste, and talk a bit
Next day she woke up rosy
And she snuggled up so cozy
When she asked me if I loved her
It hurt me to admit
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and it rolled right by-hi-hi
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned, oh me oh my
I ain't makin' no excuses for anything I uses
To sweeten my relationships and
To brighten up my day
But when my earthly race is over
And I'm headin' for the clover
And they ask me how my life has been
I guess I'll have to say
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and it rolled right by-hi-hi
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned, oh me oh my
