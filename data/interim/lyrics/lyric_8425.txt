Uh, uh, oooh, oooh, oooh
You've given me things that meant a lot
A love I could endure
You've given me a home, a family
Made me feel secure
Yet all that you give
There's a question that needs an answer:
How can you give your love to another?
Come home and face me the morning after
How do you feel  the morning after
After you've given your love to someone new
Tell me now
How do you feel  the morning after?
I laid here all night long waiting on you
Oh Lord
I know, I know, I know you must be dying inside
If you tell me you'll be confessing so you can't apologize
Oooh, oooh, oooh, it hurts me so to know that I'm the one to suffer
To know that I must be second best
When the best has gone to another.  Oh Lord
How do you feel  the morning after
After you've given your love to someone new
Tell me now
How do you feel  the morning after
After I laid here all night long waiting on you
Oh Lord
Oooh, oooh
...the morning after
After you've given your love to someone new
Tell me now.  
How do you feel the morning after
After I laid here all night long waiting on you
Oh, baby
How do you feel the morning after
After I laid here all night long waiting on you
How do you feel the morning after
After you've given my love away to someone new
Hey.  Oh Lord
