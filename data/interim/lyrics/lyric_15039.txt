Dope, def, any term is alright
When your DJ plays the K
You will listen to what the Kid has to say
Cause you know it's too damn straight
Can't wait
Gotta get on down before it's too late
And even if so it would be
My friend, just tell 'em to play it again
See, once it starts to beat your eardrum
It goes way up to your head
Bounces down your belly and back
If you hunger, you'll be fed
It's all up to the individual
This reaction is typical
Somehow you get to catch up with that beat
Snap them fingers, stomp your feet
Refrain: Ya Kid K
For real legit, you feel it
I'm talking 'bout the real deal
I'm a make ya feel
Yo DJ
Spin that wheel
 Spin that wheel
Spin that wheel
I'm a make ya feel
Yo DJ
 "Get up and party"
"I'm here to play you the music"
"Come on"
"Bring that beat back"
Hi Tek 3 know what's up
They're hip and they're hot, so turn it up 
All you long for wrapped up in one pack
When it stops, you're gon' put it back
On this trip, I'm your hostess
Providin' anything you request
Startin' from your hair to your toenails
I know how to treat a guest
Take it from me, it's a must
Come to the kid so I can bust this
Like it should be done
Ya Kid K is the one
Hook: Ya Kid K
Turn it up, let it spin
Turn it over, let it spin
Turn it up, let it spin
Turn it over, let it spin
Repeat Refrain
 Spin that wheel
I'm a make ya feel
Yo DJ
 "Get up and party"
"I'm here to play you the music"
"Come on"
"Come on"
"Bring that beat back"
Repeat Hook
Repeat Refrain
Hype, word
Anyway is okay
When the record starts to play
Legit
You feel it
Yo DJ, spin that wheel
Spin that wheel
I'm a make you feel
Yo DJ
"Get up and party"
"I'm here to play you the music"
"Come on"
"Bring that beat back"
