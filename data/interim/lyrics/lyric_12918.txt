I work on the front line
I work to survive
I sleep in a fever
So this is my life
I cry in my sleep 
Just makes me weep when I try, how I try
Know what it means to work hard on machines
It's a labour of love so please don't ask me why
Working for reason 
Trying too hard 
Moving in circles 
Don't get very far 
Should I ask you to dance 
If I promised romance would you come for the ride
I know what it means to work hard on machines
Will you believe in love, one that lasts for all time
You take me up, oh!
You take me up to the higher ground
You take me up
So high
Now I never want to come back down
I'm gliding these hard time 
There's hope in your eyes 
I don't need a religion 
Cos' this love never dies 
I believe in today 
It's better that way and you work through the night
I know what it means to work hard on machines
It's a labour of love so please don't ask me why
You take me up, oh!
You take me up to the higher ground
You take me up
So high
Now I never want to come back down
I cry in my sleep 
Just makes me weep when I try, how I try
I know what it means to work hard on machines
It's a labour of love so please don't ask me why
You take me up, oh!
You take me up to the higher ground
You take me up
So high
Now I never want to come back down
You take me up, oh!
You take me up to the higher ground
You take me up
So high
Now I never want to come back down
