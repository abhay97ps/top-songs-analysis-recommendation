Heard a promise in the wind
Then I saw you walkin' in
Tell me, baby, where ya been so long
Waited all my life to feel this strong
I love you like I never loved before
And every day I love you so much more
I'm feeling like I've never felt so sure
Love you like I never loved before
Lonely days and lonely nights
Finally gone and out of sight 
I'll do everything within my power
To make your life get sweeter hour by hour
I love you like I never loved before
And every day I love you so much more
I'm feeling like I've never felt so sure
Love you like I never loved before
I'll do everything within my power
To make your life get sweeter hour by hour
I love you like I never loved before
And every day I love you so much more
I'm feeling like I've never felt so sure
Love you like I never loved before
I love you like I never loved before
 No, I never 
I love you like I never loved before
 No, I never, never loved like this before
I love you like I never loved before
 No, I never, no, I never
I love you like I never loved before
