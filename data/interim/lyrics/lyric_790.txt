I don't mind...your love
I don't mind the one you're thinking of
But I know, I know...you gonna miss me
I don't mind...your love so soft
I don't mind, it can't go cold
But I know, I know...you're gonna miss me
Somewhere down the line...mmm...
I don't mind, this is all of my song
I don't mind, goodbye, so long
But I know, I know...you're gonna miss me
Goodbye, so long, no no no, I don't mind
Goodbye, so long...
