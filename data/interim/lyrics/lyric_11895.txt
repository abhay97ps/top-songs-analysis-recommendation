City nights, summer breeze makes you feel all right
Neon lights shining brightly make your brain ignite
See the girls with the dresses so tight
 Give you love if the price is right
Black or white, in the streets there's no wrong and no right, no
Outta sight, buy your kicks from the man in the white
Feels all right, powder pleasure in your nose tonight
See the men paint their faces and cry
 Like some girl, it makes you wonder why
City life sure is cool, but it cuts like a knife, it's your life
So forget all that you see
It's not reality
Can't you see what this crazy life is doing to me?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
So forget all that you see
It's not reality
Can't you see what this crazy life is doing to me? Yeah
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
I know
