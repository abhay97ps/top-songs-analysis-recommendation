Well, you filled up my head with so many lies
You twisted my heart 'til something snapped inside
I'd like to give it one more try
But my give a damn's busted
You can crawl back home, say you were wrong
Stand out in the yard and cry all night long
Go ahead and water the lawn
My give a damn's busted
I really wanna care
I wanna feel somethin'
Let me dig a little deeper
No, sorry, nothing
You can say you've got issues, you can say you're a victim
It's all your parents fault, I mean, after all, you didn't pick 'em
Maybe somebody else has got time to listen
My give a damn's busted
Well your therapist says it was all a mistake
A product of the Prozac and your codependent ways
So, who's your enabler these days?
My give a damn's busted
I really wanna care
I wanna feel something
Let me dig a little deeper
No, still nothing
It's a desperate situation, no tellin' what you'll do
If I don't forgive you, you say your life is through
C'mon, give me something I can use
My give a damn's busted
Well
I really wanna care
I wanna feel something
Let me dig a little deeper
No, man, sorry
Just... nothing
No
You've really done it this time, ha ha
My give a damn's busted
