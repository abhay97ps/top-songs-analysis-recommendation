She's got a face that shows that she knows
She's heard every line
Tenderly she talks on the phone
There's a way to walk
That says "Stay away"
And a time to go around the long way
A girl in trouble is a temporary thing
A girl in trouble is a temporary thing
There's a time when every girl learns
To use her head
Tears will be saved
'Til they're better spent
There's no time for her to be afraid
So instead she takes care of business
Keeps a cool head
A girl in trouble is a temporary thing
A girl in trouble is a temporary thing
She's got a face that shows that she knows
She's heard every line
Tenderly she talks on the phone
There's a way to walk
That says "Stay away"
And a time to go around the long way
A girl in trouble is a temporary thing
A girl in trouble is a temporary thing
A girl in trouble is a temporary thing
