Oooooh...
Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she never had a backstreet guy
I bet her mama never told her why
I'm gonna try for an
Uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am
And when she knows what
She wants from her ti-i-i-me
And when she wakes up
And makes up her mi-i-i-nd
She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love with an
Uptown girl
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired with her high class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice
Oooh...
Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win
And when she's walking
She's looking so fi-i-i-ne
And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mi-i-i-ne
She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love with an
Uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am
Oooh...
Uptown girl
She's my uptown girl 
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl 
With an uptown
