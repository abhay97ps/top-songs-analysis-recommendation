My own true love
My own true love
At last Ive found you
My own true love
No lips but yours
No arms but yours
Will ever lead me
Through Heavens doors
I roamed the Earth
In search of this
I knew Id know you
Know you by your kiss
And by your kiss
Youve shown true love
Im yours forever
My own true love
My own true love
