Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
Do you see some possibilities
Try and get away tonight
You can leave with me
It's a golden opportunity
And when the sun goes down
My fantasies run wild
When midnight comes around
I really come alive
At midnight!
Oh, I really come alive
Oh, my fantasies run wild
I got so much energy
Yeah, deep inside of me, girl
Come a little closer girl
Look into my mind
You would be surprised at what you find
There's a roaring lion inside of me
Waiting for the night
Comes out only when the time is right
And when the sun goes down
My fantasies run wild
When midnight goes around
I really come alive
At midnight
Oh, I really come alive
All my fantasies run wild
I have so much energy
Yeah, yeah, deep inside of me, girl
