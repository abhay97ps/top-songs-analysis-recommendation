I'm gettin' weaker, weaker
Ev'ry time I hear her name
Ah she's gettin' sweeter, sweeter
This girl is driving me insane
Refrain: Goody Goody Gumdrops
My heart is doin' flip-flops
Gee, what love can do
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops
Goody Goody Gumdrops
With a girl like you
Ev'rything is good about her
I just couldn't live without her
'Cause when I kiss her
My words come out this way
Repeat Refrain
To look into her baby blue eyes
Right down to her dainty shoe size
The way I see her
There's nothing left to say, but
Goody Goody Gumdrops
My heart is dooin' flipflops
Gee, what love can do
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops
Goody Goody Gumdrops
With a girl like you
