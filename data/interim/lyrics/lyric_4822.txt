When we walk down the street
Oh, we don't care who we see or who we meet
Don't have to run , don't have to hide 
'Cause we have something burning inside
'Cause we got love  power 
And it's the greatest power of them all
Oh, we've got love power 
And together we cannot fall
Sometimes we're up , sometimes we're down 
But our feet are always on the ground
We always laugh , don't have to cry 
And this is the reason why:
'Cause we got love  power 
And it's the greatest power of them all, hey, hey, hey!
We've got love  power 
And together we cannot fall
Hey, sometimes we're up , sometimes we're down 
But out feet are always on the ground
We always laugh , we don't have to cry 
And this is the reason why:
'Cause we got love  power 
And it's the greatest power of them all, hey,hey, hey!
We got love  power 
And together we can't fall, hey, hey, hey
We got love  power 
And it's the greatest power of them all, hey, hey, hey...
