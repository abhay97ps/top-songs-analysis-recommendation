When we're all alone
Softly you tell me I'm your own
Baby, what do you want me to do
But when we're in a crowd
You laugh and you talk so loud
Baby, what do you want me to do
I've got to know
If your love is really true
I can't go on feeling the way I do
Tell me, is it just a game
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
Baby, what do you want me to do
I've got to know
If your love is really true
I can't go on feeling the way I do
Tell me, if it's just a game
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
Baby, what do you want me to do
Oh, baby, what do you want me to do
Oh, baby, what do you want me to do
