I am woman
I am  woman 
I am  woman 
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, yes I am
Ain't nobody else can do it like we can
I said I am  woman 
I am  woman 
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, yes I am
And nobody else can do it quite like, like we can
It ain't easy walkin' in stilettos
But somebody gotta do it
Spend a day in my shoes
Then see what the hell I go through
It's so rigorous, doing what I do
Always on point, always on cue
Life's so hectic, call it a zoo
Think you understand if you only knew
I am  woman 
I am  woman 
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, yes I am
Ain't nobody else can do it like we can
I said I am  woman 
I am  woman 
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, yes I am
And nobody else can do it quite like, like we can
I need fashion
Elegance is a passion
I built this body to relax it
Try to bring me down
I'mma get the last laugh in
Don't need to talk I speak with actions
I've perfected the laws of attraction
I'm the whole package plus satisfaction
Better check yourself 'fore you get what you asking
Don't get it twisted, give your self a caution
Respect, it's all that I'm asking
Women bless life equals alright
No woman no life, I like to see him try
I am  woman 
I am  woman 
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, yes I am
Ain't nobody else can do it like we can
I said I am  woman 
I am  woman 
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, yes I am
And nobody else can do it quite like, like we can
Say yeah, yeah 
Say yeah, yeah 
Say yeah yeah yeah 
Say yeah yeah yeah 
Say I'm a woman, I'm a woman 
Say I'm a woman, I'm a woman 
I am woman, I am woman
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, yes I am
Ain't nobody else can do it like I can
I am  woman 
I am  woman 
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, yes I am
And nobody else can do it quite like, like we can
I am  woman 
I am  woman 
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, yes I am
Ain't nobody else can do it like we c-
I said I am  woman 
I am  woman 
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, yes I am
And nobody else can do it quite like, like we can
