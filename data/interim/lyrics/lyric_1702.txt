Trouble in mind
Yes I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
Sun is gonna shine
In my back door someday
Trouble in mind
Yes its true
I have almost lost my mind
Never had so much trouble
In my life before
If it don't stop
I'm going right on down to the river
I'm gonna to take my easy chair
And if the blues don't get me
I'm gonna rock on away from here
You better believe me
I'm trouble in mind
Oh yes its true
I have almost lost my mind
Never had so much trouble
In my young life before
Say it man, I'm trouble in mind
Yes I'm blue
But I just refuse to be blue always
The sun is gonna shine
In my back door someday
I said I it is, I know it is
Sun is gonna shine in my back door someday
Well I said that I believe that the
Sun is gonna shine in my back door someday
Oh, trouble in mind
