Come with me
And I'll show you how making love can be
You will see that it's here and now
This is our destiny
We'll spend the night
Darken the light
While we're romancing, baby
As we glide from side to side
Slow dancing
Oh, slow dancing
Come on right now, baby
Come on right now
Close your eyes and drift away
Into my fantasy
Oh, don't ask why
Just say you'll stay and I
Will fulfill all your dreams
Let your mind drift into time
While we're romancing, baby
As we meet cheek to cheek
Sugar, we're slow dancing
Oh, slow dancing
Come on right now, baby
Come on right now
Slow dance with me
Sugar, sugar
Let your mind drift into time
While we're romancing, baby
As we meet cheek to cheek
Oh, sugar, we're slow dancing
Oh, slow dancing
Oh, slow dance
Slow dance with me
Come on right now, baby
Come on right now
Come on right now, baby
Come on right now
Slow dance with me
Slow dance
Come on right now, baby
Come on right now
Come on right now, baby
Come on right now
Slow dance with me
