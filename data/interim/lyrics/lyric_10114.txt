Walking through the park
It wasn't quite dark
There was a man
Sitting on a bench
Out of the crowd
As his head lowly bowed
He just moaned and
He made no sense
He'd just go
Um, um, um, um, um...
I just couldn't help myself
Yes, I was born
With a curious mind
I asked this man
Just what did he mean
When he moaned
If he'd be so kind
And he'd just go
Um, um, um, um, um...
Now that I've grown up
And the woman I love
She has gone
Now that I'm a man
I think I understand
Sometimes everyone
Must sing this song
Listen to me sing
Um, um, um, um, um...
Can't you hear me, now
Um, um, um, um, um...
Everybody now
Um, um, um, um, um...
Can't you hear me, now
Um, um, um, um, um...
