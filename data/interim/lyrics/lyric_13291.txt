She caught up in that new California love
I’m the kid from out of town, try to get me some
I ask her how her night's been
She says let’s go for a night swim
And you know what she meant
So come on
Let the ocean take us away
'Til we see the daylight come
And I know that it's getting late
But we wanna stay
She on my surfboard
She on my surfboard
She on my surfboard
She on my surfboard
Gon' ride it, surfboard
Surfboard
We woke up on the beach down in Mexico
She asked me how we got here
And I don't know
We got back in the water
The waves were crashing on her
And you know how it goes
So come on
Let the ocean take us away
'Til we see the daylight come
And I know that it's getting late
But we wanna stay
She on my surfboard
She on my surfboard
She on my surfboard
She on my surfboard
Gon' ride it, surfboard
Surfboard
Summer lust
On a summer dusk
She told ‘em girls can’t surf with us
Surf with us, can’t surf with us
Salt's on her skin
Left me wanting more on the shore
Lo-love beach boys like 64, 64
Gon' ride on my
Surfboard
She on my surfboard
She on my surfboard
She on my surfboard
Gon' ride it, surfboard
Gon' ride it
Surfboard
Surfboard
