Haven't got much to give
And don't know what I'll get
All I know
Is if you love me
We can make it babe
Oh darlin'
I know things have been rough
And sometimes, little girl, the going gets tough
But I know if you stay with me, oh baby
We can make it baby
I know we can
One day I'll give you all the things you deserve
You have my word
Just love me
And stay with me
Don't let some sweet talkin' guy with his bread turn your head
'Cause girl, without you, love, my soul might as well be dead
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar
For as long as I live
All, all I know is if you love me
We can make it baby
Oh, we can make it
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
