Aaow!
Cha!
Shoo-cha-choo-cha!
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by—
You've been hit by—
A Smooth Criminal
Aaow!
So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, they’re behind him
And they end up never knowing
Who’s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Annie, are you okay? Are you okay?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by—
You've been struck by—
A Smooth Criminal
Choo-cha, choo-cha
Aaow!
Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now!
Aaow!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Aaow!
Annie, are you okay? 
Will you tell us that you're okay? 
There's a sound at the window 
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie? 
He came into your apartment 
Left bloodstains on the carpet 
And then you ran into the bedroom 
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie 
Annie are you okay? 
Will you tell us that you're okay? 
There's a sound at the window 
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie 
He came into your apartment, 
Left bloodstains on the carpet 
And then you ran into the bedroom 
You were struck down 
It was your doom Annie
