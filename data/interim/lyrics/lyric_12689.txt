Looks like a blue blue day
Only wish that I could say
That this is rain in my eyes
I only wish I could find the words
To say just how I feel inside
So please listen close
Each word's a beat of my heart
Some way somehow I'll find
How to say what's on my mind
'Til then you'll have to read my eyes
Looks like a blue day
Only wish that I could say
That this is rain in my eyes
So please listen close
'Cause each word's a beat of my heart
Each word's a beat of my heart
Each word's a beat of my heart
