Told me, darling, that you had to go
Go fetch somebody, I don't care no more
I know you're happy, try to get along
Money won't change you
Money won't change you
Money won't change you
But time will take you out
Looka here
If everybody had once been hurt
Then you know how it mean to be treated like dirt
Go ahead, baby, tell the world
That you're my woman and my only girl
Money won't change you
Money won't change you
I said, money won't change you
But time will take you out
I know you're happy
I know you're happy
And now you're gone
Money won't change you
Money won't change you, mama
Money won't change you
I said, money won't change you
But time will take you out
Looka here, looka here
Look here
Oh, yeah, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, slow it down, hold on
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it
Get on up, get on up
Get on up, get on up
Come on, baby
Come on, baby
Everybody stand up
Everybody stand up
Raise your hands
Raise your hands
Raise your hands
Raise your hands
