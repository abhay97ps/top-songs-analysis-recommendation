Music is what we like to play
All day all day all day all day all day
To soothe your soul, yeah
Down at the beach y'all parting down
Making love or lying around
To soothe your mind
Music is what we like to play
All day all day all day all day all day
To soothe your soul, yeah
Lets have a picnic go to the park
Rolling in the grass 'til long after dark
To soothe you soul, yeah
Down at the beach y'all partying down
Making love or just lying around
Lets have a picnic go to the park
Rolling in the grass 'til long after dark
Down at the beach y'all partying down
Making love or just lying around
Lets have a picnic go to the park
Rolling in the grass 'til long after dark
Down at the beach y'all partying down
Making love or just lying around
Repeat to fade
