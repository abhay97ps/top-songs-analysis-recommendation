Hey, I need it in the morning sun
I need it when the day is done
I need it 'cause it's so much fun
I need your
I need your
I'm gonna get it when the lights are low
I'm gonna get it just before I go
I'll get it 'cause I love you so
I'm a little rushed to get some
I need your
Now throw your arms around me
Pretend that it's a lovey-dove
Now you squeeze, ah-squeeze, squeeze, ah-ooh-ah
I'm gonna get it in the morning sun
Get it when the day is done
Get it, oh
It's so much fun
I need your
Hey, I love it
Feels so good
I love it and I wish you would
I love it
Say you always will
I love your
