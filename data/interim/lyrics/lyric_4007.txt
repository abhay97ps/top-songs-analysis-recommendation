You better go join the Campfire Girls
Take a few piano lessons
Buy a little doll to have for your best friend
Do all the things that little girls do
Cause if you don't know how to be true
You better go start over again
You said I was your only boy
But you sure lead me wrong
I found out you just played me for a fool
Now don't you know it's wrong to lie and make the one who loves you cry
I wonder where you missed the golden rule
You better go join the Campfire Girls
Take a few piano lessons
Buy a little doll to have for your best friend
Do all the things that little girls do
Cause if you don't know how to be true
You better go start over again
I thought you knew like everyone that love's a sacred thing
And not a game to play with every boy
But you thought it was funny
When you put me down for him
To you my heart was just another toy
You better go join the Campfire Girls
Take a few piano lessons
Buy a little doll to have for your best friend
Do all the things that little girls do
Cause if you don't know how to be true
You better go start over again
You better go join the Campfire Girls
Take a few piano lessons
Buy a little doll to have for your best friend
Do
