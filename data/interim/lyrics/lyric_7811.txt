The look in your eyes, baby, just turns me on;
So inviting to me... You know I feel that they're my home
And darling, I had to surrender all my sense of pride;
Your touch from behind on the shoulder's so tender
(The deepness of your eyes
The wheel of fading fortune's standing
For a long, long, long day, yeah, yeah, hey
People say that the eyes tell stories, and they mirror the soul;
Tell me, do we reflect the sameness of one, the unity to have and to hold?
I tend our love in quiet seclusion - only you can say
If this is love or just an illusion
I can't stop loving you, baby
I feel the loving all the time, hey
(The deepness of your eyes
The wheel of fading fortune's standing
For a long, long, winding day, yeah
