This is a test
Sugar, sugar, boo boo
What do you know about love
It's just a test
It ain't your life
Tell me...
Talk about love
That's all I want you to do
I'd like to give you a test
So, darling, prepare yourself
When I say love please explain
What pictures pop in your brain
'Cause when you talk about love 
Say when you think about love 
Ooo, when you talk about love 
You should be talking 'bout me 
Now if you need to be taught
Don't make me an afterthought
For every lesson that's wrong
You can bet my good lovin' will be gone
So let's erase any doubt
Take a second or two to figure out
Speak from your lips to my ears
Yes, I know you know what I want to hear
When you talk about love 
Hey, when you think about love 
Ooo, when you talk about love 
You should be talkin' 'bout me 
No, I'm not gonna play tit for tat
When it comes to affairs of the heart
But if I love you I won't look back
And I know that I love you so just do your part
When you talk about love 
I said, when you think about love 
When you talk about love 
You should be talking 'bout me 
So when you talk about love 
Ooo, when you think about love 
So when you talk about love 
You should be talking 'bout me 
Ooh, I said, say my name
That's right
Said, say my name
Said, say my name
What's my name?
My name is love, love, love 
I'm tellin' you
Said, love in the morning 
I said, it's love in the afternoon 
I'll give you good love in the evening, baby 
Oh, that's my name 
Oh, my name is love 
My name is love 
My name is love 
My name is love 
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
