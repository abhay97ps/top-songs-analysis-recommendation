Her parents' house exudes a reborn air
The bathtub virgins in the midnight air
Seem to smile in celebration
What an intercession
All inertia washed away
Resplendent in dignity
Angeline is coming home
I'd fantasize her

Angeline is coming home
The beautiful acquaintance
I desired has inspired me
To levels unforeseen

When do I see her?
What's said when I do?

To hear her laugh
At my hyperbole
Would send me
It's nice to have her
Home and whole
Resplendent in dignity
Angeline is coming home
She's coming home
Resplendent in dignity
Angeline is coming
Angeline is coming
Angeline is coming home
Hey, yeah
She's coming come
