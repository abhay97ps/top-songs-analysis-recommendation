We're fooled by first impressions
They're not always true
You thought that I was made out of ice
But I caught on fire with you
And I sparkled for a moment
Then I flickered out
I couldn't feel the flame any more
But darlin', I'm feelin' it now
It took such a long time to convince me
You could fill that empty space
Ooh, but Saturday night is shining
On my Sunday morning face, oo-wee baby
Saturday night is shining
On my Sunday morning face... hey, yeah, baby
Make me feel so happy
When I'm lying here beside you
In the afterglow
I feel you moving into my life
And this time I won't let you go, no baby
Sunlight is streaming
Through the open window
While you're dreaming in my arms...
Oh, took such a long time to convince me
You could fill that empty space, ooh-ooh-ooh!
But Saturday night keeps on shining
On my Sunday morning face, oo-wee baby
Saturday night keeps on shining
On my Sunday morning face
Shine, shining...
Shine, shining... oo-wee baby
Shine, shining...
On my Sunday morning face, oo-wee baby
Shine, shining... hey, baby
Shine, shining... ooh, ooh
Saturday night keeps on shining
On my Sunday morning face, oo-wee baby
Saturday night keeps on shining
On my Sunday morning face, let me tell ya
Saturday night, Saturday night keeps on shining, baby
On my Sunday morning, Sunday morning
Sunday morning face, baby
Early early morning, early early morning
Keeps on shining on my Sunday morning face, baby
Hey, yeah...
