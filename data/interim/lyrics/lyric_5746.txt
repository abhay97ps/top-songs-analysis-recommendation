Hold it, baby, I turned you on
Now I can't turn you off
I turned you on
Now I can't turn you off
What a good, good feeling
A great sensation
Oh, you and me, baby
A good combination
Ah, sock it to me
Ah, sock it to me 
Sock it to me 
Sock it to me 
Sock it to me 
Woo, baby, I started it 
But I can't stop it
I admit that I started it, baby 
Girl but I can't stop it
What a good, good feeling
A great sensation
Ah, you and me, baby
A good combination
Ah, sock it to me 
Ooh, sock it to me 
Ooh, sock it to me 
Hey, sock it to me 
Ah, get it, George 
Ooh 
Oh no
Ooh 
Oh, I turned you on, sock it to me 
Sock it to me 
Sock it to me 
Oh, I turned you on 
But I can't turn you off
Baby, I said, I turned you on 
But I can't turn you off
Come on, girl, light my fire
Send me a little bit higher
Ooh, 'round and around and up and down we go
Where we gonna stop, baby, nobody knows
Ah, sock it to me 
Whip it to me 
Give it to me 
Sock it to me 
Sock it to me 
Sock it to me 
Ah, sock it to me 
Ah, sock it to me
