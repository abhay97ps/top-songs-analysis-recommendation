Smile
Ooh, ooh
Smile
Smile
In your eyes shine pictures of
This time for us, I melt with love
When our lips kiss, silent words
Move the earth and shake my world
But nothin' means as much 
Like that special touch 
From your smile 
Oh, if anything I'd miss 
I never could resist 
Your smile
Oh, oh, oh
In your touch there's tenderness
A sweet caress that soothes all pain
When I'm lost and feelin' low
To you I go to make things right again
But nothin' means as much 
Like that special touch 
From your smile 
If anything I'd miss 
How could I resist 
Your smile 
Baby, smile 
When you smile 
Everything's all right 
When you smile 
Nothing means as much 
Nothing seems to touch 
When you smile 
You light my life , baby
The sun will shine again 
When you smile 
Oh, hoo, hoo
If anything I'd miss 
How could I resist 
Your smile , oh, oh
No other love can light my life
No one can make things right 'til my baby smiles
You move the earth and shake my world
Ooh, I melt with love
No other love can light my life
No one can make things right 'til my baby smiles
A sweet caress and tenderness
The way you light my life
No other love  can light my life
No one can make things right  'til my baby smiles
I'm saving all , my love for you
No one does for me  what you do
No other love  can light my life
No one can make things right  'til my baby smiles
When I'm down , feeling low
The sun can shine again 
No other love  can light my life
No one can make things right  'til my baby smiles
 Ooh, ooh  woo
No other love  can light my life
No one can make things right  'til my baby smiles
