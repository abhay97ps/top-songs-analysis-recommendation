You said hello Mona Lisa
It's nice to meet you
How you get a smile like that
And the back to match
Is there somewhere that I could see ya
Admire your features
Feels like we must've met
But I've never seen you before
That when I got to know you
That's how you said hello
Showed me to your canvas
Then you poured out your soul
That's how we feel in love
The way that the story goes
Got me so inspired
Had to to let the world know
That I just wanna be your
Muse 
I just wanna be your
Muse 
I just wanna be your
Your prototype
Pretty Brown eyes
Forever your lady
Colors of our love
Written on the wall
Say that all you see is beauty
And I'm the pi√®ce de resistance
I must make you feel like Pablo
Maybe  Da Vinci
I'm still tryna unlock your code
While I got you right here with me
Muse 
I just wanna be your
Muse 
I just wanna be your
Your prototype
Pretty Brown eyes
Forever your lady
That when I got to know you
That's how you said hello
Showed me to your canvas
Then you poured out your soul
That's how we feel in love
The way that the story goes
Got me so inspired
Had to to let the whole world know
I just wanna be your, your muse
I just gotta be your muse
Baby let me inspire you
Cause I just wanna be your muse
Muse 
I just wanna be your
Muse 
I just wanna be your
Your prototype
Pretty brown eyes
Forever your lady
