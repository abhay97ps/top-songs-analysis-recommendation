Yeah, this Lil Uzi Vert
I'm ready
Let's go
I don't ever want to talk about it
I don't ever want to see you 
Everybody, they been changing now
Now you see what the cheese do 
I understand, charge it to the game
Everybody wanna feast too 
I put gold all up on my neck
I put gold on my teeth too 
I ain't never stayed from the jump
How you say that I leave you? 
How you say that I left you?
First year was the best you 
After all the dumb shit that you did
Can't believe that I really kept you 
We used to sit in the same room
And I still probably would text you 
She ain't never gon' talk back
Gettin' big money, that's a tall bag 
Go to Bergdorf, spend a small bag
Look at my back, Chrome Heart tags 
Louis V like I'm Virgil, got the all-white, told the bitch Off that 
Pulled up in the Lam', it was manual, I had to stall that
I just made ten M's today, bitch, that's all facts
Call my phone, don't answer me, then I told the girl don't ball back 
Drip, splash, I can just sauce that 
Yeah, I pick the bitch up
But I made her walk back 
All my niggas got the tools
So you need a hard hat
They ain't even know it's me
'Cause I had a skull cap 
Slime snake my disease 
If you bite, I bite back 
Had this bitch on her knees
Asked her where her jaw at 
Hello? , hold on
Baby, gotta call back
'Cause I ran into a lick 
And I need all that 
Murakami on my walls 
Nigga, where your KAWS at? 
I just beat a nigga up
Now I need my paws back 
Got a Glock with a dick
Yeah, I had to pause that 
When I'm shopping, know I'm safe
So I'm in the mall strapped
Diamonds all up in her face 
Make a bitch percolate
Put her on ElimiDate
Been fucked, boy, you late 
She ain't never gon' talk back
Gettin' big money, that's a tall bag 
Go to Bergdorf, spend a small bag
Look at my back, Chrome Heart tags 
Louis V like I'm Virgil, got the all-white, told the bitch Off that 
Pulled up in the Lam', it was manual, I had to stall that 
I just made ten M's today, bitch, that's all facts
Call my phone, don't answer me, then I told the girl don't ball back 
Drip, splash, I can just sauce that 
Yeah, I pick the bitch up
But I made her walk back 
Yeah, chain gang
Diamonds in my chain hang
Diamonds in my chain swing 
I'm just tryna maintain 
Now I'm talking 'bout the fame 
Fucking with my fucking brain 
I can go in any lane 
Tear that bitch up out the frame 
Hotbox a Mulsanne 
I just gotta ventilate 
I just got a new Range 
Yeah, it came with different plates
One, two, three, four
Skip the six, skip the eight
Then I skip the shit to ten
Run from 12, and I'm straight
You ain't never reach your day
You can't go where I go, you can't stay where I stay 
Her nigga in the way
Picked her up in my Rolls 
She don't know where I stay, fucked that girl on vacay, yeah
No, she ain't never gon' talk back
Gettin' big money, that's a tall bag
Go to Bergdorf, spend a small bag

But I made her walk back 
Yeah, I picked the bitch up
And I made her walk back
