Cling to me, clinging vine
Just to me, clinging vine
How I wish those arms
You're clinging to were mine
Please come back and cling to me
Clinging vine
I can't believe that we're through
That you're clinging to someone new
Don't you know he'll never love you
Like I do 
Please come back and cling to me
Clinging vine
Please come back and cling to me
Clinging vine
