Keep on dancing
Til your feet get sore
Keep on dancing
Til your feet get sore
Keep on dancing
Til your feet get sore
Take off your shoes
And dance some more
Oh, little boy blue
Come and blow your horn
Sheep in the meadows
Cows in the corn
Slow and easy now
Haste makes waste
Keep on dancing
All over the place
Woah, keep on dancing
I like it like this
Keep on dancing
I like it like this
You can't lose with
That kind of groove
I just love to see you move
Gather round everybody and see
This young lady's killing me
Moving so fast, it's a crying shame
Does anybody here know her name
Keep on dancing now
Til your feet get sore
Keep on dancing, dancing
Til your feet get sore
Keep on dancing
Til your feet get sore
Take off your shoes
And dance some more
Keep on dancing now
Til your feet get sore
Keep on dancing, dancing
Til your feet get sore
Keep on dancing
Til your feet get sore
Take off your shoes
And dance some more
Oh, little boy blue
Come and blow your horn
Sheep in the meadows
Cows in the corn
Slow and easy now
Haste makes waste
Keep on dancing
All over the place
