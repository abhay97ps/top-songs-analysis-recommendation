Y'all wanted another one
So I'm back with another one
Y'all ready?
Here we go
Yeah
See, everybody want fame, don't nobody want change
Tryna take over the game, but you don't know
I've been writin' a couple days, I don't have nothin' to say
And feel like I'm fallin' off, sinkin' so low
And all the rappers wanna talk that shit now
And use their words in comment sections like a pistol
Homie, I don't even have a minute to sit down
Or let alone listen to the garbage that you spittin' out
Throw hot sixteens down, like I don't know
It sounds more like eight bars of auto-tune
That shit is played like Cristal, you know the deal
No one knows how to react when you're just being real
No gimmick, I finish with no limits
Talk, but you never stab back like a fitted
I don't have a record label tryin' to get in
Judgin' by what they been signin', I don't wanna be considered now
I know this is only an industry built for the
Ego and money, like 
If you got heart then don't hear it
Just keep it on Facebook and out of sight 
See, I just wanna write, speak my truth 
And they don't know what it's like for me and you 
Gotta do this every day, hygiene
Sold out stadium at home, my dreams
Got a mask up on they face and I'm pennin' 'em what the day is
You can be another deer up on those high beams
Right, tryna fight the feelin' to quit
Look, a twelve-pack, a Bud Light, and cigarettes
And all the new-school kids gonna say it's lit
I'm addicted to chewing beats like it's Nicorette
Now, isn't this great?
This shit is one-sided like Donald's debate
Drop a fat track even if it is late
Like a newborn child, I'm worth the wait, uh 
Find that I'm way more comfortable alone 
And I just wanna make my art and go back home 
Trippin', but they say be like Paul McCartney
And Lennon and let it be 
I am Jon Snow and I'm watchin' all of my
Best friends become enemies 
They left me for dead but I'm back for revenge
No pride, just ill will, yeah 
Then I flip the script like I'm Tarantino
With another sequel to Kill Bill
Now, I've been sober for a minute, now I'm startin' to worry
I got a buzz so big, I might be pissin' dirty
I call my sponsor just hopin' that he can reassure me
I'm yellin' in the mix, but I don't think you really heard me
Nerd shit, I be flippin' this hip hop
A wordsmith, he don't give a fuck if his shit's hot
I'm Will Smith, I Am Legend, the only one that's got vision
With an aim that's the same as Deadshot
Ayy, tryna open hearts
And when I rap about home, call it local bars
And give a song away free, you can hold the charge
No Lightning port, see, I just hold the charge, uh
It's dope if you tried us
Gettin' you higher than twenty one pilots
And after I write this I'm holdin' a lighter
Up to this whole scene to ignite it
See, I am not Hopsin or Token or Macklemore
The next internet sensation rapper, or
MGK, so what are you attacking for?
Goin' back and forth, yeah
I am my mother's son, sometimes I come undone
My girl believes in my music more than I do
And I know she is not the only one, got me feelin' like Obi-Wan
The only one who's gonna be standin' here with a smoking gun
And I don't really need another reason to pop
I gotta drop another track for these people to cop
And I gotta watch what I was sayin', 'cause, believe it or not
Everyone wants to see you fail, end up in jail on bail or shot
Uh, no gangsta rap shit
I'm not a gangster, I don't fuckin' act it
These record labels got sketchy tactics
All these rappers just fuckin' actors
I know this is only an industry built for the
Ego and money, like 
If you got heart then don't hear it
Just keep it on Facebook and out of sight 
See, I just wanna write, speak my truth 
And they don't know what it's like for me and you
