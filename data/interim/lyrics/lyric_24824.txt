Run fast from my day job
Runnin' fast from the way it was
Jump quick to a pay check
Runnin' back to the strip club
I'm never goin' back, never goin' back
No you can't make me
Never goin' back, never goin' back 
They'll never take me
I've paid enough of petty dues
I've heard enough of shitty news
I've had a thing for dirty shoes since I was 10
Love dirty men alike
Ooh
Better day than yesterday 
Ooh oh
I just take it day by day
Ooh oh oh
Never hearing what they say 
Ooh ooh 
I just do it my way
All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burnin' daylight
Still love, and it's still love, and it's still love
It's still love, still love , still love
It's still love, it's still love
Nothin' but love for you 
Nothin' but love 
Nothin' but love
All that I've got, pieces and pages
Talkinâ€™ a lot, sorry I'm faded
Think I forgot
You love me, you love me, you love me
Got a shift at 10 AM 
Gotta dip at 10 PM 
Gotta get that cash
Won't get past a lunch break
I ain't had a smoke break
In about two days, don't break 
Been about three years since I dated you
Why you still talkin' 'bout me like we together?
I moved on for the better, you moved on to whoever
I was down for whatever, and then some
You gon' make me late to work again
Ooh
Better day than yesterday
Ooh
I just take it day by day
Ooh oh oh
Never hearing what they say
Ooh, ooh
I just do it my way 
All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burnin' daylight
Still love, and it's still love, and it's still love
It's still love, still love, still love 
It's still love, and it's still love 
Nothin' but love for you
Nothin' but love 
Nothin' but love
I don't eat, can't sleep past 9 AM 
Heartbeat make me feel young again 
Can't beat 'em, just join the party 
I don't wanna, don't need nobody 
All that I've got, pieces and pages
Talking a lot, sorry I'm faded
Think I've forgot, you love me
You love me, you love me
You love me
You love me
You love me
