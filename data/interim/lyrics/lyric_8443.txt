Baby, you better quit, umm

Feels so good to me, girl
Keep on doin' whatcha doin', lady
Ooh, you feel so good to me
Girl, I went to see my doctor and he told me
Well, from your lovin' I've got to stay away
He told me to let you go for my heart can't stand much mo'
And there oughta be a law against lovin' a man this way
Aww, but I can't get enough of your lovin', no, Lord
And my need keeps getting stronger every day
Girl, I've got just one life to live and a lotta love to give and give
And let it be known that I ain't ashamed to say
You've got my soul on fire
Don't you ever stop it, baby, what you doin' to me
Girl, now you've got my soul on fire
Oh, yeah, baby, baby
I like it, like it, like it, baby, like it, hey, girl
When it comes to lovin', you're one of a kind
Satisfaction guaranteed, every doggone time, whoa, baby
You ain't got to worry about me ever leaving you
'Cause they ain't made a woman yet that can do the things you do
Oh, oh
When you press your sweet lips to mine, oh baby
My blood starts boiling and my temperature starts to rise
Girl, I shudder, baby, and I ain't ashamed to admit it
And even if it kills me, girl, I don't want you to quit it
You've got my soul on fire, oh yeah, baby
I like it, I like it, like it, like it
You've got my soul on fire
Ho, fire, aw, baby

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, baby
When you put your loving arms around me
Girl, my mind, body and soul you control
I'm your puppet on a string, hey, and one more thing
Woman, your love is too hot to hold
You've got my my soul on fire
Oh, baby, baby, I like it, like it, like it, like it
