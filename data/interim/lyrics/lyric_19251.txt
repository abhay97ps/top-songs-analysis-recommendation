Yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
I've got it all, but I feel so deprived
I go up, I come down, and I'm emptier inside
Tell me what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing
And why can't I let it go?
There's gotta be more to life
Than chasing down every temporary high
To satisfy me
'Cause the more that I'm
Tripping out, thinkin' there must be more to life
Well, it's life, but I'm sure
There's gotta be more
Than wanting more
I've got the time and I'm wasting it slowly
Here in this moment, I'm halfway out the door
On to the next thing, I'm searching for something that's missing
There's gotta be more to life
Than chasing down every temporary high
To satisfy me
'Cause the more that I'm
Tripping out, thinkin' there must be more to life
Well, it's life, but I'm sure
There's gotta be more
I'm wanting more
Oh, I'm always waiting on something other than this
Why am I feeling like there's something I missed?
There's gotta be more to life
Than chasing down every temporary high
To satisfy me
'Cause the more that I'm 
Trippin' out, thinkin' there must be more to life
Well, it's life, but I'm sure
There's gotta be more to life 
Than chasing down every temporary high 
To satisfy me
'Cause the more that I'm
Tripping out, thinkin' there must be more to life
Well, there's life, but I'm sure
There's gotta be more to life 
More to life
There's gotta be more to life
More to life
There's gotta be more to life...
