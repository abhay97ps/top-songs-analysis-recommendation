Ta Da
Tryna make you disappear
Make you pack your bags
Get the hell out of here
Ding-dong
The sound I'm waiting for
Your taxi's outside
And the driver's at the door
Oh, won't you please disappear?
Make yourself invisible but leave the car here
The pink slip's in my name so the Benz has got to stay
Why you
St-st-st-st-stuttering
Tryin' to explain
I had it up to here
I make the choice today
See one of us will be leaving
Right now I ain't goin' say
You say you didn't go out
I know that was a lie
The neighbors said they saw you
Last night driving by
What's up with this girl?
Some supermarket clerk is visiting our house
Each day when I'm at work
I just can't believe you had the nerve
There'll be no more...
No more kisses
We won't be makin' love
I'm tired of your SH - IT
I had enough
If I had three wishes you'd see me close my eyes
Real tight and concentrate like 1,2,3
And...
Ta Da
Tryna make you disappear
Make you pack your bags
Get the hell out of here
Ding-dong
The sound I'm waiting for
Your taxi's outside
And the driver's at the door
Oh, won't you please disappear?
Make yourself invisible but leave the car here
The pink slips in my name so the Benz has got to stay
Why you
St-st-stuttering
Tryin' to explain
See one of us has got to go
It's gonna be you cause it's my condo
See the two of us can't be up in here
So one of us is going make it clear
There's no layin' around
No free rides
No playing around, is a rule of mine
But you were cheating around
Tryin' fly free
If it worked like "I Dream of Jeannie"
I'd blink yo' ass away from me
No more kisses
We won't be makin' love
I'm tired of yo' SH - IT
I had enough
If I had three wishes you'd see me close my eyes
Real tight and concentrate like 1,2,3
And...
Ta da
Tryin' make you disappear 
Make you pack yo' bags get the hell  out of here 
Ding-dong
The sound  I'm waiting for
The taxi out side
And the driver's at the door
Ooh, won't please disappear
The pink slip's in my name so the Benz has gotta stay
Why you
St-st-stuttering tryin' to explain
Ta Da
Tryna make you disappear 
Make you pack your bags
Get the hell out of here
Ohh 
The sound I'm waiting for
The taxi outside and the driver's at the door
Oh, won't you please
The pink slip's in my name so the Benz has gotta stay
Why you st-st-st-st-stuttering 
And tryin' to explain 
TA DA!
