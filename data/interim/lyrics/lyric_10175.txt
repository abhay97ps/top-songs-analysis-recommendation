Well, when you listen to the music, does it make you want to sing?
Or does it make you want to dance to the heavy beat it brings?
It's deep down in my soul, deep down in my bones
Sometimes I get the feeling it's so deep I can't let go
But I, I guess I'm a real lucky one
Star-maker, heart-breaker, I kill the ladies with my song
Riding high and kinda crazy, may be foolish, but it seems
The only thing that gets me high is when I'm playing and I sing
'Cause dancing and singing and getting it on and singing a song
It makes me feel, makes me feel alright
It's fascination, sensation, sophisticated, complicated
Heart-related communication
I love my music, sweet music 
It's the only thing that makes me feel alright
I love my music, sweet music 
It's the only love that ever treats me right
I love my music, sweet music 
It's the only thing that makes me feel alright
I love my music, sweet music 
It's the only love that ever treats me right
Now that you got the beat, girl, does it make you jump and shout?
Do you feel kinda crazy wondering what it's all about?
Will you ever understand this? Do you know just what I mean?
And now please don't shrug your shoulders 'cause there ain't no in between
Oh, I, excuse me if I ramble on
I'm just making sure you know what's going on
'Cause if you really want me, you got to realize
No one comes before my music and there will be no compromise
'Cause dancing and singing and getting it on and singing a song
Makes me feel, makes me feel alright
It's fascination, sensation, sophisticated, complicated
Heart-related communication
I love my music, sweet music 
It's the only thing that makes me feel alright
I love my music, sweet music 
It's the only love that ever treats me right
I love my music, sweet music 
It's the only thing that makes me feel alright
I love my music, sweet music 
It's the only love that ever treats me right
Oh yeah
Oh, my music, yeah
Well, yeah
My, my music, yeah, yeah
Makes me feel alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And my music
And my music
And my music, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
