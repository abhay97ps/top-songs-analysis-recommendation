Off with your head
D-dance-dance-dance 'til you're dead
O-off-off-off with your head
D-dance-dance-dance 'til you're dead
O-off-off-off with your head
It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
Heads will roll, heads will roll
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight
Off with your head
D-dance-dance-dance 'til you're dead
O-off-off-off with your head
D-dance-dance-dance 'til you're dead
Ooh, you hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
Uh, you'll feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Heads will roll, heads will roll
But all the while
You hear the creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time
Thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight
Off with your head
D-dance-dance-dance 'til you're dead
O-off-off-off with your head
D-dance-dance-dance 'til you're dead
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
And though you fight to stay alive 
Your body starts to shiver 
For no mere mortal can resist 
The evil of the thriller 
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghost could ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer thriller tonight
Oh!
Off with your head
D-dance-dance-dance 'til you're dead
O-off-off-off with your head
D-dance-dance-dance 'til you're dead
O-off-off-off with your head
