 They gon' tell you I went
They gon' tell you I went
They gon' tell you I went
Pop star 
What they gon' tell you? 
They prolly tell you I went pop 
Until a nigga play with me and he get popped 
I'm on front row at BET without my Glock 
I'm ready to beat a nigga up like I'm The Rock 
And she ready to sweep a nigga up because he hot 
She ready to eat a nigga up until he lock 
She hit the brakes and speed it up like she a car 
Now she got her hands behind her head like I'm a cop 
I told her "Fuck the police", yeah
She right beside me and she sendin' nudes 
You fuck my bitch? That's cool, I'm fuckin' niggas bitches, too
If you try my shoes, they ain't gon' fit, man, you wear different shoes 
Had to dumb it down for them to bite, now it's time to switch the groove 
I pull up smooth wit' my lil' bae, but I coulda came wit' your boo 
If you wit' the shit like I'm wit' the shit, when they play they gon' make the news 
I was in your sis on Sunday at your grandma place, she cool 
And if she raised you, I don't want her plate, no, I ain't even take her food 
Baby bougie, he be turnin' down all kinda hoes
He took my bitch in Nike, I'm rockin' designer clothes
I told her "Sorry, I'm not fuckin', baby I'm not a ho"
Had bitches knockin' at my door like they was Domino's
They gon' say I went pop 
Until a nigga play with me and he get popped 
I'm on front row at BET without my Glock 
I'm ready to beat a nigga up like I'm The Rock 
And she ready to sweep a nigga up because he hot 
She ready to eat a nigga up until he lock 
She hit the brakes and speed it up like she a car 
Now she got her hands behind her head like I'm a cop 
I told her "Fuck the police", yeah
Takin' a trip to Mexico, I'm comin' right back in town 
I sell a lotta perico, been tryna slow it down 
Takin' a four, I put a two on that and then I make it bounce 
I took a thirty-six to a hundred and eight and weigh up every ounce
I'm a plug, workin' a drug hub out in H-town 
Hey, what up? You my lil' love bug, you with Gates now
Penetrate while I grip her waist, push her face down 
Concentrate , this that bass, makin' great sounds 
Got a graveyard up under my belt, more murders than New Mexico
Thirty round extension, mini Glizzy and I'm servin' coke
I'm up in rank in the cartel, I got control in this bitch 
And still, I'll book you for a show and get you showed in this bitch
Swear you want a don dada, bitch, we Puerto Rico gangland
A hundred bricks ain't nuttin', I pushed a button and make the plane land
Show some of you niggas how to grind up out the hole
Then I tied ya in with 'migo then I got you, he just told
Yeah, he just told you how to pop 
Until a nigga play with me and he get popped 
I'm on front row at BET without my Glock 
I'm ready to beat a nigga up like I'm The Rock 
And she ready to sweep a nigga up because he hot 
She ready to eat a nigga up until he lock 
She hit the brakes and speed it up like she a car 
Now she got her hands behind her head like I'm a cop 
I told her "Fuck the police", yeah
