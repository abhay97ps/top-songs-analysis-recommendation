They told me the streets were all paved with gold
But these dirty sidewalks are gray and concrete cold
They said neon lights were a beautiful sight
But how 'bout the one blinkin' in my room all night
And where's the magic in this magic town
Where's the good life they said could be found
Where's the magic to make all my big dreams come true
I gotta find it girl before I send for you
They said in this town you get rich in no time
But here I am and I'm down to my last dime
I just don't know why I bother to try
When nobody here gives a hang if I live or die
And where's the magic in this magic town
Where's the good life they said could be found
Where's the magic to make all my big dreams come true
I gotta find it, girl before I send for you
And where's the magic in this magic town
Where's the good life they said could be found
Where's the magic to make all my big dreams come true
I'm gonna find it, girl, if it can be found
Before I bring you to
This magic town
This magic town
