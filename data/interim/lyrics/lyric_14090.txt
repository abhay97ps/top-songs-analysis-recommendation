Thought it was love for the first time
Did not know what I had in store
Big arms, big legs, big feet
But I could not see
Just what she hid behind her door
And my heart stopped
And my blood pressure dropped
Oh what a shock
You know he's my girl
I'm a good man
So when she held my hand
That's when I knew
That he's my girl
I could be fooled by first impressions
It's true when they say love is blind
Behind the pearls, the hair and long fingernails
Little did I know what I would find
And my heart stopped
And my blood pressure dropped
Oh what a shock
You know he's my girl
I'm a good man
So when she held my hand
That's when I knew
That he's my girl
He's my girl woah
Ooh baby whatcha do to me
You got me going, you got me on my knees
Ooh baby tell me please
Is he a she, is she a he
I guess it doesn't matter to me
Cause he's my girl
Look what my best friend did to help me
To win a prize and get us fame
Put on a dress to make them think he's my girl
But he's all man, it's just a game
And my heart stopped
And my blood pressure dropped
Oh what a shock
You know he's my girl
I'm a good man
So when she held my hand
That's when I knew
That he's my girl
It might be too late
But by some strange twist of fate
Here is my date
You know he's my girl
That was one kiss
That I'm glad I missed
He's hard to resist
You know he's my girl
And my heart stopped
And my blood pressure dropped
Oh what a shock
You know he's my girl
