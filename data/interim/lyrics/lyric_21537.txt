Ooo-ahoo, ah-yah-ahha
Am-aba-ah-ah-oh-oh
Am-ah-ah-ah-oh-oh
Sometimes I lay under the moon and thank God I'm breathing
Then I pray, "Don't take me soon, 'cause I am here for a reason"
Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around, because...
All my life I've been waiting for, I've been praying for
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more, there'll be no more wars
And our children will play
One day , one day , one day 
One day , one day , one day 
It's not about win or lose, 'cause we all lose when they feed
On the souls of the innocent, blood-drenched pavement
Keep on moving though the waters stay raging
In this maze, you can lose your way 
It might drive you crazy, but don't let it phase you, no way 
Sometimes in my tears I drown 
But I never let it get me down 
So when negativity surrounds 
I know some day it'll all turn around, because...
All my life I've been waiting for 
I've been praying for 
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more 
They'll be no more war 
And our children will play
One day , one day , one day 
One day , one day , one day 
One day this all will change, treat people the same
Stop with the violence, down with the hate
One day we'll all be free, and proud to be
Under the same sun, singing songs of freedom like:
Why-ohhh , why-ohh-ohh-ohh
Why-ohhh, why-ohh-ohh-ohh
All my life I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
For the people to say 
That we don't wanna fight no more 
They'll be no more war
And our children will play
One day , one day , one day 
One day , one day , one day 
Ooo-ahoo, ah-yah-ahha
Am-aba-ah-ah-oh-oh
Am-ah-ah-ah-oh-oh
