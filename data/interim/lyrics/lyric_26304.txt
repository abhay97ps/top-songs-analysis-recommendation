Uh
Yeah, uh, that's right 
 Uh, yeah, yeah, uh-huh
I was raised by the wolves 
I wasâ€…raised by the wolves 
I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full 
Run through the night, playin' with your life 
Go against the pack, that's risking your life 
Better play it right, yeah, you better play it right 
I got loyalty in blood, I do anything for love
And everything for us 
Doing everything like everything ain't been too much 
You know my favorite time to come through for you is the clutch
Last second, what a rush , look
I'm the type to talk to the stars , straight up
These ain't tattoos, these are scars
My young dogs will tear you and the witnesses apart 
They care 'bout starving more than they do 'bout a charge 
Me, I can't break a commitment 
I done seen people fuck up the whole team 'cause they couldn't play they position 
Talking 'bout they didn't mean it, bitch, you know the road to hell was paved with good intentions
I see myself in my nemesis 
I contemplated forgiveness , I think I lost all my innocence 
Ho, my life depend on this, this ain't no simple sucker shit 
Try and steal and you get bit, that's what you motherfucking get
I feel safer taking risks and I can't eat this on my own life
Put my back against the wall just to see how much I've grown, dawg
I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full 
Run through the night, playin' with your life 
Go against the pack, that's risking your life 
Better play it right, better play it right
I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full
Run through the night, playin' with your life
Go against the pack, that's risking your life
Better play it right, yeah, you better play it right
I was raised by the wolves , paid all my dues 
Always in the game and never played by the rules 
Tried to make me leave , fell down to my knees 
Picked myself up and turned my back to the breeze, oh-ohh
Spent a milli' on a Mille, mama look at me 
With all these diamond chokers, man, it's gettin' hard to breathe
Thought that you were family, cut some branches off my tree 
But if you in my circle, know I'll always be around 
Don't let me down 
You said you'd die for me, well, there's the ground
Ice on my wrist, ice in my veins
But it's a cold, cold world, and you can be predator, you can be prey
I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full 
Run through the night, playin' with your life
Go against the pack, that's risking your life 
Better play it right, better play it right
'Cause I was raised by the wolves , ate 'til they full 
Run through the night , playin' with your life 
Go against the pack, that's risking your life 
Better play it right, yeah, you better play it right
I was raised by the wolves 
I was raised by the wolves 
I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full 
Run through the night, playin' with your life 
Go against the pack, that's risking your life 
Better play it right, yeah, you better play it right
