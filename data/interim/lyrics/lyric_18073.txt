Ha
Yeah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Woo
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
I may run and hide
When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent
In flashes of light
All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
Lookin' at the crowd
And I see your body sway, come on
Wishin' I could thank you
In a different way, come on
'Cause all of your time spent
Keeps us alive, yeah
All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
Ooh-ooh 
Ooh-ooh 
All of your time spent
Keeps us alive 
Every time we're down
You can make it right
All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
 Every time we're down
 You can make it right
 That's what makes you larger than life
 Yeah!
All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger— 
That makes you larger—
That makes you larger than life
