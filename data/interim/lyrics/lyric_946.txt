Years from now
Maybe I'll be thankful
You said goodbye
But if you leave me tonight
I know I'll cry
And the reason I'll cry
Is cause I love you
Yes, I love you, baby
You know I love you
And I thought you
Felt the same way too
Years from now
My heartaches and the
Suffering will be gone
I know I'll miss you
Miss you when I'm all alone
And the reason I'll miss you
Is cause I need you
Yes, I need you, baby
You know I need you, yeah
I did my best to please you
Cause I love you
Yes, I love you, baby
You know I love you, yeah
You know that my love is true
Years from now
Years from now
It's gonna be all over
One day, woman
It's gotta be all over
But all the heartaches
And suffering will be gone
Remember, darling
I love you, love you
Yeah, I love you so much
Years from now...
