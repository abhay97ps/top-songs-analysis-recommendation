Radio Killa 
Did a song with the American Dream, uh 
They can't put it down like this, no no no no
On my baby, she my shawty
They gotta trip all up on their breath
They hate on us 
Now who's right there every time you cry?
Gonna sleep and wake up on your side?
Endless love I'll always provide
They hatin' on us and you should know why
But who's be lovin' you lately?
Who's willing to go half on the baby?
Who who who's trying to flag our ship?
They just tryin' to get the love you give, but baby
Tell me what they know about my love 
Tell me what they know about my love 
Tell me what they know about my love 
Tell me what they know about my love, oh 
Tell me what they know about my love 
Tell me what they know about my love 
Tell me what they know about my love 
Tell me what they know about my love 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Some men don't understand why I'll never leave you
Explain my love, I don't need to
Got everybody way up in our business
Us leaving each other stay on their wish list
I see them reachin' everytime you call me, baby
They on my back like a shirt
Get off me, baby
They don't love me, let 'em wonder why
Here to stay and they going bye, bye
Who's the one calling you baby
Who's in love with yo' ass like crazy
Who, ooh, ooh's tryn' to flag down ships
Just tryn' to get the love you give, baby
Tell me what they know about my love  
Tell me what they know about my love  
Tell me what they know about my love  
Tell me what they know about my love, oh 
Tell me what they know about my love

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Yo, my love is your love
There ain't nothing in this world that they can do
To make me give you up 
You'll always be my girl
So let them do whatever, say whatever
'Cause I ain't givin her up
Ooh no, no, no, no, no
Tell me what they know about my love  
Tell me what they know about my love   
Tell me what they know about my love   
Tell me what they know about my love, oh
