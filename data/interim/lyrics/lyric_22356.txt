I wanna watch you undress
I wanna watch you glow
Let your hair down
All around and cover us both
You come in waves
We crash and we roll
You surround me, pull me, drown me, then swallow me whole
You turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn
I know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you
Yeah, I run, run, run, run right into you
Oh, oh, oh
You pull me in close
You buckle my knees
I shake and I shiver just to feel you breathe
You trace my lines
I trace your lines
Stirring my soul
Shoot sparks at the heart of the world and I watch it explode
I watch you, yeah, I watch you
You turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn
I know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you
Yeah, I run, run, run, run right into you
Oh, oh, oh
I’m amazing  when you’re beside me
I am so much more
And I feel your fingers
Pound like thunder
And I am so much more
I'm so much more
You turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn
I know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you, oh
Oh, you turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn
I know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you
Still, I run, run, run, run right into you
Still I run, run, run, run right back to you
Turning me on
Like a slow fire burn
