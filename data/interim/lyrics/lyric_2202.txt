I'm down to my last heartbreak
Yes I'm down to my last heartbreak
I'm hoping, my dear, that you
Won't ever break my heart in two
Because I'm down, down, down
To my last heartbreak
I'm down, yes I'm down to my last tear
Yes I'm down to my last tear
I've cried so many times before
And now I just can't cry no more
Because I'm down, whoa down
To my last heartbreak
You know I'm down, yes I am
To my last teardrop
