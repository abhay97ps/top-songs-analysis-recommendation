Thank you for the hospitality, nice couch, warm sheets
I'm gonna get some sleep, but I'll peep the place in the morn'
Be forewarned, I'm tipsy
There was a young miss that tipped me overboard
And now I'm drowning in cheap vodka, I'm torn
Whether to smoke some more, I pour a tall glass of H2O
I know that if I don't I'll be way worse in my misery
Hard to be a busy bee when all this knowledge comes to me
And all I seem to do is write some poetry
A few thoughts that fluidly flow
A few thoughts to sew together into one short verse
And as I weather this weather and disperse, it gets worse
And I summon the porcelain goddess to swallow up this hotness
And my stomach is so nauseous
Told my friends, "Watch this!"
And as I guzzle, and guzzle and flex muscle
My liver is yelling, "Stop this!"
Tylenol bottle is yelling, "Pop this!"
'Til the glass tells my hand to drop it
So I break that shit down like hip hoppin'
Floating words, I've been through the air like Mary Poppins
When they fall back down as electrical rain drops and they shock
That's why you see me on the dance floor, I'm popping lockin'
Drop in the list of lyrical written material
Has made you spin some more criteria
That goes better together than milk and cereal
Just a theory though, a hair-brained crow-call, a verbal burial
But out some adjectives sprout and grow
Stir the pot and in some nouns we throw
And what do you know?
We now have the whole vocabulary at our disposal
Dissolve some green in seeds to see if sticky leaves appear to be
And secrete some sweetly THC for me to breathe
How could this be? Somebody must have stole the doobie
Somebody thinks they won't be caught and took me for a newby
They took the richest's man, somebody stole the ruby
Look, fool me once: you fooled me
But fool me twice: it won't be nice
I do not advise you you convince me to despise you
I'm not a violent person, but I can be quite spiteful
And when I gather up my thoughts
Until my mind's full without being mindful
I tend to see things through the eyes of a blind fool
And that's not good for anyone
I may not be great with fists
But I can melt your mind and make you fear something dumb
Convince you you no longer have opposable thumbs
Convince you you were adopted, that woman is not your mom
Convince you that every right thought you ever had was wrong
Convince you that you're not yourself, but you are truly no one
But fuck that, let's all go out and get some drinks
Smoke some weed and talk philosophy about how the stoner thinks
Put your mind on the brink
Let it grow, let it flow down a black hole
Like water down a sink
Open the floodgates; no time, no watches
Just meditation, discovering strange new consciousness
What is this? My thought process' overtaken
Too complacent 'cause every single thought's adjacent
I lasso the good ideas, so I no longer have to chase them
I make you feel so good, it's like lyrical masturbation
I spark a worry in your head that you haven't faced yet
And now it's all you think about and you find yourself pacing
You think the time you spend trippin' is time well spent
When really any time spent with worry is time well wasted
'Cause you could have partied with your friends instead
Maybe wind up in bed with some chick who gives great head
That's why I'm here to say lighten up quick
'Cause life is way to short to live it like a prick
You gotta balance good karma and learn how to stick
To the moral fibers your parents invested as a kid
Learn how to sift through the masses of bullshit
And turn a deaf ear to the foolish word spit
Some people don't quit
Some people come equipped with a good mouthpiece
And a demeanor that denies mean and embodies peace
But their peace of mind is nothing more than ignorance through speech
That's why you end up biting into such a bitter peach
It's such a beautiful concept that beauty is bitter sweet
And you may not see the ball drop until it hits your feet
That's why I try to speak from the notches I put in my belt
'Cause one can only speak from the cards they've been dealt
And make for yourself, so say it
Say that you'll go out and make mistakes
Partake in the feast that awaits
And never forsake the rain that weighs so heavy
On the levy in your mind's sea of thoughts
'Cause one day that levy's gonna bust, and when it does
You let the world float upon your sea of thoughts
You let the world float upon your sea of thoughts
You let the world float upon your sea of thoughts
You let the world float upon your sea of thoughts, yeah
You let the world float upon your sea of thoughts
You let the world float upon your sea of thoughts
You let the world uh, you let the world uh
And you may have your beautiful mind, oh, but I've got mine
You might throw malice in your words, oh, but I've heard worse
So don't think I'm pinning for your love 'cause I've got enough
And I don't think any of us know how to live without ego
No, no ego. No, no ego
Know no ego, know no ego
Know no ego
