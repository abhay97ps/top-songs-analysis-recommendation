In the night, I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh.. how could you be so heartless?
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me you know
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely
In the night, I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh... how could you be so heartless?
How could be so Dr. Evil, you bringin' out the side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't goin' speak so
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone?
Why does she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, I won't mess my groove up 'cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me
'Cause in the night, I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh.. how could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?
Oh
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight
Into the night
Into the night
In the night, I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh yeah
In the night, I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far, far, far  he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh.. how could you be so heartless?
Oh.. how could you be so heartless?
Oh.. how could you be so
So heartless?
Oh.. how could you be so heartless?
