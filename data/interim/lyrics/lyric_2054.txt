You can take your picture off your shelf
You can go around all by yourself
You can tell the others that we're through
But darling, I know one thing you can't do
You can never stop me loving you
You can never stop the way that my heart's beating too
You can never stop me loving you
That's one thing you'll never do
You can look away when I pass by
You can do your best to make me cry
You can break my heart and leave me blue
But darling I know one thing you can't do
You can hang the phone up when I call
You can say you don't love me at all
You can say its over and we're through
But darling I know one thing you can't do
You'll never stop me loving you
That's one thing you'll never do
