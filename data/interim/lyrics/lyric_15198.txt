The chills that you spill up my back keep me filled
With satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another 
Your groove I do deeply dig
No walls, only the bridge
My supper dish, my succotash wish 
I couldn't ask for another 
No, I couldn't ask for another
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart 
Groove is in the heart
The depth of hula groove
Moves us to the nth hoop
We're gonna groove to Horton Hears a Who-who
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another
DJ Soul was on a roll
I've been told he can't be sold
He's not vicious or malicious
Just de-lovely and delicious
I couldn't ask for another
Unh, some looks in this torso 
Hot, got a deal, you wanna know 
Delightful, truly delightful 
Makin' it, doin' it, 'specially at a show 
Feelin' kinda high like a Hendrix haze 
Music makes motion, moves like a maze 
All inside of me, side, heart especially 
Note of the rhythm, where I wanna be 
Flowin', glowin' with electric eyes 
You dip to the dive, baby yo, realize 
When will you see the funky side of me?
Baby, you'll see that rhythm is the key 
Get, get, wit' it, wit' it, can't think, quit it, quit it
Stomp on the street when I hear a funk beat 
Playin' Pied Piper, follow what's true
Baby, just sing about the groove! 
*Sing it*
Groove is in the heart 
Groove is in the heart 
Groove is in the heart 
Groove is in the heart
Blow them horns along
Groove is in the heart 
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Hmmmmm
He he he he
C'mon, y'all deep
Y'all are crazy, man
