This is a song about those bad days
Start up happy and end up sad days
Talking about that Murphy's law chill
If it can go wrong, yes it will
Went to the store to cop some groceries
Friday night and I had the munchies
Filled the cart till it could not take it
One more bag of chips would break it
Went to the cheek out stood in line
Behind me a girl who was just too fine
Got in the ear while they rang the total
Reached for my wallet uh oh a bolo
Not my day I felt like a dummy
Went to the store and forgot the money
Oops up inside your head
Oops up inside your head
Say oops up
Me and amy under the covers
Scene is hot potential lovers
Demon in the sack is her reputation
In school then she is graduation
Touching holding heavy breathing
I knew I'd get it she is not about teasing
Left on the light so I could see reaction
Amy is a freak guaranteed satisfaction
She is soft as bubble bath
I am as hard as chinese math
Ready for the ultimate affection
Took out a pack obtain my protection
Rolled it on one hard stroke
It was my last and yes it broke
Oops up inside your head
Oops up inside your head
Say oops up
