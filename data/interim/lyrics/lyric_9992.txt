Some enchanted evening
You may see a stranger
You may see a stranger
Across a crowded room
And somehow you know
You know even then
That somewhere you'll see him
Again and again
Some enchanted evening
Someone may be laughin'
You may hear him laughin'
Across a crowded room
And night after night
As strange as it seems
The sound of him laughter
Will sing in your dreams
Who can explain it?
Who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons
Wise men never try
Some enchanted evening
When you find your true love
When you feel him call you
Across a crowded room
Then fly to his side
And make him your own
For all through your life you
May dream all alone
Once you have found him
Never let him go
Once you have found him
Never let him go!
