Sherry don't go, talk to me girl
Give me a chance to say what's hiding only
In the corners of my mind
Don't run away, stay with me girl
Without you, all my world would tumble down
And all my dreams would crumble 'round me
Shadows would always follow me
I need your love, Sherry don't go
I need your love, Sherry don't go
I need your love
I know that yesterday I ran away
I acted like a child playing
Games he had never learned to play
I've been on the bridge all alone by the river
And watched little paper boats sail softly by
I saw in the water a bird leaving footprints in the sky
I need your love, Sherry don't go
I need your love, Sherry don't go
I need your love, Sherry don't go
I need your love, Sherry don't go
I need your love, Sherry don't go
