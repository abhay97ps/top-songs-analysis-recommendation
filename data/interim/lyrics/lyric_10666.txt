There are times when it feels so hard just to carry on
There are times when the days all seem to be so long
Then this feelin' inside of me sets me free from the past
And I know that when I'm ready
Love is gonna come at last
Yes, I know that when I'm ready
Love is gonna come at last
Been alone in a crowded room, watched it all go on
I've had so many sleepless nights when I dreamed alone
Then a break in the clouds above feels like love shinin' down
And I know that when I'm ready
Love is gonna come around
Yes, I know that when I'm ready
Love is gonna come around
I live for tomorrow
What it may bring
I live through the sorrow
Live in my dreams, in my dreams
This feelin' inside of me
Sets me free from the past
And someday I'll find a way
To make my dreams come true
'Cause I know that when I'm ready
Love is gonna come at last
Yes, I know that when I'm ready
Love is gonna come at last
Yes, I know that when I'm ready
Love is gonna come at last
Yes, I know that when I'm ready
Love is gonna come at last
Yes, I know that when I'm ready
Love is gonna come at last
