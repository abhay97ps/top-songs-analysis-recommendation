I got one girl from Philly, I think her name Nicki
And I fuck with Nicki 'cause she not too picky
And she not too choosy, but sometimes she bougie
I play with her kitty until it get sticky
I'm movin' the bitch just like an alien
Chop with a fifty, my Uzi Israeli
See, I turned to the boss, can't deal with no middleman
Anthony Davis, don't deal with the Pelicans 
Straight out the mud, we got that work that turn you to the Grudge
Leave you slime like a snail, you get hit with these slugs
I say how I feel and I do what I want
And not just because it is what it was
I'm high like a bird, man, but don't got no Lugz
Know you heard what I said, got this shit out the mud
I'm not in these streets, I'm just close with the plug
I just saw his mother, I gave her a hug
If you talkin' 'bout the work, nigga, just hide that, supply that
Stuff a hundred rounds in the compact, contact
I probably fucked the bitch from your hometown projects
Opened up her mouth, put my dick all inside that
She don't get high, but she geeked off the contact
That's why I'll never, ever, ever keep in contact 
Just closed case, so a nigga can't find that, baby, where your mind at?
Come here, girl, sign that, matter fact, oh, never mind then
Front door, find that after the climax
And she screamin' my name every time we behind it
When I heard the door, get up, baby, where my nine at?
Water on my neck, 3D like it's IMAX 
Diamonds turned a bird to a goddamn blind bat
Ass so fat that I got to hit beside that
Heard a nigga put his Lamb' trucks on finance 
Woah , y'all niggas insane
No, we're not the same, I'm more like a big body , you like a Range
These niggas, they frauds, they repping my gang 
Like, what's up with that? 
I just pulled up Maybach, yeah, and that shit all matte black, yeah
I got one girl from Philly, I think her name Nicki
And I fuck with Nicki 'cause she not too picky
And she not too choosy, but sometimes she bougie
I play with her kitty until it get sticky
I'm movin' the bitch just like an alien

Know you heard what I said, got this shit out the mud
I'm not in these streets, I'm just close with the plug
I just saw his mother, I gave her a hug
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah , it's Lil Uzi Vert
Uh, woah , it's Lil Uzi Vert
I got on my Chrome Hearts 
One, two, three, let's go 
Yeah, ever since Clifford, yeah, Uzi been the big dog
Drippin' in this Ragu, you know I got the big sauce
Every outfit, yeah, I gotta get the pic' off
Said I know, I know you gon' return to the big boss
Ran this shit back like a motherfuckin' kickoff
Forty-five-hundred for some Margiela kick-offs
Got the yellow diamond Patek on my wrist, too pissed off
Laughin' to the bank, it's funny 
Go get you some, go get your own money
Hold on, I got you with some loan money
No, matter fact, you ain't help me when I had no money
Three-hundred thousand, yeah, that's your money
Twenty more million, that's tour money
If you fuck me good, that's your money 
I got one girl from Philly, I think her name Nicki

Wait, I just gotta hit this button, I'm—
