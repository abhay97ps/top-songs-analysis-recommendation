Happiness hit her
Like a train on a track
Coming towards her
Stuck still, no turning back
She hid around corners
And she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses
And from it she fled
With every bubble
She sank with a drink
And washed it away
Down the kitchen sink
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are comin'
So you better run
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and your brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over, the dog days are done
Can you hear the horses? 'Cause here they come!
And I never wanted
Anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too
Oh
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back
Struck from a great height
By someone who should know better than that
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and your brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you, if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come!
The dog days are over
The dog days are done 
The horses are comin', so you'd better run 
The dog days and over
The dog days are done 
The horses are comin', so you'd better run
