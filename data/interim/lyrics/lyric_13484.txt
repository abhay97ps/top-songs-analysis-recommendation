Let me be the one
You give your love to
I hear your records on the radio
See you talking on the late, late show
Every girl wants to be your friend
Don't you know you're always on my mind
Oh, how I've missed you since you've hit the big time
Oh, I'm hurting
I just can't pretend
We used to be together
Making dreams, making plans
But you left that world behind
Now I'm asking you
Don't you
Let me be the one 
You give your love to
Let me be the one 
You give your love to
We used to be together
Making dreams, making plans
But you left that world behind
Now I'm asking you
Don't you
Let me be the one 
You give your love to
Let me be the one 
You give your love to
Let me be the one
You give your love to
Let me be the one
You give your love to
