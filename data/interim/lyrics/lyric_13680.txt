Ooh, baby
Anytime my world gets crazy
All I have to do to calm it
Is just think of you
It's when I think of you, baby
Nothing else seems to matter
It's when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love
I just get more attached to you
When you hold me in your arms
And squeeze me
And you leave me making me blue
It's when I think of you, baby
Nothing else seems to matter
It's when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love
So in love 
Ooh , With you 
Baby , ooh, 
Yeah , with you 
When I think of you
When I think of you
Bass
I'm so in love
I just think of you
When you're not around, I
When I think of you
 Ooh 
So in love , with you 
Baby, you , ooh 
So in love , with you 
Break
Feels so good
When I think of you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
