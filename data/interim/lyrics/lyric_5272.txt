I pulled in to Nazareth
I was feelin' 'bout half-past dead
I just need some place
Where I can lay my head
Hey, mister, can you tell me
Where can I find a bed
He just grinned, shook my hand
"No" was all he said
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me
Picked up my bag
I went lookin' for a place to hide
When I saw old Carmen and the Devil
Walking side by side
Well, I said, "Hey, Carmen
Come on, let's go downtown"
She said, "I got to go
But my friend can stick around"
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me
Go down, Miss Moses
There's nothing you can say
It's just old Luke
And Luke is waitin' on the judgement day
Well, Luke, my friend
What about young Anna Lee?
He said, "Do me a favor, hon
Won't you stay and keep Anna Lee company?"
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me
Get your cannonball now
To take me down the line
Oh, my bag is sinking low
And I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny
You know she's the only one
Who sent me here
With her regards for everyone
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me
