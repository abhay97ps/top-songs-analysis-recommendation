Why are you in so much hurry
Is it really worth the worry
Look around
Then slow down
What's it like inside the bubble
Does your head ever give you trouble
It's no sin
Trade it in
Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man
Are you always in confusion
Surrounded by illusion
Sort it out
You'll make out
Seem to make a good beginning
Someone else ends up winning
Don't seem fair
Don't you care
Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man
Don't you forget
Who'll take care of you
It don't matter
What you do
Form a duet
Let him sing melody
You'll provide the harmony
2:02 - 2:25

Hang on

From somewhere deep inside the inner man
3:19 - 3:35
Help is on it's way!
3:37 - 3:44
Help is on it's way!
