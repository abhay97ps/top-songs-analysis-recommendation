Hey cid
That man has got your name
He's makin' a rut
For your workin' soul to stay
And he's pulling you into an endless groove
Turning your golden years into a stolen youth
He can control your time as long as he's disguised
In a single working day
Everyday
You bust your ass saving your
Dimes, and again ill say
It will all pass like wind
Through the chimes hoplessly bound
Time for cash we all
Have to pay and so it's sounds
Life ain't found in a
In a single working day
In a single working day
In a single working day
A working
1, 2, 3, 4
In a single working day
A working
In a single working
