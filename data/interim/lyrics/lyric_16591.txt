I want you to dance naked
So I can see ya
I'd like to get to know ya
You dont have to act naughty
Spin around, and round
Spin around, round and round
I want you to dance naked
I promiss I won't touch you
I promise to tell no-one
I want you to dance naked
Spin around, and round
Spin around, round and round
Spin around, round and round
I want you to dance naked
If you'd like I'll join you
I want to enjoy your body
I want to hear your secrets
I want to know if you like me
As much as I like you
I want you to dance naked
But only if you want to
Spin around, and round
Spin around, round and round
Spin around, round and round
I want you to dance naked
So I can see you
I'd like to get to know you
But only if you'd want to
Spin around, and round
Spin around, round and round
Spin around, round and round
Spin around, round and round
I want you to dance naked
