Well I got a candle, and I've got a spoon
I live in a hallway with no doors, and no rooms
And under a windowsill, they all were found
A touch of concrete within the doorway, without a sound
Someone save me, if you will
And take away, all these pills
And please just save me, if you can
From the blasphemy, in my wasteland
How did I get here, and what went wrong?
Couldn't handle forgiveness, now I'm far, beyond gone
And I can hardly remember, the look of my own eyes
How can I love this, a life so dishonest, it made me compromise
Someone save me, if you will
And take away, all these pills
And please just save me, if you can
From the blasphemy, in my wasteland
Jump in the water, jump in with me
Jump on the altar, lay down with me
The hardest question, to answer
Is why, why?
Someone save me, if you will
And take away, all these pills
And please just save me, if you can
From the blasphemy, in my wasteland
Someone save me
Someone save me
Somebody save me, somebody save me
Please don't erase me
