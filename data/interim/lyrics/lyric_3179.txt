Don't try to fool me with tears in your eyes
I know it won't be long
I can feel it when we kiss
You'll soon be gone
I can tell there's something on your mind
You're just not the same
I can hear it in your voice
When you speak my name
We're gonna break up, break up, break up
I'm losing you
I can see things I never saw before
You keep hurting me more and more
Oh there's so much that I wanna say
But the right words don't come my way
We're gonna break up, break up, break up
I'm losing you
I can see things I never saw before
You keep hurting me more and more
Oh there's so much that I wanna say
But the right words don't come my way
We're gonna break up, break up, break up
I'm losing you
Break up, break up, break up
Break up, break up
