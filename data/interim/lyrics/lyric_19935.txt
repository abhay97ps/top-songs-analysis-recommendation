I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
Ooh 
Ooh 
Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothin' overnight
'Cause a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase, said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom, they see that we did that
 It's so true that
 We been through it
 We got real shit
 See, baby
We've been too strong for too long
And I can't be without you, baby
And I'll be waitin' up until you get home
'Cause I can't sleep without you, baby 
Anybody who's ever loved you know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothin' can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby, yeah
I got a question for ya 
But still I wanna ask you, will you lie? 
Make me cry? 
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is on the up and up
 I'll be faithful
 I'm for real
 And with us you'll always know the deal
We've been too strong for too long
And I can't be without you, baby 
And I'll be waitin' up until you get home
'Cause I can't sleep without you, baby 
If anybody who's ever loved you know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothin' can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby, yeah
See, this is real talk, I'ma always stay 
Good or bad 
Right or wrong 
Now if you're down on love or don't believe this ain't for you
And if you got it deep in your heart
And deep down you know that it's true
Well, let me see you put your hands up 
Fellas, tell your lady she's the one
Fellas, tell your lady she's the one
Oh, put your hands up 
Ladies, let him know he's got you locked
Look him right in his eyes and tell him
We've been too strong for too long
And I can't be without you, baby
Can't be without you, baby
I'll be waitin' up until you get home
'Cause I can't sleep without you, baby
Oh, if anybody who's ever loved you know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothin' can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you

I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
