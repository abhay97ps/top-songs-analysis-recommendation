Hey!
Yeah
Hey!
When I get chills at night, I feel it deep inside
Without you, yeah 
Know how to satisfy, keepin' that tempo right
Without you, yeah 
Pictures in my mind on replay
I'm gonna touch the pain away  
I know how to scream my own name
Scream my name
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime, day or night
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime that I like
I take it nice and slow, feeling good on my own
Without you, yeah 
Got me speaking in tongues, the beautiful it comes
Without you, yeah 
I'm gonna put my body first
And love me so hard 'til it hurts 
I know how to scream out the words
Scream the words
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime, day or night
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime that I like
Ah la la la, ah la la la la-ah 
Ah la la la, ah la la la la-ah 
Ah la la la, ah la la la la-ah
Anytime that I like
Yeah, I know how to scream my own name
Scream my name
Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh!
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime, day or night
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime that I like
Ah la la la, ah la la la la-ah 
Ah la la la, ah la la la la-ah 
Ah la la la, ah la la la la-ah 
Anytime that I like
