Belle
The Lord and I've been friends for a mighty long time
Ooh hoo, Belle
Leaving Him has never ever really crossed my mind
Let me say just one thing
I'd never go so far, mmm
'Cause it's Him no matter who you are, oh hoo
Belle
Oh, it's you that I want, but it's Him that I need
I'd like to take a little minute just to say now
Belle
The laughter of the sound has quieted down
Ooh hoo, mmm, Belle
The best thing we could do is have Him around
Now. I'm not playing, little lady, let me say this one thing
I think if love could abound
My heart was lost but now it's found
Ooh hoo, Belle
Oh, let's you and I let His love come down
I'm so happy, happy about that now, say this
Seems so easy to me
To try to act naturally
Let's not waste each other's time, time, ooh hoo
Belle
He's my surprise and, Lord, he's my joy
My joy, not a toy
Belle
I know that you can understand
A little country boy
Just a little country boy
Hey, He brought me safe thus far
Let me say it, little lady
Through many drunken country bars
Ooh hoo, Belle, oh, let me say
He's my bright morning star
Belle, Belle
My bright in the morning
He's my bright in the morning, He's
He's my everything, my everything
Hey, a drink of water
Belle
He's my joy in the morning time
Belle
I know you're all of these things, yeah
But, uh, He's such a brighter joy, He's such a brighter
He's, He's, He's
Little, little, little Belle
My everything
Everything
In the morning
In the evening
In the daytime
In the nighttime
Hey! Hey!
He's my everything, yeah! He's
Belle
Belle, Belle, Belle, Belle, Belle ...
