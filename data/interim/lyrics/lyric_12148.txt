Baby whatcha gonna do
Go ahead and make your move
First you say ya love me
Say you'll never leave me
Now you say that we are through
It's a tough world
Ain't it a rough world
Without love it's true
I don't know what I would do
So if you're gonna leave me
Go ahead and leave me
Cause I'm gonna find somebody new
Chorus
It's a tough world
Ain't it a rough world
It's a tough world rough world stab it in the back world
Tough world
It's a hard world cold world hit you where it hurts world
Rough world... Tough world
It's a tough life rough life try to make a buck life
Tough life
Get a job hotshot make it to the top
Rough life... tough life
I'm gonna hold my chin up high
I'm gonna walk right out the door
And I'm gonna make it
Yeah I'm gonna make it
Cause I don't need you anymore
Repeat chorus
