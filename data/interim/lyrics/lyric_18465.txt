They make me sick
I know I feel you, that's why we gotta stick together
Yep, yep, yep, know it
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip
I'm feeling it, I gotta get a grip
And it's driving me crazy, baby, don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick
He was doing 8-0 on the freeway
In the 6 double O, bumping Islay
He was getting kind of close, kind of touch-ay
Because he had a little too much Hennessy
He told me that he wanna go home
With me up on the hill to my condo
Told me he would keep it all on the low-low
But I told him, "Boo, I don't really know though"
He got closer to me, it started getting deep
He had me in a zone
When he started to show me things I never saw before
Baby was smooth, but I knew it was game
Hell-of-a cool, but you men are the same
The way he licked his lips and touched my hips
I knew that he was slick
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip
I'm feeling it, I gotta get a grip
And it's driving me crazy, baby, don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick
In the 6 now, so hot
Gotta pull all the windows down
Eyes lead and I'm thinking 'bout the sheets now
Wondering should I really take it there now
He told me he would make it worth it
Again, how many times have I heard this?
Kind of funny, but I was not even nervous
Well, his slick-ass lines were kind of working
I felt my knees get weak, his body was calling me
Just couldn't take the heat
Anyway, it was 2 or 3, I had to get off the streets
Baby was cool, but I knew it was game
Said, he was too schooled to be screaming my name
Even though we made the best of it
I still told him this
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip
I'm feeling it, I gotta get a grip
And it's driving me crazy, baby, don't you quit 
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Yeah, yeah
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip
I'm feeling it, I gotta get a grip
And it's driving me crazy, baby, don't you quit 
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip
I'm feeling it, I gotta get a grip
And it's driving me crazy, baby, don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Hot when you touch the tip
I'm feeling it, I gotta get a grip
And it's driving me crazy, baby, don't you quit
Can't no, no, no, no, no
Oh, you make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
