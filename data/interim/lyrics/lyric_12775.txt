Someone to count on in a world ever changing
Here I am, stop where you standing
What you need is a lover, a man to take over
Oh, girl, don't look any further
Strange when you think of the chances
That we've both been in a state of mind
Too cool to be careless, looking for the right thing
Oh, baby, don't look any further
 Tonight we're gonna taste a little paradise
 Rocking all night long
 Daylight, I'll still be looking in your ebony eyes
And we'll go on and on and on 
Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o 
Don't look any further 
Day o umba day o nam bu ji ay o 
Don't look any further
Someone to count on 
In a world ever changing 
Here I am, stop where you standing, baby
What you need is a lover 
To love you all over 
Oh baby, don't you look any further, further
Don't look any further
Don't look any further
 Tonight we're gonna taste a little paradise
 Won't you rock me all night long
 Daylight, I'll still be looking in your ebony eyes
And we'll go on and on and on and on
Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o 
Don't look any further 
Day o umba day o na jam bay um bay o yeah
Don't look any further 
Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o 
Don't look any further, further
Day o umba day o na jam bay um bay o
Don't look any further, further
Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o
Don't look any further
Day o umba day o na jam bay um bay o yaeh
Don't look any further
