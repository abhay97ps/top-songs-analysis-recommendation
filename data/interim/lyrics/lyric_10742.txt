I know your type
You're playing with me
I saw you coming from across the room
From the twinkle in your eye
To the kiss of your lips
You're telling a lie
I see thru you like a window
As soon as you've started
You're ready to go
I'm not the kind
To have the time for you
Because you kiss in the dark
And run away
Kiss in the dark
Kiss in the dark
And run away
Kiss in the dark
You're leading me on
In everything you do you try to
But I've heard about you for a long long time
I'm afraid you're gonna find
That I'm not gonna fall for
The same old lie
