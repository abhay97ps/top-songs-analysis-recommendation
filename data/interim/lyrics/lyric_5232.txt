You hurt me when you told me you will never be mine
Soon the day will roll around when I'll see you my last time
The one you really love will soon be comin' home
And I'll be the one you left standin' all alone
Can't you find another way of doin' it baby, can't you?
Can't you find another way of doin' it baby, can't you?
Ooh yeah, never, never found no, nobody,  little girl
 that I've been lookin' for, can't you find another way?
Look, I'll do my very best to get over you
But deep down in this heart of mine, I know it ain't no use
It'll be like fightin' an army with my bare hands
Knowin' all the time that I'm on the losin' end
Ooh, can't you find another way of doin' it baby, can't you?
Can't you find another way of doin' it baby, can't you?
Ooh no, never, never found no, nobody, everything little girl
Everything that I've been lookin' for, can't you find another way?
Ooh, get it, get it
Oh, we've gone a little too close for you to step out now
Don't you know, if you leave me, baby, you're surely gonna tear me down
Can't you find another way of doin' it baby, can't you?
Can't you find another way of doin' it baby, can't you?
Can't you find another way of doin' it baby, can't you?
Can't you find another way, can't you find hey hey, oh another way?
Can't you find another way of doin' it baby, can't you?
Can't you find another way of doin' it baby, can't you?
Can't you find another way of doin' it baby, can't you?
Can't you find another way of doin' it baby, can't you?
