Hyyyyyyyyy hyyy hyyy
Hmmmmmmmm mmm mmm
My love, she throws me like a rubber ball
But she won't catch me or break my fall
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a raincloud
You know she wants a dry kind of love
I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
I wanted to run, but she made me crawl
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw
I know I got black eyes
But they burn so brightly for her
I guess it's a blind kind of love
I'm losin' you, whoa oh hyyyy
I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
Aaaaahhhhh 
Blue-eyed boy meets a brown-eyed girl
You can sew it up, but you still see the tear
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a rain-cloud
Ours is a stormy kind of love
 the sweetest thing
Ohohoh, the sweetest thing
