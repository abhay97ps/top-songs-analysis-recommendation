Lover, take your heart out of cover
Let me help you discover a perfect love
Look high, there's a bright in the blue sky
Don't you know that you can't buy a perfect love?
Darling, I can promise you always
That your future in all ways will be shiny and bright
Don't hide, let the sunshine be inside
Let your hopes be at high tide and far above
Lover, take your heart out of cover
Let me help you discover a perfect love
Lover, take your heart out of cover
Let me help you discover a perfect love
