Slow dance, slow
Slow dance, slow dance
Slow, slow
Hey, Mr. DJ
Why don’t you slow this party down
The ladies in here are fly
And there’s one who’s caught my eye
I wanna pull her close to me
And whisper sweet things in her ear, oh, yeah
'Cause tonight I’m full of fire, baby
And you’re the only one my heart desires
You’re the only one I wanna slow dance with
You’re the only one I wanna slow dance with
Let the music play
'Cause I wanna get it on
Put your arms around me, baby
And let’s start a slow grind, grind
I’m gonna rock and roll and rock it all night long, baby, baby
What you’re giving me is a feeling so strong, so strong
Feel my nature rise, girl
I’m gonna make you feel good tonight, you’re the only one
You’re the only one I wanna slow dance with
You’re the only one I wanna slow dance with
Let me lead you to the middle of the floor, oh baby
I’ll put my arms around you and I won’t let go
Slow, oh, oh
You’re the only one I wanna slow dance with
You’re the only one I wanna slow dance with
See, it’s one o’clock in the morning
And the party’s just beginnin’, yeah
And I wanna slow dance with you, baby, before the night is through
See, I’ve been watchin’ you
And I know you’ve been watching me, too
