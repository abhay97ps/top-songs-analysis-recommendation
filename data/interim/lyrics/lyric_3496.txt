Shouts to Pnny
Shouts to Ice World, Rockee
Can’t go broke, mothafucka, nah
I’m on a Kloud like Lia
Ice World, that’s some gang shit
You taking shots? Don’t see ya
Nah, I know you got no clip
Tap in let me focus, make your future look hopeless
Man I almost went homeless
Then bossed up on that G shit
On my ‘better have the fee’ shit
Nah, I don’t do no free shit
Unless I see you poppin’
We can split the profit
On some whole family eats shit
On the wave, watch em copy
Watch ‘em go and try to mock me
Watch ‘em go, do it sloppy
Bet they know that I’m OG
Ask them they say they don’t know me
I ain’t gon’ fuck with no phonies
I just been staying so lowkey
I just been staying so lowkey
I’m just gon’ chill with my homies
All of you opps is just fake
Know that ain’t real fucking BAPE
Know that’s a fake Gucci bag
I been really in my bag
That’s why all my shit is delayed, yo
Vlone Villian shoutout to Pnny
Got the Magic, got Heat like Shaq and Penny
CG and Pnny, new Woods and Henny
Don’t ask me questions if it don’t give me money
Mothafucka I be grindin’ dawg
I’m tryna get a mil and split it with my dawgs
So don’t you get in my way, or you gonna get paved
I’m a bully y'all, I’m standing 6’2
My boys is standing tall
Burn my woods with gang
Cause I don’t fuck with y’all
Stopped sippin’ tech, almost lost my mind
Then I lost my man and now I gotta ball
Man, ain’t it funny how shit work
I remember used to ship work
Imma get mine, no wasting time
I’m focused on the big picture
Laundry mat where they stash it
Green Bay da package know that’s that good work
Kickin’ shit like Liu Kang
So you know I gotta put my foot first
She off of a pill, shit could get real
Shorty know how I’m feeling
And she looking so appealing
Like baseball how we stealing
And we dealing, cause everybody want a dollar
Stupid bitches tryna holla
Dunking shit, Iguodala
I’m feeling like Kyrie
My bro in the street and he serving that Miley
My niggas ain’t had no choice
We just had to go do this shit, like it’s Nike
Big guns no fighting, a lot of thunder no lightning
Niggas grindin’ hard so we shining
These bitches coming through pining
Kick her out cause she whining
I can tell you bout the timing
This shit feel like perfect timing
Johnny Juliano
Niggas with me and it feel like a huddle
Big fight, I ain’t talk royal rumble
Got a lot of drip, niggass steppin’ in puddles
Fuck a lot of hoes, but they know they can’t cuddle
Off exotic pack, vision built for the tunnel
Bout to pour me a four of that Robbie Hummel
That, that, that lean shit
Dummie
