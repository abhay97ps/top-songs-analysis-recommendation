Lady Luck and Four Leaf Clovers
Won't ease this hurt I feel all
Over
My life was one special occasion
'til your leavin' dampened the situation
I'm Standing On Shakey Ground
Ever since you put me down
Standinf On Shakey Ground
Ever since you put me down
My car got reposessed this morning
Harder times I haven't seen in years
You'd better thorw me a life
Preserver
'cause I'm about to drown
In my own tears
I'm Standing On Shakey Ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing On Shakey Ground
Ever since you put me down
