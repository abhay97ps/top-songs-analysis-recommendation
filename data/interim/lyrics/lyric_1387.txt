May I explain right from the start
You've always been queen of my heart
Ooh wee ooh wee
Queen of my heart
No matter what I've said or done
To me you'll be, my only one
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Queen of my heart
Here is my heart
To do with as you please
Here is the key
Open and you'll see
You'll find a love, a love all your own
Here lies your treasure, here lies your throne
Queen of my heart
No matter what I've said or done
To me you'll be my only one
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Queen of my heart, queen, queen of my heart
Queen of my heart
