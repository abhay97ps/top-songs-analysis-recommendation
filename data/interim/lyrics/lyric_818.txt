A little feeling
That comes and goes
A little feeling
No one seems to know
Must have come
From way above
That little feeling
Called love
It's only minutes
But she's gone
But oh woe oh
How they seem so long
Must have come
From way above
That little feeling
Called love
I don't know right from wrong
When I'm in my baby's arms
And oh her love's so strong
I know there just can't be any harm
I don't know what I'm gonna do
All I know is I wanna love you
Here it comes
From way above
That little feeling
Called love
Here it comes
From way above
That little feeling
Called love
