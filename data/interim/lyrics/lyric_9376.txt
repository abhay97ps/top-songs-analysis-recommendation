I'm singing about, I love you girl
I'm singing about
Sometimes, when late at night when I wake up
And I find you there
I thank god 'cause he answered all of my prayers
Hey there's plenty of sunshine
To follow the rain
I know when you're mine, baby
Why should we complain
You're so fine, glad you're mine
My baby, baby
You said I am the brightest and
All of your
Honey, I said thanks for the lifeliness
And love so many ways
Plenty of sunshine
To follow the rain
I know when you're mine, baby
Why should we complain
My baby
Yes you're my...
Glad your mine, sweet baby, baby
Ohhh, girl girl girl
Such a
Ohh baby, my baby
And I'm glad you're my baby
My baby, my baby
You're...
I said you're...
My baby, baby
Oh baby baby baby baby
I love you little girl
