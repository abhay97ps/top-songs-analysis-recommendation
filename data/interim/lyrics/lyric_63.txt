Blue's not the word
For the way that I feel
And the storm's brewing
In this heart of mine
This is no crazy dream
I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now
You're not mine
Crazy arms that reach
To hold somebody new
But my yearning heart
Keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon
To another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely
All the time
So, please take the treasured
Dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love
I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms
May hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonely
All the time
Crazy arms that reach
To hold somebody new
But my yearning heart
Keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon
To another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely
All the time
And that's why I'm lonely
All the time
