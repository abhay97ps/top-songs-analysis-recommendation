Hey, hey, hey, here I go now
Here I go into new days
Hey, hey, hey, here I go now
Here I go into new days
I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Yeah, hey, hey, hey, yeah
Here I go into new days
Hey, hey, hey, ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me
Hey, hey, hey, ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me
I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey, no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me
Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear
Hey, hey, hey, and I went
And I went on down that road
Hey, hey, hey, and I went on
And I went on down that road
I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, and I went on
And I went on down that road
Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear
Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear
(I'm gone! I'm gone!
I'm gone! I'm real gone!)
(I'm gone! I'm gone, baby!
I'm gone! I'm gone!)
Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear
Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear
