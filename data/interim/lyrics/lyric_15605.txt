Verse:
Do you like philosophy
What are your political views
I really think that I...
Could learn a lot from you
I never even noticed
The way you dress
That was never my
Main interest
Chorus:
For your mind
For your mind
Verse:
Do you like to meditate
Do you analyse your dreams
You know all the other guys
Only want one thing
B section:
I'm not after your body
That's all good & fine
I don't want your body
I only want you
I really only want you
Chorus:
For your mind
For your mind
Even though lookin' that good
Should be a crime
I really only want you
For your mind
B section:
I'm not after your body
That's all good & fine
I don't want your body
I only want you
I really only want you
Chorus:
For your mind
For your mind
Even though lookin' that good
Should be a crimе
I really only want you
For your mind
For your mind
Other guys want more
But that would keep mе satisfied
For your mind
