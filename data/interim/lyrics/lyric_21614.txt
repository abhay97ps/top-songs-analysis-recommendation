I don't give a damn
'Bout the castle on the hill
All the gold that we could eat
Or the horse you have for sale
No, I'm getting kind of rich
On the side of any soul alive
I don't give a damn
If I'm runnin' from the law
When my money's not enough
And they come and take it all
No, I'm getting kind of rich
On the side of any soul alive
Have you heard my Mona Lisa?
Have you heard who you are?
You're a new morning
You're a new morning
Want to be okay
When I'm sittin' here alone
Not just thinkin' of the ways
That I could've done it wrong
No, I'm getting kind of rich
On the side of any soul alive
Have you heard my Mona Lisa?
Have you heard who you are?
You're a new morning
You're a new morning
You're a new morning
Now you're a new morning, now
Have you heard my Mona Lisa?
Have you heard who you are?
You're a new morning
You're a new morning
You're a new morning
Now you're a new morning, now
