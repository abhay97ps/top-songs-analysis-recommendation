Hull
I've travelled the land with a guitar in my hand
And an eye ever open for some fun
I've made some mistakes, had my share of the breaks
Seen the boys on the make and on the bum
Run for home, run as fast as I can
Oh, running man, running for home
Run for home, run as fast as I can
Oh, running man, running for home
I've seen all the frowns on the faces of the clowns
And the downs that they take just to be free
I've seen all the girls in their pretty frocks and curls
But they don't mean a lot to me
Run for home, run as fast as I can
Oh, running man, running for home
I've been to the places in town where the faces
Hang 'round just to stare at each other
I've looned with them, scream at the moon
Behaved like a buffoon but I soon discovered
Run for home, run as fast as I can
Oh, running man, running for home
Run for home, run as fast as I can
Oh, running man, running for home
Run for home, run as fast as I can
Oh, running man, running for home
I've travelled the land, made mistakes out of hand
Seen the faces in the places misunderstand
Yes, I've travelled the world, seen the pretty boys and girls
Heard the noise that destroys and commands
Run for home, run as fast as I can
Oh, running man, running for home
Run for home, run as fast as I can
Oh, running man, running for home
