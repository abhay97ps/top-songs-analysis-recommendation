He was hard as a rock
But I was ready to roll
What a shock to find out
I was in control
Of the situation
I didn't need no
Time or destination
He said, say, you look divine
Have I met you before
I said, your place or mine
He said, hard to be sure
Of an invitation
In these times of
Casual, quick relations
Go, baby, go
Get it on, boy
Show what you know
There's a fire down below
Go, baby, go
It doesn't matter to me
He thought I'd be impressed
By his rotating bed
Such a woman suppressed
Surely needs to be led
To complete elation and I've
Had my share of conversation
Go, baby, go
Get it on, boy
Show what you know
Oh, there's a fire down below
So, go, baby, go
It doesn't matter to me
No, no, no
He had four on the floor
And I was ready to clutch
I said, give me some more
He said, you're too much
For my inclinations and
I've had my share of invitations
Go, baby, go
Get it on, boy
Show what you know
Oh, there's a fire down below
So, go, baby, go
It doesn't matter to me
Oh, Butter Boy
Go, baby, go
Get it on, boy
Show what you know
Oh, there's a fire down below
Go, baby, go
It doesn't matter to me
No, no, no
Go, baby, go
Get it on, boy
Show what you know
Yeah, there's a fire down below
So, go, baby, go
It doesn't matter to me
