Talk to her please Mr. Sun
Speak to her Mr. Rainbow
And take her under
Your branches Mr. Tree
Whisper to her Mr. Wind
Sing to her Mr. Robin
And Mrs. Moonlight
Put in a word for me
Tell her how I feel
It shouldn't end this way
Since you are all her friends
She'll listen to what you say
Tell it to her Mr. Moon
Kiss her for me Miss Raindrop
And watch to see they all do
Please Mr. Sun
Please Mr. Sun
Mr. Sun
