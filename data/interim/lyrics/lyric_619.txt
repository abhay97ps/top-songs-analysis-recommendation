Don't worry 'bout me
It's all over now
Though I may be blue
I'll manage somehow
Love can't be explained
Can't be controlled
One day it's warm
Next day it's cold
Don't pity me
'Cause I'm feeling blue
Don't be ashamed
It might have been you
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh, love
Kiss me one time, then go, love
I'll understand
Don't worry 'bout me
Sweet, sweet, sweet, love
I want you to be
As happy as I
When you love me
I'll never forget you
Your sweet memory
It's all over now
Don't worry bout me
When one heart tells
One heart
One heart goodbye
One heart is free
One heart will cry
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, oh sweet
Sweet baby, sweet, baby sweet
It's alright
Don't worry 'bout me
