I have always been a little shy
I've always been the quiet type 'till now
I-I-I, I never let my feelings show
I never let anybody know just how
Much I was so deep in love
But now that you're in my arms
I'm gonna stand on a rooftop
Climb up a mountaintop
Baby, scream and shout
I wanna sing it on the radio
Show it on a video
Baby, leave no doubt
I want the whole world to know 
Just what I'm all about
I love to love you out loud
You keep bringing out the free in me
What you do to my heart just makes me melt
And I-I-I, I don't think I can resist
But I've never been one to kiss and tell
Our love this true, can't be subdued
So I'm gonna let out a yell
I'm gonna stand on a rooftop
Climb up a mountaintop
Baby, scream and shout
I wanna sing it on the radio
Show it on a video
Baby, leave no doubt
I want the whole world to know 
Just what I'm all about
I love to love you out loud
Baby, I want the whole world to see
Just how good your love looks on me
I'm gonna stand on a rooftop
Climb up a mountaintop
Baby, scream and shout
I wanna sing it on the radio
Show it on a video
Baby, leave no doubt
I want the whole world to know 
Just what I'm all about
I love to love you
Baby, I love to love you out loud
I love to love you out loud
