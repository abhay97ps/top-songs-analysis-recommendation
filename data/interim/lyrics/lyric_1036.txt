Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody
When you croon, croon a tune from the heart of Dixie
And just place my cradle, mammy mine
Right on the Mason-Dixon line
And swing it from Virginia
To Tennessee with all the love that's in you
Weep no more, my lady
Sing that song for me
Little joy, just as though
You had me on your knee
A million baby kisses I'm gonna deliver
The minute that you sing that Swanee River
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody
Oh, people want my fair lady
Why don't you sing the song for me?
And little joy just as though
You're happy right now
A million baby kisses I said, said I'm gonna deliver
The minute that you sing that Swanee River
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody
One more time, yeah
A million baby kisses I'm gonna deliver
The minute that you sing that Swanee River
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody, oh
