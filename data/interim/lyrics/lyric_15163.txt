There you go again
Hiding out on me
Another missing person
Trying to pretend
That our love could never be
But now I feel the tide is turning
Stop acting cool
Cause I can see right through you
The truth is in your eyes
So I'll be strong
And I'll keep on trying
Wherever you go tonight
No matter what you do
You know I won't give up on you
I don't care if it's wrong or right
I'm gonna see it through
You know I won't give up on you
I know it's getting hard
But I'll do the best I can to make it happen
Don't keep me in the dark
Cause I know where I stand
I'm always right behind you
I used to cry
But now I know much better
It's time to realize
That I'll be strong
And I'll keep on trying
Wherever you go tonight
No matter what you do
You know I won't give up on you
I don't care if it's wrong or right
I'm gonna see it through
You know I won't give up on you
Wherever you go tonight
No matter what you do
You know I won't give up on you
I don't care if I start a fight
I'm gonna see it through
You know I won't give up on you
Now time was passing
And my friends keep asking me
All I said was, "It had to be done"
What happened to the fun?
You were the girl in my world
You were the one to be with
You you say that you're the only
One to love me
Now I'm lonely
It's true
I'm blue with you
And thought we're through
Girl, I won't give up on you
Gotta keep on
Gotta keep on
Gotta keep, keep
Keep on trying
I used to cry
But now I know much better
The truth is in your eyes
So I'll be strong
And I'll keep on trying
Wherever you go tonight
No matter what you do
You know I won't give up on you
I don't care if it's wrong or right
I'm gonna see it through
You know I won't give up on you
Wherever you go tonight
No matter what you do
You know I won't give up on you
I don't care if I start a fight
I'm gonna see it through
You know I won't give up on you
