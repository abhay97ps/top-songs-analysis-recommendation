I was young, foolished
And still at that age
I gave my life color, even though its kinda beige
Young foolished, small nigga
5'6 in my height
But I got the heart of a tall nigga
Always wanted more, never settle
16 years in my life & I only one 3 medals
Yeah that's bad, but I ain't here for your sorrow at all
I know some 6'5 bums like let me borrow your tall
See what I can do with it
Riding through the H
This feeling so great
Smell that Houston air
We can be our own state
Looking for a scene to be seen
Squad getting lit, you know we be grooving
Lets hit up main event, or lets see a movie
Or lets rob a nigga, catch a nigga slipping
Man I don't want to do it cause my T lady be tripping
And I don't want to go to jail, type to never fit in
They was making cliques
I ain't want to get in
They was good with the chicks, I was mad bro
Like will my crush like me if I, if I wore my pants low
Or will she like me if i cheated on her, if I beated on her
Will she like me then?
F her then mess with her friend
I ain't want to talk to her, but we all change of plans
She said wait for me, you know how long imma stand?
I said F it, man this girl tripping
Go chill with my niggas, cause them boys be tripping
They gone stunt, they gone kick it, like a punt
My nigga dabbed me up, and he told me hit the blunt
And I ain't never smoked before, starting smoking
Hit it once and starting choking
Like nigga where you get this from?
My nigga where you get this from?
And I ain't never been high before
My mama gone kill me
And I never died before
Trynna stay up
Even though my eyes low
That's that affect when you blow
Talking with my tongue like I got lisp
Thinking why I did this
Thinking why I took this risk
Hoping that she won't be mad
Hoping she won't check my piss
Hoping she open up her hand
And don't hit me with a fist
She never hit me with fist
But its a first time for everything
Yeah, It's a first time for everything
Peace, Love, Happiness
Is what heaven brings
Yeah, Yeah
Seem like you can't put niggas on
Cause they don't rap with their tongue
Get back with they tongue
And then when you confront them
The cat got they tongue
She looks at me like I'm a devil
I see the pain in her eyes
She looks at me like I'm a rebel
I want to say I'm sorry but its really not
