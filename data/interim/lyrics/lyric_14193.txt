Your love is like salt
It's harder to be here, it's harder to see you
It's harder to go out, it's harder to hold out
Just want you close now, I just want you close
And I bet you still think about it, in your head
You still dream about it
Lime Hydrangeas in my garden
Planted them with 
Way uptown in Harlem
That's where I met my darlin'
Knew you'd end up callin'
Knew you'd end up fallin'
So in love with me
Took a knee, she sayin' "we"
Oh la la, tu mon compris
 right by the sea
Fallen bees swim in my tea
Stung my tongue and made me scream
"I love you, baby" Be my lady
Be your sunshine when it's hazy
Tulips, daisies
On an island swimmin' naked
Do we make it?
I flew across the world to chase it
I'm your favourite
Once you take your aim 
Your love is like some clockwork, baby
So let me  for you, lady
Somethin' in your smile and it makes me
Feel alive 
I'm givin' you everything
I'm finna take a trip
Right down lover's lane
Call it "Georgian Bliss"
My house is a boat
My roof is a deck
Oh sunset we should never never left
You fill my heart with salt and honey
Yeah, sweeter by the scoop
1, 2, 3 with nobody but you
Why you holdin' back when I know you want it bad
When I know you want it bad?
If you're sayin', , you know I could call your bluff
You know I could call your bluff 
Your love is like some clockwork, baby
So let me  for you, lady
Somethin' in your smile and it makes me
Feel alive 
It's harder to be here, it's harder to see you
It's harder to go out, it's harder to hold out
Just want you close now, I just want you close
And I bet you still think about it, in your head
You still dream about it, don't you?
