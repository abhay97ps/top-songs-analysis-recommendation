And when morning comes...
Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night, sleep all day
When evening comes I am alive
I love to prowl around in the streets
It's the moonlight that controls my mind
Now I've got the power to speak, yeah
Watching the city lights
They'll be shining down on you and I
And I'll hold you till the morning light
Everybody sing it now
Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night, sleep all day
That's right
Driving down the boulevard all alone
The neon signs are calling your name
Find me in the corner having the time of my life
You'd think you'd wanna do the same
Watching the city lights
They'll be shining down on you and I
And I'll hold you till the morning light
Everybody sing it now
Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night, sleep all day
That's right
Up all night, sleep all day
Come on, come on
Up all night
Ah, maybe we can just stay up
Twenty four hours a day
Watching the city lights
They'll be shining down on you and I
And I'll hold you till the morning light
Everybody sing it now
Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night, sleep all day
Come on, come on
Up all night, sleep all day
That's right
Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night
