Metro
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I kept it solid the whole time 
I ain't never, ever play both sides 
East side nigga 'bout gunfire 
Pull up in a van and the door slide 
We ain't never throwin' no white flag 
Gotta get smoke when the bros die 
They gon' spin 'til the car hot 
Don't call my phone 'til some more die
New Maybach, I don't need no key
I was in the dirt, you didn't believe in me
My attention span too short
Don't wait for pussy, you teasin' me
Bad lil' vibe, she pleasin' me
Spend a whole M, yeah, easily
I get the cash and put it up fast
I think I got JB in me
Edge of the bed, she sit up 
Suckin' on me 'til she got hiccups 
Back in the day I did stickups 
Favorite hotbox was a pick up 
Say you want smoke, don't pick us 
Face shot, now you can't get up 
Candlelight gang, nigga, shut up 
We known for shootin' shit the fuck up 
Hundred large in these Amiris, they all Crippy 
I got vibes eatin' Addys off ass and titties 
When there's smoke, we pull our stickies and they call the PD 
Many men wanna kill me, dawg, I feel like 50 
I got small fries want my spot, tryna defeat me 
I got real model bitches tryna R&B me 
All that cap inside your raps, I ain't even play your CD 
We don't go back and forth on the internet, we put niggas on TV 
I got your bitch and her BB 
Hit her in the shower, Mimi 
Next day she tryna see me 
Told her I'm blind, Stevie 
Nice girls can't even keep me 
Need a bad girl like RiRi 
We don't pump fake, we kill beef 
21 Savage, not Jeezy 
I got your bitch in the 'yo 
She in the hills on the coke 
I pull it out of my pants 
She put it right in her throat 
Fish scales smellin' like polish 
They brought it right off the boat 
Front door, back door king
I done probably robbed your bro 
Come up with a plan, better huddle 
Left wrist lookin' like a puddle 
When I'm in the street, it's trouble 
That's why I stay in my bubble 
Brand new Rari so fast, when I stomp the pedal to the floor, it stutter 
I ain't use a rubber and I make eggs, that's why I'm chasin' this butter 
Hundred large in these Amiris, they all Crippy 
I got vibes eatin' Addys off ass and titties 
When there's smoke, we pull our stickies and they call the PD 
Many men wanna kill me, dawg, I feel like 50 
I got small fries want my spot, tryna defeat me 
I got real model bitches tryna R&B me 
All that cap inside your raps, I ain't even play your CD 
Won't go back and forth on the internet, we put niggas on TV 
When there's smoke, we pull our stickies and they call the PD
Many men wanna kill me, dawg, I feel like 50
Many men wanna kill me, dawg, I feel like 50
Many men wanna kill me, dawg, I feel like 50
Many men wish death upon—
Many men wish death upon—
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away
The evil man envies the good in others
What this means is all hatred is really born from hatred of self
And can only serve to aid in one's own destruction
This is the downfall of many men
