(Aaah! You said that word
I'm gonna tell yo momma on you
She's gonna whip you too
That's what she gonna do) --] Joe Tex
Gazoose! Holy cow! Golly gee!
Dagnabit! Great Caesar's ghost!
Man, what you say?
I say, Yikes! Hush, darn it!
Wait a cotton pickin' minute!
Heavens to Murgatroid!
Take it away
I'm rubber, you're the glue sticks
Everything you say will bounce off of me back to you if the shoe fits
Potty mouths got me hot like a coffee pot
You're more predictable than a _Rocky_ plot
Save the four letter words, keep the gunshot
It's all talk, you're as fruity as a kumquat
And I'm supposed to be shocked? Stop, zip your lip
Quit, all you wanted was a pop hit, hypocrite
Don't take him serious, he needs to be laughed at
So play the laugh track 
Try a preposition, pronoun or an adverb
Cause you haven't said a thing, just a bad word
Ooooh
You're puckerin up, then you huff and you puff
And then cover the cuss with a 
Ooooh
You're puckerin up, then you huff and you puff
And then cover the cuss with a 
You're puckerin up, then you huff and you puff
And then cover the cuss with a 
Ooh ooh, shame on you
Tell me what you're tryin to do
You better watch your mouth
You better watch your mouth
Ooh ooh, shame on you
Tell me what you're tryin to do
You better watch your mouth
You better watch your mouth
Do you kiss your mother with a mouth like that?
Can't you find another way to make people react?
It ain't the way you're supposed to behave when you're grown
Potty mouths stinkin up the microphone
Your vocabulary's germ-ridden, I will call a septic
A fungus among us, spray the disinfective
You talk and spreads it, better get a medic
Or everybody gets it and it's an epidemic
You're like a trash truck, so keep your trap shut
All you really wanna do is make a fast buck
That's why rap sucks, it's too limited
Potty mouths wanna keep hip-hop primitive
I'm not sayin that I never cuss
But profanity shouldn't be a crutch
So now you been caught, shoulda thought when you spoke
Wash the potty mouth out with soap
Ooooh
You're puckerin up, then you huff and you puff
And then cover the cuss with a 
Ooooh
You're puckerin up, then you huff and you puff
And then cover the cuss with a 
Ooh ooh, shame on you
Tell me what you're tryin to do
You better watch your mouth
You better watch your mouth
Ooh ooh, shame on you
Tell me what you're tryin to do
You better watch your mouth
You better watch your mouth
Ooh ooh, shame on you
Tell me what you're tryin to do
You better watch your mouth
You better watch your mouth
