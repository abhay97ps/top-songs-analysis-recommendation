Preacher said he died too young
Over there toting that gun
For Uncle Sam and our freedom
Mom and Daddy dressed in black
They folded up that flag
Handed it to dad
And started praying
Yeah he went out 21 guns blazing
And that's One Hell of an Amen
That's the only way to go
Fighting the good fight
Till the good Lord calls you home
And so be well, my friend
Until I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a Hell of an Amen
Doctor said he ain't got long
He just smiled said bring it on
If you think I'm scared
You got it all wrong
A little cancer can't break me
My heart's right and I believe
We all hit our knees
Started praying
No, he never gave up
Said the Good Lord's waiting
And that's One Hell of an Amen
That's the only way to go
Fighting the good fight
Till the good Lord calls you home
And so be well, my friend
Until I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a Hell of an Amen
So be well my friend
Til' I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a Hell of an Amen
Amen
It's a Hell of an Amen
