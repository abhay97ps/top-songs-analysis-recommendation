Said it sounds so good to me
You gotta get on up 
Hey yeah, hey yeah 
Say it again, Jodeci 
Oh, gotta get on up 
Wait a minute, let me tell you...
Everybody grab somebody
Turn this mutha into a party
Fellas take your lady's hand
Ladies go and choose your man
There's no need to be afraid
Friday night, let's all get paid
Positive is the attitude
Negative is not the mood
Get on up 
You gotta get on up now
Get on up
And you can't sit down
You gotta get on up now
And you can't sit down
Now that everybody's movin'
Everybody in here is groovin'
Everything is alright
The atmosphere is so nice
The DJ is doin' his duty
All the ladies shakin' their booty
And the night is still young
And the party's just begun
Get on up 
And you can't sit down
You gotta get on up now
And you can't sit down
Get on up 
And you can't sit down
You gotta get on up now 
Get on up 
And you can't sit down
You gotta get on up now
And you can't sit down
Get on up 
And you can't sit down
You gotta get on up now
Party 
All day 
Never stop 
Never stop 
And you can't sit down
Get on up
And you can't sit down
You gotta get on up now
And you can't sit down
You gotta get on up now 
Get on up...
