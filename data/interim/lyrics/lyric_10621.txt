You play with my heart
There's no doubt about it
I'm crazy 'bout you, girl
I stand up and shout it
But you got what you bargained for
I can't stand this pain no more
I just want to let you know that I found out
Take it back
Take back your love
Take it back
Take back your love
I heard all the lying
I know that you said it
But now the tables have turned
And you're gonna get it
Who do you think you are?
You're pushing your love too far
I just want to let you know that I found out
Take it back
Take back your love
Take it back
Take back your love
After all that we've been through
The last laugh is now on you
I just want to let you know that I found out
Take it back
Take back your love
Take it back
Take back your love
Take it back
Take back your love
Take it back
Take back your love
Take it back
Take back your love
Take it back
