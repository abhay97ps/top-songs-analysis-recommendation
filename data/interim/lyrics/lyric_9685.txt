To take a look and walk away
Isn't a stand man
To speak the words that everyone's heard
Isn't the way man
Everybody knows
All things must come and go
But
You know like I know that
Everything's gonna be alright
People just come and go
They don't know what's right
Till they're gone
Your sun will rise and set today
Just don't you worry
And everything will come your way
Just don't you hurry
Take a little time
And find you some peace of mind
Then
You'll know like I know that
Everything's gonna be alright
People just come and go
They don't know what's right
Till they're gone
Nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah...
