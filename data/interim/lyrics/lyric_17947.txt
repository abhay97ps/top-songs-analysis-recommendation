I'm the D-M-X, an unstoppable force
The only way I'll ever stop is if my voice goes hoarse
But then again that wouldn't stop me, because nothing can
I lose my voice, I switch the style and make a rhyme with my hands
I'll make you leaf/leave like a wreath, step on you like a peddle
If rap was the Olympics, I would have a Gold Medal
Rhymes I kick it like Kato, mold you like clay dough
Squash you like a tomato, peel you like a potato
I'ma wildcat, style that, puts me on top of the pile
For a while, I'll smile cause on the drop of a dime
I'm just about to rhyme
Fuck doing a crime cause I don't have the time
Or the effort, I left it alone when I was younger
Went from a  into a fearless hunger
Now I wonder, how I, ever made the transformation
From an unknown, to my music being played more over, told ya
I'm a Casanova, fucking every girl that doesn't mind bending over
I'm a player, layer, dope rhyme sayer
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J ya, L-M-N-O-P ya
Q-R-S-T ya, you'll be a W-X-Y-Z ya
Every time I see ya, another wannabe ya
Just like me a, the capital D to the M to the X is
No I'm not a sexist, nationally known from New York to Texas
Sail  it like a river, can't stand liver
So cold I make you shiver, cry then quiver
I'ma pimp with a limp that's far from a wimp
And even though I'm not supposed to, I love to eat shrimp
And Lobster
No I'm not a mobster or gangster or criminal
That the women'll call a prankster
The boss going out at all cost
I'm DMX, an unstoppable force
"Unstoppable Force
DMX an unstoppable force"
I'm the unstoppable force of, rhymin', I'm the boss of
Crime and the same time, I'm in the course of
Saying what I like with a jet black mic
Without a cord, I'm never bored because I fight
With my mic, steadily, battles I win em
Deadly as a snake with rattles and venom
Hmmm, now think again
Do you still think you can step to me, and win?
No I didn't think so, I ran out of ink so
A pencil will make it so funky it stinks
So dope, I'll get a crackhead high
And then again, he'll OD and die
So may I, say I, been labeled as a bully
Am I semi, no because I'm fully
Automatically loaded, dramatically exploded
Exploit it, avoid it, why, because I wrote it
The mic is like a weapon when I'm steppin to
I'm getting wreck like a demolition crew
And I'll bet, your girlfriend sweats, I know who
But I'm a threat, there ain't a damn thing you can do
When I press up, cause I fess up
Mess up and fuck up
Flash a little too much cash and you getting stuck up
Diss the X, you won't get far
Do it, and I'ma smack you like the bitch you are
Because you're a sucker butt, PooPutt
There's nothing you could do but shut up
Cause I'm fed up with you but, I'ma let you slide
Cause I'm in a nice mood
But on the other hand, I don't mind being rude
Extremely quick to flip, or take no junk
Better than Dominique on a reverse slam dunk
Five foot eleven which is not that tall
But I can handle a rapper just like a basketball
So before you fill your oats and start thinkin you're fly
You better act like Sybil and "Walk on By"
"Unstoppable force
DMX, an unstoppable force" 8x
An unstoppable force, not to be reckoned with
Clear my throat, get to one two checkin with
A mic, I'll beat up, slow down and speed up
Mixed the batter, serve you on a platter and eat up
I know you wanna do me, you would if you could
So when I'm hungry, you're finger lickin' good
Better than a three course, you feel the remorse
Of the U-N S-T-O-P-P-A-B-L-E force
"Unstoppable force
DMX, an unstoppable force" 8x
