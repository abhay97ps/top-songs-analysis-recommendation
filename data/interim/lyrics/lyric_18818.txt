I got me a brand new car
Waiting in the driveway
Shining like a bright new star
I've been wishing on it every day
To take me away from here
So I called in to where I work
Told a little white lie
No, my back don't really hurt
But that's my alibi
My temporary ticket to anywhere but there
Call it an early weekend
Call it going off the deep end
Call it what you want
I made up my mind
I don't have to be me 'til Monday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday
I ain't gonna face reality
Three days without punching a time clock
Three nights of goin' non-stop
No work and all play
I don't have to be me 'til Monday
Yeah
I can do what I wanna do
Be who I wanna be
I got no one to answer to
Soon as I turn the key
A cash machine, gasoline, and we're outta here
Call it an early weekend
Call it going off the deep end
Baby, you and me
We can leave it all behind
'Cause I don't have to be me 'til Monday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday
I ain't gonna face reality
Three days without punching a time clock
Three nights of going non-stop
No work and all play
I don't have to be me 'til Monday
Oh, three days without punching a time clock
Three nights of going non-stop
No work and all play
I don't have to be me 'til Monday
I don't have to be me 'til Monday
I don't have to be me 'til Monday
I don't have to be me 'til Monday
