Hmm, I'm wide awake, I’m wide awake
I'm wide awake
Hey, I'm wide awake, I’m wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain’t no stress on me Lord, I’m movin' forward
Keep movin’ forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I’m movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Hmm, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
Hey, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
Very rarely do you catch me out
Y'all done "specially invited guest"'d me out
Y'all been tellin' jokes that's gon' stress me out
Soon as I walk in, I'm like, "Let's be out"
I was off the chain, I was often drained
I was off the meds, I was called insane
What a awesome thing, engulfed in shame
I want all the rain, I want all the pain
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame
Cardio audio, let me jog your brain
Caught in the Audy Home, we was all detained
All of you Mario, it's all a game
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I had my issues, ain't that much I could do
Peace is somethin' that starts with me 
At times, wonder my purpose
Easy than to feel worthless
But, peace is somethin' that starts with me 
Had so much on my mind, I didn't know where to go
I've come a long way from them hauntin' me
Had me feelin' oh so low
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
Oh, things ain't like before
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
No stress yes, I'm so blessed and—
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Something was wrong 
Couldn't hold on, why? 
So long 
Sit here in this storm 
Time goes on 
Really couldn't find my way out 
Of the storm 
Which way do I go?
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward 
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward 
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward 
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
