Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
If he will be, if he will be here
Oh, woah
Santa, tell me  if you're really there 
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me  if he really cares 
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me  if you're really there 
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year 
Santa, tell me  if he really cares 
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
