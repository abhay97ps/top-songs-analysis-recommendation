Maybe I know that he's been a-cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do?
I hear them whisperin' when I walk by
"He's gonna break her heart, and make her cry"
I know it's me they're talking about
I bet they all think I'll never find out
Oh, but maybe I know that he's been a-cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do?
My friends are tellin' me that he's no good
He isn't treating me the way he should
"He really loves me," that's all I can say
Before my tears fall, I just walk away
Oh, but maybe I know that he's been a-cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do? Woah-oh
Deep down inside he loves me
Though he may run around
Deep down inside he loves me
Someday he'll settle down
Maybe I know that he's been a-cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do?
"He really loves me," that's all I can say
Before my tears fall, I just walk away
Oh, maybe I know that he's been a-cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do? Oh-oh-oh-oh
Maybe I know that he's been a-cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do?
