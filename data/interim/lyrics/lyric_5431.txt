Oh, the Coo Coo, she's a pretty bird
And she warbles when she flies
But she never hollers cuckoo
Till the fourth day of July
Said, Jack O'Diamonds, well, Jack O'Diamonds
Well, I know you of old
Honey you robbed me of my silver and out of all my gold
All of my gold, all of my gold
Well, Jack O'Diamonds, oh Jack O'Diamonds
Oh, I know you of old
Honey, you robbed me of my silver
And out of all my gold
Said the Coo Coo, she's a cruel bird
And she warbles when she flies
And every time that she passes
My true love says good-bye
Well, says good-bye, well, says good-bye
Ooh, ooh, ooh, whoo, ooh
