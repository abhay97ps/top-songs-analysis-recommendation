And on a Monday, I'm gonna love ya
And on a Tuesday, I'm gonna hug ya
And on a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Saturday, Sunday, gonna love ya
I work for you, baby, work my hand to the bone
Care for you, baby, till the cows come home
Do for you, baby, for the love that I seek
Slave for you, baby, every day of the week
Scrub your dirty floor
I do a whole lot more
I wash your dirty clothes
To have a little lovin' 'fore the weekend goes
And I'll be, your seven day fool
And I'll be, your seven day fool
And I'll be, your seven day fool
Only because I really love you
And on a Monday, I'm gonna love ya
And on a Tuesday, I'm gonna hug ya
And on a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Saturday, Sunday, gonna love ya
I work for you, baby, work my hand to the bone
Care for you, baby, till the cows come home
Do for you, baby, for the love that I seek
Slave for you, baby, every day of the week
I'll treat you, oh, so kind
I'll take you out to dine
I'll work double time
If you'll only say you're be mine
And I'll be, your seven day fool
And I'll be, your seven day fool
And I'll be, your seven day fool
Only because I really love you
Ya ya, I'm gonna love ya
Oh, I'm gonna hug ya
Oh, give me all of that love
I scrub your dirty floor
I do a whole lot more
I wash your dirty clothes
To have a little lovin' 'fore the weekend goes
And I'll be, your seven day fool
And I'll be, your seven day fool
And I'll be, your seven day fool
Only because I really love you
And on a Monday, I'm gonna love ya
And on a Tuesday
