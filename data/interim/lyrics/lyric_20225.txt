Like red on a rose
When your lips first smiled at me
I was captured instantly
To each his own
Like blue in the sky
The gaze of your willing eyes
Touched something deep inside
And the truth be known
That I love you
Like all little children love pennies
And I love you because I know that
I can't do anything wrong
You're where I belong
Like red on a rose
And I love you
Like all little children love pennies
And I love you
Like good times of which
I've known many
And I love you
Because I know you give me
A heart of my own
You make my blood flow
Like red on a rose
