Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Oh, hold me closer, closer and closer
Much closer while the music plays
Mmm, my little darling
Won't you dance with me?
Oh, hold me tighter, tighter and tighter
Much tighter while the rhythm sways
Mmm, put your lips to mine
While the music blends
We're no longer strangers
Now we're more than friends
So dance with me, dance with me
Closer, closer and closer
And maybe we'll be lovers
When the music ends
 Whoa
 Whoa
 Whoa
 Dance with me
Closer, closer and closer
And maybe we'll be lovers
When the music ends
 Darling, won't you please? Whoa
 Darling, won't you please? Whoa
 Darling, won't you please? Mmm
 Woah yeah
 Woah
 Woah woah
 Woah
