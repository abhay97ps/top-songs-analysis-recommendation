Stranded in the middle of noplace
Doing nothing
Going nowhere
Ha, a-nowhere fast
Looks like a lamb's
Gone off astray
I don’t know where I am
I just can't find my way
Look, I am in distress
Afraid and alone
I'm so sick of this emptiness
I just wanna be home, instead of
Stranded in the middle of noplace
Doing nothing
Going nowhere
A-ha, a-nowhere fast
I laid out my life around
The love I thought could be enjoyed
But my dream was destroyed
Now I live in a total void 
Stranded in the middle of noplace
Doing nothing
Going nowhere
A-ha, a-nowhere fast
Growing my mind 
Seeking to know 
Trying to find
Out which way should I go
I keep searching my soul
Looking for life 
Once your love was my only goal
Now it’s out of sight , I'm here
Stranded in the middle of noplace
Doing nothing
Going nowhere
Ha, a-nowhere fast
Ah, oh, stranded in the middle of noplace
Doing nothing…
