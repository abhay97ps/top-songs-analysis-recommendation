I want her, I need her
And someday, some way, whoa-oh-oh-oh, I'll meet her
She'll be kinda shy
And real good lookin' too
And I'll be certain she's my girl
By the things she'll like to do
Like walkin' in the rain
And wishin' on the stars up above
And bein' so in love
When she's near me, I'll kiss her
And when she leaves me, whoa-oh-oh-oh, I'll miss her
Though sometimes we'll fight
I won't really care
I know she's gonna be all right
Cause we got so much to share
Like walkin' in the rain
And wishin' on the stars up above
And bein' so in love
 No, no she'll never do
 No it isn't her too
They would never, no they'd never
Never, ever love
Walkin' in the rain
And wishin' on the stars
Or bein' so in love
Walkin' in the rain
