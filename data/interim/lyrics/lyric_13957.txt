I swear I've seen your face before
It peered inside my open door
I should have played this game before
Played a little bit now then later more
Angel, angel
Ring them bells 
Ring them bells 
Something is wrong, it doesn't belong
And it's not natural to sing that song
And if I wash my hands in your dirty water
Will your religion make me clean
And if I wet my feet in your dirty water
Will I be blind for all I see
A lover would be more concеrned
When I needed you your hеad was turned
Seems like you do what you can
To make me feel a guilty man
Angel, angel
Ring them bells 
Ring them bells 
Something is wrong, it doesn't belong
And it's not natural to sing that song
And if I wash my hands in your dirty water
Will your religion make me clean
And if I wet my feet in your dirty water
Will I be blind for all I see
And if I wash my hands in your dirty water
And if I wash my hands in your dirty water
And if I wash my hands in your dirty water
