 yeah
She's got soul
She knows her way to go
She's so fine
I'm so glad she's mine
Cause she holds me tighter
Makes my darkness brighter
And my burden lighter
Ooh, baby 
Ooh, yeah
She's sweeter than all the rest
She's my baby, nothing less
 ooh, yeah
A girl like her
Sweetest in the world
She's my desire
Set my soul on fire
She starts her walking
And her baby talking
Like a tiger stalking
Ooh, baby 
Ooh, yeah
She'll smooth aches and pains
I'm so glad to stake my claim
 yeah, baby
 she's so sweet
Ooh, yeah, yeah
 she's so sweet now
Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
Such a lucky guy
To lose her, I would cry
When she starts to squeeze me
She won't leave me
And never tease me
She's a real humdinger, hey, baby
 oh, yes, she is
