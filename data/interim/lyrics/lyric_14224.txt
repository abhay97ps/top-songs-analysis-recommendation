What do the neighbors say
When they hear us scream at night
Do they talk about a love
All in tatters
What do the neighbors know
About the heart and soul
The fire down below
That really matters
They can never guess
In the silences
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane we got here
All I want is you
I don't want a man who says
Good morning, dear, no, no
All I want is you
All that I want is you
All I want is you
Nobody else but you
Let 'em listen at the door
Let 'em listen through the floor
Let 'em go ahead and draw
The wrong conclusion
So chase me 'round the room
Make me crazy like the moon
They can never guess
In the silences
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane that we share
All I want is you
I don't want a man who
Tiptoes up the stairs
No, I don't
All I want is you
All that I want is you
All I want is you
Nobody else, no one but you
They can never guess
In the silences
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane that we share
All I want is you
I don't want a man who
Tiptoes up the stairs
He's gonna fall
All I want is you
And your freight train
Whistling over my track, oh, oh
All I want is you
And your Mack truck loving
Jumping me, Jack
Oh, Jack
All I want is you....
