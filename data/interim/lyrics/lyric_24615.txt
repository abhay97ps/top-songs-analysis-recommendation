Make that girl go through practice
Take three Xannies like a hat trick
Take another pill for that magic
These models 'bout to get ratchet

Give a fuck about what a source say
Don't attach me to your name
A-all they wanted was more fame
All they wanted was more fame
And you were always a distraction

Left with her and a big back-end
She slippery, losin' traction

Pull up every which way in foreign cars 
Man, these broads so fake 
Mistakes, time to part ways
