Am I really hard to please?
Perhaps I have such special needs
I wondered what was wrong with me 
My friends all fall so easily 
Called the first one Savage Mode, my mood, that's what it was 
2016, we was ridin' around, beatin' niggas up in the club
I know she around for the money, but act like she loyal, I don't feel the love 
I'm so rich, get bored, might wake up, buy me a car just 'cause 
Her titties is hard 'cause she spent a five, my bitch titties cost me a dub 
All my bitches got BBLs, all my bitches got butts 
I ain't with thе rap beef, Draco pedophile, all of my opps get touchеd 
We ain't never ran off on no barber, but we still be hoppin' out cuts 
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', I leave all my cars
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', all my opps be
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', wipe his nose, it was
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', Savage never did no
That Clasé for your wife , that hookah for your wife 
I'm Slaughter Gang, pussy, you know I brought my knife 
He was talkin' gangster , we caught him at a light 
I let my young nigga do it, it was free, he wanted a stripe 
Havin' my way with the cheese, I'm in the den with the thieves 
I know that she ratchet, I could tell by the way that she wearin' her weave 
Smokin' on zaza, this shit came out the garden with Adam and Eve 
Chopper go fow-fow, shoot up your pow-wow, niggas tryna make y'all bleed 
Got out of line, spanked that baby, we had to rock him to sleep 
Is it a issue? Keep me a pistol, I ain't finna diss you 
All that pillow talk, I'ma have to send The Boogeyman to come get you
Chain hang low like a yo-yo, your bitch ridin' dick like pogo
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', I leave all my cars
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', all my opps be
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', wipe his nose, it was
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', Savage never did no
I brought a Hollywood bitch to Club Crucial 
I was at the Met Gala with my shooter 
Slaughter Gang, Gang, we don't do recruitin' 
Say you ready to catch a body, gotta prove it
Gotta prove that shit, nigga
Shit ain't no motherfuckin' game, nigga
Get your bitch ass whacked, nigga
Big facts, big 4L, nigga
Big Zone 6, nigga
We run the motherfuckin' city, nigga
Y'all niggas know what the fuck goin' on, nigga
Body for body, nigga, money for money, nigga
We skunkin' everybody
Fuck your crew, nigga, we'll kill your crew
Pussy, pussy, pussy
Are things better or worse the second time around?
Can we really do anything more than once?
