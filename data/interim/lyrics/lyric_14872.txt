You and me
We had a love that was forever
That's what I thought
And I can still remember
Words you said
You said we'd always be together
Then why am I alone tonight?
Something changed now
You just don't feel the same
I'll never understand
How can the same love
That made me so happy
Make me so sad?
I don't understand
How could the same eyes
That used to be laughing
Cry in the night?
It doesn't seem right at all
Remembering the nights
We held onto each other
The times you told me
You'll never love another
Remembering when I was
All you ever needed
Where are you when I need you now?
Summer days have left me
Standing in the rain
Somebody tell me how
Was my heart so blind
I couldnâ€™t see?
Was I a fool to believe
Promises you made to me
What went wrong?
What went wrong?
It doesn't seem right at all
