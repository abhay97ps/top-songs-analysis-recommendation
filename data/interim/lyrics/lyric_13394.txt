Count me out
Count me out
Fellas want to hang
And save tonight just for the gang
But you'll have to count me out tonight
If I can't bring my girl
Don't look surprised when I tell you that
Gotta spend some time with my baby, yes
So if that means we're gonna rain on your parade
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out 
You'll have to count me out
When she asked me please
Could I say no and feel at ease
If you count me out tonight
She's gonna be with me wherever I go
She's got a sweet personality
She saves her kisses just for me
So if that means we're gonna rain on your parade
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out 
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
Count me out
Count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out 
You'll have to count me out 
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out 
You'll have to count me out
I love my baby but she's just a tease
And when I need her I say 'Please, please, please
Can I hold you? Squeeze you?
‘Cause I need you'
Count me out
You'll have to count me out this time
Don't count me out
Don't leave me out
You'll have to count me out this time
You'll have to count me out 
You'll have to count me out 
You'll have to count me out 
You'll have to count me out
Man, we're going to the movies
Then to the park
And play a little ball
‘Til it gets dark
That's what being young is all about
Well, what about us?
We're your friends
We wanna C-O-U-N-T (Me in
No, not tonight)
Where you going then?
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out 
You'll have to count me out
Count me out
Count me out
Count me out
Don't count me out
Don't leave me out
Count me out
Count me out
Count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out 
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count 
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You’ll have to count 
You’ll have to count me out
