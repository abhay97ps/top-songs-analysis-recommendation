Hey, baby, you can't park here!
What do you mean I can't park here?
Just move your car out to the side somewhere!
But why in the world can't I park my car?
Excuse me, madam, you're standing still in a no parking zone
You don't get a move on that body, I'll be forced to give you a ticket
So get with it!
There's a party tonight, you're in a red light zone
If you don't want a ticket, you better move on
If you break the law, you gotta pay your dues
Ain't much better if you play it by the rules
'Cause it's so easy, it's so right
It's so easy to rock it with your body, baby
It's so easy, it's so right
It's so easy to rock it all night
No parking, baby
No parking on the dance floor
Ah, ah, ah
No parking, baby
No parking on the dance floor
Let me hear you blow your horn
Oh, oh, oh.  Shake it, baby
Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep!
Rock it, baby
Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep!
Moving violations are easy to fix
Just tell the DJ to fix it in the mix
Shake it up and shake it on down
Let me feel you moving, you gotta get down
'Cause it's so easy, it's so right
It's so easy to rock it with your body, baby
It's so easy, it's so right
It's so easy to rock it all night
No parking, baby
No parking on the dance floor
I wanna say it again
No parking, baby
No parking on the dance floor
Ahhhhhhhhhh!
Oh, oh, oh.  Shake it, baby
Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep!
Rock it, baby
Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep!
Rock it
Work it.  
Shake it
Don't park it.  Baby, baby, baby
Don't park your booty, don't park your can
It's time to party, it's time to jam
Don't park your booty, don't park your can
It's time to party, it's time to jam
Don't park your booty, don't park your can
It's time to party, it's time to jam
Don't park your booty, don't park your can
It's time to party, it's time to jam
No parking, baby
No parking on the dance floor
No, oh.  Uh
No parking, baby
No parking on the dance floor
Oh, oh, oh, oh
No parking, baby
No parking on the dance floor
Ah, ah, ah.  
No parking, baby
No parking on the dance floor
All you peoples out there, say it loud!  
Rock it, baby
Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep!
Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep!
Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep!
Rock it
Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep!
Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep!
Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep!
Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep!
