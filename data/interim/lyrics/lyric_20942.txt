Ayy, we go by The Runners
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
DJ Khaled, We The Best 
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I do it for the hood, cause the hood told me I should 
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
If you rep your hood, and you goin' hard
If they hatin' on you, don't stress
Tell them niggas that we the best 
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
Fuck nigga, you can't stop this!
Fuck the rest, we run this game, Kanye West, Khaled and Pain
Hey, if you could, you would get rid of me
What you gon' do when a nigga gotta go hard?
But I won't let you get to me 
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This is in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am  I will  I gots to go 
You got another way to live, I gots to go hard 
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go  go  go  go 
I go the hardest, flow so retard
I'm disgusted with myself, I mean, ugh, where do I start?
First I spin around and vomit, then I shit up on it
Fuck the beat up so bad, won't nobody get up on it
I flow sick, nigga how sick? Seasick
Got your hand out, don't look at me bitch
You lookin' at who made me rich
You lookin' at who made me rich
I had some wins, some losses
Just a life of a God damn boss's
With the top off, lookin' for a girl
With a ass as fat as Tracee Ross's
This is dope as it get, dope as a motherfuckin' acid trip
Fly as fifty-seven passengers, this finna be another classic, bitch
Everybody know I got it, if you want it then get at it
But I ain't gon' have it, no, I ain't gon' have it
Hey, if you could, you would get rid of me
What you gon' do when a nigga gotta go hard?
But I won't let you get to me 
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This is in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am  I will  I gots to go 
You got another way to live, I gots to go hard 
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go  go  go  go 
I ain't ever been scurred
Never been the type to bite my words
When I came up, y'all gave me shit
Now I'm finna make y'all eat them turds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Go head, spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care 'bout what you felt
Fuck you nigga, I know I'm dope
Felt like I'm comin' to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me
Funny how I'm flyer than them all
Now I'm at the top, ain't nowhere to go now
Instead of me, she gon' go down
Maybe I would have slowed down
If I knew what I know now
I'm stupid, yeah I know I'm dumb
This could fuckin get old, well it's good I'm young
Before my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one
I guess it's gon' be what it's gon' be
But here's one thing y'all got to hear
I'ma tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck y'all niggas, I'm out of here
Hey, if you could, you would get rid of me
What you gon' do when a nigga gotta go hard?
But I won't let you get to me 
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This is in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am  I will  I gots to go 
You got another way to live, I gots to go hard 
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go  go  go  go 
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
I'm going in, I'm going in
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
I go hard for the hood, I go hard for the streets
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
I go hard for the ghetto, Kanye West, T-Pain, DJ Khaled
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
We The Best, we won't stop, we can't stop, We Global
Hey, if you could, you would get rid of me
What you gon' do when a nigga gotta go hard?
But I won't let you get to me 
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This is in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am  I will  I gots to go 
You got another way to live, I gots to go hard 
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go  go  go  go
