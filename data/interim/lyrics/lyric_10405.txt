For your love
For your love
When I think about those nights in Montreal
I get the sweetest thoughts of you and me
Memories of love above the city lights
Oooh, I've tried so hard to take it
But alone my heart won't make it
I just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you, babe
I just wanna stop
I never wanna live without you, babe
I just wanna stop for your love.  Oooh
For your love
For your love.  
When I think about the way the world must turn
I get the saddest thoughts of you and me.  
Memories of life and times go on and on
Oooh, I've tried hard to forget it
But alone my mind won't let it
I just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you, babe
I just wanna stop
The world ain't right without you, babe
I just wanna stop for your love
Oooh, I've tried so hard to take it
But alone my heart won't make it
I just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you, babe
I just wanna stop
The world ain't right without you, babe
I just wanna stop for your love
Stop.  Hoo, hoo, hoo
I just wanna stop.  Hoo, hoo, hoo
I just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you, babe
I just wanna stop
The world ain't right without you, babe
I just wanna stop
