Baby, you can come see me  'cause I need you here with me
And I'll show you what love is made of
Later on if you are free, baby, you can come see me
And I'll show you what love is made of
It's been a while, and I'm sittin' here thinkin' of
How it felt when we first made love
Oh, I need that feelin' again
Nobody can compare, so
Come with me 
To this place that lovers dream of
 we can do anything,  sexy things
You can come see me  'cause I need you here with me
And I'll show you what love is made of
Later on if you are free, baby, you can come see me
And I'll show you what love is made of
It's been awhile, thinking about the last time I held you
And the smell of your sweet perfume, babe
The way I felt when you left my room
Oh, I wanna feel that way tonight
Come with me 
And I'll go with you 
To this place 
That lovers dream of 
We can do  anything, sexy things
Baby, you can come see me  'cause I need you here with me
And I'll show you what love is made of
Later on if you are free, baby, you can come see me
And I'll show you what love is made of
Baby, you can come see me  'cause I need you here with me
And I'll show you what love is made of
Later on if you are free, baby, you can come see me
And I'll show you what love is made of
Now that bodysuit that you're wearing, girl, it fits you like paint
You think that I'ma sit here and pass this chance when I ain't?
I got some thoughts set on you and many things we can do
How many women in my life but, yet, I only love you
You're number one on my list, and I, I reminisce over our first kiss
And girlfriend, yo, picture this
Let's relight the candle, give this one more shot
I never meant to mistreat ya girl, I need you a lot
Baby, you can come see me  'cause I need you here with me
And I'll show you what love is made of
Later on if you are free, baby, you can come see me
And I'll show you what love is made of
Baby, you can come see me 
And I'll show you what love is made of
Later on if you are free 
And I'll show you what love is made of
Baby, you can come see me
And I'll show you what love is made of
