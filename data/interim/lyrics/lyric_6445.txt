We're all playing in the same band
There’s enough guitars for you and me
Stand beside your brother and take his hand
Seems the times are changing finally
We're all playing in the same band
Sing the song together and you'll see
Let them know forever just where you stand
People must be learning finally
And we’re all playing in the same band
We're all playing in the same band
We're all playing in the same band
Oh, him, her, you and me
Them and those, he and she
And we and we
Him, her, you and me
Them and those, he and she
And we and we
We're all playing in the same band
There's enough guitars for you and me
Stand beside your brother and take his hand
Seems the times are changing finally
Whoa, oh, oh
And we're all playing in the same band
We're all playing in the same band
We're all playing in the same band
