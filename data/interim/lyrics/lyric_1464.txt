Preacher
If theres anyone here
Who knows why these two people should not be joined together
Let them speak now or forever hold their peace
Etta
Wait, Wait Stop the wedding
You're just marrying her for spite
If she knew the inside story
She'd tell you what you're doing just ain't right
I know you dont wanna hurt me
So stop this madness before it starts
Revenge will only cause you regret
So dont do it, dont do it
Dont break two hearts
Cuz you belong to me, Oh Darlin
And I belong to you and deep down inside me now
I know you feel that way to
So baby, don't do it 
Don't do it  Don't do it 
Oh, Dont you break two hearts 
No, No, No Baby Don't do it 
Don't do it 
Stop the wedding 
Oh, Don't you break, dont you break two hearts 
No,No,No,No, Don't do it 
Don't do it 
Stop the wedding 
Oh, dont break two hearts 
No,No, No,No, Don't do it 
Stop the wedding 
Oh, Oh Dont you break two hearts
