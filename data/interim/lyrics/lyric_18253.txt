Uh, huh
I don't wanna get the best of you, ha-ha
Yo, yo
Woah, put it on me
I can't let 
Let him go no 
Can't let you get, oh no 
He has a little game that he plays
Clever little ways and a hot boy style
Brags about the dough that he makes
Flash a little cash most girls wild out 
Lately he's been checking for me
Telling me how much he wants to be
Wants to be the one to replace
Replace the man that waits at home for me
But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me
Feelings coming on strong
We know that it's wrong
I can't let you get the best of me
The best of me
So is he trying to play with my head?
Tellin' me how he could blow my mind
Somethin' 'bout the things that he said
Made me want to take it there one time
I should be walking away
Cause his hand's up on my thigh
Should I leave, should I stay?
After all it's just one night
But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me
Feelings coming on strong
We know that it's wrong
I can't let you get the best of me
The best of me
I got so many bags of money that they won't fit in the bank
And I'mma do this just like Tony did it to Frank
But I'mma make sure both y'all win
Let him keep the place, you move and I'mma pay both y'all rent
So forget about the condo and come to the crib
Cause the castle over the mountain come with a bridge
You know, literally, we could go shopping in Italy
Hand on her thigh she ain't wanna get rid of me
And she don't drink or know how a L look 
Channel look, mixed with the Pete Arnell look
You just stay pretty while I'm running the city 
When I whip the V you can hold the joint if you with me
Vacation cost a hundred and fifty, we livin' it up
I put it on your ass if you're givin' it up
And you know I'm not a hater
And if you feel bad then you call him up later
And tell him you all Jada's
But oh no I can't let you 
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside 
Something's dying to see 
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me
You ain't gonna get to me
You can't get the best of me
But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me 
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me
Feelings coming on strong
We know that it's wrong
I can't let you get the best of me
But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me
Oh yeah, oh...
But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me
