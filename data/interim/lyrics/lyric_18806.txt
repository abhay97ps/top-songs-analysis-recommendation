I never knew there were such great movies
On tv at 3 am
I'd never guessed that at midnight tuesday
I could have pizza ordered in
I've never been a real night owl
But these days i'm all turned around
There's only one thing i'm sure of right now
I should be sleeping
'stead of keeping
These late hours i've been keeping
I've been pacing and retracing
Every step of every move
Even though i'm feeling so right
I'm so happy still i know i
Should be sleeping
Instead of dreaming about you
I never knew that i was funny
'til i went and made you laugh
Never liked a girl to call me honey
But you did and i liked that
I keep thinking about your smile
Trying to read between the lines
Looks like i'll be up for a while
After just three dates
And one great kiss
It's way too soon
To be obsessing like this
Dreaming about you
I should be sleeping
Dreaming about you
Well, i'm dreaming about you
Yeah
