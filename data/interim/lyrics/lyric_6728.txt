Lonely Teardrops
My pillows never dry off
Lonely Teardrops
Come Home, Come Home
Just Say You Will, Say You Will 
Say You Will 
Hey, Hey 
My Heart Is Fine, Fine
Lonely Teardrops
My pillows never dry off
Lonely Teardrops
Come Home, Come Home
Just Say You Will, Say You Will 
Say You Will 
Hey, Hey 
Just Give Me Another Chance
For our Romance
Come On And Tell Me
That One Day You'll Return
Cause Everyday That You've Been Gone Away
You'll Know Why My Heart Does Nothing But Burn
Lonely Teardrops
My pillows never dry off
Lonely Teardrops
Come Home, Come Home
Just Say You Will, Say You Will 
Say You Will 
Hey, Hey 
Say It Right Now Baby 
Come On, Come On 
Say It Darling Yeah!
