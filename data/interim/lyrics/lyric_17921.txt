At the local diner just outside of town
He comes in an hour early just to beat the morning crowd
He stares out the window and stirs his coffee cup
Another day, another dollar short of catching up
Same old job and same old dull routine
But in his heart, he knows what it brings
A two bedroom house for his family of three
He's givin' his all, making ends meet
A secondhand car, a washing machine
They may not have much, but he gets what they need
With the hands of a working man
Down at the factory, standing in line
He waits to punch the time clock
A million worries on his mind
Oh, Jimmy's needing braces
And Betty's needing time
And the problems that he's facing
They're all building up inside
Same old job and same old dull routine
But in his heart, he knows what it brings
A two bedroom house for his family of three
He's givin' his all, making ends meet
A secondhand car, a washing machine
They don't have much, but he gets what they need
With the hands of a working man
Same old job and same old dull routine
But in his heart, he knows what it brings
A two bedroom house for his family of three
He's givin' his all, making ends meet
A secondhand car, a washing machine
They may not have much, but he gets what they need
With the hands of a working man
With the hands of a working man
