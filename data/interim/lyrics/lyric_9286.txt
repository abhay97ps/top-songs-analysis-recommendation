Stock in my tears, yah
Scared ‘bout what he sees, yah
Am I an asshole?
Tell me how it feels, yah
It’s raining outside
Storm on the side
Thunder my replied
That’s the end now I’m tired
I’m talk about real shit
Fuck all your economic crisis
Fuck all your political racism
Youth shouldn’t die but they panic quick
You know what let’s hide the statistics
Truth is it lie when they right like a lyricist
Make decisions which make wars but they’re pacifists?
Mama getting sad
Now I’m dead inside
Never satisfy
Think about his lie
Everybody lies
Don’t know what I have anymore
Stop thinking out loud
Start to rise now
Let my eyes wide
Open up your mind
So it’s my time
Started from the dark knight to Jack the White
Look at me I’m cold as ice
How carry on with blue eyes
Like a Will problem
Weird problem
It’s my own life
May he wanna take a bullet for you
May if he doesn’t know how to live it’s fine
I’m still trying to understand, why my tears burn my eyes
May he wanna take a bullet for you
May if he doesn’t know how to leave it’s fine
I’m still trying to understand, why my tears don’t cry
I used to think I was happy
But now it’s weird
Cold now it’s cold now
Baby don’t cry now
Because it’s not the last time
Keep your sadness for dark ones
Cold now it’s cold now
Baby don’t cry now
Because it’s not the last time
Keep your sadness for dark ones
Young straw hat wanna break the scores
Not a fake rap I don't praise the lord
Giving it up in your mind I wanna break the laws
Giving it up in your mind I wanna break the laws
If I'm the shit, may people will fight for why I struggle
And If I'm God, I don't know people do if I write do drugs in the bible
 Stop weapons and your KKK nations
Nothing has changed since 2pac to XXXTentacion
Self-esteem in a small amount
Win the rings It's all about
And be able to keep it this is all I got
Everydays into now may I'm out
Oh thanks to being support in the comments
"You're an ass-hole" Oh, that's a beautiful compliment
Are you real when you say that?
Cause' you say it online
But I'm keeping on rapping
Keeping it on riming
Keep it on off
Is that a stack of a lack of life?
Like the gap between this tweet and a mirror
What's you're looking for
For me that's enough
Nothing like your born
For me that's an error
Yeah but, you know what I mean
You know that I'm in your head
"You cannot be an artist, you cannot be..." you know fuck man
I love my music because it's my fucking therapist
Welcome in my head it's called Midtown East
I used to think I was happy
But there is so much pain
Molly
Fresh outta school ‘cause she was a high school grad
Hommies are cool and she makes proud Dad
Like she doesn’t have the lifestyle she dreams about
Start to making craps, start to smoking crack, start to getting out on night but
She didn’t wanna get in the truck
But she can’t do anything when she’s drunk
World raise
Words erased
Nobody help her
Even she was raped
She was savaged and no one knows
Ain’t nobody got time for confidence
The consequence is that Molly was sad
But no matters the difference
She doesn’t smoke because she’s asthmatic
So she became a crack addict
Long panic life
Might be not lived
It’s hard to see when you’re a tiny rock on the traffic
And then she went to the darknet
Maybe she doesn’t wanna die yet
She knew it
But fuck it
But know she gotta motherfucker gun in her pocket
She’s on the last car
Maybe she wanna leave the train
She hasn’t another plan
Did she have another plan?
She will never have a son
There’s nothing behind the sun
There’s nothing after the gun
Molly please run
Chiral in the mirror
Crying for another day
There’s only one hell, one hell, it’s our world
Scared to sleep
Scared to loose these second awake
She had enough, where midtown is eight miles away
She looked at the glass
Split her mask and cast the past before she passed away
