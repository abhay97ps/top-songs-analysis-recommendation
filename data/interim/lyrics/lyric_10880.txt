Though the sun may be dawning
You're the one that lights the morning
As I awake to the heaven
Of your sweet summer loving
By a stream in the country
Running barefoot and feeling free
While the love in our hearts blend
Into sweet summer loving
Sweet summer loving
In the dandelions
Sweet summer loving
Keeps me high as candy wine
When that big red balloon sets
Like a painting across the West
As the sky turns a crimson blue
As the world turns for me and you
By the light of the moon glow
While the warm summer wind blows
'Cross the sill of your window
We'll be letting our love flow
Sweet summer loving
In the dandelions
Sweet summer loving
Keeps me high as candy wine
Sweet summer loving
In the dandelions
Sweet summer loving
Keeps me high as candy wine
Sweet summer loving
Sweet summer loving
Mmm
Sweet summer loving
Mmm
Sweet summer loving
I love your sweet summer loving
Sweet summer loving
Sweet summer loving
Mmm
Sweet summer loving
Mmm
Sweet summer loving
