Ayy
Drank, take a lil' sip of that Act 
Flood all my bitches in that 
I'm in the projects without Pat 
My jewelry leave 'em blind like bats 
Diamonds for her in the back 
Hit that lil' bitch from the back, she stacked 
Ask me like how I do that? 
Pop a lil' Xan and relax 
About my racks, you get whacked 
If he got racks, he get taxed 
Five, four, three, two, one, attack 
Bitch, all of my whoadies hit that
Pussy nigga, they some rats 
He swung on my pockets, they fat, no catch
But all my bitches they brats 
Pop a lil' Perky, relax 
These niggas up to something 
Hey, she need to fuck or something
I'ma wake up for somethin'
I fell in love with nothin' 
Bitches, they do it for me
Stuck on me, gluin' somethin' 
Patrick Swayze, Swayze, Swayze, save me
All my bitches get it, never lazy 
All my pockets full like they pregnant 
Y'all niggas still hatin' 
Dice in the middle
I'ma shoot it with precise in the building 
Fuck that bitch because she likin' my rhythm 
White on her head, I got lice in the buildin' 
Lil' mama ready, she Tyson, go get her 
I can't complain, I got ice in my bezel 
I'm not racist, I got white in my Bentley 
Caught a rabbit, it was ice all up in it 
Hell yeah 
Call me mister mister Porsche 
Pockets swole with no abortion 
I sleep soft, I'm never snorin' 
Talk to bitches when I'm borin' 
Your money little like a Yorkie
I open your head up with a forty 
I think I'm gettin' back to the old me 
Yeah, I'm gettin' back to the old me
Hey, these niggas up to something 
Hey, these niggas forfeit on us, ayy
Drank take a lil' sip of that Act
