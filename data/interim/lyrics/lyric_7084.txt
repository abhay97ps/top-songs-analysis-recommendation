Yvonne:
Sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you and anoint you
Myrrh for your hot forehead and
Then you'll feel
Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet
Close your eyes, close your eyes
And relax, think of nothing tonight
Women:
Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes
Carl:
Hey hey Woman, your fine ointment, brand new and expensive
Should have been saved for the poor
Why has it been wasted? We could have raised maybe
Three hundred silver pieces or more
People who are hungry, people who are starving
Matter more than your feet and hair
Yvonne:
Try not to get worried, try not to turn on to
Problems that upset you
Don't you know
Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright yes
Ted:
Surely you're not saying we have the resources
To save the poor from their lot?
There will be poor always, pathetically struggling
Look at the good things you've got!
Think! While you still have me
Move! While you still see me
You'd be lost, and you'd be sorry
When I'm gone
Yvonne:
Sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you and anoint you
Myrrh for your hot forehead
Then you'll feel
Everything's alright yes everything's fine
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet
Close your eyes, close your eyes
And relax, think of nothing tonight
Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
ALL:
Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes
