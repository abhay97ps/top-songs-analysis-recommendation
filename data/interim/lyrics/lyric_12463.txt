My love is in league with the freeway
Its passion will ride, as the cities fly by
And the tail-lights dissolve, in the coming of night
And the questions in thousands take flight
My love is the miles and the waiting
The eyes that just stare, and the glance at the clock
And the secret that burns
And the pain that won't stop
And its fuel is the years
Leading me on - leading me down the road
Driving beyond
Driving me down the road
My love is exceeding the limit
Red-eyed and fevered with the hum of the miles
Distance and longing, my thoughts do collide
Should I rest for a while at the side
Your love is cradled in knowing
Eyes in the mirror, still expecting they'll come
Sensing too well when the journey is done
There is no turning back
No
There is no turning back
On the run
My love is in league with the freeway
Oh the freeway, and
The coming of night-time
My love
My love is in league with the freeway
