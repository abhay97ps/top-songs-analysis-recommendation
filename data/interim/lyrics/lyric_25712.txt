It's so on point, like it's so musically correct, I don't wanna clash
Like I'm tryna just put like 
That's what I'm sayin'

Turn up
I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone 
Told my bitch "I love you", that was just a typo
That bitch drive me crazy , she gon' make me psycho 
Everything I been through , it's something only I know
Ayy, I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone 
Told my bitch "I love you", that was just a typo 
That bitch drive me crazy , she gon' make me psycho 
Everything I been through , it's something only I know
Ayy, I'm a legend just like Michael
My bitch is ungrateful, so I'm out with my side ho
She gon' treat me different, I should make her my ho
She don't need no surgery, she don't got no lipo
But she got that ass, though, told her how to throw it right
She treat me like a motorcycle, ride me like a motorbike, vroom
I just took off, check the speed 
I just made 100K off a show 
I just made 50K off of weed 
You know I like to play with your ho 
I choke her and pull out her weave 
I told her "Bae, I gotta go" 
She beggin' me "Stay over, please" 
I gotta leave, boo 
I don't wanna mislead you 
I just wanna please you 
She looked and said "Me too" 
So I let her ride out 
She like how we vibe out 
But if you blow my phone up , I'ma put you in timeout
'Cause I'm—
I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone

That bitch drive me crazy , she gon' make me psycho

That bitch drive me crazy , she gon' make me psycho 
Everything I been through , it's something only I know
I'm 'bout to tell my dude I love him, then I'm gonna dub him
'Cause to be honest I put my side nigga above him
Tell him that I know that he creepin' with that ho
That's why I'm fuckin' that nigga that I be callin' my bro 
Middle finger, fuck a-you
Who the fuck is you?
This L is for you, I'ma take a W
Fuck on the dick, then I fuck up a check
He say he want a kiss, but I give him a peck
I said "Call me Aretha," I want my respect
When you niggas get stupid, it's plenty on deck
Ain't about to be sittin' home cryin' for you
Better get one in pink if you buy it in blue
All these niggas is lined up eyein' the coupe
Because takin' your spot what they dyin' to do
Ayo, open the door, give me my clothes
Throw me the keys, 'cause I'm taking the Rolls'
Get any closer, we comin' to blows
You get the picture, ain't talkin' a pose
I mean, who doin' it, doin' it?
Like we doin' it, doin' it?
Why you ruin it, ruin it?
Here we go
How you ain't know a Queen from a rat?
She saw that cheese, now you 'bout to get trapped
How you ain't know a Queen from a rat?
Ireland, you gon' be doublin' back
I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone 
Told my bitch "I love you", that was just a typo

Everything I been through , it's something only I know 
Ayy, I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone

Ain't no typo, ain't no Michael 
Ain't a psycho, fuck your iPhone
Fuck your iPhone
