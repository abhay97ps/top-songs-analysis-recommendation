Ooh, baby, let me pour the wine, yeah
Ooh, candlelight to help us dine
Don't matter what I offer
'Cause filling your cup doesn't soften you up
So here's my final offer
I'll come out and say it, girl, I don't wanna play
Baby, can you stay the night
And love me in the morning light
Stay with me to greet the day
Loving every hour away
I've got things to do
And you like it too
So, why don't you stay the night
Ooh, anything to spark romance, yeah
Ooh, didn't leave a thing to chance
No, I didn't leave
And now it's your turn
Some softly playing music
The singer is saying what I want you to say
So, listen to the music
And then you will know, can't you feel it growing
Baby, can you stay the night
And love me in the morning light
Stay with me to greet the day
Loving every hour away
I've got things to do
And you like it too
So, why don't you stay the night
So here's my final offer
I'll come out and say it, girl, I don't wanna play
Baby, can you stay the night
And love me in the morning light
Baby, can you stay the night
'Cause, baby, it'll be all right, yeah
Baby

Sweet baby
