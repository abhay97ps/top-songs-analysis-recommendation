We The Best music
DJ Khaled
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher 
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? 
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher
Look, look
My granny 88, she had my uncle and then
A miscarriage back-to-back every year for like ten
Pregnant with my moms, doctor told her it was slim
Was bed rode for nine months, but gave birth in the end
Pops turned 60, he proud what we done
In one generation, he came from Africa young
He said he met my moms at the Century Club
Los Angeles love kinda of like Hussle and Boog
Mani turned ten, Kross turned two
Startin' to see this life shit from a bird's view
We the ones that made millions off the curb, fool
In this rap shit ten, never made nerd moves
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher 
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? 
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher 
Emptied out the clip, it was broad day
Fuck niggas always gotta learn the hard way
We gon' tape it off if we ball play
Put a half a moon crescent on your bald fade
Police hit the lights, that's a car chase
Lookin' back at my life make my heart race
Dance with the devil and test our faith
I was thinkin' chess moves but it was God's grace
Crooked ass whoever 'til we all straight
With no shame, I peeped game and it's all fake
South Central state of mind, high crime rate 
Homicide, hate, gang banging'll get you all day 
And look at my fate
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher 
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? 
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher
Higher
Oh, Lord
Can you feel it?
My shoes are scrapin' the sky
I'm so high
We keep goin' higher
