She knows I'm true
But what she don't know
Is I'm true to only you
Tell me where does it stop
Does he know his married life
Is on the rocks
Now before you say you want me
For the rest of your life
What are we gonna do
About your husband
And what are we gonna do
About my wife
Sneak to your side in the darkness
Where our faithfulness must hide
Knowing I'll forever taste
All the tears I put upon
My children's face
Before I say I want you
For the rest of my life
What are we gonna do
About your husband
And what are we gonna do
About my wife
Should we stop and look around
Let's think about the
Hearts we'll be breaking
And though we want each other
We need each other and
We love each other
Think about the move we are making
Baby, don't you cry
No matter what
We'll never, never say goodbye
And I, I promise you this
Though she wears my ring
You'll always wear my kiss
Don't ask for marriage
We can't pay the price
Cause you don't really
Wanna hurt your husband
And I don't really
Wanna hurt my wife
Oh, we'd better stop
Think it over, baby
Oh, what are we gonna do now
You've got to help me, baby
Cause I need, I want you
And I love you, hey, hey
