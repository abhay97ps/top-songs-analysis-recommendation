I'd like to live out all my dreams
And if I could, yes if I could
The nicest one would be with you
And you'd be here with me
Don't you ever get lonely?
Lord I'm no good when your away
But what do you expect
From a girl who loves you like I love you
Won't you ever just get tired and come on home to me
Don't you ever get lonely?
You're a part of me
That I can't do without
You're a part of me
That dreams are all about
But you can't hold onto something that you never had before
Love waits for the wind to bring you back again
And take me away
Friend say its great now you're a star
But what do they expect from a girl
Who loved you just the way you were
And late at night I wish things had never changed
And you were here with me
Don't you ever get lonely?
You're a part of me
That I can't do without
You're a part of me
That dreams are all about
But you can't hold onto something that you never had before
Love waits for the wind to bring you back again
And take me away
