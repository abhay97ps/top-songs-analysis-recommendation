Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy going to shut you down
It happened on the strip where the road is wide
Two cool shorts standing side by side
Yeah, my fuel injected Stingray and a four-thirteen
Revving up our engines and it sounds real mean
Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy going to shut you down
Declining numbers at an even rate
At the count of one we both accelerate
My Stingray is light the slicks are starting to spin
But the four-thirteen's really digging in
Got to be cool now, power shift - here we go
Superstock Dart is winding out in low
But my fuel injected Stingray's really starting to go
To get the traction I'm riding the clutch
My pressure plate's burning that machine's too much
Pedal's to the floor hear the dual quads drink
And now the four-thirteen's lead is starting to shrink
He's hot with ram induction but it's understood
I got a fuel injected engine sitting under my hood
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
