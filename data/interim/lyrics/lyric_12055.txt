Saw the old gang
We still keep in touch
Relive memories
I cherish so much
I sit there and laugh
At all the things I did
All when I was a kid
It seems only yesterday
The '50s were here
Hot summer nights
With a six pack of beer
When I burned up the road
In my coupe de ville
I was the king of the hill
I loved James Dean, Elvis
And rock and roll
Haven't outgrown my wild ways
I'm a middle-age kid
Feelin' just like I did
In my younger days
My friends they tell me
I'm a picture of youth
While they're showin' their age
In a moment of truth
Though my rock 'n' roll living
Seems crazy to some
The music's keeping me young
I still love James Dean, Elvis
And rock and roll
Haven't outgrown my wild ways
I'm a middle-age kid
Feelin' just like I did
In my younger days
There's a child in my heart
That I'll never let go
Dreamin' of somethin'
That I'll never outgrow
And I'm makin' my music
Singing out on the stage
Feeling young with age
I still love James Dean, Elvis
And rock and roll
Haven't outgrown my wild ways
I'm a middle-age kid
Doin' just what I did
In my younger days
I'm a middle-age kid
Doin' just what I did
In my younger days
Yeah, yeah, yeah
