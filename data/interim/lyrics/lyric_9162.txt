Now when you open your mouth, what comes out
What's the first word, what's the first line?
When you open your mouth and love comes out
Then you know, you just sang the clear line
I've heard people say it a thousand times
In a thousand different ways
I've heard people play it a thousand times
And they know, they know that's the only way
To play
You got to
Play on love
Play on love
Play on love
Play on love
Now are you talking about what it is you know
Or just repeating what it was you heard
Someone told you just exactly what to say
And you know, you know that's only one set
Of words
You got to play on love
I've heard people say it a thousand times
In a thousand different ways
I've heard people play it a thousand times
And they know that's the only way to play
You been a reading it without living it
Now that's the golden prison we can always find
Living in stories and living in books or
We can live and leave all the stories behind
It's up to you and it's up to me
Come down yelling timber through the
Burning trees
Who's been telling you about perfection
And how did he get in here, that's the question
He must've
Played on love
Played on love
Played on love
Played on love
I've heard people say it a thousand times....
You got to
Play on love
Play on love
Play on love
Play on love
Reading it without living it...
You got to
Play on love
Play on love
Play on love
Play on love
