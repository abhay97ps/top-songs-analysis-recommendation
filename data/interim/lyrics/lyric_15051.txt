Day after day
I think about you and say
Why dont you notice me
Cause I've been watching you
I've been watching you
I write you letters all day
And then I throw them away
Cause I dont know what to say
Cause I've been watching you
I've been watching you
Cause I'm alone in this world
And I'm in love with you, girl
Can't you see?
Won't you please notice me
I call you at home
And then I hang up the phone
Before you know that it's me
Cause I've been watching you
I've been watching you
I can't take it no more
I'm gonna knock on your door
Say why won't you notice me?
Cause Ive been watching you
I've been watching you
Cause I'm alone in this world
And I'm in love with you, girl
Can't you see?
Won't you please notice me, ooh
Cause I'm alone in this world
And I'm in love with you, girl
Can't you see?
Won't you please notice me
I can't take no more
No more
Girl, no more
No more
Cause Im alone in this world
And Im in love with you, girl
Can't you see
Won't you please notice me
Cause I'm alone in this world
And I'm in love with you, girl
