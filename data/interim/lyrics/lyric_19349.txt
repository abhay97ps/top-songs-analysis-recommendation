It's not easy saying this to you
It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do
But, boy, before you go
I want you to know
I wish you strength when times are hard
Oh, I wish with all my heart you find just what you're looking for
I wish you joy, I wish you peace
And that every star you see's within your reach
And I wish you still loved me
I wish things were different, you know that
But I'm still happy for the times we had
You mean the world to me
Oh, baby, please believe
I wish you strength when times are hard
Oh, I wish with all my heart you find just what you're looking for
I wish you joy, I wish you peace
And that every star you see's within your reach
And I wish you still loved me
Losing you is tearing me apart
But a part of me will be with you, no matter where you are
I wish you strength when times are hard
Oh, I wish with all my heart you find just what you're looking for
I wish you joy, I wish you peace
And that every star you see's within your reach
And I wish you still loved me
Oh, I wish you still loved me
Mmmhmm, mmmhmm
