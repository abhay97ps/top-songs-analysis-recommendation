They said they want some of that raw shit 
Turn it up, I'ma sit in the car, bitch 
If you turn off your lights, you gon' see me at night
Ho, you know I'm a motherfucking star, bitch 
How I know you ain't from where I'm from?
'Cause you know you can't go leave your gun in the car, dick 
Nigga like me walk down on your ass
Leave you stuck in the sand like a motherfuckin' starfish 
Where the Backwoods at? I'm tryna smoke some' 
STG, swear to God they don't want none' 
STD, play with fire, I'ma burn something
Back to back in Scatpack doing donuts 
Starting not to get head 'til I want some
She eat up the two-ball, the screwball like ice cream 
Who you know wear designer with Nike? 
I smile and I show off my dimples, I'm icy 
Name a label that's fucking with my team 
Somebody come give me a challenge, excite me 
Nigga better stay 'way from that water
I let this bitch off, it's gon' hit you like lightning 
How the fuck they let Baby go platinum?
I thought he was wack and they didn't even like him 
You can come see my plaque on my wall
Walkin' 'round in my drawers, talking shit in my castle 
Think he sick, wipe his nose, I'm a nappy 
Take his bitch, that's my ho, I'm her daddy 
Ship the shit to your door, send the addy 
Mix it in with the low, doesn't matter 
Nigga know I was having that remix 
I play pussy and burn you, that's defense 
Baby pull out my dick and she eat it
She like how I be kicking that street shit
That's your boy, he aight, he ain't me, bitch 
Check me out on your screen, BET, bitch 
Know I got the whole gang in LA 
I'm strapped up with that thang in LA 
I hop off the plane and I skate
She 'bout to come bring me some brain, that's my bae 
I can't go back and forth with a ho
Like a bitch who gon' do everything that I say 
Say they want some of that trap talk 
I get a brick, let it moonwalk 
The K shoot silent, but it still talk 
Smoke with the pilot in the skybox 
The Culinan came with a umbrella 
Baguettes, no prongs, they stayin' together 
I lift my arm and change the weather 
Turn a bitch from nothing to a Cinderella 
They said they want some of that raw shit 
Turn it up, I'ma sit in the car, bitch 
If you turn off your lights, you gon' see me at night
Ho, you know I'm a motherfucking star, bitch 
How I know you ain't from where I'm from?
'Cause you know you can't go leave your gun in the car, dick 
Nigga like me walk down on your ass
Leave you stuck in the sand like a motherfuckin' starfish 
They said they want some of that raw shit 
Turn it up, I'ma sit in the car, bitch 
If you turn off your lights, you gon' see me at night
Ho, you know I'm a motherfucking star, bitch 
How I know you ain't from where I'm from?
'Cause you know you can't go leave your gun in the car, dick 
Nigga like me walk down on your ass
Leave you stuck in the sand like a motherfuckin' starfish 
I feel like how I'm sipping on Activis 
Might as well turn to an activist 
The meeting was corporate, walked in like we been there
Man, they ain't know we really was savages 
Ain't in a UPS or with the FedEx, but a nigga be packing it 
Ain't tryna brag or boast or tell 'em something they don't know
But a nigga be having it 
Metal on me all time 
Beefing with metal detectors and magnets 
Bitch, I'm with 'Set and DaBaby
Hit the racetrack just to see who the fastest 
Baby just came out of a cast
Don't make us put your bitch ass in a casket 
We wrapping up plastic actually
I get the backend, hot like a dragon 
I hit the Cook', then I ash it 
I fishtail the Demon, I drag it 
These niggas broke, maggots 
Take your bitch throat, stab it 
Audemar, baguettes got added 
Grab the stick, pay the hit when it's static 
Yeah, my bitch is the baddest, I’m bragging 
Quarter mil' on the Richard, it's plastic 
They said they want some of that raw shit 
Turn it up, I'ma sit in the car, bitch 
If you turn off your lights, you gon' see me at night
Ho, you know I'm a motherfucking star, bitch 
How I know you ain't from where I'm from?
'Cause you know you can't go leave your gun in the car, dick 
Nigga like me walk down on your ass
Leave you stuck in the sand like a motherfuckin' starfish 
They said they want some of that raw shit 
Turn it up, I'ma sit in the car, bitch 
If you turn off your lights, you gon' see me at night
Ho, you know I'm a motherfucking star, bitch 
How I know you ain't from where I'm from?

Nigga like me walk down on your ass
Leave you stuck in the sand like a motherfuckin' starfish
