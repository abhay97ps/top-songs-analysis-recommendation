I wanna fuck you slow with the lights on 
You're the only one I've got my sights on 
Type of sex you could never put a price on 
I'll take it off, you're the one I'll roll the dice on 
And I just want a baby with the right one
'Cause I could never be the one to hide one
And we lost a lot of things in the fire
So it took a year for me to find out 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
Oh-oh 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe
Oh-oh 
I'm tired of being home alone 
I used to have a girl a day 
But I want you to stay 
You said you might be into girls 
Said you're going through a phase 
Keeping your heart safe 
Well, baby, you can bring a friend 
She can ride on top your face 
While I fuck you straight 
And we lost a lot of things in the fire 
So it took a year for me to find out 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
Oh-oh 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
Oh-oh 
I'm tired of being home alone
Used to have a girl a day 
But I want you to stay 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
Oh-oh 
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
Oh-oh 
Ooh
