I saw her dancin'
Dancin' in some smoky place, yeah
I'll bet that I was
The only one who watched her face, ooh
All night I never saw a smile there
She didn't even try
You know for just a little while there
I saw a tear in her eye
Got to back and watch that little girl dance
I got to back and watch that little girl dance
I'll sit and watch her
And wait 'til I can get her alone, yeah
Then I'll say "Baby
Baby let me take you home"
I wonder how it is to lover her
I toss and turn in my bed
The way she moves to the music
Can't get it out of my head
I got to back and watch that little girl dance 
I got to back and watch that little girl dance
Dance for them baby, dance little girl
Wait for me baby, wait my little girl 
I got to back and watch that little girl dance
I got to back and watch that little girl dance 
I got to back and watch that little girl  dance 
I got to back and watch that little girl  dance 
I got to back and watch that little girl  dance  Whoa-oh
I got to back and watch  that little girl dance
