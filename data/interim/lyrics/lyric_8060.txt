It was 1948 like a Hollywood scene
Everybody at the door trying to live a little dream
And it was 1959 in a difficault time
We were laughing everyday singing songs and blowin' minds
Na na na na na...
I don't want to love you but you got me anyway
Na na na na na...
I don't want to love you but you got me anyway
All the things I've done and the places I've been
Every hour like a day, every day another dream
All the things that I said never meaning to say
All the times I ??? never wanting to say
Na na na na na...
I don't want to love you but you got me anyway
Na na na na na...
I don't want to love you but you got me anyway
When I get so lonely every night in my sleep
With a terrible feeling there's no one around to help me
Carry on, carry on, to the end, to the end
Looking hard in the sun for a better friend
Never die, never die as the years go by
Will life go on? Yea, life goes on
Na na na na na...
I don't want to love you but you got me anyway
Na na na na na...
I don't want to love you but you got me anyway
You got me anyway
You got me anyway
You got me anyway
