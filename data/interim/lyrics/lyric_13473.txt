I'm not the one, that you'll be shootin' for
I'm not the one, who's coming back for more
We've been through this too many times
It's never clear, it's pantomime
Goin' round and round 'cause you can't get on your feet
Goin' round and round, still takin' all the heat
Goin' round and round, never lettin' down
I'm not the one, whose memory you still keepin'
I'm not the one who's talkin' in your sleep
I don't have to tell you twice
Knew you when you weren't so nice
Goin' round and round 'cause you can't get on your feet
Goin' round and round, still takin' all the heat
Goin' round and round, never touchin' down
I'm not the one that you'll be breakin' in
And I'm not the one that you'll be takin' in
Tried and tried to crack the shell
When you fake, it's hard to tell
Goin' round and round cause you can't get on your feet
Goin' round and round, still takin' all the heat
Goin' round and round cause you can't get on your feet
Goin' round and round and round and round
Goin' round and round cause you can't get on your feet
Round and round, still takin' all the heat
Round and round cause you can't get on your feet
Round and round, still takin' all the heat
Round and round cause you can't get on your feet
Round and round, still takin' all the heat
Round and round cause you can't get on your feet
