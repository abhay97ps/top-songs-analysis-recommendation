Ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Hey, hey
Did you ever think there might be another way
To just feel better, just feel better about today
Oh, no, if you never wanna have to turn and go away
You might feel better, might feel better if you stay
Yeah, yeah
I bet you haven't heard a word I've said
Yeah, yeah
You've had enough of all your tryin'
Just give up the state of mind you're in
If you wanna be somebody else
If you're tired of fighting battles with yourself
If you wanna be somebody else
Change your mind
Change your mind
Hey, hey
Have you ever danced in the rain or thanked the sun
Just for shining, just for shining o'er the sea?
Oh no, you take it all in the world's a show
And yeah, you look much better
Look much better when you glow
Yeah, yeah
I hope you've heard every word I've said
Yeah, yeah
You've had enough of all your tryin'
Just give up the state of mind you're in
If you wanna be somebody else
If you're tired of fighting battles with yourself
If you wanna be somebody else
Change your mind
Change your mind
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Hey, hey, what ya say
We both go and seize the day
'Cause what's your hurry
What's your hurry anyway
Yeah, yeah
I hope you've heard every word I've said
Yeah, yeah
You've had enough of all your tryin'
Just give up the state of mind you're in
If you wanna be somebody else
If you're tired of losing battles with yourself
If you wanna be somebody else
Change your mind
Change your mind
Change your mind
Change your mind
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
