I got a feeling called the blues lord
Since my baby said goodbye
And I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and cry, oh lord
That last long day she said goodbye
Lordy well I thought I'm gonna cry
She do me, she took you, she got the kind of lovin'
Lord love to hear her when she called me sweet baby
Such a beautiful dream, I hate to think it's all over
I lost my heart it seems
Well I've grown so used to you somehow
Now I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome
I got the the lovesick blues
Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a pretty little gal
That's what's the matter with me
Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a pretty little gal
But she don't care about me
Oh well I tried and I tried just to keep her satisfied
But she just would not stay
And now that she is leaving
This is all I can say
I got a feeling called the blues lord
Since my baby said goodbye
And I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and cry, oh lord
That last long day she said goodbye
Lordy well I thought I'm gonna cry
She do me, she took you, she got the kind of lovin'
Lord love to hear her when she called me sweet baby
Such a beautiful dream, I hate to think it's all over
I lost my heart it seems
Well I've grown so used to you somehow
Now I'm no nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm so lonesome
I got the the lovesick blues
And I'm a-lonesome
I got the the lovesick blues
