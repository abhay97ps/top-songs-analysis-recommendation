April gave us springtime
And the promise of the flowers
And the feeling that we both shared
And a love that we called ours
We knew no time for sadness
That's a road we each had crossed
We were living a time meant for us
And even when it would rain, we would laugh it off
I've got pieces of April
I keep'em in a memory bouquet
I've got pieces of April
It's a morning in May
We stood on the crest of summer
Beneath an oak that blossomed green
Feeling as I did in April
Not really knowing what it means
But it must be then that you stand beside me now
To make me feel this way
Just as I did in April
But it's a morning in May
I've got pieces of April
I keep'em in a memory bouquet
I've got pieces of April
But it's a morning in May
I've got pieces of April
I keep'em in a memory bouquet
I've got pieces of April
It's a morning in May
It's a morning
It's a morning in May
