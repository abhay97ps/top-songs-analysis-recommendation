I make you say ooh, ooh
I make you say oooooooh
I got the dirty old hands
Of a drummer in a band
But I never really hit the sticks
I got the sunburned tan of every working man
Who's spent a minute in a ditch
And I ain't gonna try to tell another lie
You never should have let me in
Cause I'm the type of guy who  show you where my hands have been
This is now
That was then
You broke my heart, I let you in
This is now, that was then
I fucked around, with all your friends
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa oh oh
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa oh oh
This is now
That was then
Forget about the past and lets hit it again
I make you say ooh, ooh, I make you say oooooooh
Shes eleven out of ten
Got a body with a pin
You can pull it like a hand grenade
And I don't know where shes going
But I know where shes been
Cause its the only time my beds been made
And I ain't gonna try to tell another lie
You tripped me when you let me in
Cause I'm the type of guy who
Drinks until his eyes lose
Sight of whats in front of him
This is now
That was then
You broke my heart, I let you in
This is now, that was then
I fucked around, with all your friends
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa oh oh
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa oh oh
This is now
That was then
Forget about the past and lets hit it again
She's the portrait of a model
I'm just a picture of a man
She's got her fingers on a bottle
But I'm drinking from a can
And she's always seeing people
And I'm always on my own
But shes right here begging
Saying take me home, take me home
This is now
That was then
You broke my heart, I let you in
This is now, that was then
I fucked around, with all your friends
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa oh oh
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa oh oh
This is now
That was then
Forget about the past and lets hit it again
