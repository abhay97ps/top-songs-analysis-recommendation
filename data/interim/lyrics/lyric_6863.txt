Now 'Old Man Rhythm' is in my shoes
It's no use sittin' here singin' the blues
So be my guest, you got nothin' to lose
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise
Oo-wee, oo-wee, baby
Oo-wee, oo-wee, baby
Oo-wee, oo-wee, baby
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise
I feel like jumpin', and, honey, won't you join me please? Yeah
Well, I don't like beggin', but now I'm gonna bend a knee, oh yeah
Well, I gotta get a-movin', honey, I ain't lyin'
My heart is beating the rhythm, and it's right on time
So be my guest, you got nothin' to lose
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise
Oo-wee, oo-wee, baby
Oo-wee, oo-wee, baby
Oo-wee, oo-wee, baby
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise
Well, I gotta get a-rockin', get my hat off the rack
I gotta boogie-woogie like a knot's in my back
So be my guest, you got nothin' to lose
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise
Oo-wee, oo-wee, baby
Oo-wee, oo-wee, baby
Oo-wee, oo-wee, baby
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise
I feel like jumpin', and, honey, won't you join me please? Yeah
Well, I don't like beggin', but now I'm gonna bend a knee, oh yeah
Oo-wee, oo-wee, baby
Oo-wee, oo-wee, baby
Oo-wee, oo-wee, baby
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise
And I'm goin', and I'm goin', and I'm goin' on a sea sea cruise
Let me take you on a sea cruise, na na
