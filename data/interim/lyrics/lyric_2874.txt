You're the only world I know you're the one I can't let go
You're my laughter and my tears and I love you all my years
You're the beating of my heart you're my thoughts when we're apart
You're the one I can't let go you're the only only world I know
You're my nighttime and my day you're my one love all the way
You're the one I can't let go you're the only only world I know
