Me and my baby been on the run
So very long
Her folks sent a man to get us
They say we've done wrong
So we run, yeah we run, yeah we run
From the stranger in town
Stranger in town, he's out to get me
Stranger in town wants me and my baby
He follows me to every town
And if he gets me he'll bring me down
So we run, yeah we run, yeah we run
From the stranger in town
I'm not afraid of what they'll do to me
I'm just afraid they'll hurt my baby
We don't care if we run forever
Just as long as we're together
Stranger in town, I think we've lost him
Stranger in town, can't let him bring us in
Another town, one more mile
And we'll be free for a while
And we'll run, yeah we'll run, yeah we'll run
From the stranger in town
Stranger in town, stranger in town
Stranger in town, stranger in town
