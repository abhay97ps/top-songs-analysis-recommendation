If you decide to make me blue, I'll be in trouble
If you decide to be untrue, I'll be in trouble
'Cause no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway
So if that's what you wanna do, I'll be in trouble
If you decide one day you want to make a change, love
You want to leave me here and love a total stranger
Well, no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway
So if that's what you wanna do, I'll be in danger
I'll do everything I can to make you stay
Keep you by my side 
'Cause I love you in such a way
I have to forget all about my pride
If you decide you want to go, I'll be in trouble
I can't prepare myself and soul, I'll be in trouble
So no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway
So I just want you to know, I'll be in trouble
Oh yeah
If you decide you want to go, I'll be in trouble
I can't prepare myself and soul, I'll be in trouble
So no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway
So I just want you to know, I'll be in trouble
I'll be in trouble, 
If you ever leave me, baby 
If you deceive me 
I must confess, 
My life would be a mess 
I'll be in trouble, baby 
So much trouble 
Hmmm, everyday, trouble 
And everyway, so much trouble. 
Hmmm, baby 
So much trouble
