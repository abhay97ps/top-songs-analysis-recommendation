Sun comin' up over New York City
School bus driver in a traffic jam
Starin' at the faces in her rearview mirror
Looking at the promise of the Promised Land
One kid dreams of fame and fortune
One kid helps pay the rent
One could end up goin' to prison
One just might be president
Only in America
Dreamin' in red, white, and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to
We all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America
Sun goin' down on an LA freeway
Newlyweds in the back of a limousine
A welder's son and a banker's daughter
All they want is everything
She came out here to be an actress
He was the singer in a band
They just might go back to Oklahoma
And talk about the stars they could have been
Only in America
Dreamin' in red, white, and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to
And we all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America
Only in America
Where we dream in red, white, and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to
We all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America
Yeah, only in America
Where we dream in red, white, and blue
Yeah, we dream as big as we want to
America
