Symphony, symphony of love
Music from above how does it start?
You walk in and the song begins
Sing but I only start in my heart
Then you speak the melody seems to rise
Then you sigh and it softly dies
Symphony sing to me
Then we kiss and it's clear to me
When you're near to me you are my symphony
My symphony
A rose must remain with the sun and the rain
Or its lovely promise won't come true
To each his own, to each his own
And my own is you
What good is a song if the words just don't belong?
And a dream must be a dream for two
No good alone, to each his own
For me there's you
CHORUS
If a flame is to grow there must be a glow
To open each door there's a key
I need you, I know, I can't let you go
Your touch means too much to me
Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed
Or they'll never know what love can do
To each his own, I've found my own
One and only you
REPEAT FROM CHORUS
