Why don't everybody put your hands together,clap along with the music
The song is not a very hard one to sing, but I'd like everyone to what I'm saying to ya
You're the reason, I want to live girl
I swear you're the reason, I want to give
You're a part of my body, you're all of my soul…well
And a love like ours baby, is so sweet and mellow …oh girl
 It's the only love I'll ever need
 naw, naw, I can't let you get away
 Only lovе I'll ever need
I want to talk about it, gotta tell somеbody bout it, tell somebody how I feel about you
 Tell the world
 Tell the world 
Ain't no shame, ain't no shame
, Tell the world
, Tell the world 
You're the person, you're the person, that God must have put here for me
Now tell me who's are you, but all my destiny, lawd
You're more just my woman, you're purpose in my life
For you I'd do anything, I'll make any, any sacrifice
 It's the only love I'll ever need
 I can't let you get away
 Only love I'll ever need
I want to talk about it, gotta tell somebody bout it, tell somebody how I feel about you
 Tell the world
 Tell the world 
Ain't no shame, ain't no shame
 Tell the world
 Tell the world
