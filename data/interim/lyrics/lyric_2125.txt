Please hear the song
My blue guitar is playing
Why did you go away
The song is saying
Listen to my
Blue guitar call to you
While my heart is aching
And breaking in two
Every note repeats I want you
Night and day, my song will haunt you
Til things are like they were before
And you are in my arms once more
Play, play, my blue guitar
Tell her that I love her so
Play, play, my blue guitar
True love will find a way, I know
Play, play, my blue guitar
Tell her that I love her so
Play, play, my blue guitar
True love will find a way, I know
Every note repeats I want you
Night and day, my song will haunt you
Til things are like they were before
And you are in my arms once more
