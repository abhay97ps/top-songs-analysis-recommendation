I'm getting ready for the function at the junction
And baby you better come on, now now
Because everybody's gonna be there
We've got people comin' from everywhere
We've got Ling Ting Tong from China
Long Tall Sally from Carolina
We've got 007, the private eye
And he's bringin' all the guys from I Spy
Come one, come all, we're gonna have a ball
Down at the function at the junction
And baby you better come on, now now
We're serving egg foo young and barbecue
Having chicken dumplings and kidney stew
Having heap big fun 'til the break of dawn
Gonna shake a tail feather, shoot him 'fore he run
Hold a shotgun on the rooster, and dare him to crow
Hotfoot anybody sleepin', make 'em get out on the floor
Tell him to tell them, to tell Paul to tell them all
Tell 'em 'bout the function at the junction
And tell 'em that they'd better come on, now now
Tell 'em 'bout the function at the junction, baby
Tell 'em that they'd better come on, now now
All the soul brothers, jitterbuggers
Hip cats and fancy hats
And pretty girls with pretty smiles
All decked out in the latest styles
And Farmer Jim and Guitar Slim
And Betty Boop and "Oop-boop-be-doop"
Mohair Sam from Alabam'
And Minnesota Fats from Hobo Flats
Breath-takin', hip-shakin' cuties, now
Talkin' 'bout some fascinatin', devastatin' beauties, now
They'll all be gathering here, from far and near
For the function at the junction
And brother, you better come on, now now
Tell 'em 'bout the function at the junction
Sister, you better come on, now now
Talkin' 'bout a function at the junction
Everybody, you better come on, now
You ain't never seen the function at the junction
You ain't never...
