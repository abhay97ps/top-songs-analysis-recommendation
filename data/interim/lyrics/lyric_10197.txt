Times are hard and you're so all alone
Still you live your life from day to day
You know it's no good
So you fall apart, your future plans
Throws your past in your bag and move away
I don't want to see you run no more
I don't want to hear you cry again
You don't need to waste your days no more
You don't need to look for it any more
Try to draw joy
I knew a man that loved so long ago
A lady stole his heart. A lady broke his heart
And he knew it was no good
So he decided to make some plans
He went and laid his life on the line
Moved away
I don't want to see him run no more
I don't want to hear him cry again
He don't need to waste his days no more
He don't need to look for it any more
Try to draw joy
You'll love again
You'll love again
You'll love again
Oh‚ you'll love again
Yes you will
Oh‚ you'll love again
I don't want to see you run no more
I don't want to hear you cry again
You don't need to waste your days no more
You don't need to look for it any more
I don't want to see you run no more
I don't want to hear you cry again
You don't need to waste your days no more
You don't need to look for it any more
I don't want to see you run no more
I don't want to hear you cry again
You don't need to waste your days no more
You don't need to look for it any more
I don't want to see you run no more
I don't want to hear you cry again
You don't need to waste your days no more
You don't need to look for it any more
I don't want to see you run no more
I don't want to hear you cry again
