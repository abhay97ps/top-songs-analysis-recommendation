Don't wanna love you
Don't wanna make you my wife
Don't wanna see ya
Everyday for the rest of my life
All I want is a one-night affair 
Oh, I got to have
Oh, I'll hit and run
I'm a son-of-a gun
I'll hit and run
Yes, I will, yes, I will
Yes, I'll wine and dine ya
Take you anywhere you wanna go
And when the night is over
I don't want to see you no more
All I want is a one-night affair 
Oh, let me have
Oh, I'll hit and run
I'm a son-of-a gun
I'll hit and run
Yes, I will, yes, I will
Oh, I'll never let you under my skin
'Cause I don't want to be hurt again
Oh, I
Yes, I will
Yes, I am
Yes, I will
All I want is a one-night affair 
Oh, let me have
Oh, I'll hit and run
I'm a son-of-a gun
I'll hit and run
Yes, I will, yes, I will
Oh, I'll never let you under my skin
'Cause I don't want to be hurt again
Oh, I
Yes, I will
Yes, I am
Yes, I will
All I want is a one-night affair 
Oh, let me have
Oh, I'll hit and run
I'm a son-of-a gun
I'll hit and run
Yes, I will, yes, I will
