You've been the first in my life
Who has ever made me feel this way
And I will not deny
I'm gonna need you right here
By my side
Baby, I can wait
Let me take your breath away
Never will be too late
Baby, I can wait
-CHORUS-
You are mine
There's no other one for me
Keep in mind
You make my life complete
And tonight
We'll make love endlessly
Cuz you're mine
You're the one that I'll keep
For all time
Now that you're here, boy
I'm never gonna let you go
Can I touch you there, or
Do you mind if we kiss real slow
You're my everything
You're my hopes and dreams
Baby, you know it ain't no lie
I'm gonna be with you till the day that I die
Baby, I can wait
Let me take your breath away
Never will be too late
Baby, I can wait
-CHORUS-
You're the one that lights my fire
You're the one that keeps me strong
You're the one that I depend on
When my world is goin' wrong
You're the one that I hold closer
You're the man I'm dreaming of
And I really really love you
I just want you to know that
-CHORUS-
I can't wait til the day
When I hear you say
You're the one that I need
You're the one that I'll keep
For all time
