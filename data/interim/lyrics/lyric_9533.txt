Hand me down my walkin' cane
Hand me down my hat
Hurry now and don't be late
'Cause we ain't got time to chat
You and me, we're goin' out
To catch the latest sound
Guaranteed to blow your mind
So high you won't come down
Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam
Oh, this dude is outta sight
Everything he does
Seems to come out right
Once I went to hear him play
At a club outside of town
I was so surprised, I was hypnotized
By the sound these cats put down
When I saw this short, fat guy
Stretch a band between his toes
Hey, I laughed so hard
'Cause the man got down
When it finally reached his nose
Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam
Got that rubber band, uh
Up on his toes
And then he wriggled it up
All around his nose
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Playin' all that music, yet keepin' time
Where in the world did he learn that, oh, Lord
Lord, help him get away
Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam
Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, uh
Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo
Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, uh
Rubberband man, rubberband man, uh
Du du du du
Watch him, keep movin', just movin'
Got em groovin' on the corner, it's burnin' up, y'all
Ohooohooohhh
Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Rubberband man's a doozy
Move so quick, uh, he make me woozy
And then he stopped to show down
He wiggle it up, he wiggle it down, uh
Got speed to move it
Get rubberband off the ground, uh
He lifted it well high
In the sky, y'all
And then he
Du du du du du
Oh, get with it, y'all
Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam
Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, uh
Turn it up, turn it up
Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, uh
Rubberband man, rubberband man, uh
How much of this stuff do he think we can stand, uh, huh?
So much rhythm, grace, and debonair for one man, Lord
And then he had the nerve to twiggle his left toe
Slip it through his knee, got the feeling in his head, y'all
Aw, come on, baby
Hey, y'all, prepare yourself  for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound 
Like the rubberband man 
You're bound to lose control 
When the rubberband starts to jam
Rubberband man starts to jam
Moving up and down cross the land
Got the people all in his wake
Everything probably seems outta place
Just move it, just move it
Just move, move, move it
Just, rubberband, rubberband man
Just move it, just move it
Just move, move, move it
Just, rubberband, rubberband man
Get down
Oh, get down low
Ah ha
Oh, he can jam, y'all
Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound 
Like the rubberband man 
You're bound to lose control 
When the rubberband starts to jam
Ohwee
What's he doin' to me?
Rhythms I ain't felt before
Just groovin' up loudly
Gotta move, I gotta groove
Rubberband man
Achoo, achoo, achoo
The way he twiddles his toes with the band 
Hey, y'all,  prepare yourself for the rubberband man 
You've never heard a sound 
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control 
When the rubberband starts to jam
Ready to jam
Do my Rubberband
Ready to jam
I gotta do my Rubberband
A-twang, a-twang, a-twang, a-twang
Lord, have mercy
A-twang, a-twang, a-twang, a-twang
Just strike me in my bones
A-twang, a-twang, a-twang, a-twang
Maked a move, y'all
I kinda groove when I did
Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man 
You've never heard a sound 
Like the rubberband man 
You're bound to lose control 
When the rubberband starts to jam
He's a big fat man that moves me good
Everybody oughta knock on wood
When you see the man do his stuff
