Yo it’s been a minute since the pen ain’t been a prob
I remind em all suicide bombs, fly the plane 9/11 dog
Tell em build a mosque, tabernacle, a synagogue
I’mma send em bars like the scriptures were sent from God
That’s too biblical not to listen to
Metaphysical literal lyrics put an end to you
Fully focused to finish you fucks
How you fitting to use all the miniscule minister minute I diminish dudes
That mean minus y’all, get these niggas Tylenol
Cause all I’m giving niggas is headaches when the mic is on
It was hyping y’all, in the magazines, on the blogs
So I aimed the bars at the block that’s the streets involved
Nas, no BS, no Chris Brown, just my Boston squad
Unless the Knicks is at the TD Garden
But everything else is mash while we steam up the hash
I’m with V Knucks and Flash about to reup the cash motherfucker
With the pen we true veterans
With the pen we teach youth to use Heaven-sent spitting blue heroin
On the move pedalling, measure and move medicine
Penmanship, smooth elegant, true veterans
Partially own half the strips that you think is popping
California buzz word to Stockton
Then I headed back to Boston
Lyrically an arson, turn the temperature up
We stick to niggas flossing
Intelligent thugs, gateway we pedalling drugs
My ink spray metal ? with blood
Cross the bosses, MAC-10s spit with night forces
Word niggas will bang for them Vs and might force it
My BBM reports like CNN
Got bitches who wanna see my men
Not many artists who wanna see the pen
Torae, Brooklyn don the vets
My soldiers swarm on anything and everything if it’s drama
? approach and die
Official vets from the Bridge to the Stuy, no lie
In the lab Easy Rider inhale we what you feel
This is proof that hip hop’s still real motherfucker
My pen depicts victimization and niggas that’s hating
My triggers is shaking, no clique is escaping, I ship em to Satan
God type spitting the ancient like hieroglyphics
And paintings from pyramids that was scripted in basements
I spit heat for the immigrant Haitians
In prison it’s pacing living in cages working for minimum wages
Pages of hope ? resembling Asians
Making moves to the Caymans
With clear water and the view is amazing
Now I’m taking trips to Jamaica with bitches with paper
I know where I came from, that’s why my vision is greater
So why the fuck would I consider a hater?
I’m stacking grands, making movies with some stunts doing favours
Jackie Chan, Torae spitting crack with the fam
We matching them grams
You want fire? I’mma need the cash in advance
I rap for them fans from Bean to the Africa sands
Now tell me who the fuck can go in like Flash and his mans
