There's no chill and yet I shiver
There's no flame and yet I burn
I'm not sure what I'm afraid of
And yet I'm trembling
There's no storm yet I hear thunder
And I'm breathless why I wonder
Weak one moment then the next I'm fine
I feel as if I'm falling
Every time I close my eyes
And flowing through my body
Is a river of surprise
Feelings are awakening
I hardly recognize as mine
What are all these new sensations
What's the secret they reveal
I'm not sure I understand
But I like the way I feel
Oh why why why why oh
Why is it that every time
I close my eyes he's there
The water shining on his skin
The sunlight in his hair
And all the while I'm thinking things
That I can never share with him
I'm a bundle of confusion
Yet it has a strange appeal
Did it all begin with him
And the way he makes me feel
I like the way he makes me feel, he makes me feel
I like the way, I like the way he makes me feel
