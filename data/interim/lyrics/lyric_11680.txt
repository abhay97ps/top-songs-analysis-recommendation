I see the message in your eyes
I feel the hunger closing in
As something deep within the night
Tells me that I'm in love again
I know it's not the first time
And I know it won't be the last
All alone I can't make the verse rhyme
No don't let this one slip past
Let's steal the night
Let's make our great escape
Steal the night
Hey, hey
Let's steal the night
Before it gets too late
Steal the night away
Steal the night away
I can clearly read your mind
Caught by your fire from the start
So let's not waste our precious time
Go on and listen to your heart
