Please, this shit's so fucking hard
Helluva Beats
Yeah, ayy, ayy
Thirty-thousand words in a rap, that's a first, and, in fact, that's the most in the world on a track
Yeah, I've been searchin' the map, for like any other person who could work it like that
Do it perfectly slow and then perfectly fast, I'm the only one that's out here, and I'm certain of that
Play me a beat, it gets turned into ash, if I play you a beat, it gets turned into trash
Ayy, hold up, wait, when I'm on the track, I make no mistakes
I can do the shit for like thirty-thousand hours, fuck thirty-thousand words, I don't slow my breaks
I go UK, then I make so many pounds, everybody think I'm overweight
Gettin' bread, see me eatin', but I gotta go in, better hold my plate
Ooh, ooh, gotta switch up, I'm so godly, I'm the bishop
Now these haters wanna link up, my bars make them get the hiccups
So I had to run it up real quick, freestyle, gotta do some real shit real quick
Everything I do is real big 'cause I gotta get the crowd to feel this,  real lit, real shit
Nowadays, they write me and I don't write it back, see my future demons like a psychic and a psychopath
Swear I'm drivin' down the road and I might've crashed, do the dash, always movin', don't know where to find me at
Hey, movin' on, gotta find a team, earnin' all my stripes like Camilla, but I'm lima beans
All these rappers 'bout to get fucked like they Riley Reid, I'm your teacher, so be quiet or I am assignin' seats
Pioneer to the shit, Leif Eriksson, I was even hunted, 2012, like I'm Jerry Lynn
All these places got me sneezin', need a Claritin, until I fall off next year, I'ma be arrogant
Yeah, I'm runnin' all this shit, run it up, yeah, you know that I be comin' up for a hun'ed bucks
At the start, all I wanted was like thirty-thousand hits, got bored, add a couple zeroes for the shits
Why not? Look what I got, look what I bought, camera is my true eye, I'm a side-clause
Shoes, they go too high, only high-tops, fuck yeah, I'm the new guy, what am I on?
Come in, Jaden Smith, I'm a motherfuckin' icon, boy, I'm too cold, I don't even have on my ice on
Too lit, I don't even have the mic on, and I'm too bright, I don't even have the lights on
Better wait up, shit's too easy, like a layup
And my bitch too entertainin', see the note, you gotta stay up
Takin' bets on that I'll fail, it's time to pay up
Now you tryna hide your face, I'm pretty sure that that ain't make-up, uh
I'm droppin' hits to get the world records, who's your favorite artist, 'cause I'm sure better?
Well maybe not, but I tried, though, Post Malone, I go psycho
Leave you a stink, like a rhino, 'cause I rap beef, no gyro
And I rhyme fast and I rhyme slow, turned my L's into W's; typo
Uh, hop into the track, give you the love and you give it right back
Ten different flows I be spittin', some trap and some other shit get in it's get on the map
Done this for like a year, and now, my writing's clear, I've been gettin' respect, 'cause now I am here
And I'm here to stay, did you hear me say, "I'm not here to play"?
"He got a flow and a voice now, I remember when he choki'g a boy out
But he's back in showin' no choice now, don't you know that he's gonna destroy now?"
So I'm gonna get there, and I know how, cut his beat, I'll be blaring 'em so loud
We'll be talk about bitches and money, this shit is so funny, my parents are so proud, damn
I'm startin' to try, tryin' the shots at it, look at the ground and see stars in the sky
Drawin' the line, all of you rappers are dizzy, I can see the stars in your eyes
You're probably high, if you think that you compare to me, it must be part of the lines
Copyin' guys, you better send all those beats back to Future, like Marty McFly
Thirty-thousand words on a track, lil' bitch, now these people turn my vid on and react, lil' bitch
Know I got the clout, I got the stats, lil' bitch, and you givin' me a headache, where's the Advil, bitch?
But I'm doin' all I can, and I did it in the past-tense, makin' all this money up off of YouTube off me AdSense
Money up off of YouTube off AdSense, all of you are wack, that's a fact, I'ma rap then
And I rap, huh, I'm a laptop, Eminem holds the world record for "Rap God"
1.6K words, though, we already have that topped
And we'll do it for another hour, and I'm underrated and I'm underpowered
My bars are so filthy, all of y'all need to take another shower
For every fan, there's a hundred doubters, and they let me know up in the comments
But you know that we ain't done, 'cause I gotta talk my nonsense
And I gotta keep it clean, uh, do exactly what my mom says
And I know when they headed for the top, and we still be makin' progress
I can spit bars for nine months, then deliver you a new life
Yeah, we eatin' in this bitch, uh, all y'all better take a huge bite
And I didn't even write that shit, 'cause I freestyle, you still like that shit
See my video, press 'like' on it, that subscribe button? Better wipe that shit
I'm getting tired of this beat, I think it's time to change it
'Cause I'll spaz on trap, old school boom-bap, you name it
Think of that as a intro, now we get into the meat of it
This some shit you didn't see comin', I don't give a fuck 'bout what you think of it!
Heh, ayy!
Ayy, ayy
Uh, switch up
Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy
Look out the window, see past it, but we're faintin' reflections
You never laugh like you used to, you've got fainter expressions
You headin' down the wrong path and they changin' directions
Maybe don't mention 'bout how I made me your blessin'
And lately, I question the shit that was taught to me
I'm awkwardly stoppin' these conversations
Hey, how long you waitin' till the day you wake up and thank God you made it?
I don't like to dwell, but man, I gotta say it, don't like my songs, but you still gotta play it
Don't like your road, just N.W.A., Dr. Dre it
Stop contemplatin' and stop complainin'
And recreate it, actually, don't recreate it, be creative
Reached the place where you still vibe in that shit when we replay it
Living a life of pain just to alleviate it
When you haven't used nothing but distractions to really take it
Yeah, maybe they'll change when they see we made it
We headin' onto new platforms and leavin' the basics
Uh, my creative process is making progress
Despite my background, I haven't gotten to playin' lacrosse yet
Don't you know we got a good thing goin'?
I've been watchin' all these shows while I could be showin'
I've been creeping up on the door, so dangerous
You looking at statistics, while I figure how I'm changin' them
I done learned so many things in my past life
Now I don't give a single shit about the rap life
That's nice, ain't it? That's nice to be given advice when I paint it
Have twice much the fame, and
I can't even comprehend that much in the future
Hatin' the teacher, but you loving the tutor
Enter the game, I'm a fuckin' intruder
Stealin' these flows, man, I'm stuck as a looter
Procrastinatin' 'cause my fucking computer
No willpower, I'm just stuck as a loser
Sittin' alone at 3 AM
Chillin' on a late night is the weekday's friend
Man, this shit is too wild, I "must behave, Ben"
That's what the teachers are preachin' to me, but even when
I'm on the top of this drop and they're rocking the world with confidence
Accomplishments topplin' everyone and you try stoppin' it?
-Obvious there's a problem, and solvin' it just ain't up to me
Luckily, I've been trained to test the system, don't you fuck with me
I hope you like my company, I hope you do appreciate it
I hope that one day, you'll see we made it
No, you cannot recreate it, all of this pain, I just alleviate it
I'm just trying to find the mindset, grinding to be the greatest
That is why I'm strivin', livin', tryin', I'm buyin'
I'm givin' dignity, cryin', I'm winnin', but feel like dyin'
I'm shining, I'm like a diamond, but I am dead on the inside
Guessin' now we'll rest with this, but set it on my big mind
And I'm in time
-Workin' all my life, get that in line
I'm tryna figure out, everyone get their pictures out
Nobody's gonna live without this shit on the incline
I'm on the incline, I'm on the incline
Stay in your lane, you got your place and I'm in mine
I'm on the incline, bitch, I'm on the incline
Nobody can really understand how my shit climb
Have I been livin' yet? Spendin' time on the internet
I'm wastin', they hatin' it, I should be makin' it, aimin' for goals but takin' this shit instead
I stay in bed, laughin' at stupid shit, ludicrous
Who is this ten-year-old pregnant with two new kids? Why am I doing this?
Why the fuck do I care? I don't, but I kinda do
I don't know what I try to do, but whatever it is, I say, "Bye", to you
Hey, me, I lied to you! Don't realize? Well it's time you do
You have no idea what I can do, when the skies are gray, you gotta find a blue
You gotta try to do, something to put you into a new positive mindset
Set headlines, go wreck lines, pass deadlines, leave lines dead
I guess that I digress, and I digest the way I'm blessed
Impressed after I'm pressed, you seek intent for what I said
But I'm just gonna move on, get your groove on for my new song
Do right, and you do wrong, got a big head, Jimmy Neutron
You try to hate, well, get in line, just delivered some quick rhymes
Some straight bars, we have came far, but we lookin' up on the incline
Water break
I got a lot to say
It's been eleven minutes so far
Actually, it hasn't, it's been shorter
How can I have a believable meaning
When all of you livin' in paradise, livin' in luxury, nobody seen it or  greet it?
But what if it's different, I mean, it's all seeming to be, and it's in inconceivable dreaming?
I know it's so unbelievable, being stuck in this rare unachievable feeling
They givin' me something, I ended up leaving, they givin' me nothing, I ended up grievin'
No positive side, ended up seeing what life could be like from a  different lead in
Thank God for a cover zone so I know when and where to cross it
All over the place, I'm surprised I haven't lost it
Yeah, ayy, and I'm feeling like I'm at the top, uh
Livin' to the max now
Yeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm steppin' up, I never back down, more focused on my background
And the music and how my rap sounds, speak up, cut the track down
Go till the end, I don't back out, stuck in the trap, figure that out
After, I'll do the math now, it's garbage, take the trash out
But I'm here to stay till I pass out, blackout
Okay, it's time to go fast, so sit back and relax, and just maybe you'll get it
About time, but maybe you're mad I said it, you gon' pay attention, cash or credit?
I have to let it go back a second, I have some lyrics in the past that I have to edit
Now we're back in the middle of the track , mix it up and if you talk, then, nah, forget it
We moved on, walked past the exit, want you to come back and pass a message
-Never pack bags and trash, you left it, kinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it
Money, never am glad I spent it, if I ever had told you I'm mad, I meant it
If you ever feel bad or sad, accept it, think back to the track and the rap that Ben did
Yeah, pretty obvious I'm killing it, if this isn't my time, then maybe you need a syllabus
I'm feelin' all the rhythm, you can tell that I am into this, voice is more powerful than a million instruments
Suddenly, lyrics go demon, like it's somebody else, people want me to grow because of you
But I'm never going to level my endeavors to be better than the people that never had trust in me
Yeah, uh
And I'm feeling like I'm at the top, yeah
Livin' to the max now, uh
Yeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm stepping up, I never back down, more focused on background
And the music and how my rap sounds
Speak up, and they're messing with the track now
People are tellin' me that I'm fallin' short, looking back at you when you're missing all the cash now
And I'm mad at the fact that I'm not in my right mind
Meant to be a half-decent rapper, but I keep on saying all the wrong words at the right time
Lookin' at yourself, you never know what you might find, lookin' at the sky in the middle of the nighttime
I find so much life, I wonder why I can't just find mine
Got so many confusing questions, so much knowledge, I can use some lessons
I'm emerging out with a new profession, I'ma do the best with my new perfection
And I'm doin' it, I'm moving onto this future shit
These hooligans are complete fools in that they just don't understand that I am through with it
Improvin' it, I'm improvin' it, I got my brain, and I'm usin' it
And I'ma make it out alive when I'm playin' and takin' and makin' this cash, that I'm tearing these tools to bits
You're clueless, ninety percent of y'all ignorant
Keeping your minds oh-so limited, get off your high horse, because now it is time to figure it out
Seeming so close, I can picture it now, success in my drink, and I'm sippin' it now
Envisioning deeper ambitions, and now, I'ma get to it, that is what living's about
Uh, God!
Uh
My voice is gone already, shit
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Think I've got a consensus, bein' lost in the trenches
Adolescent lessons expressin' God's job is to tempt us
Makin' it hard to stay alive, it's so easy to die
Makin' you hang your head low, but say, "Reach for the skies"
Life is a walkin' contradiction, I see through its lies
I'm just tryna tell the stories I've seen through its eyes
I feel I'm forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry
With all this fake deep bullshit, I'm too eager to try
Yeah, everybody sendin' blessings in need of reply
Tryna sell their own tears, for they bleedin', they dry
Fuck your demons inside, I'm in need of the, "Why?"
So I can summarize my life through my breathing and sigh
Like, oh well, I can say that I tried
Hopped into life and then I stayed for the ride
So many beautiful faces, but they vacant inside
And I'm just patiently waiting for the day I decide, damn
This reminds me of days when I drive in L.A
I'm screamin', "Hi" to the sky up with a smile on my face
Now I'm hidin' my face, I keep tryin' to trace
All of the steps that I had taken to findin' my place
Swept out to oceans so lonely, waves feel like an embrace
And now I'm lookin' at my mic like it's sent as a prophet
I used to be an atheist, but that turned me agnostic
Recently, I've been wondering if I've fuckin' lost it
See my friends from kindergarten go to rehab
That's the type of shit that makes you think back
To simpler times, blissfully ignorant minds
Before reality could ground us, we would live in the skies
And as a- and as a kid, I never thought I'd be bein' like this 
Man, as a kid, I never thought this would even exist
I felt elusive, intangible, just steam in the mist
And now I'm wakin' up feelin' I ain't even this shit
You only look at what you got once you see that it's lost
And life's too gradual for me to believe in my sauce
Don't understand rappers braggin', "I got that paper on me"
Man, I got kids in schools who doin' presentations on me
So what the fuck you really value tryin' to take that from me?
To me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money
Rain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study
And write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn
Like Tyler, Creator tweets, I just capitalize
These Romans tally up my hits with the capital 'I's
This is a natural high
I see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies
I wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried
They say 'cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie
They think 'cause I'm a awkward kid, I'm invalid
As DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive
Throughout half of my album, it wasn't good enough
Shit, I mean it still isn't good enough
I'm like an active volcano, I know I could erupt
But I guess I am not full enough, damn
I swear, the higher you get, that's the lower you feel
Man, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal
Man, that's more shit you gotta prove so they know that it's real
Thirty seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel
Yeah, said this a motherfucking thesis statement
Yeah, came a long way, I cannot be complacent
Every day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest
And if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted
Most of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me
So when I die, I know I left us with something to leave
So when I wake up in the morning with something to see
Yeah, I got so much shit that I'm wantin' to be
Benny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said
If you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous-
Many want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant
Got iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence
Yeah, I know I'm way too cocky
But I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out
So when people say you can't, that makes you wanna get better
That's benefit of the doubt
I've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom
It's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often
And I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around
Always stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like-
Yeah, this is freedom of speech
Tryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace
Sacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree
Opportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like-
Nah, I'm just tryna find some clarity
Apparently, it all has to do with popularity
There will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to
What is carefully being prepared to me
Sometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity
I'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful at the very least
Giving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see
Everyone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy
'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping block and what's often the case
Shot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass
Off of the place, brought in a way predict what I will probably say
And at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so, obviously, let the audience say
So let me explain this to those who came in looking at the stages
Seeing a white kid thinking he's famous
When they don't understand that I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest
Entertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in
-Re-energize, got lyrics to memorize
Start an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try
That's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin'
With the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon
But I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin'
Limited ability with little humility
But whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me
I'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history
Tryna show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me
Tryna win this gold and try hard, good game, gg
You beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me
Showin' up on your device, control/option/delete
Consider myself elite, measure myself in retweets
I be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me
Instead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout
I'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house
Tryna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch
I'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out
Into reality, in normality actually happily
Found myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why?
'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing
Nothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing
Not complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it
Love sleepin' and just usin' the internet
But my time is limited, and I better figure this
Before I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips
And let me just tell you what I have came to do
Tryna' show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to
Tryna' show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo
And say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through
And if a major record label is looking at me
I'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats
I can rap fast, and rap slow
I may make mistakes but everyone, has, so
I'm like MJ back when he had the afro
Also, I'm not black, so.. maybe not
But before everyone gets angry, stop
I'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block
All the people who keep on going crazy off
'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, got
A lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker
With some dominant teachers
I deserve to be starter, but constantly on the bleachers
I'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager
They be fearin' this every time that they hearin' it
To know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid
So when you're nearin' this, please let me know
When I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go
Hear the metronome combined in the compilation
To unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation
But that is just a dream, and probably a combination
Of a big ego and false encouragement on the way in
But when I'm playin', just know it's all a big game
I was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name
But when you think about it, it is all insane
What can be created from chemicals in this brain
But when you look at me, you lackin' respect
When I'm crackin' my neck so that I can rap to my chest
Has in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step
Until I'm on the same stage, and you have it again
But, but when you think about the hall-of-fame
You think about how people used to sit and call you names
And you check and wonder if it will be all the same
Step back into reality, it all remains, damn
Alright, I just spilled water on my computer right now
On my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this thirty-thousands words shit
Hold on, uh
Goddamn it
My lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean
This is off the top, I don't need to use no machines
Hold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever
But I am very clever
Okay, okay, I'm gonna take a drink, if you're watching this, take a drink too
These are some shit' that you can drink to
But drink water unless you're of age
You know what I'm saying? Ayy
Okay, okay
Uh
Uh
Ayy
I feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous
And most of humanity's made of idiots
I barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand?
You think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand?
Please... what I do is barely poetry
There's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me
But still consider me confident
Still consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness
But honestly, all of this, is haunting me, probably
It is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling
Into awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin'
It's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening
It's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake
I close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away
Yeah, we're just tryna find that great escape
To get away from how we're living life day-to-day
Some people find it in a drink or in a cup
Or in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love
But all I know is that it's tough
And all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much
I'm Jong and Ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper?
These kid-haters are like ten years old, but still claim to be big players
That shit will make me go, but I'm aiming high, and you aiming low
Got amazing rhymes and a crazy flow, and I may be , but I came to show
What I can do when I get on the mic, and I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype
And I'm seeing it through in successes inside, I don't take it for granted with plans in this life
-Set on the wrong, forgetting the right, like, 2 AM in my head in the lights
Ahead of the best of 'em, lettin' the rest of 'em go off to bed in the night
-Getting it like I be livin' in first class, I know that you never will surpass
-Getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work fast
Remember the memos they sendin' and sendin' again and again  and they never will end it
And say it is splendid, but never relented and every sentence I say is perfected
Take a deep breath, 'cause I need that
Most of y'all don't even care what I'm saying, you really just like how I speak fast
My bars are meta, I got meta bars with meta-eights and metaphors
You want better cores and better cars, but you don't know what I'm headin' towards
Say that I am the king of this shit, crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this
I'm ingin' and rappin', and makin' it happen and makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit
Tryna find the other way, y'all just waiting for another day
'Cause what other fourteen-year-old had hit 100K?
I'm making the most of a crazier flow, so many ways it could go
I'm taking the throne and you chillin' and stayin' at home, I'm willing to make it my own
I'm bakin' my cake, and you know that I'm eating it, even if staying up late is the needed bit
Reason is, stayin' the same, I'm just fleein' it, leavin' my life while I'm seeing these seasons switch
Meaning, these people ain't feelin' rich, reach in the fire, I'm heatin' it
Pleasin' these liars, they've , they so now they're receiving it, agreeing to be a live without leading it
Flow's so dope, I think it's time that we take a break
We all make mistakes and play some hate, I got 808s here to save the day
'Cause I am on top of it, lost in my thoughts and I gotta be stoppin' it, rockin' it
You know my flow is so dominant, positive, confident, full of accomplishments, compliments
All of these offers is boring as fuck, though I am not a part of 'em
Start a new part to the charts and I gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when I'm starting it
Breaking it up, like cartilage, flow is so crazy, it's dope and you know it
I know that you hate to admit it, but really, this shit is the business, rhymes keep darkenin'
Under the radar, you don't know what's comin', I'm comin' right up, and your bitch started runnin'
I found to be part of a little of something called love, and I guess that's the art of it
I try to go slow, but it don't work
-Gettin' better, that don't hurt, and you think I'm dead, and you're sure
You're salty and not kosher, slave to the corporates and the owners
This is live and love, call it Shrek, like the ogre
Hah, bitch, I have had enough, and I am sure I ain't mad enough
Forgettin' the rest while I'm gettin' success, and I look at the numbers, I add 'em up
This chart is like a parabola, thank you a lot for havin' us
And so, every day, I take one step up, man, I am takin' the ladder up
-Hundred K- get the plaque, lookin' forward, not heading back
Remember what I had said is that we ain't givin' up, remember that
Hit me up when you done whining, I'll hit you up when I'm done rhyming
Listen up, 'cause I'm combining all my skills into one finding
We run rhymes, you know we do, we got the shit that we're going through
These lyrics go over you, you don't listen, so you don't know it's true
'Cause we in, and we've done it, thousands, now we a hundred
Shoutout to Didac and Momo and the others
Shit, I consider them brothers, shit, I consider you all are my family
Shoutout to those who will stand with me, even when all of the others abandon me
Yeah, drama, we move past that, now I look at you with the last laugh
Better trackback, now I rap fast, so many skills in my backpack
Started off so terribly, now all of these people compare to me
In the past, I never anticipated what there would be
And seeya', so long now off to the end of the song now
See ya' next at five-hundred and a million, at's on now
It's on now
Oh shit, I'm almost out of water
This is a hard- this a- real challenge
This like, physically difficult, ayy
When I walk up in the scene, I hear a orchestra
Now everybody telling me I don't perform enough
My math teacher told me that I'd never be shit
And now, I'm searched more then the quadratic formula
Ayy, I got the formula, I got the formula
You got the sauce, but God damn, I got the formula, ayy
People always asking Ben, "Why you record so much?"
I got to fry up all these rappers quick, like, order up
Formula, like I'm Mr. Krabs
I change and transform it up, you stuck in the past
Yeah, I wear Supreme goggles to my science lab
Uh, it hurts to write this song, 'cause I don't like to brag
And now I've tied myself up, like a Nike Mag'
People love to criticize me for the life I've had
They make it 'bout white and black, like I'm Michael Jack'
I make these haters look confused, like it's Dora asking where Swipper at, ayy
Uh, bitch, I'm supreme, 'cause I got it on me, now they copy that, like a walkie-talkie
And I'm feelin' like they really want to stop me, tryna fold my paper, like it's origami
Wanna justify the hate, they call me cocky, and I am, 'cause your girl call me, 'Papi'
Tryna take ti-t-uh.. paparazzi, I'm a fax machine up in a lot of copies
Ayy, still saying, "Who woulda thought?", like, who would of guessed it, huh?
Haven't lifted weights in two years, but somehow, I'm always flexing
If you really want to find the answer to your question, here is where you should look:
Want the secret to the sauce, motherfucker? Better go and find a cookbook
Ayy, they doubt a fucker with a dream
Looking to the stars for some money and a scheme, yeah
Looking at the cars, all the hundreds and the greens
Serpent's told you, "No," and it's like nothing's as it seems
God damn, I guess I really thought he was the man
I guess I really thought he had some fans, but that shit is all a sham
All that cash he stocked was from a scam
All the views he got was from some spam
I've been living like, "Man, ain't why he been doin' what he can?
Why ain't he just sticking to the plan?
How has he been living with no limits, getting millions by the minutes?"
I don't get it, I don't really understand, I've been living like
"Damn, he ain't getting money by the 'Gram
I'll do better if I study my exams
Do I really wanna stand next to all these average fucking sad duds?"
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one
Yeah
Hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one
Ayy
Just because you gave up, doesn't mean I'm a backup
Uh, uh, uh
Feel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones
And so they hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he
'Cause he's been living this passion, I'ma just sit and imagine
I've got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap, and she really been digging my track, and I'm livin' for Snap
That shit invisible now, I'm unoriginal now
I'm making 'u'-minimum wage, this is literal AIDS, and I need to figure this out
How did I get to the stage? I wanna get up on stage, do this shit everyday
And I won't care 'bout whatever they say, let 'em all pester away
But I just can't shoot my shot, got a bad gun
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream 'cause he has one
By now, if you're still watching this shit
You are a boss and you deserves some applause for this shit
But we ain't over, we ain't done, though
Am I taking a break? Are you dumb, bro?
Well, we nearing 10K, but I still need 30K
While all you sit around, I would rather work than play
Lyrics go through your dome, through your vertebrae
Hit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates
That was actually a pretty good bar
I just wrote that like, right- a second ago before I recorded this
Ayy, ayy
You know, just to add some- fill stuff in, uh
Sometimes, I don't know what to think
Sometimes, I don't know what'll
Make it okay, make it okay
I'm snorin' all day for dreams, yeah, ayy
Uh, wake up pondering, damn, my mind is wandering
All these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen
All accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence
Often is the result of falling under consciousness
You'd make babies cry, I make crazy lives
You're just angry, 'cause you're livin' in a fading lie
And I've been feeling this energy, feeling that somebody's getting the penalty
Fearing that one day you'll end up ahead of me, feeling that this is the end of me
No, will I tell you? No, never
I think I'm so clever, but in the grand scheme of things, I know that I'm no better
But I don't ever
Want to go to show, just one mo' letter
I'm a- go-getter, I go get A's and get grades
And get As, then wake up, and get C's, but get paid
Uh... my life is so unusual
To most, it isn't suitable, to me, it's irrefutable
Can't see me in a cubicle, I'd rather watch my funeral
I'd rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero
Damn... but you know that I'm capable
You know I'ma pounce at any chance that is available
Feeling so unique and I think it's not explainable
No one hears my lyrics, and says, "OMG, relatable!"
No, that's not what I'm here to give
Been waiting- years for this, you're about to experience
Something that I've spent time, money and thought on
Learned about all the times money had thought wrong
Kinda funny, it's long gone, but time is crummy and not long
I ain't lucky, I'm not calm, not by a long-shot
Out on the inside, see me on the outside
Always think I'm positive, and never see the downsides
It's 'bout time you know the truth, you couldn't be further from it
Get your head out your own ass, you couldn't be further up it
Okay
Okay, okay
We're like thirty minutes in, thirty minutes, but we got thirty-thousand, bro
Fuck
Yeah, I'm the key to the equation, bitch, you better beware
I'm like the 'e' that equals all of the emcees squared
I'm just me, performing in front of empty chairs
But y'all see, so all of y'all better get prepared
I got so much opportunity, I gotta make the most of it
Shoes made of the banana peels, I feel like I'm supposed to slip
Man, in this life, we all climbing unstable ladders
It's not about who goes faster, but it's 'bout the man who'll hold his grip
Damn, I got a crazy ass work ethic
Blocked out south east and west, leave in one direction
I finished my album, and people saying they lovin' it
Fuck with it, but I took it down and redid it to perfection
We all students of rap, but we don't learn lessons
Like a Eskimo's jacket, all them be forgettin'
Wanted to fuck a nun, started like really badly
And I didn't even have to ask for me to get her blessing- that's a horrible bar
Can't stand me 'cause I crossed them up, their ankles hurtin'
Yeah, uh... yeah, yeah, I'm an amazing person
I base my motivation on my favorite angels words
About how I'ma make it, gettin' famous, man, that thing's for certain
You keep your standards low, man, I keep my standards high
Wanna' get on any action, like the Brazzers camera guy
Can't deny- I'm fucking insane, sometimes I fantasize
How it would be like to be normal, but I just randomize
And analyze my situations, leaving people paralyzed
And take a step out of bed, meanwhile I'm at my paradise
America is very nice, but I'd like to see the world
But I'd like to get out in to the open and meet my girl
In a Mercedes Benz with his lady friends
Crazy Ben is just chilling with them women, you know they be tense
They'd be tense or more, they'd be tense or more
I like to talk to all these people, 'cause they marvel at my metaphors
It's free speech, I can say what I want
But these listenin' are trying to make me pay for my talk
They don't like what I'm doing, they don't appreciate the banter
I get it, you're jealous, but listen, 'cause I'm the answer, uh
Motherfucker, I'ma live for the right time
Fuck that, I'ma live for the moment
Sitting here in the middle of the night time
My mind puzzled with the thoughts that be flowing
Damn, I've been living in a headache
Bitches never listening, they saying that they ready
But I can never believe them
Got these goals and they can never achieve 'em
How can your dreams come true if you ain't willing to dream 'em?
Damn, that's a lot of shit to think about
Suddenly, company starts to come to me, wondering
What I'm doing, next I realize, that shit, I gotta figure out
Made some beats, I gotta hit 'em out, heh
Got these dreams that I'm living out
In my mind's eye, giving out lots of songs with responses
That I never pictured, wow, damn, damn
This beat's way too holy to rap over
Mental block, my mind's capacities, that's lower
Your raps slower, they lack closure, they lack substance
Like a printer without toner, y'all filling pages that have nothing
Ooh, but I have got something to tell you
I ain't got some money or bullshit to sell you
Speaking from late nights, I'm thinking of Drake's life
Watching these interviews, thinking, one day, I might
Be on that stage right beside all these players
Shit's up to me, I won't hide it in prayers
I'll prove it in music I use to influence
I do this way harder than people assuming
Resuming my writing, viewing this lighting
That puts me to be in the view of the hiding
I do what they're liking, but that makes 'em hate me
No matter what I do, they just mistake the
Reason I'm flowing, the reason I start up
Not just for the fame, and the money, the star bucks
And- damn, I ain't talking about the coffee place
Most to these rappers only write this shit using copy/paste
I'd have made a lot of songs that go to waste, uh
I just need a home run, I already loaded base-s
I have got so many cases
Been visiting, living in so many places
Experiences that I made me to Emmy
Ben, B-E-N, please, I hope you let me
Be me, I ain't greedy or needy
Believe me, I just want to be on your TV
Get on my level, 'cause I need a new staircase
Damn, yeah, I've been looking at their face
And, one day, I'll be there
I know what I'm doing, I'm already prepared
I've been waiting like thirty-thousand years
Tryna make the world listen, so make sure that you can hear
I'm trying to take a passion out of turning my career
I'm concerned without my fear, but I earned it, and I'm here
Now I earned it, and I'm here to stay
I'm coming in, you're trying to clear the way, another chance, another fucking year to play
Not even seventeen, eighteen, I'm so near to fame
Not really, look at all the shit, I just hear this day
I don't know- I look at the future nostalgically
I'd cure every disease, and y'all still wouldn't be proud of me
Undoubtably know how to be what I am about to be
To say that money talks, and that shit seems so damn loud to me
Recently, I have been feeling alienated
My songs out of this world, people claim that aliens made 'em
But, baby, I'm crazy, don't hate me- don't hate me 'cause I'm different
Hate me because you hate me, then maybe we can live with it
That people say that this is the biggest thing to hop on the screen
All will scream, overreacting, like it's a drama scene
Y'all are mean, and since the best quality is honesty
Promise me that it's the reality, where's Keanu Reeves?
Trapped in a Matrix, it's how I felt sometimes back in the ages
When I would rap on a stages, and now I laugh at those days, and
I'm moving on, grooving while you lose the song
Move along, nothing to see here except some stupid pawns
Who could bomb those whole place up with one great lung?
One great tongue, I am that one great one on vacation
I vacate to a location
Far away from where people just may run
A light to go to where there is no one, no one, no fun
Oh, son, I'm tryna be me, and so young
I can murder this beat with no gun, go run
I've too many problems to handle, here, hold one
I just hop onto the rap boat, but that ship has now sunks
And now, punks can make loud junk, Uptown Funk
Was a great song, catchy at first
But that radio station playing it, and making it just get to the worst, my head's gonna burst
If I hear it again, and I'm sure
I'll throw my speakers on the ground, denting the earth
And now, I'm ending this verse, and I mean it
Now the ink of this pen just keeps on bleeding, yeah
Good rappers never get to see the light of day
But when you selling sex and a gimmick, they'll sign you right away
I'll obey.. nah, whatever, man, what is this?
I'm rapping so fast to the max, and I'm playing my tracks so that people will know I mean business
Nobody witness anything better than when I am showing you did this
Know I'm suspicious, because I'll be flowing and growing like, "Oh, this kid is big"
Know how I live it, go on a mission, y'all better listen
Till I'm ahead of this shit by all of the inches, 'eah
And when I'm, uh.. I'm telling y'all that I got a story
God ignores me, stop the glory, cop is for me in auditory
Not visually, typically, the original me
So unforgivable, so inexplicable, obvious the pinnacle digitally
Damn, that was fast, felt so gentle I unpacked
And I'm just tryna prove to you the things that I can move on the track
And I'm trying to get a record deal, never ever felt so real
Whenever we're the guests to feel, whenever f-this gets to feel
So different, and I'm loving, time to change, and discover it
Time to make a difference, and I'm living it, so I'm up for it
I always talk to that mother, kids, the mother kids couldn't understand me
One path, making a knot, ain't gonna stop for plan B
I wrote that one a long time ago
That was the first time that I looked- that I- I looked at those again
But you know, I still- I'm not that rusty, not that rusty
I- actually... classic!
We just living in the solar system
One big world here to hold the wisdom
One big jail to control the victims
We're all here tryna find a soul in rhythm
A voice in writing and a choice deciding
Whether or not to follow what the boys are likin'
What the girls are doing, what we gotta be exposed to
Think about who you are, and it's so true
Think about the people who you think have really known you
Do they really know you? Do you even know you?
Damn, that shit is like a Jaden Smith tweet
Sometimes you gotta think 'bout how crazy shit be
And lately it seems to make the extremes
So prominent and dominant in making big dreams
I'm seeing aliens scream
When I go to sleep, man, my brain needs fixing
But I'm just tryna make it in life
Fuck you to people who be saying it like
I ain't making it right? Take a vacation and hike
I'm- chilled out, bitches, getting famous despite the fact
That I'm young and little bit nerdy
And I know a lot of people would consider me early
I'm just a little kid working tryna configure my searches
Tryna deliver my purpose, and take a shit on my burdens
I'm just me, no, I ain't a victim or hurting
I just see all the people living and burning
So be free, time to be a little bit nervous
It don't matter if you're scared, 'cause this shit is disturbing
And I get it, I don't wanna ever forget it
Guessin' I'm headed towards the ending, and I know it is splendid
So I'll see ya'- round, underachievers
Hop on my wagon, 'cause we dragging late, we gotta be leaving, man
So basically, I do this for fun, they ain't making me
I'm tryna have a blast, 'cause we growing so fast, we be getting my career from A to Z
And, basically, I'm great you see, I made my life at the age of three
But- what am I meant to do when my own fanbase are hating me?
I've seen people misusing their fans, like crooks
Manipulating their audience to catch that hook
They'll believe anything that you'll tell them, look-
You can- feed them shit so you can sell your book, haha
But no shots fired, though
Nothing wrong with a little bit of lying though
I mean... look at Fox News
That's the whole premise of their entire show
But no political shit, I always do just enough, I'm a minimalist
Makin the most of my minimums, winnin' 'em, got a couple of synonyms to help you listen to original bits
I- got a lot of digital prints, man, your own homedog is a literal bitch
But I'm filling the syllables, it's a little predictable, 'cause I've written this shit for all of the cynical kids
I got time! Maybe a little too much of it
But you know that I'm tryna move up a bit
People look at me and say my potential has
Got a big max, and you know that I'm lovin' it
So fire- can't handle me with oven mitts
Underground, blessed if you discovered it
Flow is so unique, I got so much to do
Not like any other kid
Ayy, yo', what you say, though?
Yeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though'
Yeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low
You know I'm comin' to them checks like Usain Bolt
Wait so, inhale the fumes while I paint this picture:
Me, I'm sitting in my room and I'm anxious
Tryna make my moves while they huge and they famous
I knew this shit I couldn't do, I was jaded
Now, somehow, I'm next up, yeah, I'm blessed up
Now I wake up and I'm fly, I don't dress up
Now I'm fly and my opponents better catch up
I get my checks, uh, all y'all need to step up
I-I-I-I-I-I- remember trying to practice my cadence
In tracks I was makin', I had to be patient
Everybody said that shit was trash, and they were right
But I turn that shit and made it right, shit is day and night
Now I gotta take a flight to Vegas, might not stay the night
Everybody see me eattin', now they want to take a bite
So I'm like, "Okay... no way"
Yeah, when it comes to this shit, man, I don't play
I'm like Houdini in my Ghost, yeah, you can't see me, I'm gone
Ball so hard, I gotta wear my Yeezys to prom
YouTube bitches asking me to retweet they song
I'm the reason people got Spotify Premium on
Ayy, yo', what you say, though?
Yeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though'
Yeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low
You know I'm runnin' to them checks like Usain Bolt
So I'm like okay, not no way, when it comes to that shit, man, I don't play
If you ask me how I got it I  say, I got the drive, yeah, really get out of the roadway, uh
Damn
Some of these are
Too slow and also too fast
Whatever
I'm out of order, three hoes like I'm Santa Claus
Pull up on your bitch, Bape hoodie with a camouflage
Hey now, yo, what's the play now?
I'm tryna slide, I ain't talkin' 'bout a playground
Yeah, I remember all them days I would stay down
20K's chillin' in in my PayPal
So what the fuck you wanna say- you wanna say now? Nothing
Best in my town and that's no discussion
Humble beginnings, ain't humble, we winnin'
If I wanna bag, that's my humble decision
Everything I do is going off
So if I wanna freestyle, then you better know the cost, ayy
I think she blocked me
Damn
There's no more water, I'm literally about to die
I think she blocked me on the Instagram
I need to know, what did I do? I guess I missed your plan
Me, I'm just searchin' for that truest shit, where is it, man?
I'll never know, just wanted you to help me understand
I need some closure because, truthfully, I give a damn, I give a damn
Plenty of fish in the sea, but see, I ain't no fisherman
See, I'm a middleman, a businessman, and this means business, man
Diggin' in the sand, lookin for a reason, I'm not kiddin', man
How am I gonna let all of this get to me? Been a few months since you texted me
Shit, I'll just tell myself I'm a celebrity, ain't no way that this can get to me
And in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter, but right now, it's feeling like everything
The more I talk about it, it just gets sadder, 'member thinkin' about a wedding ring
But now I'm thinkin' 'bout so many things, what did I do to deserve it?
This shit the most petty of petty things, I'll stick with how nobody's perfect
Like all of my life, I'll forget about it and all of the things that I'd said about it
But why the fuck did I get blocked? I just cannot wrap my head around it
I just can't wrap my head around it
Now I'm just getting bored, I'm just fuckin' up all the flows
Just for the fun of it
If you're still watchin' this shit, uh, comment, uh...
Comment, "Arrowhead water", in the comments
And let me know what-what would you rate this out of ten
Give me a rating, that way know that you're real- that you're real one
You know what I'm saying? Alright, here we go
Spectacular speculations- havin' some reservations
Imaginin' all the statements- travellin' through these places
Back in, then buy some passionate trashin' of reputations
They actually don't have facts, and reality left them baseless
I wish that we left 'em nameless- 'sociate 'em with faces
Make judgments from expectations and watch as their heads are shaking
-People want me to crumble and turn to some medication
To fuck up my motivation and focus on education
But I'm petty, petty, pett,y petty, that's all they really ever tell me
So many times that you convince me of shit, that I swear you could've won an Emmy
I got a phone in my hand, like a note for the 'Gram, and I'm thinkin' about holdin' your hand, but you don't understand
I think that love is either gold or a scam, and you never really know till the end, like, how all this began
I've been comin' at this as a man, trying to figure out where I fit into the plan
How does all the drama surround me? I hear 'em followin' loudly, and I don't wanna hear about this shit again
I guess that's the way it goes when they stalk me and do anything to try and stop me
I did nothing wrong, but that's how it goes when a basic bitch try to block me, uh
Livin' life, but you stay the same how you expect
Yourself to go take the fan making name
But you don't take the pen you wanna be
Unique but not make it change like what
How you expect to go through this think
About the girls man why you wanna do is
So stupid and useless if you never lose
It with yourself a little for the
Movement when I write the St. the ode to
Joy' this the oldest success don't know
If there is a God but I know that I'm
Blessed and I'm hoping to know and I'm
Open to yes I'll do whatever I can to go
To the best that will go to the right
And go to the left no doubt imma show up
At night instead of going to bed when I
Know that I'm right I'm exploding my
Chest I keep on loading the time and it
Goes over my head I think no why do I
Even try these things I need shiny
Things like diamond rings and flying
Rings and preci bling that is what
Drives these strains I'm so I'm so
Lively and lazy at the same time saying
Something sane and crazy in the same
Rhyme never go to practice who don't
Faze me 'til it's game time
Learning his life will amaze me how I
Made my define a minute
When a wetland is favorite the mik
Children they get so pissed with me I'm
Either villain now they no kidding and
No I'm not quitting I know I'm just
Sitting sitting with a dream and maybe
Maybe just sit in this city where the
Dream could take me but I know it can't
I know it tastes look I'm angry why I
Just the B of the A-team at the
Feet of the mainstream man I dream for
This daydream and I believe that I'm
Making it cease for the taking it's me
In a train and I see that I'm breaking
My knees aren't place and I keep on
Thinking that I'm being amazing but I'm
Improving I know it's just a slow climb
Pushing myself yeah I'll be there in no
Time so I'm moving I'm moving till I get
There get where I just don't want to get
Left there
I don't remember I don't even
Know what that's from but that was
Written in there it's been a lot of late
Nights okay
I don't give a fuck about anything
Skinny white child on the track, but I’m threatening, they don’t wanna let ‘em in
They told me if I take it, I’ll feel better, like it’s medicine
But I ain’t settling, they tryna’ rush me, like adrenaline
And labels don't reply so I
Can't get it deal I mean is it footage
Did someone get me a Benadryl
I got a hell of skill man they worried
That I never will a success in skills
Men are done seven mill I think about
Food by the chair I'll be going over

Hypocrites women nobody buzzer okay that

But I live life with a positive attitude
That's why I've seen pissed, but I'm
Never getting mad at you that's the
Reason that people mirror my attributes
What I contribute to the world is some
Places shit nobody else's world did and
I'm just trying to spread some pieces
Love my man it's really hard 'cause you
Need some love I've been waiting, 'cause
This is defense time for me to be laying
Out of business and I'm breathing in the
Air but it all tastes
When all of this time is wasted really
Ain't wasted
This is trash, I don't know when I wrote this
I think I wrote this in like 2013, this is how far back I-
This is how far back we are, I'm not even gonna rap this
Let's do something else- oh, okay, let's do this
It's bumpin', this beat is just so disgustin'
You leavin' me in the lust of my meet-and-greet for my lovin'
I'm enchanted, damn, this beat is just full of somethin'
That's makin' me want to get up, and breath in all the percussion
Man, I'm dancing, dancing, man, I'm feelin' the rhythm
Droppin' my head, fancy snares, and when it hits 'em
It really gets in my bloodstream, life just makes sense to me
Bass and a good- groove is really a great recipe
Can't- mess with me, no one, I'm feeling too in the moment
Feelin' new when I go in, and feelin' blue when it's over
And I'm- noddin' yes, and then I am proddin' next
And I'm tryna' to mentally send God a text
Like, "Hey, what's up, God? I don't know if you're real
But, listen to how this bumps, you supposedly feel like a god
But, y-you get what I'm sayin'?"
And God damn, I just can't really express when I'm playing
Really, this is bumpin' to me
You ain't feelin' it, so then you just get up and you leave
But this is- something to me, so don't come runnin' to me
I said we comin' in this shit like we be fuckin' the dream, shit
No, never mind, probably not
But I constantly got- energy that's lost in my thoughts
And I'm not gonna stop, and yes, it's maybe costing a lot
But lookin' at the end result, man, we've accomplished a lot
And no, I'm not gonna regret a thing after this
I'm still trying to master this, 'cause now I'm known as that weird-ass rappin' kid
The fact of it is that it is really- just a giant hobby
Something for me to be original, not a lyin' copy
Trying to make some shit where you can really get your head nodding
Verses so fire that, when I'm done, you're left sobbing
But that won't happen, like I said, we just a work-in-progress
Some of my shit means shit and other words are nonsense
But now we easin' up, we got a beat that's bumpin'
See me stuntin' while I'm flowin', we adjusting, see me bluffin'
Everyday, man, see me bluffin', that is what I do
Listen to some good shit, tryna' make a substitute
I got so much stuff to do, and I am just a youngin' too
Who just hopped on the scene? Everybody wonders who
But all I know is- that we find a safety in rhythm
And that is the reason- that I am making a shipment
I said it's bumpin', yeah
Nearing- we're nearing an hour if you're still
Watching the shit I love you I actually
Like love you long time
Okay
I said, I'm married to the game, but I only just met her
Hopin' that my shit get better, but I'm just gonna'
Move with it, ride with it
It's my life, the only burden is the time limit
Fuck it, I'm livin', I said, "Fuck it, I'm livin'"
People are getting mad, just because, yeah, I'm winnin'
Just because, yeah, I'm winnin', they're stuck-up, and I get it
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it
I-I messed up the punchline, it's actually really good
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, ayy
Ayy, ayy, uh
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, eh
Yeah, time to move on, grindin' out all my new songs
My only motivation is people I need to prove wrong
Yeah
Said, my only motivation is- yeah
And, how am I meant to keep my workflow up?
If a girl shows up, all my world blows up
I'm just sittin' and waitin', instead of becomin' the greatest
Tryna' find a brand new motherfuckin' deal
All you bitches fake, all my numbers real
All my shit is punchin' in my stomach, like a meal
Am I married to the game if I can't afford a ring?
It's all very much the same if I can't afford to sing
Man, it's scary for a king, even-, I said, it's scary for a king, even
They call me odd, but I bring even
I bring reason to believe in it, even it up for free, and
The meaning is really scenin', no line can be wrong between em'
I don't show seasons, I am me, no matter what
And that can grow pleasin', I'm barely close to anybody
I don't know people, man, I don't know people who so equal
I don't know nobody who doesn't own evil
Man, that it just a truth and a lie
A truth and a lie, somethin' like the blue in the sky
Or a suit and a tie, I'm new to the life, I'm new in my mind
New to the time, man, I'm like the proof in disguise
And I'm- lookin' at all of this shit
Oh, you should know I'm not fallin' for this
You get discouraged for one minute
The next minute, you be callin' it quits
And I'll probably get rich If I focus enough
You close-minded, let's open it up
And all of these people assumin' 'bout what I be doin'
But they do not know what is up
And I just wish- that they would fucking go away
And I won't obey, no I will- never ever show the way
And I will try to mask it up with other jokes on fucking jokes
Always playin' G', but now I'm movin' onto other notes, yeah
My voice is fucking hurting
It's hurting, a lot, I'm not- I haven't had vocal training
So I don't know how to- d do this for a long period of time
Without causing damage to my vocal cords, but who gives a fuck?
Man, I just live it up
I'm gonna go a little bit quieter now
Uh-huh
Yeah
All of these people keep on changin'
All of these times and different phases
All of these lights, I know the stages
All of these sights is so amazing
Yeah, I've seen at least a million faces
A million times, a million places
But when it's all said and done
I look and I wonder why, uh
Everyone knows that it's so amazing, all the support is my motivation
Compared to the big people at the Capital, my name is spelt in lower cases
People loved me before I made it, people liked it before they watched it
I'm on a way too much more than I have, and I'm glad, because now, I will never stop it
Man on a mission, and I got a vision of talking a lot of wisdom, and I gotta listen
Gotta follow and be the leader, and tomorrow, I'll be the teacher when they need the feature
Got flow, and it's so damn crazy, people consider me so amazing
I'm holding control and then folding them verses, I'm hurt because I'm on loaded bases
Advancing, I know the basics, already know them, they're overrated than me
Meanwhile, I am not rated at all, so we hoping, because now I am open for game
I'm charged up, I ain't Drake, but I'm on the worst behavior
So many people they know the players, don't know the game and don't know the makers
Don't know the fakers, but who cares? I'm not here to cater, I'm here to improve and show that I'm greater
I'm here to go move and just go on the layers, and bitch, I am going so later
I got time, my own lyrics, I got mine
And I'm on time for the wrong lines, and I'm not crying, so let's start grinding, let's go
I've been living life all on my own
All on my own, people keep calling my phone
Wanting to know when I'll be the star of the show
But I'm all my own, I'm all on my own
And I don't want to talk about it, stop to doubt it
'Cause the world is awfully crowded, but-
The ghost of me is haunting the throne
So I'll make it there all on my own
My intermission is mixing with intermissions
And following intuition conflicting with my decision
And it is more than just business, 'cause this is for self-approval
And it is to make it look like I'm living for something useful
And it's sad, but you know it's true for most of you
Appearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue, the growing movement
Sue a new type of thing that you can gain from
To push away the past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago-
Oh, holy shit!
I actually reached the end of the beat
But I still have, like
Ten-thousand more words
Hold on, I gotta pause this
Hold on, three, it's still one-take!
-Past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago
Look at where we been, but imagine where one can go
Its not fun to know that we just livin' to die
We now know how much money you can give for a lie
Give for a look, but how much can you give for an eye?
What's the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry?
So, get your ass up, 'cause it's time to make it happen
Always been shitty at rappin', but I practice for the passion, man
Yeah, I've been living life all on my own, bitch
I ain't the star of the show, bitch
I know like four people who truly respect the grind
And it's usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme
And if time is money then free time ain't really free
And sometimes I get pissed 'cause my own lyrics ain't really me
They stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas tree
I want to be what's taunting me, but sorry, I'm a mini-me
In the face of my full potential, that is the biggest me
Bigger than you, bigger than anybody in history
The challenge is a challenge, the fact that you got to maximize
To satisfy a lavish life and have a crazy magic time
And luckily I'm so damn young, 'cause, man, I have the time
To learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind
I'm trying to master my craft, and the problem is that I've got
Several different things to potentially make my job
I want to make the MLS, and also have a mili' subs
And also get a mili' plays, and maybe make a mili' bucks
A million- shit, all we ever want is more, really
And once I get three million, I want four milli'
It's so silly, it's so tricky, this whole cycle
We can never be happy, but that is so vital
Uh
Those are actually some good lyrics
Uh
Rebirth, feet hit the earth
My knees hurt
They're weaker than
Previously, her breathing seems to be burnt like
Free CDs were before we
Could be searched
I'm like please, just please work
Like a lenient slave owner
That's edgy like gravestones
Oh, you get me
I saved dough for a Bentley
Two percent there already
I may go for a Chevy
'Cause who cares about flexin' if you ain't holding it heavy
Uh, I've been trying’ to prove to all of the people I knew
Who didn't like what I do
Disgusted like, "Ew"
Yeah, this shit goes outta you
Plans have now all become true
Seeing them through
Man, that's the reason I do
All of the things that I do
It's not for a crew
Not for a god or a demon
I've really been needing a clue
Filling these shoes
Reading these pieces and news
Damn this shit really is screwed
It gives me the blues
Whenever i'm shielding my eyes from the darkness and don't get a view, uh
But if ignorance is really bliss
Then why this ignorance be killin’ kids
And why's this ignorance is truly vicious it's not giving shit and ends up innocent
That shit really is ridiculous it's magnificently
Fucked up
But nobody wants to tough it up
I've even seen it goin down, it's comin’ up-
'Kay to the Vatican having
Them good times and bad times new Romans
Do that again when I was when I was so
Young too young to really know fun but
So but I guess that's what happens when
You grow up dry your eyes and wipe your
Nose up just keep drinking till you
Throw up tell me one judge but we all
Just want to be loved and somehow get
Validated by those we hate such a
Twisted system that we've been given to
Harmful a I've been really thinking and
Faker right now is not a fake wash away
The thoughts of me along the way are all
Has changed yeah and now we looking is
So far away and it's a far away just a
Civil war
Segment war you'll be the aiming to the
Piece of what we can afford
Yeah anymore what we even living for
Yeah baby murder little piece that is a
Civil war
You know you know they be
Looking at me right now like the source
System they a better pipe down
I've been reading my essays my web page
Yeah I caught our new construction site
Now with his praise man I think I gotta
Find out all these questions man I
Really wanna hide down oh I want to drop
Out maybe learn a lot about my strip
Before our way to see it die out damn I
Just want to go along I'm holding strong
I know I know I'm not the Botes one I'm
Old enough from throwing up bars so sick
It doing that they know it's up down
Minute now I really don't know done and
A babe race like I got drafted for
Freddie year-round hype over March
Madness wanna get to what his girls
Stripping down like his know they feel
Like we takin liberal all his classes
Ay be saying damn bad when the gods
Savage number on like
I am not average-
Hold on, I have to fix this fucking instrumental
This is so mental, hold on, I have to fix it real quick
I'm gonna fix it, take a pause
Uh, yeah, ayy
I'm addicted to the screen and the
Validations of people who are 13 in
Another nation I've been looking for
Seven sent a message or a comment on a
Video it seems to be wasted like
Internet track meets they II traced it
Look at this shit I just recently made
It that's how it goes when I'm beaten
And breathing achieving and keep on
Succeed in there Haiti y'all lousy they
Can't breathe all that smoke bro you
Doubt me but just see where I'll go so
Allow me to break free from my own dome
To get out there be me believe in my own
Zone things become intense of the heat
Of the ozone is surrounding me I need to
Go home so can I pretty please just be
All alone nobody to retweet to leave on
My home phone I ain't gonna I'm gonna
Hop in a drug shit when they all come
And they love it ain't gonna happen
Allow sure when I know I ain't about it
Yeah they're gonna take us away now they
Got something to say now you can order
This shit on a take-out
All of these this
Is a fake now
Okay so all my clothes is Japanese, I wear it casually
And I'm a killer on the mic, might cause a couple casualties
And all I'm needin' is a beat to make your fuckin' salary
Man, I said, "Fuck the peanut gallery, I got a fuckin' allergy"
Trappin' down my PayPal, make it Friends and Family
Now I'm so hot, I need some oven mitts, ain't safe to handle me
Now I made my checks from Spotify, they pay me handsomely
I got the mic up to my brain to help maintain my sanity, okay
Everybody 'round me they been wasting my time, ayy
Pull up to the functions, see they face when I rhyme, ayy
Everyone's a critic on my case all the time
Do it by myself, I don't need a way to get signed
Bitch, I'm clouted up, yeah, I'm clouted up, ayy
Get my numbers up, gotta add 'em up, ayy
Until I get it, I ain't never packin' up, no
And they all comin' for my blood like Dracula, ayy
Okay, I'm backin' this, not maskin' shit, now everybody wanna go packin' shit
I don't give a fuck, you know I'm abstinent, I'ma fuck the whole game up on accident
Wait a minute, shit, I'm too passionate, said I save it for my , no cappin' it
Remember when they used to all laugh at this, and they hit me up like, "What the fuck's happenin'?"
Yeah, I had to sacrifice a lot of sleep
Because a lot of people want a lot from me
 Yeah, standing in the way of who I wanna be
Now random strangers recognize me when I cross the street
So many memories, do you remember these
Moments way back in the time?
Trapped in the back of my mind
I am so happy to grind, I am so happy to find
So much experience now that I'm passing the lines
Now that I'm grasping the signs
I have been laughing a lot, got nothing to hide
No, I've got nothing to hide
Bitch, I am stuck, left behind
I need a drive, yeah, I need something to ride
Fill my own bank account, shit that I'm making now
Put it all off to the side
Feeling the vibe, got this new sorrowful happiness
That I just can't seem to guide
Feeling alive, yes, I am breathing the air
And I'm feeling so careless, but I can't
Let go
Every morning I wake up, I'm wanting to drop out
But I can't stop now
You know I put too much work into this shit just to pop out
So I walk down five different paths every day
Just need the one, it's only begun
No, I'm not going away
No, I'm not going to say
That this shit is going badly at all
I'm glad that I fall
I love the ref, but I ain't mad at the call
I'm mad at the call
Yeah, I'm having it all, I'm traveling far
I'm practicing hard
Never going back to the start, never going back to the start
You should know that I'm putting my work on the table
No, I am so able, I'm lining these cables
I got the horsepower, but tied to the stables, get by with no label
I do the mixing and mastering
Writing and rapping and making it happen
I'm eating my cake, and I'm having it
Real emotion, I'm tapping in, passionate
And I am working my hardest
It's already started, yes, I am being an artist
I'm feeling the largest
I'm feeling the largest
Oh!
Is that the final beat change up?
Alright, we were on that last beat for like an hour
For lit- literally an hour... um..
But you know what? Gotta hop on this classic beat, ayy
Uh
Yeah
Had to change it for all you that have been watching till
Till the end, you know?
You didn't think that beat was ever gonna change, but it did, though
Uh
Yeah
Ayy
Recently, I've been feeling my lyrics missing meaning
I'm trying to whitewash how much they stink like I'm Listerine-ing
Damn, I'm feeling like I've missed the key
And so I guess that DJ Khaled is always skipping me
But, yeah, you know I'm trying to do what I can
But these ignorant idiots just can't understand
Yeah, you know I'm trying to do what I can
But these ignorant idiots just can't understand
I got new crews and the new friends, got new views in a new lens
I'm the new dude, I'm the new Ben, got my YouTube with the new trends
But the way I'm growing is so unorthodox
How could I be connecting them if I have yet to sort the dots?
Sort of lost and very found at the same time
I pour the cost, now I'm very loud in a daytime
And very quiet at night- seem to shine when I write
And I'm longing to be a five-year-old, chilling, flying a kite
And I admire the sight of somebody else working more than me
I've been staying grounded, but the sky is moving towards my feet
And fortunately, I'm on course, living morally
Grinding to get what's rightfully mine, I'm headed right for my dream
Damn, I guess that's all I need to know for now
They put me in the driver's seat, no way I'm slowing down
They know me now but don't know my sound, it is so profound
Give m- two years and I'll make it, let me show you how
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I gotta stop all of this bragging shit
So many haters, S.M.H. is the acronym
I'm trying to get a couple "OMG"'s
Or a, "WTF, he is so sexy"
I got no Bentley, beat is so deadly
Walked up to the rap club, no entry
And I feel a little like I won't get seen
'Cause I'm so white, won't fight, don't get me
'Cause I'm coming at this music with a different set of ideas
Trying to bring my own crib like it's Ikea
Here's a pro-tip: take no tips
From people who aren't pros yet, bitches always so stressed
Damn, 'cause they trying to find that great escape
Nation of dreamers who all just trying to stay awake
Every day, I be waking up to my 808s
Day-to-day hustle, I'm just trying to pave a way
People with the problems always give the most advice
Like, why don't you search your own life? Don't come close to mine
I'm mostly fine, so please leave me alone to whine
And next time that you're talking shit, please bring me an open mind
'Cause people locking they own ideas in straitjackets
I'm David Blaine's magic- helping you break past it
I'm trying to raise havoc, not trying to stay savage
Trying to make balance while finding a great passion
Climbing to get up this- witnessin' injustice
By who people in love with or based off of skin colors-
Shit is so disgusting- seeing it in public
I'm trying to make sense of it here in the discussions-
Close my eyes and go to sleep, waiting until they notice me
Wait until my creations are making everything so complete
My thoughts are scattered- find lots of patterns
I try not to let it get my plots in ashes
I don't ever think I've- some money, some- little talent
These rappers shows look like lip-sync battles with Jimmy Fallon
What really happened? I'm jealous of people selling platinum
Worst year of my life? That's like saying the worst Kendrick album
Is way better than average, I'm already established
Unforgettable classic, y'all shit is set to go plastic
They want to see me disappear like incredible magic
Your regrettable attitude is upsetting my passion
I'm getting listens and places, fuck all the simpler days
I just took a moo- mon- break- I got Spotify paying me minimum wage
I'm like that's good enough, man, I've been eating, ain't full enough, I just want to make it pulling up
I've been putting up with all of these amateurs, sure enough, I'ma show 'em how it should be done
I got green and I want beef like a omnivore
I got that exclusive flow that can't be bought at stores-
All this new shit, they still be wanting more
They say that my duty is not fair like some modern war
I'm stacking rolls, just like the Michelin Man
Eating sushi every night, but I don't live in Japan
Damn, I'm trying to get as many hits as I can
And like a lazy ass beaver, I ain't giving a damn
Whoa, this shit is corny, you're really gonna ignore me?
You really gon' let it slide when these Benjamins do adore me?
And as we rise, man, it ain't about fame and fortune
We got a greater importance, that's why I wake in the morning
I'm tryna play a performance- make a change with a chorus
I came from a tiny platform, but now my stage is enormous
Flawless, do anything to stay out of office
'Cause I'm cautious, not gonna sell my soul for the profits
Yeah, I got many dreams, lot of passions
I'mma get there by any means, just imagine
Just know that anything can happen
Take chances, put everything in rapping
I don't even really need to go fast
Flow back, not wandering like a nomad
So glad, yeah, they all melt like a snowman
Back-to-back flames got Drake saying, "Oh, man"
Not again, got a lot of friends who want to end
All my shit, unsubscribe, like I'm On Demand
I've been living in a moment, got a lot of fans
Pedophile, back at it again with the white vans
Can't lie, man, I got a lot of white fans
Could I get a ultralight beam, maybe by chance?
Every day I've been switching up on my stance
Scare everyone away whenever I dance
People in the comments saying that I can't rap
Okay? 'Cause I didn't understand that
Fuck you, man, I think it's time to stand back
You'll be sitting, getting in the way like a sandbag
If you want to talk trash, say it to my face
I'll be singing, "La-la", I got two L.A.-
I be laughing, "Haha" at the human race
Hey, I'm in the lead, not far from a newer place
Uh- getting sick and sicker
The flow on the track getting quicker and quicker
Shiver me timbers, I'm winning these bigger
Killer victor, not swiping left like it's Tinder
They filter my picture, put it in bad light-
Uh, me playing these rappers is a bad fight
Ayy, me spitting these bars, that's a mad sight
Haters be changing their opinions, is that right?
Ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm winnin’- I'm winnin’- I’m spitting’ a million words per the minute
I’m in it to win it, I’m in it to win it, I'm fixin to hit it
This shit is my mission, not up to opinions
You know that I’m grinnin’, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
But I don't want to be a ribbon in the sky
Living in disguise, man, I see the venom in the middle of they eyes
Figure if you living or you die
'Cause it's time for you to finish your reply
I've been dealing with these guys
Know that I am blacking out that so I
Guess I'm automatically back when you
Died of a bad guy and better than like
Hi for these actors I've dated like a
Battery pack that a blackberry add on a
Stack of his tab revving as the bath of
A tag to send him a shout back to Iraq

Train of thought right back on the track
Oh these drivers out of breath
That guy's like a motherfucking asthma
Attack yeah mass, mass, mass Megan flames
