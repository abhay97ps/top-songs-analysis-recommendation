I read your letter, made me feel better
How did you know that I was singing the blues?
I felt your sunshine, made me feel so fine
How did you know that I was thinking of you?
In blue California, lights are bright
They'll make you learn to fight for fame and fortune
Promises are made and promises are broken
Dreams are falling through, I should have stayed by you
I've had some hard times, your words are so kind
It's good to hear somebody telling the truth
I felt your sunshine, made me feel so doggone fine
How did you know that I was dreaming of you?
In blue LA, nights can be so cold
It makes a lonely soul get tired of freedom
Promises are made and promises are broken
Dreams are falling through, I love you, I still love you
Woah, oh, how did you know that I was singing the blues?
How did you know that I was thinking of?
Thinking of you, thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
