I can't stop loving you, I've made up my mind
To live in memory of the lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you, yeah, it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours that we once knew
So long ago still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time stood still, so still, since we've been apart
I can't stop loving you, I've already made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
Those happy hours that we once knew
So long ago still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time stood still, oh so still, since we've been apart
I can't stop loving you, yeah, it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday, yeah
