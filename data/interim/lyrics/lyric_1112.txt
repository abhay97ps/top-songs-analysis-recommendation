Poor Fool
Ike & Tina Turner
I want to tell all of you that ain't doin' nothin' for me
And can't do nothing for me
You should tend to your business and leave mine alone
Because as far as this man is concerned
I wanna tell ya he's mine 
Now let me tell ya he's mine 
Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh  yeh eh yeh yeh
Yeh yeh yeh yeh he's mine  I'm not ashamed (poor
Fool) cause he's my man  and he's mine (you've been a fool too
Long)
Now listen, this man is mine he's my every thought
I'd give him prussia if it could be bought
I'm not ashamed of nothing I do
I'd guide a missile if he told me to
'cause he's mine 
I know he's mine 
The man is mine 
And listen, if I make my bed hard
That's where I'm gonna sleep
You people talking means nothing to me
I work my fingers right down to the bone
Doin' the things to please him right or wrong
'cause he's mine  I know he's mine  the man is mine
Ohh he's a mine  and let me tell ya he's mine
 yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh (we know
How you feel) yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh he mine  I'm
Not ashamed  'cause he's my man  and he's mine
And listen, I'm with my man in every way
Don't keep him hoppin' each and every day
I'll never hurt him or make him frown
I'm with my man if he's up or down
'cause he's mine  I know he's mine  the man is mine
And ohhhhhhhh he's a mine 
Now let me tell you he's mine 
Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh /fade/yeh yeh yeh yeh
He's mine
