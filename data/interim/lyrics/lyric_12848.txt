I've seen your kind before
I've seen you creepin around
Before you come round my door
Oh there's one thing you, gotta know
She's mine all mine
Don't show your face here no more
She's mine all mine
Don't hang around here no more
I heard her call out your name
Late last night in her sleep
That's why I came here to say
No, it won't be easy to steal her away
She's mine all mine
Don't show your face here no more
She's mine all mine
Don't hang around here no more...
Go!
You've got her under your spell
And she's believin your lies
You'd like her at your hotel
No, not as long as I'm alive
She's mine all mine
Don't show your face here no more
She's mine all mine
Don't hang around here no more, more, more, more
Oh she's mine
Don't show your face here no more
No no no no!
Don't hang around
Don't hang
Don't hang around no more
