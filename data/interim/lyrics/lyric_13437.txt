Secret
I've got a secret and I can't explain
All the time I've waited for this day
All along I was never in doubt
I've always knew it would never get out
There are things that I cannot tell
And there are things that you know damn well
This is getting very hard for me
I guess you'd better just wait and see
This is all
This is all
Secret
You heard a message and the message was clear
All the time you wipe away that tear
All I want is to hold your hand
To see the sun and walk the sand
You make me sad and you make me glad
And now you see all my secret is is love, is love, is love
My secret is this love
Everyday you're always there
You comfort me and make me feel it's worth my while
And then I look around and you're not there
And every day you say you care and I'll beware
Secret
This is all
This is all
I got a secret and I can't explain 
Secret
All I want is to hold your hand 
All along I was never in doubt 
Secret
To see the sun and to walk the sand 
Secret
I got a secret and I can't explain
