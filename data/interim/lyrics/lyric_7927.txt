Lord, I miss you
I just can't get it
Through my weary head
You're really gone
I just can't believe it
But all of a sudden
I've got too much pain
For one man alone
The nights drag by
And it gets harder all the time
To go to sleep without
Your soft skin touching mine
And I woke up on your side
Of the bed again this morning
With my old alarm clock
Ringing half past eight
With that old familiar hunger
And my arms wrapped
Round your shadow
I woke up on your side of the bed
Another funky morning
Sunday's dead and Monday's
Dripping down my window pane
I wake up shaking
Staring at the walls and
Listening to the lonesome
Sound of falling rain
I just can't make myself
Believe that you don't care
I keep on dreaming
I'll wake up and you'll be there
And I woke up on your side
Of the bed again this morning
With my old alarm clock
And I woke up on your side
Of the bed again this morning
With my old alarm clock
Lord, I woke up on your side
Of the bed again this morning
With my old alarm clock
Ringing half past eight...
