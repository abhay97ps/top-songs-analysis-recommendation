Oh, yes, he's the darling
And I'm so glad that he'll be mine
Yesterday he said he wants me
To share a love so fine 
When he smiled for me only
And his kisses are so divine
From now on I won't be lonely
'Cause we're sharing
A love so fine 
All the girls are jealous of him
That's not really hard to see
They would never try to love him
His love belongs to me
All the girls are jealous of him
That's not really hard to see
They would never try to love him
His love belongs to me
Our love will last forever
And forever's a long, long time
And I know, no one will ever, ever break up
A love so fine 
Oh, yeah 
Yeah, yeah 
Oh, yeah
