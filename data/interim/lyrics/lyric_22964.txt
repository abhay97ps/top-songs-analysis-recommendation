I'm breaking down, gonna start from scratch
Shake it off like an etch-a-sketch
My lips are saying good-bye
My eyes are finally dry
I'm not the way that I used to be
I took the record off repeat
It killed me, but I survived
And now I'm coming alive
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh-oh
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh, yeah
I broke the glass that surrounded me 
I ain't the way you remember me 
I was such a good girl
So fragile but no more
I jumped the fence to the other side, 
My whole world was electrified 
Now I'm now longer afraid
It's Independence Day
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh-oh
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
Miss movin' on
Everything is changing
And I never want to go back
To the way it was 
I'm finding out who I am and who I am
From here on out is gonna be enough 
Is gonna be enough...
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh-oh
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh 
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh 
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh 
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh 
Yeah, I'm movin' on
