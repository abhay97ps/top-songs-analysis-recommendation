Got to say hello
It's a lucky day
Kiss the moon goodbye
And be on our way
It's a lucky day 'cause I found you
Gonna build a new world around you
Touch the sun and run
It's a lucky day 
Hello life, goodbye Columbus 
I've got a feelin' that you're gonna hear from us 
You're gonna know that we've taken the world by surprise
Got that look in our eyes
It's a lucky day, just for changin'
Leavin' the old world behind
Lucky day, for walkin' a new road
Just to clear your mind
It's a day for startin' a new way
Tellin' the old one goodbye
Lucky day  for gettin' above it 
Spread your wings and fly 
Hello life, goodbye Columbus 
I've got a feelin' that you're gonna hear from us 
You're gonna know that we've taken the world by surprise
Got that look in our eyes
It's a lucky day, goodbye Columbus 
I've got a feelin' that you're gonna hear from us 
You're gonna know that we've taken the world by surprise
Got that look in our eyes
It's a lucky day 
Yeah
 Goodbye, goodbye Columbus
 Goodbye, goodbye Columbus
 Goodbye, goodbye Columbus
 Goodbye, goodbye Columbus
 Goodbye, goodbye Columbus
 Goodbye, goodbye Columbus
 Goodbye, goodbye Columbus
