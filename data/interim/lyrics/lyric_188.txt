In a cavern down by a canyon
Excavatin' for a mine
There lived a miner from North Carolina
And his daughter, chubby Clementine
Now every mornin', just about dawnin'
A'when the sun begins to shine
You know she would rouse up, wake all a dem cows up
And walk 'em down to her Daddy's mine
A'took the foot bridge, way 'cross the water
Though she weighed two-ninety nine
The old bridge trembled and disassembled
 dumped her into the foamy brine
Hey, crackle like thunder,  she went under
 blowin bubbles  down the line
Hey, I'm no swimm'a but were she slimm'a
I might'a saved that Clementine
 broke the record, way under water
I thought that she was doin' fine
I wasn't nervous ya until the service
That they held for Clementine
Hey you sailor  way out in your whaler
With a harpoon, your trusty line
If she shows now, yell, "there she blows now"
It just may be chunky Clementine
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin'
Oh my darlin' , oh my darlin' sweet Clementine
You may be gone
But!
You're not forgotten
Fare thee well
So long, Clementine
 Bye!
