Irresistible you, my heart has gone to you
And while I resist, I'll be irresistibly drawn to you
I know from the first it was so
I was caught in the undertow from the moment we kissed
Irresistible you, you're in the heart of me
And your magic eyes seem to magnetize every part of me
I'm yours my heart and I insist, for we don't want to resist
Irresistible you
