Something's wrong with me can't get you out of my mind
I see your face in everything I do
It feels like I've known you for a long, long time
I only wanna make it with you
Something in your eyes just won't let me forget you
Something in your face that keeps me hanging around you
Something got a hold of me the day that I met you
Something's wrong with me
Something's wrong with me
Yesterday I saw you on the street with someone
I said it doesn't matter to me
Behind the smile I'm wearing are the tears of a clown
Because loving you is where I wanna be
Something in your eyes just won't let me forget you
Something in your face that keeps me hanging around you
Something got a hold of me the day that I met you
Something's wrong with me
Something's wrong with me
There's something wrong with me
Girl there's something wrong with me
There's something wrong with me
Something in your eyes just won't let me forget you
Something in your face that keeps me hanging around you
Something got a hold of me the day that I met you
Something's wrong with me
Something's wrong
Something in your eyes just won't let me forget
Something in your face that keeps me hanging around you
