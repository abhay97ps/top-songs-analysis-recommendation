I want a normal life, just like a newborn child
I am a lover-hater, I am an instigator
You are an oversight, don't try to compromise
I learn to love to hate it; I am not integrated
Just call my name, you'll be okay
Your scream is burning through my veins
Sooner or later, you're gonna hate it
Go ahead and throw your life away
Driving me under, leaving me out there
Go ahead and throw your life away
You're like an infantile, I knew it all the while
You sit and try to play me, just like you see on TV
I am an oversight, just like a parasite
Why am I so pathetic? I know you won't forget
Just call my name, you'll be okay
Your scream is burning through my veins
Sooner or later, you're gonna hate it
Go ahead and throw my life away
Driving me under, leaving me out there
Go ahead and throw my life away
Sooner or later, you're gonna hate it
Go ahead and throw our life away
Driving me under, leaving me out there
Go ahead and throw our life away
Throw our life away
Throw our life away
