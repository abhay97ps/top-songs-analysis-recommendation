Sunshine peeking through my window
Making teardrops shine like diamonds
It's been a night of madness
Still I see a day of sadness
You see since I don't have you
There's no one for me to turn to girl
If you ever think of leaving
That guy I know you're pleasing
Come on back girl
Yes I'm pleading
Come on back
It's you I'm needing
Making love to one girl new
Can't ease the pain of losing you
She may have a groovy face
But looks could never take your place
You see since I don't have you
There's no one for me to turn to girl
If you ever think of leaving
That guy I know you're pleasing
Come on back girl
Yes I'm pleading
Come on back
It's you I'm needing
If you ever think of leaving
That guy I know you're pleasing
Come on back girl
Yes I'm pleading
Come on back
It's you I'm needing
