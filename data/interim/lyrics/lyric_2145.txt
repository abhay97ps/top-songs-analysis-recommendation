Everybody!
Everybody!
Everybody's had the blues
Everybody!
Everybody!
Everybody's blue when they're lonesome!

Everybody!
Everybody's had the blues

You lose somebody you love
But that's no reason for you to break down and cry!
I said a-hey, everybody!
Everybody!
Everybody's had a lonely moment!
Everybody!
Everybody!
Everybody's had the blues
One time or other, everybody, listen to me
You lose somebody you love
But that's no reason for you to break down and cry!
I said a-hey, everybody!
Everbody!
Everybody's had a lonely moment!
Everybody!
Everybody!
Everybody's had the blues
I said a-hey, everybody!
Everybody!
Everybody's blue when they're lonesome!
Everybody!
