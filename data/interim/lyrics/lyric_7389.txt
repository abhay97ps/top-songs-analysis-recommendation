Fish were made to swim in the ocean
And boats were made to sail on the sea, yeah
As sure as there are stars above me
I know, you were made for me
A grape was made to grow on a vine
An apple was made to grow on a tree, yeah
As sure as there are stars above me
I know, you were made for me
We’ll have our quarrels
And you’ll upset me
But what-what can I do?
You’ve been mine
Since the first minute I met you
 And I’ll never
Never, never leave you
Oh, yes, they were
Oh, yeah 
As sure as there are stars above me
I know, you were made for me
Oh, yes, they were
Oh, yeah 
As sure as there are stars above me
I know, you were made for me
Oh, yes, they were
Oh, yeah
Like a fish in the ocean
Like a boar on the sea, baby
Oh, baby, I know, you were made for me
Oh, baby, I know, you were made for me
Oh, baby, I know, you were made for me
Yeah
I know, you were made for me
