Back off, boogaloo
I said, back off, boogaloo
I said, back off, boogaloo
Back off, boogaloo
Whatcha think you're gonna do?
I gotta flash right from the start
Wake up, meat head
Don't pretend that you are dead
Get yourself up off the cart
Get yourself together now
And give me somethin' tasty
Everything you try to do
You know it sure sounds wasted
Back off, boogaloo
I said, back off, boogaloo
You think you're a groove
Standin' there in your wallpaper shoes
And your socks that match your eyes
Back off, boogaloo
I said, back off, boogaloo
Come on, back off, boogaloo
Get yourself together now
And give me somethin' tasty
Everything you try to do
You know it sure sounds wasted
Back off, boogaloo
Whatcha think I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna flash right from the start
Back off, boogaloo
I said, back off, boogaloo
Come on, back off, boogaloo
Back off, boogaloo
I said, back off, boogaloo
Come on, back off, boogaloo
Back off, boogaloo
I said, back off, boogaloo
Come on, back off, boogaloo
Back off, boogaloo
I said, back off, boogaloo
Come on, back off, boogaloo
Back off, boogaloo
I said, back off, boogaloo
Come on, back off, boogaloo
Back off, boogaloo
I said, back off, boogaloo
Come on, back off, boogaloo
Back off, boogaloo
I said, back off, boogaloo
Come on, back off, boogaloo
