Oh, go
Girl, it's been awhile
You've lost your pretty smile, what happened?
Oh, was it something that they said
That's playing with your head, what happened? Oh
When you're standing in the spotlight, woman
Some people try and take a shot
Well, it's only jealousy, only jealousy, oh, they can't see our love
But one thing you can be sure of
You know that I'm a believer in you and me
You know that I'm a believer, oh it's true
And no matter what you do, girl I'll believe in you
I believe
Oh, it's never what you hear
It's only what you feel that matters, uh huh
Left your brother stand alone
You kept climbing social ladders, oh no
When it comes down to basics
And we're lookin' at it one on one
It don't matter what they say, matter what they say
About us now, ah, can't hurt us now
But one thing you can be sure of
You know that I'm a believer in you, oh and me
You know that I'm a believer, oh it's true
And no matter what you do, girl, I'll believe
The only way to win, child
Is never play the game at all
I'll be there to catch you even if you should ever fall
But one thing you can be sure of
You know that I'm a believer in you, in me
You know that I'm a believer, girl it's true
And no matter what you do
You know I'm a believer in you, in love
You know that I'm a believer, oh it's true
And no matter what you do, girl, I'll believe in you
Oh in me, oh in love
You know that I'm a believer, oh it's true
And no matter what you do, girl, I'll believe
