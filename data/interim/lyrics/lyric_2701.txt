What's that sound?
Everybody round
There can be no beat
Makes me wanna move
My feet
It's in my bones
Anytime my music carries on
I feels like rhythm
If you like to dance
This is your chance
I can't keep still
With bongos playing
And everybody feels that way
It's in my bones
Anytime the music carries on
Oh, I feel like rhythm
You can beat the drums
Lord, if you wanna
Let the bongos play
And I dance all night
Let the music flow
Oh, I never wanna go
Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
It's in my bones
Anytime my music carries on
Lord, I feel like rhythm
You can beat the drum
Lord, if you wanna
Let the bongos play
And I dance all night
Let the music flow
Oh, I never wanna go
Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
It's in my bones
Anytime the music carries on
Lord, I feel like rhythm
If you like to dance
This is your chance
I can't keep still
Oh, I'm like the
Rolling wheel
