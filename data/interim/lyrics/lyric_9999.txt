I saw her today
I saw her face
It was a face I loved
And I knew, I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray
That they'd go away
But still they begin
Needles and pins
Because of all my pride
The tears I gotta hide
Oh, thought I was smart
I'd won a heart
Didn't think I do
But now you see
She's worse to him than me
Let her go ahead
And take his love instead
And one day she will see
Just how to say "please"
And get down on her knees
That's how they begin
She'll feel those needles and pins
Hurtin' her, hurtin' her
Why can't I stop and tell myself
I'm wrong, I'm wrong, so wrong
Why can't I stand up
And tell myself I'm strong
Because I saw her today
I saw her face
It was a face I loved
And I knew, I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray
That they'd go away
And still they begin, ah
Needles and pins, are
Because of all my pride
The tears I gotta hide, oh
Needles and pins
Needles and pins, ah
Needles and pins
Needles and pins, ah
Needles and pins
Needles and pins, ah
Needles and pins
Needles and pins, ah
Needles and pins
