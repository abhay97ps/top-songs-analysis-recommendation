Stop!
Baby, can't you see that I can't take it no more?
Stop!
If you keep it up, I'm gonna go through the floor
That's what's gon' happen, baby
Never knew how good a love could be
Now it's gonna make a fool of me
Everything is hazy
One more kiss and you'll drive me crazy
Baby, stop
Hold it up a minute, 'cause I've gotta catch my breath
You know what you do to me, baby
Stop!
Every time you squeeze, you scare my heart half to death
That's what you do to me, baby
But I was captain of my ship
Higher lovin' made me lose my grip
Everything is hazy
One more kiss and you'll drive me crazy
Baby, stop, stop it right now, baby
I think you're tryin' to take advantage of poor old me
That's what I think, baby
Stop!
When you touch my hand, I'm helpless as I can be
That's how I feel, baby
Tell me, baby, what are you made of?
What you do to me must be made of love
Everything is hazy
One more kiss and you'll drive me crazy
Stop it, baby
Sure want you to stop it, baby
Stop it, baby
Stop it right now, baby
Can't you see that I can't take it no more?
Stop, would you
Stop it, baby
Beggin' you, baby
I'm down on my knees
Stop it, baby
Stop it, baby
Stop it right now, baby
