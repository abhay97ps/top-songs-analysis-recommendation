All that work and what did it get me?
Why did I do it?
Scrapbooks full of me in the background
Give 'em love and what does it get you?
What does it get you?
One quick look as each of 'em leaves you
All your life and what does it get you?
Thanks a lot and out with the garbage
They take bows and you're battin' zero
I had a dream
I dreamed it for you, Dad
It wasn't for me, Dad
And if it wasn't for me, then where would you be
Miss Rachel Berry?
Well, someone tell me, when is it my turn?
Don't I get a dream for myself?
Starting now, it's gonna be my turn
Gangway, world, get off of my runway!
Starting now, I bat a thousand
This time, boys, I'm taking the bows and
Everything's coming up Kurt!
Everything's coming up Hummel!
Everything's coming up Kurt!
This time for me
Hahahahahahaha!
For me!
For me!
For me!
For me!
For me!
For me..!
Yeah!
