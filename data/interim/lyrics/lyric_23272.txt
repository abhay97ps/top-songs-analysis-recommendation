There ain't nothing like them first loves baby
Remember them high school days
Friday nights, homecomin' dances
Giving my old letterman's jacket away
To old what's her name
But now it's you and me talking on the phone till 4 AM
About anything and everything
Making me feel young again like ain't a damn thing changed
Ain't a damn thing changed
Makes me want to sneak down your driveway
To climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll until the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that backseat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get the butterflies like we used to
Got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again
I thought them feelings was long gone baby
But you take me back in time
Just like spring break in Panama City
The girl from Indiana sure was pretty
But she sure ain't got nothing on you tonight
Because you're like the summer loving don't come or go
Never had to say goodbye
I wake up in the morning feeling like the first kiss
Every time your lips touch mine
Makes me want to sneak down your driveway
To climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll until the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that backseat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get the butterflies like we used to
Got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again
Looking back I wish I could put you inside every memory
You can be my first love
My first kiss
My first and last everything
Makes me want to sneak down your driveway
To climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll until the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that backseat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get the butterflies like we used to
Got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again
Yeah just like we're 17 again
17 Again
Oh
