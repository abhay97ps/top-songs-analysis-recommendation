Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
If you cry, I think my heart would break
That would be much more than I could take
And if I saw a tear fall from your eye
Darling, don't you know that I would die
True love
True love
True love
True love
Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
If you cry, I don't know what I'll do
Baby, 'cause I'm so in love with you
And if I knew that I had caused you pain
My tears would fall like the rain
True love
True love
True love
True love
Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
