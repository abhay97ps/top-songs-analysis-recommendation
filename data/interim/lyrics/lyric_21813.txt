The future is bulletproof!
The aftermath is secondary
It's time to do it now and do it loud
Killjoys, make some noise!
Na, na na, na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na, na na, na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na, na na, na, na na
Na, na na na, na na
Na, na na na na
Drugs, gimme drugs
Gimme drugs, I don't need it
But I'll sell what you got
Take the cash and I'll keep it
Eight legs to the wall
Hit the gas, 
And we crawl, and we crawl, and we crawl
You be my detonator
Love, gimme love
Gimme love, I don't need it
But I'll take what I want from your heart
And I'll keep it in a bag, 
Put an "X" on the floor
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more
Shut up and sing it with me
 From mall security
 To every enemy
 We're on your property
Standing in V formation
 Let's blow an artery
 Eat plastic surgery
 Keep your apology
Give us more detonation
More, gimme more, gimme more!
"Oh let me tell you 'bout the sad man"
Shut up and let me see your jazz hands
Remember when you were a mad man
Thought you was Batman
And hit the party with a gas can?
Kiss me, you animal!
 You run the company
 Fuck like a Kennedy
 I think we'd rather be
Burning your information
 Let's blow an artery
 Eat plastic surgery
 Keep your apology
Give us more detonation
And right here, right now
All the way in Battery City
The little children raise their open filthy palms
Like tiny daggers up to heaven
And all the juvie halls
And the Ritalin rats
Ask angels made from neon and fucking garbage
Scream out, "What will save us?"
And the sky opened up
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die
Wanna try, wanna try, wanna try
Wanna try, wanna try now
I'll be your detonator
 Make no apology
 It's death or victory
 On my authority
Crash and burn, young and loaded
 Drop like a bullet shell
 Dress like a sleeper cell
 I'd rather go to Hell
Than be in purgatory
Cut my hair, gag and bore me
Pull this pin, let this world explode
