Kicking it with the woman I really wanna call my wife
Never before have I felt that vibe
Walking by the lake, sober, but never have I felt so high
Time stands still, when our hands fill one another's
I can't feel my face, she makes an amped up man chill
Temperatures boiling like the pot is burning
Cruising the city while the pot is burning
We're from two different worlds, so there's constant learning
It’s constant yearning, wondering what you're doing
Every second that the clock is turning
By the chill sound of the water current
I gotta come clean like I'm laundry detergent, see they don't want you to flourish
Between the first and last syllables of her first name
First second, I heard it, my heart had to burst flames
Her lips kissing mine, submerged for days
Never flirt with flame, or you get burnt with pain
I bet I leave her wetter yet, we'll never need umbrellas
Paddle and get up-stream, travel the seven seas together
You're my water, I need you when we're out partying harder
Let me be your man, that land surrounding your body of water
They say, "life's a beach" pal, let's go
So far away
Can we escape to a new place
Live in a dream where there’s no pain
A million miles away, away, away
We can erase every worry
Every doubt will be blurry
A million miles away, away, away
Another eve to walk around the lake with her
Heaven-invading hills and drown in this place with her
We did this all day, until the fog came
Then we split and parlayed, stayed up talking till the next day
No thrill to sex dames without a deep connection
Peep the reflection of the full-moon, stay up all-night, repeat the session
A beauty too deep to consume, by a peek in a room
You gotta go deep in the blue sea to catch even a clue
Jaded and fiery eyes, making it dire to try
We get close to "fried", apply water or I'm gonna die
Face of an angel who could make a priest forced to sin
Smile like pearls with porcelain skin
She shines so bright when my orbit's dim
My friends think your friends are tens, so bring more for them and pour some gin
For me, I'll pour wine in your glass
And try to relax while the flow started from slow then switch timing to fast
There are other worlds beyond this physical plane
This is a place we grow, you know, a spiritual thang
And if you're hearing some thangs, you know you're hearing your brain
Saying let's jet, maybe I'm hearing the same
So far away
Can we escape to a new place
Live in a dream where there’s no pain
A million miles away, away
We can erase every worry
Every doubt will be blurry
A million miles away, away, away
I fantasize away
Right next to you I’ll
I wanna sail away
So far, so far, away
It's time to escape
I wanna take you on a Ferris wheel then a carousel
Somewhere in a parallel universe, you and I  sit there and chill
And we're a pair that's ill, and you ain't gotta worry about any other man at all You're standing tall like a pair of heels
Fun on a sunny weekend, another stroll through Zurich park
Thinking about how far we are compared to there back where we'd start
So hold me at slides, no holding back mine
No wonder we always end up by da water, Pisces’ our zodiac sign
The longing growing longer as we continue to resist
Palming, holding on her, the kiss is the best thing on the menu's list
But resistance only holds out for so long
No doubt-just hold on, we'll go out and show off
I'll take her breathe and make the wind
I'm "the man" like Adam, this "eve", no plate for ribs
On second thought, I’ll take the ribs, make a wish
Make the chic, erase her with a wish, let's take the risk
Reservations, two plates, we ate for one
Take her warmth, remake, when done, create the sun
She's my soulmate, that's wild
Her Colgate bright smile, want to be with her, that's wild
Can we escape to a new place
Live in a dream where there’s no pain
A million miles away, away, away
We can erase every worry
Every doubt will be blurry
A million miles away, away, away
What's real or fake
I can't see it
This dream I'm in
I'm so deep in
I still long for those days
When everything was okay
It's a long a lucid pain
I gotta get away
