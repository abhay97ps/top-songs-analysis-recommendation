Hello, my love
I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near
Too
All through the morning rain
I gave
The sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls
Run through my mind
In the garden
I see
West purples shower bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins
Dressed in green
Pretty music I hear
So happy and loud
Blue flowers echo
From a cherry cloud
Feel sunshine
Sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
If you try to ask, "is it cool?"
"Is it cool?"
If you arrive and don't see me
I'm gonna be with my baby
I am free flying
In her arms over the sea
Stained window
Yellow candy screen
See speakers of kite
With velvet roses
Digging freedom flight
A present from you
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays I sit in for a few
A present from you
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays I sit in for a few
