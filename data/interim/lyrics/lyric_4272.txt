I'd never seen this side of you before
'Til now
Never knew that you could feel this way
'Til now
After all the time we spent together
Just doesn't seem fair
At all
No fair at all
Never seen the moonlight in your hair
'Til now
Never heard the sweet things you could say
'Til now
After all the time we spent together
Just doesn't seem fair 
At all
No fair at all
After all the time we spent together
Just doesn't seem fair 
At all
 No fair at all
 No fair at all
No, no, no
 No fair at all
No, no, no
 No fair at all
 No fair at all
 No fair at all
