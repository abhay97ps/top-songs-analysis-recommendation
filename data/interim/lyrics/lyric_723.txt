MUSIC ACCOMPANIED.  HESPERUS SINGS.
Queen and huntress, chaste and fair,
Now the sun is laid to sleep,
Seated in thy silver chair,
State in wonted manner keep:
Hesperus entreats thy light,
Goddess, excellently bright.
Earth, let not thy envious shade
Dare itself to interpose;
Cynthia's shining orb was made
Heav'n to clear, when day did close:
Bless us then with wished sight,
Goddess excellently bright.
Lay thy bow of pearl apart,
And thy crystal shining quiver;
Give unto the flying hart
Space to breathe, how short soever:
Thou, that mak'st a day of night,
Goddess excellently bright.
Cyn.
When hath Diana, like an envious wretch,
That glitters only to his soothed self,
Denying to the world the precious use
Of hoarded wealth, withheld her friendly aid?
Monthly we spend our still-repaired shine,
And not forbid our virgin-waxen torch
To burn and blaze, while nutriment doth last:
That once consumed, out of Jove's treasury
A new we take, and stick it in our sphere,
To give the mutinous kind of wanting men
Their look'd-for light.  Yet what is their desert?
Bounty is wrong'd, interpreted as due;
Mortals can challenge not a ray, by right,
Yet do expect the whole of Cynthia's light.
But if that deities withdrew their gifts
For human follies, what could men deserve
But death and darkness?  It behoves the high,
For their own sakes, to do things worthily.
Are.
Most true, most sacred goddess; for the heavens
Receive no good of all the good they do:
Nor Jove, nor you, nor other heavenly Powers,
Are fed with fumes, which do from incense rise,
Or sacrifices reeking in their gore;
Yet, for the care which you of mortals have,
You well are pleased with odours redolent:
But ignorant is all the race of men,
Which still complains, not knowing why, or when.
Cyn.
Else, noble Arete, they would not blame,
And tax, or for unjust, or for as proud,
Thy Cynthia, in the things which are indeed
The greatest glories in our starry crown;
Such is our chastity, which safely scorns,
Not love, for who more fervently doth love
Immortal honour, and divine renown?
But giddy Cupid, Venus' frantic son.
Yet, Arete, if by this veiled light
We but discover'd 
Any the least of imputations stand
Ready to sprinkle our unspotted fame
With note of lightness, from these revels near:
Not, for the empire of the universe,
Should night, or court, this whatsoever shine,
Or grace of ours, unhappily enjoy.
Place and occasion are two privy thieves;
And from poor innocent ladies often steal
The best of things, an honourable name;
To stay with follies, or where faults may be,
Infers a crime, although the party free.
Are.
How Cynthianly, that is, how worthily
And like herself, the matchless Cynthia speaks!
Infinite jealousies, infinite regards,
Do watch about the true virginity:
But Phoebe lives from all, not only fault,
But as from thought, so from suspicion free.
Thy presence broad-seals our delights for pure;
What's done in Cynthia's sight, is done secure.
Cyn.
That then so answer'd, dearest Arete,
What th' argument, or of what sort our sports
Are like to be this night, I not demand.
Nothing which duty, and desire to please,
Bears written in the forehead, comes amiss.
But unto whose invention must we owe
The complement of this night's furniture?
Are.
Excellent goddess, to a man's, whose worth,
Without hyperbole, I thus may praise;
One at least studious of deserving well,
And, to speak truth, indeed deserving well.
Potential merit stands for actual,
Where only opportunity doth want,
Not will, nor power; both which in him abound,
One whom the Muses and Minerva love;
For whom should they, than Crites, more esteem,
Whom Phoebus, though not Fortune, holdeth dear?
And, which convinceth excellence in him,
A principal admirer of yourself:
Even through the ungentle injuries of Fate,
And difficulties, which do virtue choke,
Thus much of him appears.  What other things
Of farther note do lie unborn in him,
Them I do leave for cherishment to shew,
And for a goddess graciously to judge.
Cyn.
We have already judged him, Arete,
Nor are we ignorant how noble minds
Suffer too much through those indignities
Which times and vicious persons cast on them.
Ourself have ever vowed to esteem
As virtue for itself, so fortune, base;
Who's first in worth, the same be first in place.
Nor farther notice, Arete, we crave
Then thine approval's sovereign warranty:
Let 't be thy care to make us known to him;
Cynthia shall brighten what the world made dim.
THE FIRST MASQUE.
ENTER CUPID, DISGUISED AS ANTEROS, FOLLOWED BY STORGE, AGLAIA, EUPHANTASTE, AND APHELEIA.
Cup.
Clear pearl of heaven, and, not to be farther ambitious in
titles, Cynthia! the fame of this illustrious night, among others,
hath also drawn these four fair virgins from the palace of their
queen Perfection, (a word which makes no sufficient difference
betwixt her's and thine,) to visit thy imperial court: for she,
their sovereign, not finding where to dwell among men, before her
return to heaven, advised them wholly to consecrate themselves to
thy celestial service, as in whose clear spirit (the proper element
and sphere of virtue) they should behold not her alone, their
ever-honoured mistress, but themselves  to live enthronised.  Herself would have commended them unto thy favour more particularly, but that she knows no commendation is more available with thee, than that of proper virtue.  Nevertheless she willed them to present this crystal mound, a note of monarchy, and symbol of perfection, to thy more worthy deity; which, as here by me they most humbly do, so amongst the rarities thereof, that is the chief, to shew whatsoever the world hath excellent, howsoever remote and various.  But your irradiate judgment will soon discover the secrets of this little crystal world.  Themselves, to appear more plainly, because they know nothing more odious then false pretexts, have chosen to express their several qualities thus in several colours.
The first, in citron colour, is natural affection, which, given us
to procure our good, is sometime called Storge; and as every one is
nearest to himself, so this handmaid of reason, allowable
Self-love, as it is without harm, so are none without it: her
place in the court of Perfection was to quicken minds in the
pursuit of honour.  Her device is a perpendicular level, upon a
cube or square; the word, "se suo modulo"; alluding to that true
measure of one's self, which as every one ought to make, so is it
most conspicuous in thy divine example.
The second, in green is Aglaia, delectable and pleasant
conversation, whose property it is to move a kindly delight, and
sometime not without laughter: her office to entertain assemblies,
and keep societies together with fair familiarity.  Her device,
within a ring of clouds, a heart with shine about it; the word,
'curarum nubila pello': an allegory of Cynthia's light, which no
less clears the sky then her fair mirth the heart.
The third, in the discoloured mantle spangled all over, is
Euphantaste, a well-conceited Wittiness, and employed in honouring the court with the riches of her pure invention.  Her device, upon a Petasus, or Mercurial hat, a crescent; The word; "sic laus ingenii"; inferring that the praise and glory of wit doth ever
increase, as doth thy growing moon.
The fourth, in white, is Apheleia, a nymph as pure and simple as the soul, or as an abrase table, and is therefore called Simplicity;
without folds, without plaits, without colour, without counterfeit;
and  plainness itself.  Her device is no device.
The word under her silver shield, "omnis abest fucus"; alluding to
thy spotless self, who art as far from impurity as from mortality.
Myself, celestial goddess, more fit for the court of Cynthia than
the arbours of Cytherea, am called Anteros, or Love's enemy; the
more welcome therefore to thy court, and the fitter to conduct this
quaternion, who, as they are thy professed votaries, and for that
cause adversaries to Love, yet thee, perpetual virgin, they both
love, and vow to love eternally.
RE-ENTER ARETE, WITH CRITES.
Cyn.
Not without wonder, nor without delight
Mine eyes have view'd, in contemplation's depth,
This work of wit, divine and excellent:
What shape, what substance, or what unknown power,
In virgin's habit, crown'd with laurel leaves,
And olive-branches woven in between,
On sea-girt rocks, like to a goddess shines!
O front!  O face!  O all celestial, sure,
And more than mortal!  Arete, behold
Another Cynthia, and another queen,
Whose glory, like a lasting plenilune,
Seems ignorant of what it is to wane.
Nor under heaven an object could be found
More fit to please.  Let Crites make approach.
Bounty forbids to pall our thanks with stay,
Or to defer our favour, after view:
The time of grace is, when the cause is new.
Are.
Lo, here the man, celestial Delia,
Who 
Contains as much as man in fulness may.
Lo, here the man; who not of usual earth,
But of that nobler and more precious mould
Which Phoebus' self doth temper, is composed;
And who, though all were wanting to reward,
Yet to himself he would not wanting be:
Thy favours gain is his ambition's most,
And labour's best; who 
Stands fixed silent in thy glorious sight.
Cyn.
With no less pleasure than we have beheld
This precious crystal work of rarest wit,
Our eye doth read thee, now instiled, our Crites;
Whom learning, virtue, and our favour last,
Exempteth from the gloomy multitude.
With common eye the Supreme should not see:
Henceforth be ours, the more thyself to be.
Cri.
Heaven's purest light, whose orb may be eclipsed,
But not thy praise; divinest Cynthia!
How much too narrow for so high a grace,
Thine  the most unworthy Crites
Doth find himself! for ever shine thy fame;
Thine honours ever, as thy beauties do.
In me they must, my dark world's chiefest lights,
By whose propitious beams my powers are raised
To hope some part of those most lofty points,
Which blessed Arete hath pleased to name,
As marks, to which my endeavour's steps should bend:
Mine, as begun at thee, in thee must end.
THE SECOND MASQUE.
ENTER MERCURY AS A PAGE, INTRODUCING EUCOSMOS, EUPATHES, EUTOLMOS, AND EUCOLOS.
Mer.
Sister of Phoebus, to whose bright orb we owe, that we not
complain of his absence; these four brethren (for they are
brethren, and sons of Eutaxia, a lady known, and highly beloved of
your resplendent deity) not able to be absent, when Cynthia held a
solemnity, officiously insinuate themselves into thy presence: for,
as there are four cardinal virtues, upon which the whole frame of
the court doth move, so are these the four cardinal properties,
without which the body of compliment moveth not.  With these four
silver javelins,  they support in
princes' courts the state of the presence, as by office they are
obliged: which, though here they may seem superfluous, yet, for
honour's sake, they thus presume to visit thee, having also been
employed in the palace of queen Perfection.  And though to them
that would make themselves gracious to a goddess, sacrifices were fitter than presents, or impresses, yet they both hope thy favour,  and  use several symbols, containing the
titles of thy imperial dignity.
First, the hithermost, in the changeable blue and green robe, is
the commendably-fashioned gallant Eucosmos; whose courtly habit is the grace of the presence, and delight of the surveying eye; whom ladies understand by the names of Neat and Elegant.  His symbol is, "divae virgini," in which he would express thy deity's
principal glory, which hath ever been virginity.
The second, in the rich accoutrement, and robe of purple, empaled
with gold, is Eupathes; who entertains his mind with an harmless,
but not incurious variety; all the objects of his senses are
sumptuous, himself a gallant, that, without excess, can make use
of superfluity, go richly in embroideries, jewels, and what not,
without vanity, and fare delicately without gluttony; and
therefore  is universally thought to be of fine
humour.  His symbol is, "divae optimae"; an attribute to express
thy goodness, in which thou so resemblest Jove thy father.
The third, in the blush-coloured suit, is Eutolmos, as duly
respecting others, as never neglecting himself; commonly known by the title of good Audacity; to courts and courtly assemblies a
guest most acceptable.  His symbol is, "divae viragini"; to
express thy hardy courage in chase of savage beasts, which harbour in woods and wildernesses.
The fourth, in watchet tinsel, is the kind and truly benefique
Eucolos, who imparteth not without respect, but yet without
difficulty, and hath the happiness to make every kindness seem
double, by the timely and freely bestowing thereof.  He is the
chief of them, who by the vulgar are said to be of good nature.
His symbol is, "divae maximae"; an adjunct to signify thy
greatness, which in heaven, earth, and hell, is formidable.
MUSIC.  A DANCE BY THE TWO MASQUES JOINED, DURING WHICH CUPID AND MERCURY RETIRE TO THE SIDE OF THE STAGE.
Cup.
Is not that Amorphus, the traveller?
Mer.
As though it were not! do you not see how his legs are in
travail with a measure?
Cup.
Hedon, thy master is next.
Mer.
What, will Cupid turn nomenclator, and cry them?
Cup.
No, faith, but I have a comedy toward, that would not be lost
for a kingdom.
Mer.
In good time, for Cupid will prove the comedy.
Cup.
Mercury, I am studying how to match them.
Mer.
How to mismatch them were harder.
Cup.
They are the nymphs must do it; I shall sport myself with
their passions above measure.
Mer.
Those nymphs would be tamed a little indeed, but I fear thou
has not arrows for the purpose.
Cup.
O yes, here be of all sorts, flights, rovers, and
butt-shafts.  But I can wound with a brandish, and never draw bow
for the matter.
Mer.
I cannot but believe it, my invisible archer, and yet
methinks you are tedious.
Cup.
It behoves me to be somewhat circumspect, Mercury; for if
Cynthia hear the twang of my bow, she'll go near to whip me with
the string; therefore, to prevent that, I thus discharge a brandish
upon—it makes no matter which of the couples.  Phantaste and
Amorphus, at you.  
Mer.
Will the shaking of a shaft strike them into such a fever of
affection?
Cup.
As well as the wink of an eye: but, I pray thee, hinder me
not with thy prattle.
Mer.
Jove forbid I hinder thee; Marry, all that I fear is
Cynthia's presence, which, with the cold of her chastity, casteth
such an antiperistasis about the place, that no heat of thine will
tarry with the patient.
Cup.
It will tarry the rather, for the antiperistasis will keep it
in.
Mer.
I long to see the experiment.
Cup.
Why, their marrow boils already, or they are all turn'd
eunuchs.
Mer.
Nay, an't be so, I'll give over speaking, and be a spectator
only.
Amo.
Cynthia, by my bright soul, is a right exquisite and
spendidious lady; yet Amorphus, I think, hath seen more fashions, I
am sure more countries; but whether I have or not, what need we
gaze on Cynthia, that have ourself to admire?
Pha.
O, excellent Cynthia! yet if Phantaste sat where she does,
and had such attire on her head,  I say
no more—but goddesses are goddesses, and Phantaste is as she is!
I would the revels were done once, I might go to my school of glass
again, and learn to do myself right after all this ruffling.
Mer.
How now Cupid? here's a wonderful change with your brandish!
do you not hear how they dote?
Cup.
What prodigy is this? no word of love, no mention, no
motion!
Mer.
Not a word my little ignis fatue, not a word.
Cup.
Are my darts enchanted? is their vigour gone? is their
virtue—
Mer.
What!  Cupid turned jealous of himself? ha, ha, ha!
Cup.
Laughs Mercury?
Mer.
Is Cupid angry?
Cup.
Hath he not cause, when his purpose is so deluded?
Mer.
A rare comedy, it shall be entitled Cupid's?
Cup.
Do not scorn us Hermes.
Mer.
Choler and Cupid are two fiery things; I scorn them not.
But I see that come to pass which I presaged in the beginning.
Cup.
You cannot tell: perhaps the physic will not work so soon
upon some as upon others.  It may be the rest are not so resty.
Mer.
"Ex ungue"; you know the old adage; as these so are the
remainder.
Cup.
I'll try: this is the same shaft with which I wounded
Argurion.
Mer.
Ay, but let me save you a labour, Cupid: there were certain
bottles of water fetch'd, and drunk off since that time, by these
gallants.
Cup.
Jove strike me into the earth! the Fountain of Self-love!
Mer.
Nay faint not Cupid.
Cup.
I remember'd it not.
Mer.
Faith, it was ominous to take the name of Anteros upon you;
you know not what charm or enchantment lies in the word: you saw,
I durst not venture upon any device in our presentment, but was
content to be no other then a simple page.  Your arrows'
properties,  Cupid, are suited, it should seem,
to the nature of him you personate.
Cup.
Indignity not to be borne!
Mer.
Nay rather, an attempt to have been forborne.
Cup.
How might I revenge myself on this insulting Mercury?
there's Crites, his minion, he has not tasted of this water?
  It shall be so.  Is Crites
turn'd dotard on himself too?
Mer.
That follows not, because the venom of your shafts cannot
pierce him, Cupid.
Cup.
As though there were one antidote for these, and another
for him?
Mer.
As though there were not; or, as if one effect might not
arise of diverse causes?  What say you to Cynthia, Arete,
Phronesis, Time, and others there?
Cup.
They are divine.
Mer.
And Crites aspires to be so.
Cup.
But that shall not serve him.
Mer.
'Tis like to do it, at this time.  But Cupid is grown too
covetous, that will not spare one of a multitude.
Cup.
One is more than a multitude.
Mer.
Arete's favour makes any one shot-proof against thee, Cupid.
I pray thee, light honey-bee, remember thou art not now in Adonis'
garden, but in Cynthia's presence, where thorns lie in garrison
about the roses.  Soft, Cynthia speaks.
Cyn.
Ladies and gallants of our court, to end,
And give a timely period to our sports,
Let us conclude them, with declining night;
Our empire is but of the darker half.
And if you judge it any recompence
For your faire pains, t' have earn'd Diana's thanks,
Diana grants them, and bestows their crown
To gratify your acceptable zeal.
For you are they, that not, as some have done,
Do censure us, as too severe and sour,
But as, more rightly, gracious to the good;
Although we not deny, unto the proud,
Or the profane, perhaps indeed austere:
For so Actaeon, by presuming far,
Did, to our grief, incur a fatal doom;
And so, swoln Niobe, comparing more
Than he presumed, was trophaeed into stone.
But are we therefore judged too extreme?
Seems it no crime to enter sacred bowers,
And hallowed places, with impure aspect,
Most lewdly to pollute?  Seems it no crime
To brave a deity?  Let mortals learn
To make religion of offending heaven.
And not at all to censure powers divine.
To men this argument should stand for firm,
A goddess did it, therefore it was good:
We are not cruel, nor delight in blood.—
But what have serious repetitions
To do with revels, and the sports of court?
We not intend to sour your late delights
With harsh expostulation.  Let it suffice
That we take notice, and can take revenge
Of these calumnious and lewd blasphemies.
For we are no less Cynthia than we were,
Nor is our power, but as ourself, the same:
Though we have now put on no tire of shine,
But mortal eyes undazzled may endure.
Years are beneath the spheres, and time makes weak
Things under heaven, not powers which govern heaven.
And though ourself be in ourself secure,
Yet let not mortals challenge to themselves
Immunity from thence.  Lo, this is all:
Honour hath store of spleen, but wanteth gall.
Once more we cast the slumber of our thanks
On your ta'en toil, which here let take an end:
And that we not mistake your several worths,
Nor you our favour, from yourselves remove
What makes you not yourselves, those clouds of masque
Particular pains particular thanks do ask.
How! let me view you.  Ha! are we contemn'd?
Is there so little awe of our disdain,
That any 
Should mix themselves with others of the court,
And, without forehead, boldly press so far,
As farther none?  How apt is lenity
To be abused! severity to be loath'd!
And yet, how much more doth the seeming face
Of neighbour virtues, and their borrow'd names,
Add of lewd boldness to loose vanities!
Who would have thought that Philautia durst
Or have usurped noble Storge's name,
Or with that theft have ventured on our eyes?
Who would have thought, that all of them should hope
So much of our connivence, as to come
To grace themselves with titles not their own?
Instead of med'cines, have we maladies?
And such imposthumes as Phantaste is
Grow in our palace?  We must lance these sores,
Or all will putrify.  Nor are these all,
For we suspect a farther fraud than this:
Take off our veil, that shadows many depart,
And shapes appear, beloved Arete—So,
Another face of things presents itself,
Than did of late.  What! feather'd Cupid masqued,
And masked like Anteros?  And stay! more strange!
Dear Mercury, our brother, like a page,
To countenance the ambush of the boy!
Nor endeth our discovery as yet:
Gelaia, like a nymph, that, but erewhile,
In male attire, did serve Anaides?—
Cupid came hither to find sport and game,
Who heretofore hath been too conversant
Among our train, but never felt revenge:
And Mercury bare Cupid company.
Cupid, we must confess, this time of mirth,
Proclaim'd by us, gave opportunity
To thy attempts, although no privilege:
Tempt us no farther; we cannot endure
Thy presence longer; vanish hence, away!
You Mercury, we must entreat to stay,
And hear what we determine of the rest;
For in this plot we well perceive your hand.
But, (for we mean not a censorian task,
And yet to lance these ulcers grown so ripe,)
Dear Arete, and Crites, to you two
We give the charge; impose what pains you please:
Th' incurable cut off, the rest reform,
Remembering ever what we first decreed,
Since revels were proclaim'd, let now none bleed.
Are.
How well Diana can distinguish times,
And sort her censures, keeping to herself
The doom of gods, leaving the rest to us!
Come, cite them, Crites, first, and then proceed.
Cri.
First, Philautia, for she was the first,
Then light Gelaia in Aglaia's name,
Thirdly, Phantaste, and Moria next,
Main Follies all, and of the female crew:
Amorphus, or Eucosmos' counterfeit,
Voluptuous Hedon ta'en for Eupathes,
Brazen Anaides, and Asotus last,
With his two pages, Morus, and Prosaites;
And thou, the traveller's evil, Cos, approach,
Impostors all, and male deformities—
Are.
Nay, forward, for I delegate my power.
And will that at thy mercy they do stand,
Whom they so oft, so plainly scorn'd before.
'Tis virtue which they want, and wanting it,
Honour no garment to their backs can fit.
Then, Crites, practise thy discretion.
Cri.
Adored Cynthia, and bright Arete,
Another might seem fitter for this task,
Than Crites far, but that you judge not so:
For I (not to appear vindicative,
Or mindful of contempts, which I contemn'd,
As done of impotence) must be remiss:
Who, as I was the author, in some sort,
To work their knowledge into Cynthia's sight,
So should be much severer to revenge
The indignity hence issuing to her name:
But there's not one of these who are unpain'd,
Or by themselves unpunished; for vice
Is like a fury to the vicious mind,
And turns delight itself to punishment.
But we must forward, to define their doom.
You are offenders, that must be confess'd;
Do you confess it?
All.
We do.
Cri.
And that you merit sharp correction?
All.
Yes.
Cri.
Then we (reserving unto Delia's grace
Her farther pleasure, and to Arete
What Delia granteth) thus do sentence you:
That from this place (for penance known of all,
Since you have drunk so deeply of Self-love)
You, two and two, singing a Palinode,
March to your several homes by Niobe's stone,
And offer up two tears a-piece thereon,
That it may change the name, as you must change,
And of a stone be called Weeping-cross:
Because it standeth cross of Cynthia's way,
One of whose names is sacred Trivia.
And after penance thus perform'd you pass
In like set order, not as Midas did,
To wash his gold off into Tagus' stream;
But to the Well of knowledge, Helicon;
Where, purged of your present maladies,
Which are not few, nor slender, you become
Such as you fain would seem, and then return,
Offering your service to great Cynthia.
This is your sentence, if the goddess please
To ratify it with her high consent;
The scope of wise mirth unto fruit is bent.
Cyn.
We do approve thy censure belov'd Crites;
Which Mercury, thy true propitious friend,
Will undertake to see exactly done.
And for this service of discovery,
Perform'd by thee, in honour of our name,
We vow to guerdon it with such due grace
As shall become our bounty, and thy place.
Princes that would their people should do well,
Must at themselves begin, as at the head;
For men, by their example, pattern out
Their imitations, and regard of laws:
A virtuous court, a world to virtue draws.

                                  THE EPILOGUE.
Gentles, be't known to you, since I went in
I am turn'd rhymer, and do thus begin.
The author (jealous how your sense doth take
His travails) hath enjoined me to make
Some short and ceremonious epilogue;
But if I yet know what, I am a rogue:
He ties me to such laws as quite distract
My thoughts, and would a year of time exact.
I neither must be faint, remiss, nor sorry,
Sour, serious, confident, nor peremptory:
But betwixt these.  Let's see; to lay the blame
Upon the children's action, that were lame.
To crave your favour, with a begging knee,
Were to distrust the writer's faculty.
To promise better at the next we bring,
Prorogues disgrace, commends not any thing.
Stiffly to stand on this, and proudly approve
The play, might tax the maker of Self-love.
I'll only speak what I have heard him say,
"By—'tis good, and if you like't, you may."
"Ecce rubet quidam, pallet, stupet, oscitat, odit
Hoc volo: nunc nobis carmina nostra placent."
