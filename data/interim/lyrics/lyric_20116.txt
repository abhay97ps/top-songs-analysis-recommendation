Aww yeah, that's right
All you single people out there
This is for you
Yeah
I'm not waiting around for a man to save me
Don't depend on a guy to validate me 
I don't need to be anyone's baby
No, I don't need another half to make me whole
Make your move if you want
Doesn't mean I will or won't
I'm free to make my mind up
You either got it or you don't
This is my current single status
My declaration of independence
There's no way I'm trading places
Right now a star's in the ascendant
I'm single 
That's how I wanna be
I'm single 
That's how I wanna be 
Yeah, uh-huh, that's right 
Don't need to be on somebody's arm to look good
I'm not saying I don't wanna fall in love, 'cause I would
I'm not gonna get hooked up just 'cause you say I should
I'm gonna wait, so I'm sorry if you misunderstood
Ohh, yeah
This is my current single status
My declaration of independence
There's no way I'm trading places
Right now a star's in the ascendant
I'm single 
That's how I wanna be
I'm single 
That's how I wanna be 
I'm single 
That's how I wanna be 
I'm single, oh, oh, ooh
Everything in it's right time
Everything in it's right place
I know I'll settle down one day
But 'til then, I like it this way
It's my way
Ayy, I like it this way, ay
Make your move if you want
Doesn't mean I will or won't
I'm free to make my mind up
You either got it or you don't 
This is my current single status
My declaration of independence 
There's no way I'm trading places 
Right now a star's in the ascendant 
This is my current single status
My declaration of independence
There's no way I'm trading places 
Right now a star's in the ascendant
I'm single 
That's how I wanna be
I'm single
That's how I wanna be
