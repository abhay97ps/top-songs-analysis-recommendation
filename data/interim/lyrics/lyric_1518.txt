I've been away from you
Such a long, long time
Since I've been gone
The sun won't shine
I miss you so
You never know how I do
Every little thing that
I say and do
Every thought leads
Me back to you
Something's wrong
I can't go on without you
I'm coming home
Dear, right away
I'll never think of going away
I wanna hold you like before
I wanna love you forever more
So I count the
Miles of railroad track
Seven miles and
I'll soon be back
I love you so
You'll never know
How I do
I'm coming home
Dear, right away
I'll never think of going away
I wanna hold you like before
I wanna love you forever more
I count the miles
Of the railroad tracks
Seven miles and
I'll soon be back
I love you so
You'll never know
How I do
You'll never know how I do
Never, never know how I do
Oh, I love you
