Well, baby, baby, don't you leave me here to make it alone
'Cause I don't think that I could take it for a day on my own
Why would you wanna hurt me
When I love you, baby, can't you see?
That you're precious to me 
And I can't let you go 
Baby, one day you'll see 
That you'll always be 
So precious to me
Why would you wanna hurt me
When I love you, baby, can't you see?
That you're precious to me 
And I can't let you go 
Baby, one day you'll see 
That you'll always be 
So precious to me
Oh, baby, baby, you can tell me, when will we meet again?
If I can't be your one and only then I'll have to pretend
Uh-huh, that you're still with me
Girl, I love you so affectionately
'Cause you're precious to me 
And I can't let you go 
Baby, one day you'll see 
That you'll always be 
So precious to me
To me
You're so precious to me 
And I can't let you go 
Baby, one day you'll see 
That you'll always be 
So precious to me
To me
You're so precious to me
You're precious to me
