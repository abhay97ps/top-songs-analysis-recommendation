I thought that you thought
That we thought we were bound
We were bound to each other
But it's not that way
We don't care about one another
Thunder and lightning showed me all the threats you weren't saying
Thunder and lightning, going to throw it all away
Thunder and lightning, and you touched my life without warning
Oh, how I loved you, you loved me
Now, what are we thinking?
Thunder and lightning will burn you just as sure as I'm singing
Thunder and lightning, didn't know our love would end this way
You got your way, we're to blame, but that's OK
Another time, another place
It's one more game
After all is said and done
We'll overcome
The psychological setback
Of a time on the run
It hurt to see you play games
That were so one-sided
I dealt the cards but the aces
Were in your back pocket
Thunder and lightning, won't let you alone 'til I'm paying
Thunder and lightning, didn't know our love could end this way
