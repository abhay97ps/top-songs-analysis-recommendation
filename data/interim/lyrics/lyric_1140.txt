A room full of tears
A room full of tears
Raindrops keep a-falling
Trickling down my window pane
As I sit here hoping
And that you'll come back home again
Since you've gone, I can't go on
I know my heart would surely break
Here am I lonely
Left here with only
A room full of tears
Everyone keeps asking
If you're really gone away
My pride won't let me answer
And I really don't know what to say
I made you mine, you said goodbye
Oh, where did I make my mistake?
Here am I lonely
Left here with only
A room full of tears
All this strain and all this pain
Is just much more than I can take
Here am I lonely
Left here with only
A room full of tears
A room full of tears
A room full of tears
