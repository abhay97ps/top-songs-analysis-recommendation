I don't know if I can say what I wanna do 
Hmm, maybe I can 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, come on
Now do I have to grab the back of your neck
To make you listen to me
Do you have to see me flashing the dough
Or waving my Rollie
Yeah, baby, can I get a hit of you?
What's up? What's up?
Come on, I like the touch
I got to freak ya 'round if you're down because
I got to get it
You won't forget it
Kiss you under your navel

Just let me hit, just let me hit it
I'll kiss the lips under your navel
I'll bet he won't go where I go
Listen now, baby, I can be a better man
Better yet a gentleman
Fly you to Japan and back again
Or spend a week in Puerto Rico
Baby wait 'till I'm finito
Cause I'm fiending yeah
And I got to get a hit of you
What's up? What's up?

We can do it when you want it, where you want it, how you want it 
Damn the coochie tight, I make it hot 
Lick you in between your legs and won't stop 
From the back, from the front, you on top
