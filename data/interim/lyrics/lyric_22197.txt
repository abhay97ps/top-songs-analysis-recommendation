So many different flavors 
So many shapes and sizes 
You coming with me and you going with Iyaz
No surprises, I put it all on the table for you
Nothing is too taboo, I'm ready, willing and able for you 
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this town
I'm tryna pick the right one, tryna pick the right one
I'm tryna find a shorty to hold me down
They say, to get a New York girl, then you gotta have a lot of class
And I heard ain't nothing like a Cali girl
But you better have a lot of cash
And I know, ain't nothing like them A-Town girl
'Cause they know how to show you love
And no matter where I go, I gotta let 'em know
That this song here is about you 
See, I don't mean to run away
To places you would not believe
I'm seeing all those pretty girls
I'm wishing you were there with me
It's simple when you smile, girl
Tells me all I need to know
You can be my one and only
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
I'm tryna pick the right one, tryna pick the right one
Tryna pick the right one, tryna pick the right one
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this town
I'm tryna pick the right one, tryna pick the right one
I'm tryna find a shorty to hold me down
Tell, tell, tell me, is it you, girl? 
Is it you, girl? 
Is it you, girl? 
Is it you, girl?
They say, to get a MIA girl, then you gotta have a lot of swag
And I heard, to get a Down South Bell
Then you gotta ride a Cadillac
And I know, ain't nothing like them London girl
'Cause they know how to party up
And no matter where I go, I gotta let 'em know
That this song here is about you
See, I don't mean to run away
To places you would not believe
I'm seeing all those pretty girls
I'm wishing you were there with me
It's simple when you smile, girl
Tells me all I need to know
You can be my one and only girlfriend
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
I'm tryna pick the right one, tryna pick the right one
Tryna pick the right one, tryna pick the right one 
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city 
There's a lot of pretty girls in this town
I'm tryna pick the right one, tryna pick the right one
I'm tryna find a shorty to hold me down
Tell, tell, tell me, is it you, girl? 
Is it you, girl? 
Is it you, girl? 
Is it you, girl?
Oh, hehe
I'm so indecisive
Tryna find a pretty girl that these shoes goes nice with
Been around the world and back, got a nack for them girls in black
But I need a chick that's gonna hold me tight like vice grips 
Just make sure you leave my heart how you found it 
You can keep the key but the lock stays around it 
Baby, let's take it slow, no pulling a fast one 
And you look like the type to keep my mind off the last one
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
I'm tryna pick the right one, tryna pick the right one
Tryna pick the right one, tryna pick the right one
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city 
There's a lot of pretty girls in this town
I'm tryna pick the right one, tryna pick the right one
I'm tryna find a shorty to hold me down
Tell, tell, tell me, is it you, girl? 
Is it you, girl? 
Is it you, girl? 
Is it you, girl, girl, girl, girl?
