Yeah, you, I really, really love you
Nobody else will do
That's why I love you
That's why, why, why
Yeah, you, I really, really want you
Nobody else will do
That's why I love you
That's why, why, why
Well, babe, you know I love you so
I'd pay the world if you could know
But when I see you coming down the street
My heart skips a beat
You, I really, really need you
But yet, you play me for a fool
Why do you do me like you do, do, do?
Yeah
Well, babe, you know I love you so
I'd pay the world if you could know
But when I see you coming down the street
My heart skips a beat
You, I really really need you
But yet you play me for a fool
Why do you do me like you do?
Why do you do me like you do?
Why, why?
