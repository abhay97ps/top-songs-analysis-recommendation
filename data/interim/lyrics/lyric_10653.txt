I have found that one and only love
One my heart has been searching for
Other loves have said a lot, I know
But so unlike the ones I knew before
Baby, you says it all
Baby, you says it all
Baby, you says it all
You says it all, all
I have felt that one and only dream
One I know this heart will always feel
You have made my
Life one endless smile
I got to say I really
I really like your style
Baby, you 
Good God almighty, I said you, you
My baby says it all
You says it all, all
And you have made
My life one endless smile
I got to say I really
I really like your style
Baby, you 
God almighty, baby, you
My, baby, you
Wow, wow, wow
My baby says it all
From her head to her toes
I want everybody to know
Hey, hey, you, you, you
