Kinda complicated, got me educated 
When I watch you I feel the rhythm in my heart
When I see you girl, I knew it from the start
Movin' to the beat, I'm just tryin' to play my part

To go ahead and get my dance

Are you saving that dessert for me?
Cause if you are baby
You know you could work for me
The way you do it causing jealousy
But you don't ever gotta worry about the enemy
They try to do it like you
And they get mad cause they don't do it successfully
They try to copy your moves
But they don't never ever do it that tastefully
