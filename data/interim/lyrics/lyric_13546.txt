Riding on the range
I've got my hat - on
I've got my boots - dusty
I've got my saddle
On my horse
He's called....T-t-t-t-t-trigger
Of course
I wanna be a cowboy
And you can be my cowgirl
I wanna be a cowboy
And you can be my cowgirl
I wanna be a cowboy
Riding on the chuck wagon
Following my man
His name is Ted
Can you believe that?
 Ted! Oh, Ted! Fighting off danger!
Camping on the prairie
Plays havoc with my hair
Makes me feel quite dirty
Though we all do sometimes
 Ted gets so dirty!
I wanna be a cowboy
And you can be my cowgirl
I wanna be a cowboy
And you can be my cowgirl
I wanna be a cowboy
Looking like a hero
Six-gun at my side
Chewing my tobacco
Out on the horizon
I see a puff of smoke
Indians on the warpath
 White man speak-em with forked tongue
Or not
I wanna be a cowboy
And you can be my cowgirl
I wanna be a cowboy
My name is Ted
And one day I'll be dead yo yo
