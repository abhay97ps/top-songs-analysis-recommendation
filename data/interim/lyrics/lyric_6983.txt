Wanting you the way I do
I only want to be with you
And I would go to the ends of the earth
'cause darling
To me that's what you're worth
Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere, that you tell me to
If you need, need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead
If you're out on the road
Feeling lonely and oh so cold
All you gotta do is call my name
And I'll be there on the next train
Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere you tell me to
If you need, need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead
I've always wanted a real home
With flowers on the windowsill
But if you want to live in new york city
Honey, you know i will
Yes, I will
Yes, I will
I never thought I could get satisfaction
From just one man
If anyone can keep me happy
Oh, you're the one who can
I'm gonna follow where you lead me
I'm gonna follow where you lead me
Wanting you the way I do
I only want to be with you
And I would go to the ends of the earth
¡®cause darling, to me that's what you're worth
Where you lead I will follow
Anywhere...
Anywhere you tell me to
If you need, need me to be with you
I will follow, oh, where you lead
I'm gonna follow where you lead me
I'm gonna follow where you lead me
I'm gonna follow where you lead me
I'm gonna follow where you lead me ...
