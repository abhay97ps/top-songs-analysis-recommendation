Goin' to Kansas City, haha, Kansas City here I come
Goin' to Kansas City, ha, Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little foxes there, and I'm gonna get me one
Looka here, I'll be standing on the corner of 12th Street and Vine
I'll be standing on the corner of 12th Street and Vine
With my Kansas City, baby, and a taste of Kansas City wine
Well, I might take a train or I believe I'll try a plane
If I have to walk, I'm goin' there just the same
Way down to Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little foxes there, and I'm gonna get me one, one
And if I have to stay with my baby, I believe I'm gonna die
Gotta find a new woman and that's the reason why
I'm gone, Kansas City here I come
Do you hear me?
They got some crazy little foxes there, I'm gonna have me one
Hey!
I need somebody to hold me
I need somebody to hold me
OH, I've got Kansas City on my mind, Kansas City
I can't, I just can't
I can't bare the strain
The reason that I don't like pain
OH, I'm going to Kansas City
