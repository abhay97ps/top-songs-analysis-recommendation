Said I wouldn't drink, but I did the same day
Shit, I lied to your face like I always do
Said I was gon' change, both know that I can't
Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always do
I been the same ever since the first day
Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew
Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else
Like I always do
I know you can't believe me 'cause I never tell the truth but, oh
I wish that you could just see that it's only to protect you, no
How many times can somebody want the same pain? 
When the prеssure put on me, then I changе things
And every time that I run, I know you gon' chase
We always end up right back in the same place
You-u-u-u-u, wastin' all my time with you-u-u-u-u
Wishin' I was someone new-ew-ew-ew-ew
Stuck up in my ways and you say that you hate it, but
You always knew
Said I wouldn't drink, but I did the same day
Shit, I lied to your face like I always do
Said I was gon' change, both know that I can't
Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always do
I been the same ever since the first day
Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew
Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else
Like I always do
Do, do, do, do, do , like I always do
Do, do, do, do, do , like I always do
I'm sorry, I can't be the me you wanted
I'm about to fall, then you're all in
I'm not the one to solve your problems 
'Cause I'm fucked up too-oo-oo-oo-oo
Wastin' all my time with you-u-u-u-u
Wishin' I was someone new-ew-ew-ew-ew
Stuck up in my ways and you say that you hate it, but
You always knew
Said I wouldn't drink, but I did the same day
Shit, I lied to your face like I always do
Said I was gon' change, both know that I can't
Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always do
I've been the same ever since the first day
Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew
Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else
Like I always do
Do, do, do, do, do , like I always do
Do, do, do, do, do , like I always do
