Hey hey yeah
Ooh hoo hoo yeah
When I kiss your lips I just don't want to behave
My passion runs deeper and, girl, I'm not afraid
To bare my heart and soul and let it tumble all out
But if you say the word you'll have me talkin' about
When I kiss your lips, I just don't know where I stand
My passion runs deeper and things get out of hand
I'll bare my heart and soul and let it tumble all out
But if you say the word you'll have me talkin' about
 girl, whenever we touch
 girl, there's never too much
 girl, it's never enough
Too much passion is not enough
Too much passion is not enough
Whenever you touch me I feel a fire inside
My feelings that I have for you I just can't hide
I'll bare my heart and soul and let it tumble all out
But if you say the word you'll have me talkin' about
Too much passion is not enough
Too much passion is not enough
Too much passion is not enough 
Too much passion is not enough 
Too much passion is not enough 
Too much passion is not enough
