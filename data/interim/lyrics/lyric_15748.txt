I was such a fool
Hopelessly in love with you
You were so cruel
For what you put me through
So now I'm telling you goodbye
There's no way to stop me, don't even try
I'm not the same girl I was yesterday
Forget the past and let the memories fade away
This is the last time you'll break my heart
I'm doing what I should've done from the start
This is the last time, no more second chances
And now you'll never know what true romance is
I've opened my eyes
I know you've done me wrong
I said that I loved you
And you just played along
All of those times I begged you to stay
But you just walked away
That was the last time you made me cry
Baby, we're through, I'm telling you goodbye
This is the last time you'll break my heart
I'm doing what I should've done from the start
This is the last time, no more second chances
And now you'll never know what true romance is
This is the last time you'll break my heart
I'm doing what I should've done from the start
This is the last time, no more second chances
And now you'll never know what true romance is
So now I'm telling you goodbye
There's no way to stop me, don't even try
I'm not the same girl I was yesterday
Forget the past and let the memories fade away
This is the last time you'll break my heart
I'm doing what I should've done from the start
This is the last time, no more second chances
And now you'll never know what true romance is
This is the last time you'll break my heart
I'm doing what I should've done from the start
This is the last time, no more second chances
And now you'll never know what true romance is
