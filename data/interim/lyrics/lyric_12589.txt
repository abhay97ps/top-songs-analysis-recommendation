No self-control
A chain reaction as my body lets go
A strange kind of light
The tempo takes me and the circuit excites
Magnetic
The rhythm of a dangerous dance
Suck you in twice as fast
Magnetic
The rhythm of a dangerous dance
Suck you in, you'll never last
Step into the light
Make the spark ignite
Step into the light tonight
No place to hide
I keep on runnin' but I'm falling behind
A new kind of beat
It takes your mind, then it takes your feet
Magnetic
The rhythm of a dangerous dance
Suck you in twice as fast
Magnetic
The rhythm of a dangerous dance
Suck you in, you'll never last
Are we making contact tonight?
Don't break the circuit, oh
I'll be making contact tonight
Don't break the circuit, oh
Magnetic
The rhythm of a dangerous dance
Suck you in twice as fast
Magnetic
The rhythm of a dangerous dance
Suck you in, you'll never last
Magnetic
The rhythm of a dangerous dance
Suck you in twice as fast
Magnetic
The rhythm of a dangerous dance
Suck you in, you'll never last
Are we making contact tonight?
Don't break the circuit, oh
I'll be making contact tonight
Don't break the circuit, oh
Step into the light
Make the spark ignite
Step into the light tonight
Step into the light
Make the spark ignite
Step into the light tonight
Magnetic
The rhythm of a dangerous dance
Suck you in twice as fast
Magnetic
The rhythm of a dangerous dance
Suck you in, you'll never last
Step into the light tonight
Come make the sparks ignite
Step into the light tonight
Step into the light
Make the spark ignite
Step into the light
Dance in the static tonight
