'Cause now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back to me
Oh, when Judy left with Johnny at my party 
And came back wearing his ring
I sat down and cried my eyes out
Now that was a foolish thing
'Cause now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back to me
Well, it hurt me so to see them dance together 
I felt like making a scene
Then my tears just fell like rain drops
'Cause Judy's smile was so mean
But now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back to me
Oh, one night I saw them kissing at a party 
So I kissed some other guy
Johnny jumped up and he hit him
'Cause he still loves me, that's why
So now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back to me
Yay, now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back to me
