You're wondering if
I care about you
Is there some cause
That I should doubt you
Oh, I can see, boy
That you don't know me very well
Uh uh, you're so unsure
And you run here and there
To ask my feelings
Friends only guess
They can't say really, oh
Don't ask my neighbors
Don't ask the friends I hang around
Uh uh, don't be afraid
To come to me 
Don't ask my neighbors
Come to me 
Don't be afraid of
What you'll see 
You'll find I love you 
Come to me 
Don't be afraid
You ask all my friends
If I'm the same, boy
You don't understand
You think I'm changing, ohh
Don't ask my neighbors
Don't ask the friends I hang around
Uh uh  don't be afraid
 to come to me 
Don't ask my neighbors 
Come to me 
Don't be afraid of what you'll see
You'll find I love you 
Come to me 
Don't be afraid
I, I will, ooh.....
Don't ask my neighbors
Come to me 
Don't be afraid of what you'll see
You'll find I love you
Come to me 
Don't be afraid
Hurry, come to me
Come to me, come to me
Don't ask my neighbors
 come to me
Don't be afraid of what you'll see
You'll find I love you
Come to me, don't be afraid
