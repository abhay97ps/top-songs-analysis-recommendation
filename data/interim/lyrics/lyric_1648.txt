Closed up all my windows, so no one could see
Even told the mailman to pass by me
Cause my love is coming today
And I know what she's gonna say
So I’m getting ready for the heartbreak
So I'm getting ready for the heartbreak
Last night he saw me walking, it was much to dark to see
The girl I was holding hands with didn't mean a thing to me
But now my tears are falling like rain
And I’m starting to feel the pain
So I'm getting ready for the heartbreak
So I'm getting ready for the heartbreak
There's no use in carrying it on
Pretty soon our love will be gone
So I'm getting ready for the heartbreak
So I'm getting ready for the heartbreak
