Yeah, yeah
Let me catch ya vibe, let's just take our time
Just relax your mind and take it easy
Don't have to decide, you do, I do, I
Don't have to be mine, let's take it easy
Damn, we so fi', bae
Whippin' through the 305 highway
Love it how you ride in the fast lane
Make me wanna say, "That's my babe," yeah
Dani gotta behave, gotta be chill like a Sunday
Never wanna look too thirsty
But your drip got me feeling wavy
Make you feel lucky, lucky
Make you wanna love me, love me
Baby, when you with me, with me
Got no worries, worries
I love it when you touch me, touch me
Feelin' so lovely, lovely
Make me wanna love me, love me
Make me feel lucky, lucky
Let me catch ya vibe, let's just take our time
Just relax your mind and take it easy
Don't have to decide, you do, I do, I
Don't have to be mine, let's take it easy
Hey, yeah
And take it easy
Hey
When you pull up on my side, babe
Speedin' down that 101 highway
Movin' too fast, couldn't see the place
But you see that look on my face, so you know what it is
Pedal to the metal, all gas, no brake
Girl, I would never get in your way
I'ma shut up and let you drive
Put that thing to the floor, one for the road
Make you feel lucky, lucky 
Make you wanna love me, love me
Baby, when you with me, with me 
Got no worries, worries 
I love it when you touch me, touch me
Feelin' so lovely, lovely 
Make me wanna love me, love me 
Make me feel lucky, lucky 
Let me catch ya vibe, let's just take our time
Just relax your mind and take it easy
Don't have to decide, you do, I do, I
Don't have to be mine, let's take it easy
Hey, yeah
And take it easy
Hey
Let's take it easy
Hey, yeah
And take it easy
Hey
