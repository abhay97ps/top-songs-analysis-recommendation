Ladies

You keep on going in circles girl you’re trying to find your way out
But its time I put on my cape and
Put that s on my chest
Girl I wanna come and save you
But I’m stuck in the middle of seeing you hurt
I know when you love him
And you wanna make it work
And I can’t help but think that I've known you first
It’s getting louder, girl
Can’t ignore it no more

I can hear your heart crying out for me 
I can hear your heart crying out for me
 Come on in, come on in come on in and save me
 Come on in, come on in come on in and save me

But baby having late night conversion on your sofa
You telling me how he played you out over and over
Over and over
But I’m stuck in the middle of seeing you hurt
I know when you love him
And you wanna make it work
And I can’t help but think that I knew you first
It’s getting louder
