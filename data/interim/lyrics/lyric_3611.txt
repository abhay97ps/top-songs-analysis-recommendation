Is it me or is it her
Tell me which one do you prefer
I love you 
You know I do 
I'm gonna ask you one more time
Are you hers or are you mine
Is it me 
Is it her, Is it me, is it her
Is it me, is it her
Which one, baby, do you prefer
Do you want her rather than me
I need to know how it's gonna be
You don't even know, my baby
Which way your love will go
I'm a better woman than she
If you don't believe it
Come try me
I'll love you in a way
You'll never forget 
I won't do anything to my baby
You'll regret
All the things I've said are true
But the choice is up to you
Is it me 
Is it her, is it me, is it her
Is it me, is it her
Which one, baby, do you prefer
I've gotta know, baby
Is it me or her
Which one, baby, is it gonna be
I've gotta know, baby
Is it her or me
Is it her or is it me
