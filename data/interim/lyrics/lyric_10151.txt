The way you read the crowd, the way you make them pay
You stepped in and did the scene a whole new way
No one would resist you now and even if they could
Hollywood just never had it quite this good
I see your name in lights, I see them standing in line
They send the cards and the wine
Broadway here she comes
You should be a natural
Camera, action, do it again
What a reaction, do it again
Camera, action, do it again
What a reaction, do it again
No one had to tell you what your smile was for
You sure there's not an uncle name of Barrymore
Now she did this and she did that you are the latest talk
Now there lining up for you around the block
Throwing roses and Holy Moses
Even the Times say
Sparks fell from the skies
That gets you immortalized
Camera, action, do it again
What a reaction, do it again
Camera, action, do it again
Ooh, anyway I gotta do it)
What a reaction, do it again
They gave you 5 stars, they're sending big cars
And Sunset Boulevard will never be the same
You give it a brand new name
Camera, action, do it again
What a reaction, do it again
Camera, action, do it again
What a reaction, do it again
Camera, action, do it again
What a reaction, do it again
Camera, action, do it again
What a reaction, do it again
Camera, action, do it again
What a reaction, do it again
Camera, action, do it again
What a reaction, do it again
