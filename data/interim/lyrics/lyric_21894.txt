The Perfect Storm, it's Twista and Chris Brown, ya dig?
Oh, oh, oh
I got a new one for ya, let's make a movie, baby
The Traxster
Twista got cars, big swagger
I'm a rock star like Mick Jagger
And I got bars that I spit faster
You a hot star and no bitch badder
So let me take you on a ride, on a journey
With the one that you call daddy, yeah, who gonna make you get it wet
But this time we gon' do something romantic and different 
I'll tell you about it when we get on the movie set
I was thinking that we could just make a sex tape
Plus I think yo face cute when it's in HD
Maybe I could tape you and you could tape me
When I pull my H2 up to your H3
You know that you wanna be in this movie
So don't be acting like a tripping with a stranger mission
Recording you while you loving me down below
Switching the camera angle when we change positions
You could be the director, aiming the camera down at me 
Filming me licking until you say, "Cut"
Ready for any footage you wanna get 
Ain't gotta call nobody else because I do my own stunts
It's the X rated version of a box office hit
I see she ready to strip for this
So let me get the music in, get the tape in 
Get the cameras in
Baby, we don't need no script for this 
I'ma throw a couple thousand, baby, strip for this 
Let me pull my camera out and make a movie, yeah
Starring you and me, yeah
Baby, we don't need no actresses 
Let me see what I'm working with, I'ma break your back with this 
Let me pull my camera out, let's make a movie, yeah
Starring you and me, yeah, yeah, yeah, girl
Shawty, we gonna make a movie
Got me loving it when I'm feeling on the booty
Especially when I can blame it on the alcohol 
'Cause it do something to me, oh
She look better than any chick in my perimeter 
Sexy, I wish I could film every bit of her
Kissing right down to her stomach and then I'ma
Tell her we could be in our personal cinema
I let you hold the camera first and then I hold it then 
'Cause I wanna see how it's coming out and going in 
Let you see such a freak in me. I hope this never leak on TMZ 
This is 50 World Star or CNN
Baby girl, you kick the world off the axis 
I'm no director, filming you for practice 
And you know I think you a hell of a actress 
Especially when I'm shooting you on a mattress
Shawty, straight to the top, that's where we headed
And I'ma see my name in the credits and be the shit if you let it
See something that you not really feeling
Then we can always go back and make an edit
I'll be sipping on Patron Platinum
She knew about the rapping, but didn't know I'd be on acting
Now our personal reality show
So there, get the tape in, get the cameras in 
Baby, we don't need no script for this 
I'ma throw a couple thousand, baby, strip for this 
Let me pull my camera out and make a movie, yeah 
Starring you and me, yeah 
Baby, we don't need no actresses 
Let me see what I'm working with, I'ma break your back with this 
Let me pull my camera out, let's make a movie, yeah
Starring you and me, yeah, yeah, girl
