I love sweet William
Yes, he's my boy
And I'm his little doll
His favorite toy
He brings me candy
And kisses too
Because I'm stuck on him
I'll stick to him like glue
Oh, I need sweet William so
I'll never let him go
And I know our love will grow
I love sweet William
Yes, he's my thrill
And who will marry me?
Sweet William will
Instrumental bridge
I love sweet William
Yes, he's my boy
And I'm his little doll
His favorite toy
I love sweet William
Yes, he's my thrill
And who will marry me?
Sweet William will
Sweet William will
