You've got me doin' the craziest things
Up and turned me around and around and around
Like a yo-yo on a string
You've got me thinkin'
The world's gonna end
Then you fill me with hope and love
And tear me down again
Oh, our love is insane
Things are up in the air
Or down on the ground with nowhere in between
Oh, our love is insane
I wouldn't give it up 
No, not for anything
You've got me swearin'
I'll walk out that door
Out of touch, out of time
Without a friend or a dime
I'm drawn to you once more
Oh, our love is insane
Things are up in the air
Or down on the ground with nowhere in between
Oh, our love is insane
I wouldn't give it up 
No, not for anything
You soothe the wound then you break my heart in two
Tell me to touch you then to take my hands off you
We yakety-yak, then for days you won't talk to me
Your honey's so sweet but you know that you're stingin'
Stinging like a killer bee
Oh, our love is insane
Oh, our love is insane
Our love is insane
Oh, our love is insane
Oh, our love is insane
Oh, our love is insane
