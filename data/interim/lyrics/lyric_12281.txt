There's a little girl in our neighborhood
Her name is Charlotte Johnson and she's really lookin' good
I had to go and see her, so I called her on the phone
I walked over to her house and this was goin' on
Her brother was on the sofa, eatin' chocolate pie
Her mama was in the kitchen, cuttin' chicken up to fry
Her daddy was in the backyard. rollin' up a garden hose
I was on the porch with Charlotte, feelin' love down to my toes
And we were swingin', 
Yes, we were swingin' 
Little Charlotte, she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on her front porch in this swing
Just a-swingin' 
Yeah, and we'll be swingin', 
Yes, we'll be swingin' 
Little Charlotte, she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on her front porch in the swing
Just a-swingin' 
Now, Charlotte, she's the darlin', she's the apple of my eye
And when I'm on the swing with her, it makes me almost high
And Charlotte is my lover, and she has been since the spring
I just can't believe it started on her front porch in this swing
Just a swingin', 
Well, just a-swingin' 
Little Charlotte, she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on her front porch in the swing
Just a-swingin' 
I said, Little Charlotte, she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on her front porch in the swing
Just a-swingin'
