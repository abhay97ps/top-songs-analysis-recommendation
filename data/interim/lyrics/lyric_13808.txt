You've been taken by the city
The oldest story in the world
You come for the gold
And end up bought and sold
You can't seem
To make no difference
With all the lies that you've been told
What you don't know is you're
The best man in the world
There's more than meets the eye
There's so much you don't see
Like the power of your heart
Driving your destiny
Magic takes what she deserves
A lesser heart would lose it's nerve
You've been taken by the city
But you've done better than you know
You're part of the sky
You're part of the street
You've got the talent to satisfy me
What you don't know is you're
The best man in the world
Best man in the world
Best man in the world
There's more than meets the eye
There is so much you don't see
Like the power of your heart
Driving your destiny
Magic takes what she deserves
A lesser heart would lose it's nerve
You've been taken by the city
But you've done better than you know
You're part of the sky
Part of the street
You've got the talent to satisfy me
What you don't know is you're
The best man in the world
Best man in the world
Best man in the world
Best man in the world
Best man in the world
Best man in the world
