Sometimes, the going get a little tough now
When the times get hard and the friends get few now
No one to turn to, and nothing to do now
You scream and you holler
'Til your back and is soaking wet now
You still love 'em so much
And still, you can't forget now
You scream and you holler
Your back gets soaking wet
You know that you used to love him
And still, you can't forget
You know sometimes it's hard
Nowhere to go
No one to love
Tried everything you know
And AHH, baby
And AHH, baby
I want you to play
I want you to play a little softer now
You know, a friend of mine told me one time
I think it was back in 1959
He said, "Darling, you send me"
He said, "If you call me, I'll come running back to you
And another friend of mine told me
He said, "If you need me, call me"
You see, I got a lot of friends in my business
And another friend of mine, he told me
You better stop dogging me around, now
And a recent friend of mine, he came up
And you know what he said? "It's too late"
