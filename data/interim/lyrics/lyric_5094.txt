Listen to me, babythe lights are way down low
There's a stack of records on the stereo
Let yourself unwind, girlwe're gonna take a journey down to rhythm and blues
Ridin' on a soul train, yeah baby just-a me and you
You don't have to hurry on a soul train ride
You don't have to worrylet your troubles slide
Dancin' to the music, maybe we can travel till we're out of sight
Yeah, and everything'll be all right
Groovin' slow and easy, just takin' our time
We ain't goin' nowhere, for baby I don't mind
So put your arms around mewe're gonna take a journey down to rhythm and blues
Ridin' on a soul train, yeah baby just-a me and you
Ridin' on a soul train, baby
Oh, ridin' on a soul train, yeah
