Hey, hey, give 'em what they want
If lust and hate is the candy
If blood and love tastes so sweet
Then we give 'em what they want

So their eyes are growing hazy
'Cause they wanna turn it on
So their minds are soft and lazy
Well
Hey, hey, give 'em what they want

Then we give 'em what they want
So their eyes are growing hazy
'Cause they wanna turn it on
So their minds are soft and lazy
Well
Who do you want to blame?
