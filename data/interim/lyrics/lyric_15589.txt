It's just like heaven
Being with you
You're like an angel
Too good to be true
But after all
I love you
I do
Angel baby
My angel baby
When you are near me
My heart skips a beat
I can hardly stand on
My own two feet
Because I love you
I love you
I dooo
Angel baby
My angel baby
Ooooh I love you
Ooooh I do
No one can love you
Like I do
Ohhh, ooohâ€¦ ooh ohh
From the first time
That I looked deep into your eyes
You sent me off to heaven baby
Body and mind
Everything about you
Is everything that i've dreamed of
And now you're here beside me
My angel from above
It's just like heaven
Being with you dear
I could never stay away
Without you near
Because I love you
I love you
I dooo
Angel baby
My angel baby
Angel baby
My angel baby!
Oooh I love you
Ohhh I do!
No one can love you
Like I do
Ooooh ohhh oooh
Oooh, oooh oooh
