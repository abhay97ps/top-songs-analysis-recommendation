I've been thinkin' 'bout
All the times you told me
You're so full of doubt
You just can't let it be, but I know
If you keep comin' back for more
Then I'll keep on tryin'
I'll keep on tryin'
And I've been drinkin' now
Just a little too much
And I don't know how
I can get in touch with you
Now there's only one thing for me to do
That's to keep on trying
To get home to you
And I feel so satisfied when I can see you smile, I
I want to confide in all that is true
So I keep on tryin'
I'm through with lyin'
Just like the sun above, I come shining through
Oh yes, I keep on tryin'
I'm tired of cryin'
I got to find a way to get on home to you
I've been thinkin' 'bout
All the times you held me
I never heard you shout
The flow of energy was so fine
Now I think I'll lay it on the line
And keep on tryin'
To get home to you
And I feel so satisfied when I can see you smile, I
I want to confide in all that is true
So I keep on tryin'
I'm through with lyin'
Just like the sun above, I come shining through
Oh yes I will
Oh yes, I keep on tryin'
I'm tired of cryin'
I got to find a way to get on home to you
