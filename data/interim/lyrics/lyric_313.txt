Don't come knockin' on my door
I don't want you round no more, no more
'Round me no more
I tell you once and I'll tell you twice
I'll find the one gonna treat me right
Treat me right
Gonna treat me right
You, you done me wrong
Stole my love and gone
I just can't go on
I just can't go on
You can go on baby, baby that's all right
I'll find the one gonna treat me right
Treat me right
Gonna treat me right
You, you done me wrong
Took my love and gone
I just can't go on
I just can't go on
You can go on baby, baby that's all right
I'll find the one gonna treat me right
Treat me right
Gonna treat me right
