Every day I have to cry some
Every day I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Every day I have to cry
There was a little girl I had planned to marry
This was my love, I didn't wanna share it
I though that love would make my life bright and sunny
She said she couldn't love me 'cause I didn't have no money
So every day I have to cry some
Every day I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Every day I have to cry
Had me a girl, guess I really loved her
Every night when I was thinkin' of her
But you can't mix love with money
'Cause if you do it's gonna hurt somebody
So every day I have to cry some
Every day I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Every day I have to cry
Whoa, I know that I am just a poor man
But is it wrong to love 'cause I'm not a rich man?
But every time you mix love with money
Every time it hurts somebody
So every day I have to cry some
Every day I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Every day I have to cry
Every day I have to cry some
Every day I have to cry some
