The first thing every morning
And the last thing every night
I think of you and all
The things I say and do
If only you were here
To whisper sweet things too
I'd tell you how much I love you
How I'm longing to hold you tight
The first thing every morning
And the last thing every night
Oh, I'd tell you how much I love you
How I'm longing to hold you tight
The first thing every morning
And the last thing every night
The very first thing every morning
And the last thing every night
