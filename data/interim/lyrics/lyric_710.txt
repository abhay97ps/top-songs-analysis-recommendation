A-little Pedro
A-little Pedro
A-little Pedro
To win the governor's daughter
Way down in-a Mexicali
There was a cat named Little Pedro
He got the red sombrero, has a silly grin
A-everywhere he goes
A-there's a bull, in the old bullpen
Just a-snortin' an a-kickin' all day
He knocked down twenty-two houses
Killed twenty-one men
And they stood up and said, H'Ole'
A-little Pedro
A-little Pedro
A-little Pedro
Win the governor's daughter
Bull charged in with his eyes a-flamin'
To the center of the ring 
In stormed Pedro with a silly grin
A-like he could not kill a thing
Took a short step forward
And he's turnin' around
He saw the bull comin' at his feet
He grabbed the red sombrero
And his bag he packed
And he headed for the nearest backstreet
The bull couldn't stop
As he started to charge
He hit the hard concrete wall
Said that there was a smile on his face
And that was the end of it all
A-little Pedro
A-little Pedro
A-little Pedro
He win the governor's daughter
Win the governor's daughter
Win the governor's daughter
