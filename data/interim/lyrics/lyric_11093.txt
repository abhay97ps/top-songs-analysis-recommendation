I Can't Help It
Andy Gibb and Olivia Newton-John
Oh, I
Baby, what a fool I am
First a boy and then a man am I
And you
You're the heart of it all
You're the things I say and do
Am I wasting my time hanging around
You would be gone
But I can't help it
Every moment that I think about you
Every day and every night without you
I can't survive
Love, take away the lonely days gone by
Make it every day for you and I
Giving me a chance to go on believing
Girl, you gotta go on believing
Boy, you gotta go on believing
You
Baby you're the breath I take
Coming from the heart in love am I
And you
You're the heart of it all
You're the things I say and do
Am I wasting my time hanging around
You would be gone
But I can't help it
Every moment that I think about you
Every day and every night without you
I can't survive
Love, take away the lonely days gone by
Make it every day for you and I
Giving me a chance to go on believing
Girl, you gotta go on believing
Boy, you gotta go on believing
