Hey
Everybody loves to feel the beat
From Malibu to 42nd Street
I like to groove
No matter where I am
From Detroit City down to Alabam
It has moved me heart and soul
So I do believe
It's a whole philosophy to me
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can't feel it, baby
I can't move
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can hear it, baby
I can't lose
A good groove will
Turn your head around
Lifts you up
When you're feeling down
Get your body moving into gear
That's why the world's
Been turning all these years
It ain't written
In the statute books
It can't be learned in school
It's the law, baby
It's the golden rule
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can't feel it, baby
I can't move
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can hear it, baby
I can't lose
All right
It ain't written
In the statute books
It can't be learned in school
It's the law, baby
It's the golden rule
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I live by the groove
If I can't feel it, baby
I can't move
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can hear it, baby
I can't lose
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can't feel it, baby
I can't move
Said I live by the groove
I live by, live by
Live by, live by the groove
If I can't hear it
I can't move
I live by the groove
If I can't feel it, baby
I can't move...
