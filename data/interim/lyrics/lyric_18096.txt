Go,steam from a summer raindrop
Rising off the blacktop
I wipe the sweat from my brow
Steam on my radiator
I'm late and getting later
Should be at your place by now
Bank sign says 102
But that ain't nothing when I'm next to you
There's fire in your fingertips
Flames in your touch
Desire in your burning lips
Can't get enough
Today was a scorcher
But I'll go you one better
Tonight when we get together
We're going to make steam
I dream of you there on my front steps
Sunning in that short dress
Hotter than the Texas heat
Seems I'm never gonna get there
Traffic's going nowhere
But when I feel you next to me
Girl the things you know to do
Just make my heat index go through the roof
Girl the things you know to do
Just make my heat index go through the roof
Steam
Ha ha ha
We're gonna make steam
Come on
