Ah-ah-ah
Up in my cup, yeah
I let my feelings build up 
I just pour it up in my cup
Oh yeah, yeah
And if you said that you real, how come you gone now?
I be calm all the time, I turn up, they say, "Calm down"
I pull up in a new Wraith, that's just what I'm on now
We dropped the top to ride around, look back, the sun down
I look around to see who hatin', count who switched on me
Peep all these new hoes in my contacts but she been on me
I like it one girl at a time, lately, I been on three
I cannot jack you, shawty, I heard that you was a skeet
You don't know who gon' be there when you down
But you know who gon' be there when you up
I let my feelings build up
So now I just pour it up in my cup
Girl, you didn't fuck with me then
So why you fuckin' with me now?
Baby, I know you been broke
What you know about ballin' out?
You can smell X when I breathe, niggas get stretched if I bleed
Fifty K cash when I sneeze, I done went Diamond in the streets
Cut off my dog, he a leech, Glock go baow if he reach
Killers involved when I preach, asked one opp but he sleep
I'd give it all to my dawgs, motivate law when he call
A hundred and fifty on the Patek, I could've got the car with the stars
I be rappin' 'bout blocks, I'm promotin' my scars
He ain't know about the Lamb', I told 'em, "It's ours"
From Percs to bars, from guns to cars
From coke to narc, from small to large
Who really with you when it's said and done?
They gon' try to get you, so you better run
You don't know who gon' be there when you down
But you know who gon' be there when you up
I let my feelings build up
So now I just pour it up in my cup
Girl, you didn't fuck with me then
So why you fuckin' with me now?
Baby, I know you been broke
What you know about ballin' out?
You don't know who gon' be there when you down
But you know who gon' be there when you up
I let my feelings build up
So now I just pour it up in my cup
Girl, you didn't fuck with me then
So why you fuckin' with me now?
Baby, I know you been broke
What you know about ballin' out?
Sometimes I miss the days of hunger, standin' in the rain
'Member when I didn't have shit to lose and everything to gain
Yes, I'm grateful for my blessings, no, I shouldn't complain
But what about when I got doubts? I woke up feeling drained
Death was just so normal in these streets, another youngin' slain
My uncle died from a shootout, left murder on my brain
Show no mercy, kill 'em all, that's how we was trained
Crime scene pictures, can't forget about them blood stains
Wounded memories, oh, I'm in need of Novocaine
Got me wishin' that these Percs could really numb the pain
Catch me, don't got my gun, I guess I'm leavin' with this chain
Long live Mike Durb, I won't let them say your name in vain
You don't know who gon' be there when you down
But you know who gon' be there when you up
I let my feelings build up
So now I just pour it up in my cup
Girl, you didn't fuck with me then
So why you fuckin' with me now?
Baby, I know you been broke
What you know about ballin' out?
You don't know who gon' be there when you down
But you know who gon' be there when you up
I let my feelings build up
So now I just pour it up in my cup
Girl, you didn't fuck with me then
So why you fuckin' with me now?
Baby, I know you been broke
What you know about ballin' out?
