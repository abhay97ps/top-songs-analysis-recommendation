You know I feel so bad, children
Feel like a ballgame on a rainy day
Yes I do, y'all
Don't you know I feel so bad, children
Oh Lord, like a ballgame on a rainy day
Whoa, since I lost my woman
You see I have to shake my head
And then I walk away
I have to walk away
Y'all listen to this
I just wanna tell you people
I wanna tell you just how I feel
Can you hear me now?
Oh, I wanna tell all you people out there
I wanna tell you just how I feel
Oh, how I feel
You see, I feel so bad, I feel so bad
Because my woman, she gave me a dirty deal
The child messed up my mind
Oh, yes, she did
Now listen y'all
I got one more thing
I want to talk to you about
Wait a minute
Sometimes I want to leave, yeah
Then again I want to stay, yeah yeah
Did y'all hear what I said? Oh oh oh
Sometimes I want to leave this town, yes I do
Then again, I wanna stay, ooh hoo hoo hoo
You see, but the thing is
I already got my suitcase packed up
So I guess I'll have to
Catch a train and then I'll ride away
Go and ride away
Said I'm gonna move
Gonna move on, gonna move on
Lord, I wanna move
Since the woman been gone
I ain't had no love
That's what I want
That's what I need
A little dab'll do me
Ooh, sock it to me
Lord, Somebody help me
Help me find my way
