When we had to part
That's when I knew
Baby, it’s gonna be a cold, cold winter without you
The snow is fallin' on the ground
The wind is blowin' all around
From June until September
I always will remember
But it’s a cold, cold winter night
I miss those summer days with you
The silly things we used to do
And since we're not together
I need you more than ever
But it's a cold, cold winter night
True, summer's great for havin' fun
But you need love when winter comes
I sit at home and watch the storm
Wish you were here to keep me warm
Can't wait 'til next vacation
I'll see you when that day comes
But it’s a cold, cold winter night
Can’t wait 'til next vacation
I’ll see you when that day comes
But it's a cold, cold winter night
Can't wait 'til next vacation
I’ll love you when that day comes
But it's a cold, cold winter night
Can't wait 'til next vacation
I'll love you when that day comes
