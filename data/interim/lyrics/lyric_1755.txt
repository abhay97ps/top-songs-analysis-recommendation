Send me some loving
Ooh send it I pray
How can I love you
When you're so far away?
Oh honey, send me your picture
Oh send it my dear
So I can hold it
And pretend you are here
Can you send me your kisses?
I still feel your touch
And oh I need you so badly
I want you so much
My days are so lonely
Whoa my nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm alone
And I'm waiting for you
I want you to 
Oh send me some of that loving baby
 Ooh, send it I pray
 How in the world can I love you?
 When you're so, so, so far away
 Send me your picture baby
 Oh send it my dear
 Oh so that near to hold it
 I wanna pretend that you're near
 Send me loving, baby
 Oh send it I pray
