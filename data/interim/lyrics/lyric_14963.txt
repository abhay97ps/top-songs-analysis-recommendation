Six o'clock in the morning
Still sitting here pouring
The drinks 'til they're gone
We did everything together
Would have done it forever
How did we go wrong?
I know that what goes up
Comes down
I didn't know you hit the ground
Why'd you have to give it up?
Well, you were just a little girl
I'll never look into your blue eyes
Fly high, Michelle
We did it just for a good time
A misunderstood time
We lived with the fear
I wish we still could have done things
And not overhung things
I wish you were here
And now I'll live a life
Of could-have-beens
Until new life begins
Why'd you have to give it up?
Well, you were just a little girl
I'll never look into your blue eyes
Fly high, Michelle
I'll say another prayer tonight
That I'll see you in the light
You have to give it up
Well, you were just a little girl
I'll never look into your blue eyes
Fly high, Michelle
You have to give it up
Well, you were just a little girl
I'll never look into your blue eyes
Fly high, Michelle
Fly high, Michelle
Fly high, Michelle
Fly high, Michelle
