I couldn't believe the
Night you walked away
Left me alone to play
A fool's charade
And here I am
Still reaching out for you
Anticipating, awaiting
Your next move
Holding on, holding on
Trying hard to keep you
Am I wrong being strong
Don't leave me holding on
Feel like I'm
Falling from a fantasy
'Cause I am lost
In your reality
You said you knew
You couldn't give enough
For what we had
Was all I needed, love
Holding on, holding on
Trying hard to keep you
Breaking through, touching you
Don't leave me holding on
Holding on, holding on
Trying hard to keep you
Am I wrong being strong
Don't leave me holding on
Holding on
Holding on, holding on
Holding on, holding on
