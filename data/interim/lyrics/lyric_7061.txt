Whoo-oooh-oooh!
Come on now!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Whooo-oooh!
One day I took you to the zoo
And I did all the tricks for you that the monkeys wouldn't do
I played the part of a clown just to have you put me down
But I still love 
So go ahead, pin the tail on the donkey 
Go ahead, girl and call me a fool 
Go ahead, pin the tail on the donkey 
'Cause one day the tail will be pinned on you 
Go ahead girl!
It started back when we were young
Pigtails and bubblegum
Now it's the junior prom
But still you won't dance with me
Leave me standing like a tree 'til time to take you home 
So go ahead, pin the tail on the donkey 
Go ahead, girl and call me a fool 
Go ahead, pin the tail on the donkey 
'Cause one day the tail will be pinned on you 
Go ahead girl!
Better move!
Better move on!
Baby , baby 
Baby , baby 
Baby , baby 
Ooh baby , baby 
Baby , baby 
Baby , baby 
Whoa-oh!
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah girl!
Come on girl!
I lay my heart down at your feet
Hoping someday you'll retreat
And return your love to me
I'll wear a dunce-cap on my head
Like it was a crown instead
'Cause I'll always love
So go ahead, pin the tail on the donkey 
Go ahead, girl and call me a fool 
Go ahead, pin the tail on the donkey 
'Cause one day the tail will be pinned on you 
Go ahead girl!
So go ahead, pin the tail on the donkey 
Go ahead, girl and call me a fool 
Go ahead, pin the tail on the donkey 
'Cause one day the tail will be pinned on you
