And there are rumours, baby, yeah
It's another girl, yeah
I worked my fingers
Down to the bone, yeah
To try to make you
A happy home, yeah
So now you're leaving me
This is the thanks I get, baby

Worked 'em down down to the bone, yeah
To try to make you a happy home
Babe, baby, babe

Makes me feel so bad
