I don't wanna be a loser
I don't wanna have a broken heart
Oh I don't wanna be a loser
I don't want another girl to tear us apart
Tell me, what can I do to keep from losin' you
Cause I could never live without your love
I don't wanna be, no I don't wanna be a loser
I don't wanna hear you say goodbye
Oh I don't wanna be a loser
End up with a million tears that I'll have to cry
Oh I'll fight with all my might, kiss you & hold you tight
Until you say I'm right; I don't wanna be a loser in love
I don't wanna be a loser
I don't want another girl to tear us apart
Oh please tell me, what can I do to keep from losin' you
Cause I could never live without your love
A loser in love, in love, I don't wanna be a loser in love
Oh I don't wanna be a loser in love
I don't wanna be a loser in love
