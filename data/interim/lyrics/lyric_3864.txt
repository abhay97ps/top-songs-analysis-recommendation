Run when I say
Somebody's calling you
You'd better run
Run when I say
You'd better run
Run when I say
I feel like my time has long gone
Long gone
Well now goodbye false pretender
Lord, I cannot wait for You
For the Bible declares
You're goin' to Heaven, Lord
What the Bible declares You do
Run when I say
Somebody's calling you
You'd better run
Run when I say
You'd better run
Run when I say
I feel like my time has long gone
Long gone
Long gone
Well, I met a false pretender
Whose head was bending, Lord
I met him in the evening
He was headed down that long lonesome road
Run when I say
Somebody's calling you
You'd better run
Run when I say
You'd better run
Get away from here
Somebody's calling you
I feel like my time has long gone
Long gone, long gone
