Where are the dreams
That we once had?
This is the time
To bring them back
What were the promises
Caught on the tips of our tongues?
Do we forget or forgive?
There's a whole other life
Waiting to be lived when
One day we're brave enough
To talk with conviction of the heart
And down your streets
I've walked alone
As if my feet were not my own
Such is the path I chose
Doors I have opened and closed
I'm tired of living this life
Fooling myself, believing we're right when
I've never given love
With any conviction of the heart
One with the earth
With the sky
One with everything in life
I believe we'll survive
If we only try
How long must we all wait to change
This world bound in chains that we live in
To know what it is to forgive and be forgiven?
Too many years of taking now
Isn't it time to stop somehow?
Air that's too angry to breathe
Water our children can't drink
You've heard it
Hundreds of times
You say you're aware
Believe, and you care
But do you care enough
Where's your conviction of the heart?
One with the Earth
With the sky
One with everything in life
I believe it will start
With conviction of the heart
With the Earth
With the sky
One with everything in life
I believe it will start
With conviction of the heart
One Earth
One sky
Only one world
Only one chance
For one life
When will live
One child
One dream
And only one life
Give her one chance
For one life
When will we live
Only one Earth
Only one sky
Only one world
We've only got one chance
To live in one life
I believe it's only gonna start
When we begin with
Some conviction of the heart
