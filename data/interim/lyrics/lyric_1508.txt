It's too late to worry
I broke your heart dear, I was untrue
And now I've lost you, what can I do
I hope you're happy baby for I'll get by
Too late to worry, too blue to cry
Our love has ended, you say we're through
You found a new love that's so good to you
I'll always love you as days go by
It's too late to worry, worry, worry
I'm too late to cry, oh yeah
