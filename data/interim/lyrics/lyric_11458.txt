Hey
Yeah
When I was young
I'd listen to the radio
Waiting for my favorite songs
And when they played I'd sing along
It made me smile, yeah
Those were such happy times
And not so long ago
How I wonder where they've gone
But they're back again
Just like a long lost friend
All the songs I love so well and every
Sha-la-la-la
Whoa, whoa
Sha-la-la-la
Whoa, whoa
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That we started to sing, so fine
When they get to the part
When she's breaking his heart
It could really make me cry
Just like before it's yesterday once more, mmm
Looking back on how it was
And years gone by
The good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed, ooh
And it was the songs
Of love that I would sing to you then
I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies still sound good to me
As they melt the years away and every
Sha-la-la-la
Whoa, whoa
Sha-la-la-la
Whoa, whoa
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That we started to sing, so fine
Oh, when they get to the part
When she's breaking his heart
It could really make me cry
Just like before it's yesterday once more, girl
Nothing remains the same
Life is a constant change
Nothing remains the same
Life is a constant change
I'm looking back on what used to be
Uh-huh and how it affected me
Do you remember the way
You showed me love?
Oh, I'm looking back on the love we made
It wasn't a masquerade
It was a long, a long time ago
Don't you know?
Nothing remains the same
Life is a constant change
Nothing remains the same
Life is a constant change
Oh, I'm looking back on what used to be
And what you meant to me, girl
We both, we both never thought it never end
And I'm looking back and it's nice to be
So filled with the memories
Of all the love, all the love we shared
In the past and oh, no
Nothing remains the same
Life is a constant change
Nothing remains the same
Life is a constant change
Sha-la-la-la
Whoa, whoa
Sha-la-la-la
Whoa, whoa
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
We started to sing, so fine, oh, it was
When they get to the part
When she's breaking his heart
It really makes me cry
Just like before it's yesterday
Sha-la-la-la
Whoa, whoa
Sha-la-la-la
Whoa, whoa
Shing-a-ling-a-ling, we started to sing
Every time
Oh, when they get to the part
When she's breaking his heart
It really makes me cry
Just like before it's yesterday
Sha-la-la-la, whoa, whoa
Sha-la-la-la, whoa, whoa
Shing-a-ling-a-ling
We started to
