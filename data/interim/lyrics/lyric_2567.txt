 Whatcha calling my name?
 It's my one big thing
 Whatcha want to know?
 Ain't ya ever heard me blow?
Can you play that thing? 
 Make you dance and sing
Aw I'm gonna blow now
Now we've been searching for a long long time
To find a way to leave our trouble behind
We've been down under and we've sure been blue
Come on and play it like we know you can do
 What'cha calling me for?
 You wanna dance some more?
 Everything's alright
 I can play all night!
 Do the Monkey Watusi
 Or play a little bluesy
Ha ha, we're gonna wail now
 What'cha calling me for?
 Wanna dance some more
 And everything's alright
 I can play all night!
 Do the Monkey Watusi
Or you can play a little bluesy 
Aw, everybody's gonna wail...
