I get confused
When I'm tired
But the last time I saw you
We were in a room with sunshine in my eyes
And water on the floor
I watched you float away
Take me with you
A long time ago
We were walking around
We were fooling around
In the garden
In the garden
I saw you turn around
And still you turn around
My eyes are playing tricks on me
How I miss you
I could be your lover
Chained under the water
Under the water
I could be standing on a ladder
To make it easier
To make it easier
Your eyes are colored stone
You've got an earring
Through your nose
Your chains are made of gold
I don't think they would float
But floating is what you do
That is beautiful
That is you
I could be your lover
Chained under the water
Under the water
I could be swimming out to save you
No one ever saves you
To make it easier
I'll be your lover
Under the water
I could be standing to make it easier
I could be your lover
Chained under the water
Under the water
I could be swimming out to save you
No one ever saves you
To make it easier
