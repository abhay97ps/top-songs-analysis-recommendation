Soon it will be time to go
I don't want to leave, I guess you know
Maybe something new will come up
And I can come home for just a few more days
Get off this two lane highway
Is going my way, moving fast
Two lane highway
Is taking me home, home at last
You don't want me sleeping in
You turn around, I'm back again
I guess this time I'm really gone
But it don't seem right, I've been up all night
On this two lane highway
Is going my way, moving fast
Two lane highway
Is taking me home, home at last
Two lane highway
Is going my way, moving fast
Two lane highway
Is taking me home, home at last
Two lane highway
Going my way, moving fast
Two lane highway
Taking me home, home at last
Is taking me home, home at last
Oh, is taking me home, home at last
