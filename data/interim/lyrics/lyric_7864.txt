In the '70s there was long hair
There were left-over hippies everywhere
And I should know 'cause I was there
In the '70s they had prayer mats
There were stringy beards and floppy hats
And men looked like Jesus in crushed velvet flares
And in the '70s there were Osmonds
There were lots of Osmonds
There were lots of little Osmonds
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
In the '70s there were skinheads
There were bovver boys and brummie reds and
Greasers, grebos, Judge and Natty Dread
In the '70s there were chopper bikes
Oxford bags and kung fu fights
Trojan sounds, Lee Perry dub
And in the '70s there were Osmonds
There were lots of Osmonds
There were lots of little Osmonds
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
In the '70s there were lots of bombs
They blew my home town up
And lots of people were killed
On the news the relatives cried
Everyone knew someone who'd died
They'll never forget it for the rest of their lives
And all around the people say
"We hate the IRA and we asked for justice but it never came"
And in the '70s there were Osmonds
There were lots of Osmonds
There were lots of little Osmonds
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
In the '70s there was Hughie Green
Lieutenant Pigeon hit the scene
Paper Lace and Candlewick Green
Mouldy Old Dough, Chicory Tip
Gilbert O and Hurricane Smith
Billy Don't Be a Hero, hey David rock on!
In the '70s Lesley Whittle died
The Black Panther went inside
And Jeremy Thorpe, oh he resigned
And at school the girls would bring
A thousand volts of Holt and sing
Hey There Lonely Girl, Impossible Love
And in the '70s there were Osmonds
There were lots of Osmonds
There were lots of little Osmonds
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
In the '70s the rollers came
And Best retired from the game
And Cassidy quit, oh what a shame!
In the '70s I was just a kid
Still knew what it was all about
I soaked it in now it's all dripping out
And in the '70s there were Osmonds
There were lots of Osmonds
There were lots of little Osmonds
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
Osmonds, now
Oh now there were lots of paper roses
Yeah there were lots of crazy horses
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
