Welcome all to the cerebellum celebration
Top of the chain of food a couple of zany dudes
Whoever they blazing through the vegetation
Stop complaining you cannot contain em
Maneuver the block got payment fuck an invitation
Kickin' hinges in, I go and get the pen and slip the venom in your medication
Kept' em waiting
But not for long, drop the bomb shit and fuck your Soccer mom, Quick in VIP but see believe me, none of my niggas furtive you we just feed em proper long dick
Give it a bit and watch em start to catch the feelings
Simple arithmetic, you aughta' respect the villain
Give me a different bitch that I can forget in a minute but I'ma forget her anyways if that shit ain't
That's who it is
New Strange with our backs to the wind
New bane kill the bat no revenge
New flame in the sack for my friends
Do blaze give it back go again
Few days on yo back for my kin
Pain like a nigga back from the gym. 
You ain't doing shit but sittin' 
You lucky cause the way you catchin' heat that you could bet it's me and from the Pitcher's mound
Throw the quickest out and make an example of these little handful of rappers that remain
You can blame Insane, he went and got the illest hide your function
Now nobody fucking with it if it ain't

Why do must some of them niggas who normally wanna go see
Drippin' a 9 millimeter but nigga I fill it with heat
Niggas you wouldn't believe the way that they murder a nigga
They put em inside of a box in the back of they Chevy Caprice
Nigga whats up with the beef
Women they fuckin' with me
Making a couple of kids when they be fuckin' a bitch
Givin' the women the dick and they lovin' it, really they suckin' and suckin' it, that's your ho, she is slut of the week
Brain, brain when a nigga blast guns
Brain, brain a nigga wish I had one
Give her lobotomy when they be riding this nigga
Everything I do is sicker than the last one
How the fuck is all you out of bucks?
Niggas hot as fuck when you ain't never smashed nothin'
I be fuckin hella hoes nigga never know you new bitch could be my last one
Bangin' a pistol like my name was Pistol Pete
In the ville like Nash no Tennessee
Even in November I go trick or treat
Knocking then I smoke 'em like a swisher sweet
Who as sick as we, in the industry
Ain't nobody fucking with our infantry
Murder everybody here's the missing feet
Poke a nigga bitch, make her send a tweet
Brainsick, I know you feeling this shit
Michael Vick flow I'm killing this bitch
Niggas ain't believe me, now they prolly see me tryna' fuck with me drippin' this shit
Packing a pistol grip and I ain't gon' let it
Niggas faker than a rhinestone bet it
Ain't nobody in the game wanna see the brain nigga tell 'em ISO said it

I kill 'em whenever they want the heat on 'em
So many people I will teach you over the rail and beat you grabbin' a bitch and skeet on 'em
Run away off and they never wanna be optimistic
Got two bitches one for me and one for you
Ready to switch and get in a different shit it's been about time just fightin' us with the bullshit under you
Tell her they awesome gosh I wish I could've been there
The nigga that's spitting the semen on your chin
Then properly take it and rub it up on your skin
Stick it then putting the time to turn it on again
Who wanna go mano a mano with Tony Soprano, I hit 'em with syllable rippin' a nigga a brand new asshole
They go wolf but bring a Ted all they want, I'm murdering niggas for shit that's hotter than Tabasco. 
Brain Brain
I'm coming to eat your mothafucking brain
I hope you choke on a chicken bone, chocolate milk, chickens, and some chains
Summon a demon and want me to pick up the piece and let me off the leash and I ain't got no kinda sense
I run up on niggas with diesel type of trucks and tearin' bitches up by hangin' em over the wire fence

I'm the little voice inside your brain
Been one of the best well my venom I cannot contain
Sick as centipede and so when I refrain
Sever the poison I consider him off the chain
Gobble 'em up I puff a blunt until I'm numb I payed this haters no attention given 'em none
You can see I'm by my lonely homies swarm me bring an army you will never see the sun 
Brainsick, now I'm not the same shit you would listen to is basic yada yada rappin' wolfing bullshit
See that penmanship we grip as innovation
In the darkness reaching for the light-up put in my tunic room but I will survive
My pursuance movin' what am I doing
I conclude the voodoo, I allude is in the mind
I'm choppin' the rhythm, I kill 'em, I fill 'em up with venom sick of these sticks of a villa but hit 'em up with that weapon
Vengeful devil
Open the mental levels all my enemies better be off of my momentum
And I'm a man is why
Suffer the consequences thinking that maybe I will suffer the opposites
When I went in for comin' opponents on the mic, controlled 'em, hold 'em up for sick-opotamus
Y'all don't wanna listen to me fine talk
I'm a lethal weapon intertwined it with the instrumental till the gun line boss
Give me a minute, the weather is offset I can climb a mountain, suffer the elements if I am surrounded
Pick up the sword before the war is waiting mortars, rippin' em up enough, the judgment is too cloudy

Shouts out to the brainiacs gettin' sick in the buildin'
Makin' a killin' off this independent music that we makin', why?
Cause our brains are penning
Tell the maniac I'll make him feel at home
Half of the nation that are sick are just the villains
Time to put the gauge to your face and they paint the ceilin' with your fuckin uh... 
Yea, I'm lovin the fact that we can never be defeated
See the sweetness leave us squeamish, we elitists, leave these leeches eatin' pieces out the helix
Since a fetus, I've been genius, I've been stickin' my penis in this game
She a bitch, once she get it, she just need it fiendin' for us so we feed her this 
Here's the brain train, choo choo
Mayday, better shoo shoo and make way, when we move through
Doin' voodoo, yea, you'll die and I'm rippin' your mental up like 2 ply
When the noose tie, watch your shoes fly, a result of when I use my 
Brain, killin' the game, ain't got no competition
Droppin' bombs on the opposition
Goin' against the grain with the brain to distract the system
Yea we rock the mass and we got the gas and they copycats are contradiction
Let 'em watch it, mimic, copy, gimmick
Only one cat got the sickest, it's the brain!

Murder with a mic of a syllable lyrical rhythm I take em all whenever the mic is on 
I could tongue wrestle with a python
Some of them cyclones so my mind gone
You're like my song'll make you bygones
Suicide bombs'll take your life gone
Take a parson to a pipe bomb
And say goodbye mom the step of life gone
Murder with the pen burning through the skin
Chopping motherfuckers up into vegetables
Thought you would begin with the brains that hit the skin
But at Brainsick shit we chop impeccable
If your compassion-al but don't say shit
Just let the blood drip to the pavement
Just needed a fucked up mind to go play with
And tell the world that i'm fucking brainsick
Doing it with the wrong but the ruth's i can't slaughter
Dumping it with the pump for the babies to the father
Brainsick in momentum with this other with a pencil
But I'm salivating therefore we're not gonna be fucking bothered
Chopping up with my dynamo family and my son
Trynna pocket the cards and find out whether that have to do with god
Complicated chopper with a drive fuck said the doctor
We don't fuck around so I could fucking make it fun

Really need the Brain
I'm so insane
Come from the plain
Walk through my field
Lost in the rain, off of the strange
All for the cane
Pop another pill
Man I think I need my medication
Head is vacant
I'mma steady patient, and this bread that I'm chasing is my dedication
This haze I'm blazing, my meditation 
Come for the freeze
Hum for the dog
Come for the meat
Come for the heart
Run better get a gun
Let us spark drums, gonna get the drum I like
I'm all hate bitch, get yo face palmed
Shape-shift nigga Shang Tsung
Your soul is mine
Yes, I'm holding mine
Sing the same song till they came home 
Yeah you know the game
Guard is where the cane
Talking to the flames
All of that remain
Darkness in the pain
Balling in the game
To the hall of fame
Mama said "nigga stay off drugs"
Then I wouldn't of sighed
Take a number line
Probably scared yourself looking in my mind
Bad for my health, but I'm feeling fine
Another way that I sing loddy doddy
While making her body probably off the molly
Think I shoulda let her slap in the lobby
Now shorty wanting to kick it like Miyagi
ISO I think I need another bottle
I go wait, super off the throttle
Die slow bitch nigga that's the motto
Been a lunatic ever since I lost my

Hey Sam, I'm just giving you a call
Cause you know I've been listening to your music all day
Every day
Wake up to it
Go to sleep to it
I just want us to know that I appreciate it man
Your music has been an inspiration, it's been motivation
It helps me get through the good times, it helps me get through the bad times
It's a prescription to me
It's a drug
And been there for me when I really needed it
You know when I finally came home it's the first music I listen to
So I just wanna say I appreciate you for sharing your music with me
And I appreciate you for making music the way you make it
Keeping it real
I love you Sam
Bye
