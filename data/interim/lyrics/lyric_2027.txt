And I’m here to let you both know
I've selected both of you
At Anarchy Rulz it will be Slayer vs Jaques Dudley

But tonight i wanna see who's fit to be champion
A nice filter test
Jaques Dudley will take on Ruckus next
Slayer you will take on Golden Bryce
And here's why this is interesting
If you can both win your match. I’ll add that as a point for the iron man match. So getting the win is important

Troy Clausen comes out Jaques don't worry. It happens huh. No negative points. It happens.
Ruckus grabs the mic “hey, i just beat your hand picked champ. Why don't we make this match. A triple threat iron man match. *crowd pop*
Troy Clausen: huh Ruckus i don't think i could add a tag team into a world title match. I can't have you and Siaka running around co-champs. Ridiculous

Hey Clausen come outhere boy. I just beat ya mans. And I'm getting curved. Fuck this shit. Throws Joeys headphones. Ruckus exits thru the crowd

Interview

GG in the crowd
Romeo
I hate to ruin the fashion show but i gotta day this whole bit you runnin with is trash
As a matter of fact i think you are everything wrong with this company
I always thought the X stood for extreme but if you ask me you are the softest wrestler I've ever seen
Romeo starts going off
You are a peasant
I'm the reason people watch
I'm the taste maker of professional wrestling
You are just a pissant camera guy that i made famous
If you aren't as much of a bitch as you look
*GG pulls out Janice 
I wanna make a challenge
I've never even seen you get physical in that ring
I'm talking barbed wire
Fire
Thumb tacks
Romeo if you wanna prove to me that you ain't soft
Then at Anarchy Rulz you'll take me on in a Queens City death match
Romeo: I'm not gonna give you the pleasure sweeetheart
GG: Romeo, you couldn't even beat me
A no name cameraman in a 7 minute match
I think you have a lot to prove
I think you know why your old tag team partner is in the title hunt and you had to make your own title to stay relevant
GG: Now if i can get some crowd participation
Pay per champion
Chant starts
