These red roses damn near turn to ashes 
If I keep it real, you won't understand it
These dirty blogs got your mind damaged 
I'll walk a million miles to see you happy
I hope she don't think that I think that she some kinda ho 
I don't care, that just lets me know that
She knows what she wants, yeah
Baby, I won't judge 
Freak, freak, freak, freak
Now I'm sure that 
She knows what she wants, yeah
Freak, freak, freak, freak
I ain't gonna hold you, baby, I like what I see
That print in them sweatpants got me weak off in my knees
I've been thinking 'bout you since we met at No I.D.'s
If you're free tonight, I think that you should come see me
 Uh, oh
Don't be scared of my aggression
 Oh
Just don't get the wrong impression
I hope she don't think that I think that she some kinda ho
Freak, freak, freak, freak 
I don't care, that just lets me know that
She knows what she wants, yeah
Baby, I won't judge 
Freak, freak, freak, freak
Now I'm sure that she knows what she wants, yeah
Freak, freak, freak, freak
You like the way I wink at you?
I can't never have a hater bone inside my body 
I just like it better when my girl do her pilates 
I wanna dress you up and have you fresher than a stylist 
Think about any drama when your body traumatizing 
You so caught up in the hype, you coulda easily been my wife 
I see the way your friends look, they already thinkin' I'm sheisty 
They misunderstood me when they say I'm Jesus Christ 
I just want you to worship me, I like what I like 
I'll feed you to the wolves if you don't talk to me nice
They gon' try to crucify me 
They think we worship 'luminati 
I take my heart and I go hide it
Oh-oh-oh-oh
After all, I just hope you don't think that I'm some kind of ho 
I don't know, he just makes me feel like
He knows what he wants, yeah
Freak, freak, freak, freak
Baby, I won't judge
Freak, freak, freak, freak
Oh-oh-oh, oh-woah
Now I'm sure that he knows what he wants, yeah
Yeah, I chose happiness over everything
Over anything and it's everything
Yeah, happiness over everything
Over anything and it's everything to me
