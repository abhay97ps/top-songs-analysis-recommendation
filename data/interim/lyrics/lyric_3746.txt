Six AM ain’t no time to write a song
When the moon’s still up but the night is gone
And the muse she is fast asleep
Where I guess, I oughta be
Hold back that sunrise just a little bit more
I’m not quite ready to feel its warmth
My love comes to me when I’m cold
Into my heart with all the rest of the ghosts
Go down Moses, shine your light
Oh, I will not fight, I will not fight
Go down Moses, shine your light
No, I will not fight, anymore tonight
Somewhere down in Bozeman where the bachelors hang
They tell their stories with equal pride and shame
Just like soldiers at the end of a war
Trying to look happy to be out of work
Go down Moses, shine your light
Oh, I will not fight, I will not fight
Go down Moses, shine your light
No, I will not fight, anymore tonight
Go down Moses, shine your light
Oh, I will not fight, I will not fight
Go down Moses, shine your light
No, I will not fight, anymore tonight
Pour it all, pour it all into my eyes
No, I will not fight, anymore tonight
No, I will not fight, anymore tonight
No, I will not fight, anymore tonight
No, I will not fight, anymore tonight
