Wind in your hair, sun on your skin
You're looking good, girl, all over again
Hey there, Miss Brown
I want you to know, I love you
You're brown as the sand, you're soft as the shore
You're leaving me hungry and crying for more
Ooh, we, baby, girl, you're such a score
And I want you to know that
You know what, girl?
I love you
I bet you didn't know that, girl
You didn't know that
I need you
Right now, baby, right now, baby
And I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes
Lips soft and tender, ready to speak
Her voice says, I love you  and its making me weak
Hey there, little girl, may I just say, I love you
Tell her how you feel, Rick
Love is the brown skin girl in my eyes
Think it's time that I told you, don't you realize?
You're such a queen, woman, you're such a prize
And I want you to know that
You know what, girl
I love you
And I bet you didn't know that, girl
You didn't know that
I need you
Right now, baby, right now, baby
And I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes
I love you, ebony eyes, oh, my
I need you
Woman, I need you
Oh, and I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes
I really love you, woman, I love you 
Ebony eyes, oh, my
I wanna say that I need you 
And I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes
Ebony eyes
Ebony eyes, oh, my
Ebony eyes
Girl, and I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes
Love you 
Ebony eyes
