See you when you come over
You're still feeling hazy, I'm lazy
Let's stay in until it's over
Don’t book that Uber
Girl, come lay on my shoulder
It's alright, girl you know you can stay the night
Girl, when you come over
When you come over, come over
Come over to my place, yeah, we can get it kickin'
Cook you up a little something in the kitchen
We can Netflix and chill, baby girl why you flicking?
'Cause I know the only reason you here is for dicking
She moving slow-mo', she rides this D like a pro-roll
Up and down she goes like a yo-yo
But I don't know though
'Cause she's always on the gram, at her man
Popping up like a promo
I got her covered in her Davinci
I stay dripping in Prada, she call me daddy like a father
But then she telling me she miss me
I'm spending figures up on 
Girl, you can see me after
She calling fleek up, I'm tryna keep up
Girl I'm outside, come put your feet up
Put you on a jet, let's go out

See you when you come over
You're still feeling hazy, I'm lazy
Let's stay in until it's over
Don’t book that Uber
Girl, come lay on my shoulder
It's alright, girl you know you can stay the night
Girl, when you come over
When you come over, come over
Come over and relax, I don't want a girl but she got me doin' laps
I see you up on Insta, you a queen and that's facts
But she knows I wanna dig her, so I'm gonna double tap
But this is crunch time, can I see you on your lunch time?
We can take a trip like a 
Come, let's fine dine, she's sippin' white wine
Body like a goddess and your face is lookin' so fine
Uh, but don't think I have forgotten
'Bout them times, where them boys tried to slide
But you'd block 'em, you want them shoes with the spikes, so you got 'em
Then I spank her in the lubes, now, that's what I call a red bottom
Ayy, and she knows she's looking sexy
We riding on the waves, I ain't  on a jet ski
So when I ask her to come over, she let's me
Because she gets me
See you when you come over
You're still feeling hazy, I'm lazy
Let's stay in until it's over

Girl, come lay on my shoulder
It's alright, girl you know you can stay the night

See you when you come over
