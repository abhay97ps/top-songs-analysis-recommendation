Young wings can fly
Young wings can fly
Young wings can fly
Higher than you know
Just like I found you
Along the way
We can find a little more happiness
With each new day
So don't be afraid
To hold me close
And never
Never let me go
Young wings can fly
Young wings can fly
Young wings can fly
Higher than you know
At every crossroads
Follow your heart
Believe me
I've been in love with you
Right from the start
A love such as ours
Is something that
We never, never will outgrow
Young wings can fly
Young wings can fly
Young wings can fly
Higher than you know
So don't be afraid
To tell the world
Just where
Where you want to go
Young wings can fly
Young wings can fly
Young wings can fly
Higher than you know
