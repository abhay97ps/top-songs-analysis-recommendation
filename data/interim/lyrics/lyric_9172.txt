When I walk down the streets
See the people who stop and stare and say
Haven't I seen that face somewhere a long time ago
When I walk down the streets
See the stranger who says 'why, hi'
With a 'how you goin', buddy'
When you walked on by I thought I'd say hallo
They say: haven't I seen your face before
Weren't you the boy that used to live next door
Weren't you on television every night
Haven't I seen you round
Take a look at me, I'm yesterday's hero
Yesterday's hero, that's all I'll be
Take a look at me, I'm yesterday's hero
And yesterday's hero is all that I'm gonna be if I don't get together
Make a new start and be somebody better
All that I'll be if I don't get together now
When you walk down the streets
If you know me, then pass me by
If you wonder what I'm doing
Don't ask me why I don't read the news
When you walk down the streets
If you're sorry then don't feel bad
If you followed my story
Then just be glad you ain't in my shoes
Because haven't you seen my face before
Yes, I was the boy who used to live next door
Yes, I was on television every night
Haven't you seen me round
Take a look at me, I'm yesterday's hero
Yesterday's hero, that's all I'll be
Take a look at me, I'm yesterday's hero
And yesterday's hero is all that I'm gonna be if I don't get together
Make a new start and be somebody better
All that I'll be if I don't get together now
Yesterday's hero, yesterday's hero
Yesterday's hero, yesterday's hero
