I held you down for the longest
And I was there through all of your darkest moments
Feels just like yesterday when we were homeless
Gotchu some bread and start treating me bogus
Talking 'bout you wanted something new 
Like I wasn't good enough for you 
Guess you done caught you a case of amnesia
Maybe you should take a look in your rear view
'Cause obviously you forgot all the times that I held you when you cried
And don't you remember that even if you was in the wrong I stood by your side?
No I guess not, I guess not, 'cause you let them thots take my spot
Congratulations to you, what you wanted is what you got now 
So you don't gotta worry 'bout me 
You made it clear that you're unhappy 
Go ahead and have your fun now 
Just remember what goes around, comes around
You don't gotta worry 'bout me 
You made it clear that you're unhappy 
Go ahead and have your fun now 
Just remember what goes around, comes around
I remember when you said that you could have somebody better
And I can't even lie to you it really messed my head up
Had me lookin' in the mirror disgusted with myself
Wishin' that I looked like someone else
Like the girls you liked on Instagram 
And you really had the nerve to call me insecure
Maybe it wasn't you
Maybe it's true I didn't know my worth 
Maybe, maybe I should've loved me first 
Maybe, maybe I should've loved me first
So you don't gotta worry 'bout me 
You made it clear that you're unhappy 
Go ahead and have your fun now 
Just remember what goes around, comes around
You don't gotta worry 'bout me 
You made it clear that you're unhappy 
Go ahead and have your fun now 
Just remember what goes around, comes around 
Around, around,  around
What goes around it comes around, ay
Around, around,  around
What goes around it comes around, yeah
Around, around,  around
Ooh
