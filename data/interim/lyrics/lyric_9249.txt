He's a friend of mine
He's a friend of mine
There was a time, I didn't believe at all
Then one day, I had to give him a call
There I was lying flat on my back
The doctor said, I had a heart attack
I said a prayer, before I went to sleep
Next day you'll know, I was back up on my feet
Oh
He's a friend of mine
I want everybody to know it
Yeah, He is
He is a friend of mine
I don't say much, but I speak to Him every day
He's always there, to help me find my way
I don't deny, our close association
He helps me out, of any situation
If you read the book, of Revelations
You'll find that He's, your only salvation
Oh
He's a friend of mine
I want everybody to know
He's a friend of mine
He is a friend of mine
I don't deny, our close association
He helps me out, of any situation
If you read the book, of Revelations
You'll find that He's your only salvation
He's a friend of mine
I want everybody to know
He is a friend of mine
A friend
Oooh
Everybody's friend
Everyday
In every way
Every way, a friend of mine
He is a friend of mine
He's in my heart
He is
He's in my mind
All the time
He's all I need
Don't you need a friend?
Don't you need a friend
He is a friend of mine
