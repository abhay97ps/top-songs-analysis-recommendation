Here I go again, it's all right
Full moons grown to brighten the night
I've been lookin', now seein' the light
It's sure shinin' bright, yea
Well, honey, believe in it, it bein' free mm
Nothin' to love's like nothin' to be
You've got once a lifetime
To see just how much of your dream
Honey, to feel like fallin' in love, just to know
Honey, to feel like fallin' in love
Turnin' home, runnin' free as the wind
Stretchin' my stride, wanna hold you again
Well, it's time to be taken in
Let me know where I've been, yea
Honey, to feel like fallin' in love, just to know
Don't you know what it feels like fallin' in love
Honey to feel like fallin' in love
Turnin' home, runnin' free as the wind
Stretchin' my stride, wanna hold you again
Well it's time to be taken in
Let me know where I've been
Thought I said
Just let me feel like fallin' in love
Don't you know what it feels like fallin' in love
Honey to feel like fallin' in love
Honey, to feel like fallin' in love, just to know
Don't you know what it feels like fallin' in love
Honey to feel like fallin' in love
