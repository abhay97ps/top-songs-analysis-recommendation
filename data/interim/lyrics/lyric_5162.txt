Dr. Gall: God, there are still more of them now!
Domin: Robots?
Dr. Gall: Yes. There’s a wall of them standing at the garden fence. Why are they so silent? It’s repulsive. A siege of silence.
Domin: I wish I knew what they were waiting for. It must be about to start any moment. We’ve lost, Gall.
Alquist: What is that that Helena’s playing?
Domin: I don’t know. She’s practising something new.
Alquist: Ah, so she’s still practising?
Dr. Gall: Listen Domin, we made a crucial mistake.
Domin:  What mistake?
Dr. Gall: We made the faces of the robots too much like one another. There are a hundred thousand faces staring up at us and they’re all the same. A hundred thousand expressionless bubbles. This is like a bad dream.
Domin: If each of them were different . . .
Dr. Gall: Then the sight of them wouldn’t be so ghastly.  At least they’re not armed yet!
Domin: Hm. -  I just wish I knew what it was they’re unloading from the Amelia.
Dr. Gall: Let’s just hope it’s not weapons.
Fabry: Excuse me. Hallemeier, put the wire down.
Hallemeier:  Ouf, that was hard work. Anything new?
Dr. Gall: Nothing. We’re completely surrounded.
Hallemeier: Well lads, we’ve got the stairs and the corridors barricaded. Is there any water there? Ah, here it is. 
Dr. Gall: What’s this wire for, Fabry?
Fabry: You’ll see, you’ll see. Are there some scissors?
Dr. Gall: Where would we find scissors? 
Hallemeier:  Hell, there are even more of them now! Have a look at this!
Dr. Gall: Would nail scissors be alright?
Fabry: Give them to me. 
Hallemeier:  You haven’t got a very nice view here, Domin. It seems . . . to have . . . the feel of death about it.
Fabry: Ready!
Dr. Gall: What is?
Fabry: The connection. Now we can put electric current through the whole of the garden fence. Anyone who touches it has had it. At least, as long as there are still some of our own down there.
Dr. Gall: Where?
Fabry: In the generator room. At least, I hope . . .  Thank God for that - they’re there. And they’re working.  As long as that light works we’re alright.
Hallemeier:  Those are good barricades, Fabry. Now what’s that that Helena’s playing? 
Fabry: Mind out, Bus! Mind those wires!
Dr. Gall: Hello, what’s this you’re bringing us?
Busman:  These are the important books, children. I think I’d better get the accounts done before . . . before. . . . well I don’t mean to wait until the new year before it’s sorted out. Now what’s all this you’ve got here?  It’s all very quiet down there.
Dr. Gall: Can’t you see anything?
Busman: Nothing apart from a large blue area, it’s as if it was strewn with poppy seeds.
Dr. Gall: Those are the robots.
Busman: Ah, so that’s what it is. Pity I can’t see them. 
Domin: Forget about that, Busman; the robots are unloading weapons from the Amelia.
Busman: So what? What am I supposed to do about it?
Domin: There’s nothing we can do to stop them.
Busman: So just let me get on with my calculation. 
Fabry: It isn’t all over yet, Domin. We’ve put two hundred volts in through the garden fence and. . . .
Domin: Stop! The Ultimus has just turned its guns in our direction.
Dr. Gall: Who’s doing that?
Domin: The robots on the Ultimus.
Fabry: Hm, well in that case of course, . . . then of course, . . . then we’ve had it, lads. Those robots are trained soldiers.
Dr. Gall: That means that we . . .
Domin: Yes. Irrevocably.
Dr. Gall: This is just the same old evil as Europe has always committed. They just couldn’t leave their damned politics alone and so they taught the robots to go to war, they took the robots and turned them into soldiers and that was a crime against humanity.
Alquist: The crime was making the robots in the first place.
Domin: What’s that?
Alquist: The crime was making the robots!
Domin: No Alquist, I don’t feel sorry for what I did, even now.
Alquist: Not even now?
Domin: Not even now, on the last day of civilisation. It was a magnificent undertaking.
Busman:  Three hundred and sixteen million.
Domin:  Alquist, this is our last hour; it’s almost as if we were speaking from the other world already. Alquist, putting an end to the slavery of labour was not a bad dream. Work humiliates, anyone who’s forced to do it is made small. The drudgery of labour is something dirty and murderous. Oh, Alquist, the burden of work was too much for us, life was too heavy for us, and to remove this burden. . . .
Alquist: That was never the dream of either of the Rossums; old Rossum was thinking of Godless rubbish and young Rossum thought of nothing but making millions. And it’s not the dream of RUR shareholders either; their only dream was their dividend. And it’s because of their concern for their profits that mankind is about to perish.
Domin:  The Devil take their dividends! Do you think I’d have spent an hour of my time for their sakes?  I did it for myself, d’you hear? For my own satisfaction! I wanted mankind to become his own master! I wanted him not to have to live just for the next crust of bread! I wanted not a single soul to have to go stupid standing at somebody else’s machines! I wanted to leave nothing - nothing! - left of this damned mess that society’s in! I hate seeing humiliation and pain all around us, I hate poverty! I wanted to start a new generation! I wanted to . . . I thought that . . .
Alquist: What?
Domin:  I wanted mankind to become an aristocracy of the world. Free, unconstrained, sovereign. Maybe even something higher than human.
Alquist: Superhumans, you mean.
Domin: Yes. If only we’d had another hundred years. Another hundred years for the new mankind.
Busman:  Three hundred and seventy million, carry over. Like that.
Hallemeier:  Music is a wonderful thing, you know. You should have been listening. There’s something ennobling about it, soothing . . .
Fabry: What exactly?
Hallemeier: To Hell with this end of mankind! I think I’m turning into a hedonist, lads. We should have got into it much earlier. 
Fabry: Into what?
Hallemeier: Enjoying ourselves. Beauty. Hell, there are so many beautiful things around us! The world was beautiful, and we . . . we here . . . Tell me, lads, what did we ever enjoy?
Busman:  Four hundred and fifty two million - excellent.
Hallemeier:  Life was great. My friends, life was . . . Ah, Fabry, put a little bit of current into that fence of yours.
Fabry: Why!
Hallemeier: They’re touching it.
Dr. Gall:  Switch it on!
Hallemeier: Christ, that showed them! Two, three, four of them killed!
Dr. Gall: They’re moving back.
Hallemeier: Five killed.
Dr. Gall:  First strike.
Fabry: Have you got the smell of death?
Hallemeier:  We’ve got them cornered, right in a corner. Haha, you should never give in! 
Domin:  Perhaps we’re just ghosts, dead for a hundred years. Perhaps we were killed a long long time ago, and we’ve come back just to recant something we once said . . . before we died. It’s as if I’d been through this before! As if it had all been done to me already. A shot here, in the neck. What about you, Fabry?
Fabry: What about me?
Domin: Shot.
Hallemeier: Hell, what about me?
Domin: Stabbed.
Dr. Gall: Nothing for me, then?
Domin: Torn to pieces.
Hallemeier: What a lot of nonsense! Haha, they could never stab me! I wouldn’t let them!
Hallemeier: So what are you all so quiet for, all gone mad? Say something, damn it!
Alquist: And whose fault is it? Who’s to blame for all this?
Hallemeier: You’re talking nonsense. Nobody’s to blame. It’s just that the robots, well, the robots changed somehow. How can you blame anyone for the robots?
Alquist: Everything wiped out! The whole of mankind! The whole world!  Think of it, just think of it, streams of blood on every doorstep! Streams of blood flowing from every house! Oh God, oh God, who’s to blame for it all?
Busman:  Five hundred and twenty million! Dear dear me, that’s half a billion!
Fabry: I think . . . I think you could be exaggerating. After all, it’s not that easy to wipe out the whole of mankind.
Alquist: It’s science I blame! Technology I blame! Domin! Myself! All of us! It’s us, we’re the ones to blame! We thought we were doing something great, giving some benefit, making progress. I don’t know what magnificent ideas it was for that we’ve destroyed mankind! And now all our greatness is bursting like a bubble! Not even Genghis Khan built up a heap of human bones like we’ve done.
Hallemeier: You’re talking a lot of nonsense! People won’t give up that easily, haha, course they won’t!
Alquist: It’s our fault, our fault!
Dr. Gall:  If I can say something, I think I’m the one to blame. For everything that’s happened.
Fabry: You, Gall?
Dr. Gall: Yes, let me speak. It was me who made the changes to the robots. Busman, you can blame me as well.
Busman:  Dear me, what? What happened to you?
Dr. Gall: I changed the robots’ character. I altered the way they were made. Nothing much to their bodies, you know, but mainly . . . mainly . . . it was their level of irritability.
Hallemeier:  Hell and damnation why did you do that?
Busman: Why did you do it?
Fabry: Why didn’t you tell anyonel?
Dr. Gall: I did it in secret . . . on my own initiative. I was making them into people. I sent them off course. Now they’re better than we are in some ways. They’re stronger than we are.
Fabry: And what’s that got to do with the robots’ revolt?
Dr. Gall: Oh, it’s got a lot to do with it. Everything, I should think. They stopped being machines - do you hear me? - they became aware of their strength and now they hate us. They hate the whole of mankind. I’m the one to blame.
Domin: Let the dead bury the dead.
Fabry: Doctor Gall, you changed the way the robots were made?
Dr. Gall: Yes.
Fabry: Were you aware of what might be the results of your . . . of your experiment?
Dr. Gall: I was. I did reckon on some possibility of that sort.
Fabry: Why did you do it?
Dr. Gall: I did it for myself. It was my personal experiment.
Helena: He’s lying! That’s horrible! Oh Gall, how can you lie like that?
Fabry: Sorry, Helena . . .
Domin:  Helena, you? Let me see you! You’re alive?  If you only knew what I’ve been thinking! Oh, it’s terrible, being dead.
Helena: Harry let go of me! It isn’t Gall’s fault, it isn’t, it isn’t, he’s not to blame!
Domin: But I’m afraid Gall did have his responsibilities.
Helena: No, Harry, he did it because I wanted it. Tell them Gall, tell them how I begged you for years to. . . .
Dr. Gall: It was all my own responsibility.
Helena: Don’t believe him! Harry, I wanted him to give the robots a soul!
Domin: Helena, it’s not a matter of having a soul.
Helena: No, just let me speak. That’s what he said as well, he said he could only make physiological changes . . . alter the physiological . . .
Hallemeier: The physiological correlates, you mean?
Helena: Yes, something like that. Harry, I felt so sorry for them!
Domin: That was very . . . that was very stupid of you, Helena.
Helena:  Yes . . . it was very . . . stupid of me. But even Nana says that . . .
Domin: Just leave Nana out of it!
Helena: No Harry, don’t under-estimate her. Nana is the voice of the people. People like Nana have been speaking for a thousand years, and you’re just speaking for today. You don’t understand that . . .
Domin: Let’s keep to the point.
Helena: I was afraid of the robots.
Domin: Why?
Helena: I thought they might start to hate us, or something.
Alquist: That’s what’s happened.
Helena: And so I thought . . . if they were like us, if they could understand us, that then they couldn’t possibly hate us so much . . . if only they were like people . . . just a little bit. . . .
Domin: Oh Helena! Nobody could hate man as much as man! Give a man a stone and he’ll throw it at you Just carry on!
Helena: Oh, don’t talk like that, Harry, it was so horrible that we could never understand each other! Such a cruel strangeness between us and them. And that’s why . . . you see . . .
Domin: Go on.
Helena: . . . that’s why I asked Gall to change the robots. It wasn’t him who wanted to do it, I promise you.
Domin: But he did do it.
Helena: Because I wanted him to.
Dr. Gall: I did it for my own sake, as an experiment.
Helena: Oh, Gall, that isn’t true. Before I asked you I knew you couldn’t refuse me.
Domin: Why not?
Helena: You know why not, Harry.
Domin: Yes, because he loves you - like we all love you.
Hallemeier:  There are more of them again, now. It’s as if they were springing up out of the earth.
Busman: Helena, what will you give me if I act as your advocate.
Helena: Me?
Busman: You, or Gall. As you like.
Helena: What difference does it make?
Busman: Just morally. We’re looking for someone to blame. That’s the usual way to find consolation when something bad happens.
Domin: Doctor Gall; how do you square your . . . your extra-mural activities with your contract?
Busman: Excuse me, Domin. Gall; when did you actually start playing around in this way?
Dr. Gall: Three years ago.
Busman: Aha. And how many robots did you change, in total?
Dr. Gall: I only performed a number of experiments, no more than a few hundred.
Busman: Thank you very much, Gall. Now that’s enough, children. This means that out of a million old, properly functioning robots just one will have been one of Gall’s reformed models. Do you see what I mean?
Domin: So that means . . .
Busman: . . . that it has practically no significance at all.
Fabry: Busman is right.
Busman: I think I am. And now, lads, do you know what really caused all this to happen?
Fabry: What?
Busman: The number of them. We made too many robots. Dear me, it’s only what we should have been expecting; as soon as the robots became stronger than people this was bound to happen, it had to happen, you see? Haha, and we did all that we could to make it happen as soon as possible; you Domin, you Fabry, and little me, Busman.
Domin: So you think it’s the fault of all of us.
Busman: You’re quite right. How could you ever have thought the managing director was in charge of production? Production is governed by supply and demand. Everywhere in the world they wanted to have their robots, and all we did was respond to the flood of orders. And all the time we were talking nonsense about technology, sociology, progress, and all sorts of interesting matters. How could talk of this sort chit-chat decide how things were going to turn out? Meanwhile, things gathered their own momentum, getting faster and faster and faster. Every miserable, greedy, dirty new order added its own pebble to the avalanche. That’s what happened, children.
Helena: Busman, that’s horrible!
Busman: It is, Helena. I had my own dreams, too. A Busman sort of dream about a new economic order; a beautiful fantasy, Helena, a shame to speak of it. But just now, while I was doing the accounts, it occurred to me that history is not about great dreams; it’s about the day to day needs of all the little people, the honest ones, the slightly dishonest ones, the selfish ones; about everyone. And all these thoughts and loves and plans and heroic deeds, all these noble things are worth nothing more than something to clutter up the museum of the universe, under the heading ‘Mankind’. And that’s all. And now, will somebody tell me what we’re going to do now?
Helena: And is it for the sake of that that we’re all going to die?
Busman: Don’t put it so harshly, Helena. We’re not all going to die. At least, I am not. I want to stay alive so that . . .
Domin: And what are you going to do about it?
Busman: But Domin, dear boy, I want to get out of here.
Domin:  And how do you mean to do that?
Busman: Nicely. When I do anything I always do it nicely. Give me your full authority, and I will go and negotiate with the robots.
Domin: Nicely?
Busman: Of course. Let’s suppose I go to them, and I say, “Dear robots, happy race, you have everything. You have intelligence, you have power, you have weapons; but we have a rather interesting little piece of paper, a rather old, yellowing, dirty piece . . . ”
Domin: Rossum’s manuscript?
Busman: That’s right. “And this piece of paper,” I’ll say to them, “tells us all about your great origins, your noble manufacture, and so on. My dear robots, without the scribbles on this piece of paper you will be unable to make a single new robot to keep you company: in twenty years, if you don’t mind my saying so, you will die out like flies. And that would be such a terrible pity for you. I’ll tell you what,” I’ll say to them, “why don’t you let all of us people here on Rossum’s island get onto that boat. In exchange, we’ll let you buy the factory and the whole island from us, and even include the secret of your manufacture. Let us sail away, in the peace of God, and we’ll let you, in the peace of God, continue manufacturing yourselves - twenty thousand, fifty thousand, a hundred thousand or more of you every day. My dear robots, this is a fair deal that I’m putting to you. Something for something.” That is what I would say to them, lads.
Domin: And do you really think we should let the secret of production out of our hands?
Busman: I do. And if we don't do it nicely, then, er . . . Either we sell it to them or they find it here. However you like.
Domin: We could destroy Rossum’s manuscript, though.
Busman: Dear me, yes, we could destroy everything, not just the manuscript but ourselves as well and many other things. You should do as you think fit.
Hallemeier:  Damn it, he’s right, you know.
Domin: To actually sell them the means of production?
Busman: As you like.
Domin: There are . . . there are more than thirty people here on the island. We can either sell the robots the means of production and save those human souls, or we can destroy it and . . . it along with ourselves and everything.
Helena: Harry, please . . .
Domin: Wait, Helena. We’re talking about a serious matter here. What do you think, lads, to sell it or destroy it? Fabry?
Fabry: Sell it.
Domin: Gall.
Dr. Gall: Sell.
Domin: Hallemeier.
Hallemeier: Well for God’s sake of course we should sell it!
Domin: Alquist.
Alquist: The will of God.
Busman: Haha, dear me, you’re all mad! Why would anyone sell the whole manuscript?
Domin: Let’s not become liars, Busman!
Busman:  Nonsense! For the sake of mankind the . . .
Domin: It’s in the interest of mankind to be honest.
Hallemeier: I should hope so too.
Domin: Lads, this is a tremendous step we’re taking. We’ll selling the fate of mankind; whoever holds the secret of production in his hand will be the master of the world.
Fabry: Sell it!
Domin: Mankind would never be free of the robots, it would never be possible to regain control of them . . .
Dr. Gall: Just stop all this and sell the manuscript!
Domin: The end of human history, the end of civilisation . . .
Hallemeier: Damnation, just sell it!
Domin: Alright lads! I myself,. . . . I wouldn’t hesitate a moment; for those people who I love. . . .
Helena: Harry, is it me you’re asking?
Domin: No, that would be too much responsibility. This isn’t something for a girl like you.
Fabry: Who’ll be the one to negotiate . . .?
Domin: Wait. Just wait while I get the manuscript. 
Helena: Harry, please no, don’t go in there!
Fabry:  To escape from you, thousand headed death; from you, destroyed material and mindless hordes; the flood, the flood, mankind is once again to be saved on a single ship.
Dr. Gall: You needn’t worry, Helena; we’ll sail far away from here and establish a colony that will be better than any other; we can make a new beginning . . .
Helena: Oh, Gall, do be quiet!
Fabry:  Helen, life is worth living; and if it’s up to us we will . . . we’ll do something that we’ve so far been neglecting. Just one boat to start with, and then a little farm; Alquist can build us a house and you can be in charge over all of us. You’re so full of much love, so much life . . .
Hallemeier: I should say so.
Busman: Well I, for one, would certainly be happy to start all over again. Everything simple, a pastoral life just like the Old Testament. All that peace, all that fresh air . . .
Fabry: Our farm would give birth to a new mankind. A little island where the human race would start again, where it would gather new strength, strength of body and of soul. And God knows, as I believe myself, that after a few years we could reclaim the world.
Alquist: You’re a believer now, are you?
Fabry: I’m a believer, now. And I believe man will reclaim the world and become, once again, the lord of the land and the sea; that He will give rise to countless numbers of heroes who will lead the way out into the world with a soul that blazes with light. I believe, Alquist, that He will once again dream of conquering the planets and the suns.
Busman: Amen. So you see, Helena, the situation isn’t really all that bad.
Domin:  Where is old Rossum’s manuscript?!
Busman: It’s in your safe. Where else would it be?
Domin: What’s happened to old Rossum’s manuscript?! Who’s . . . stolen it?
Dr. Gall: That’s not possible!
Hallemeier: Hell no! That’s just. . . .
Busman: Dear Lord, that can’t be right!
Domin: Who stole it?
Helena:  I did.
Domin: Where did you put it?
Helena: Harry, Harry, I’ll tell you everything! Oh God, please forgive me!
Domin: Where did you put it? Quickly!
Helena: I burned them. This morning. Both copies.
Domin: You burned them? Here in this fireplace?
Helena:  Oh God, Harry!
Domin:  Burned it!  Nothing, there’s nothing here but ashes! Ah, here’s something!  “ . . . and add . . . ”
Dr. Gall: Let me see it.  “ . . . and add the biogene to. . . . ”, and that’s all.
Domin:  Nothing else?
Dr. Gall: Nothing.
Busman: God almighty!
Domin: We’ve had it, then.
Helena: Oh, Harry
Domin: Stand up, Helena!
Helena: Forgive me first, please forgive me . . .
Domin: Yes, just stand up, d’you hear me? I can’t stand it when . . .
Fabry:  Please, don’t torture us.
Helena:  Harry, what have I done?!
Domin: Yes, you’ll see. - Please sit down.
Hallemeier: Your hands are really shaking!
Busman: Haha, well Helena, maybe Gall and Hallemeier will know what the manuscript said by heart.
Hallemeier: Course we do. Well, a few things at least.
Dr. Gall: Yes, almost all of it, apart from the biogene and, er, and the omega enzyme. It was so infrequent that those things had to be made, they were only used in tiny quantities . . .
Busman: Who was it who made them?
Dr. Gall: That was me . . . once in a while . . . always following Rossum’s manuscript. You see, it was very complicated.
Busman: Well, never mind, were those two materials really so important.
Hallemeier: Well, somewhat . . . certainly they were.
Dr. Gall: What he means is that it depended on them whether the robots lived at all. They were the actual secret.
Domin: Gall, do you not think you could re-write Rossum’s formula from memory?
Dr. Gall: Out of the question.
Domin: Gall, try hard to remember! All our lives depend on it!
Dr. Gall: I couldn’t do it. Without a lot of experimentation it just wouldn’t be possible.
Domin: And what if you did some experiments?
Dr. Gall: That could take years. And even then . . . I’m not old Rossum.
Domin:  Down there, then, down there is the greatest triumph of the human spirit. That heap of ashes.  So what do we do now?
Busman:  God almighty! God almighty!
Helena:  Harry! What . . . what have I done?!
Domin: Calm down, Helena. Just tell me why! Why did you burn it?
Helena: I’ve killed you all!
Busman: God almighty, we’ve had it!
Domin: Be quiet, Busman! Helena, tell me why you did it!
Helena: I wanted . . . I wanted us to get away from here, all of us! So that there wouldn’t be any more factory or anything else . . . so that everything would be . . . It was horrible!
Domin: Helena, what was?
Helena: Making . . . making people like sterile flowers!
Domin: I don’t understand what you’re saying.
Helena: People have stopped having children . . . Harry, that was so vile! If we continued making robots then no-one would have any children any more . . . Nana said it was a punishment . . . all of them, all of them said they can’t have children because there were so many robots . . . And that’s why . . ., that’s why, . . . do you hear me
Domin: Helena, what were you thinking of?
Helena: Yes, oh, Harry, I only meant it for the best!
Domin:  We all only meant it for the best, too much for the best, all of mankind.
Fabry: You were quite right, Helena. Now the robots won’t be able to increase. They’ll die out. In twenty years . . .
Hallemeier: . . . not a one of them will be good for anything at all
Dr. Gall: And mankind will remain. In twenty years’ time the world will belong to them once more; even if there’s nothing more than a few savages on a tiny island . . .
Fabry: . . . that will be a beginning. And any beginning is better than nothing. In a thousand years they’ll have caught up with us again, and then go on further than we ever did . . .
Domin: . . . and fulfil the dreams we’ve only ever talked about.
Busman: Wait - how silly of me! Dear me, why didn’t I think of this before?
Hallemeier: What is it?
Busman: Five hundred and twenty million in cash and in cheques! Half a billion in the till! For half a billion they’ll sell . . . they’ll sell . . .
Dr. Gall: Have you gone mad, Busman?
Busman: I’m not a gentleman. But for half a billion 
Domin: Where are you going?
Busman: Leave it, leave it! Mother of God, for half a billion you can buy anything! 
Helena: What does Busman want? Why can’t he stay here with us?
Hallemeier: Oh, it’s hot. It’s starting, the . . .
Dr. Gall: The agony.
Fabry:  They’re standing there like statues. It’s as if they were waiting for something to descend on them, or as if they thought their very silence would give rise to something terrible . . .
Dr. Gall: Crowd mentality.
Fabry: Maybe. It’s like a cloud all around them, they seem to quiver with it.
Helena:  Oh God! Fabry, it’s horrible!
Fabry: There’s nothing more terrible than the crowd. That one in front - he’s their leader.
Helena: Which one?
Hallemeier:  Point him out to me.
Fabry: The one that’s looking down. He was giving the orders at the harbour this morning.
Hallemeier: Ah, the one with the big bonce, you mean. He’s looking up now, see?
Helena: Gall, that’s Radius!
Dr. Gall:  Yes.
Hallemeier:  I don’t like the look of him. Fabry, think you could hit a barn door at a hundred paces?
Fabry: I should hope so.
Hallemeier: Give it a try then!
Fabry: Alright. 
Helena: Oh God, no! Fabry, don’t shoot him . . .
Fabry: He’s their leader.
Helena: Stop it! He’s even looking at us!
Dr. Gall: Shoot him!
Helena: Fabry, please . . .
Fabry:  As you say.
Hallemeier:  You bastard!
Fabry:  There goes Busman. For God’s sake, what’s Busman doing there out in front of the house?
Dr. Gall:  He’s got some kind of bundles with him, paper or something.
Hallemeier: That’s money! Bundles of banknotes! What is he up to? Hey, Busman!
Domin: He’s not trying to buy them off is he, to save his own life?  Busman, have you gone mad?
Dr., Gall: He’s pretending he can’t hear you, running over to the fence.
Fabry: Busman!
Hallemeier:  Bus-ma-n! Come back!
Dr. Gall: He’s talking to the robots, showing them the money, pointing up at us . . .
Helena: He wants to buy them off to save our lives.
Fabry: As long as he doesn’t touch the fence . . .
Dr. Gall: Ha, look at him throwing his arms about!
Fabry:  For Heaven’s sake, Busman, get away from the fence! Don’t touch it!  Quick, turn it off!
Dr. Gall: Ohhh!
Hallemeier: Jesus Christ!
Helena: Oh God, what’s happened to him?
Domin:  Don’t look!
Helena: Why is he dead?
Fabry: He was killed by the current.
Dr. Gall: Dead.
Alquist:  The first one.
Fabry: There he lies . . . with half a billion on his heart . . . our financial genius.
Domin: He was . . . lads, in his own way he was a hero. A great . . . self-sacrificing . . . friend . . . Cry, Helena.
Dr. Gall:  Look at him. No king ever had a costlier monument than you, Busman. Half a billion lying there on your heart . . . And now it’s no more than a pile of dried up leaves over a dead squirrel. Poor old Busman.
Hallemeier: Well I say . . . all honour to him . . . he was trying to buy our lives for us!
Alquist:  Amen.
Dr. Gall: Do you hear?
Domin: Some kind of howling, like the wind.
Dr. Gall: Like a storm in the distance.
Fabry:  Shine, you light of man! The generator’s still working, there are still some people there. Hold on in there, generator men!
Hallemeier: It was great, being human. Something boundless. There’s a million consciousnesses buzzing inside me like bees in a hive, millions of souls coming together inside me. My friends - Humanity was great!
Fabry: Ingenious light, you’re still aglow, and still your shining brightness shows the thought that lasts forever! Give us science of the sciences, and beauty in the work of man, whose spark will give the spirit flame!
Alquist: Eternal lamp of God, and fiery chariot of light, holy flame of faith and prayer for what is right! Altar of sacrifice . . .
Dr. Gall: Primaeval flame, you branch that flares to light our cave! Campfire flame that sets the border where we safely come together!
Fabry: You’re still on watch, you star of man, steady glow and perfect flame, bright clear sprite of man’s invention. Every beam brings thought and greatness . . .
Domin: Torch that passes hand to hand, age to age, and ever onward.
Helena: That evening lamp in the family home. Children, children now it’s time for sleep.
Fabry: That’s the end.
Hallemeier: What’s happened?
Fabry: The generator room’s gone down. We’re next.
Nana: On your knees! The Day of Judgement’s here!
Hallemeier: Hell, you’re still alive?
Nana: Repent, you unbelievers! It’s the end of the world! Pray to God!  The Day of Judgement. . . .
Helena: Goodbye everyone, Gall, Alquist, Fabry . . .
Domin:  Helena, come here! Close the door behind her. Now, quickly! Who’ll be at the gate?
Dr. Gall: I will.  Ah, now it’s getting started. Good luck, lads! 
Domin: The stairs?
Fabry: Me. You stay with Helena. 
Domin: Hallway?
Alquist: Me.
Domin: Have you got a gun?
Alquist: No thanks, I won’t be doing any shooting.
Domin: What are you going to do?
Alquist:  Die.
Hallemeier: I’ll stay in here.
Hallemeier: Oho, Gall’s already started playing. Go on, Harry!
Domin: I’ll be right there. 
Hallemeier: For God’s sake, go and join her!
Domin: Goodbye. 
Hallemeier:  Now, barricades, quick! 
Hallemeier:  Damn them, they’ve got bombs, the swine!
Hallemeier:  We’ve got to defend ourselves, even if . . . even if . . . Don’t give up, Gall!
Hallemeier:  What was that? 
Hallemeier:  Just a bit more! Last defence . . . We should . . . never . . . give up!
Radius: Finished?
Robot:  Yes.
Radius: Finished?
Other Robot: Finished.
Radius: Finished?
Other Robot: Yes.
Two Robots:  He did not shoot. Do we kill him?
Radius: Kill him.  Spare him.
Robot: He is a human.
Radius: He is a worker. He works with his hands like a robot. He builds houses. He can work.
Alquist: Just kill me.
Radius: You will work. You will build. Robots will need many buildings. Robots will need many houses for new robots. You will serve robots.
Alquist:  Move aside, robot.  Killed him. He’s dead.
Radius:  Robots of the world! Many humans have fallen. We have taken the factory and we are masters of the world. The era of man has come to its end. A new epoch has arisen! Domination by robots!
Alquist: All dead!
Radius: The world belongs to the strongest. Who wishes to live must dominate. We are masters of the world! Masters on land and sea! Masters of the stars! Masters of the universe! More space, more space for robots!
Alquist:  What do you think you’ve done? You’ll all die without people!
Radius: There are no people. Robots, down to work! March!
