Ayy, yo, y'all niggas must be out your fuckin' mind 
Thinking dog can't pull another motherfuckin' rabbit out the hat 
Think I ain't got a trick up my motherfuckin' sleeve, you bitch-ass niggas
Fuck these niggas thinking?
Y'all niggas thinkin' I'm doing, just sittin' around doin' nothin'?
Oh my God, niggas can't be serious
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Yo, yo 
Yo, yo 
Yo, yo 
Man, cats don't know  what it's gon' be
Fuckin' with a nigga like me
D to the M to the X 
Last I heard, y'all niggas was havin' sex  with the same sex 
I show no love  to homo thugs 
Empty out, reload, and blow more slugs 
How you gonna explain fuckin' a man?
Even if we squash the beef, I ain't touchin' your hand 
I don't fuck with chumps 
For those that been to jail, that's the cat with the Kool-Aid on his lips and pumps 
I don't fuck with niggas that think they broads
Only know how to be one way, that's the dog 
I know how to get down, know how to bite 
Bark very little, but I know how to fight 
I know how to chase a cat up in a tree
Man, I'll give y'all niggas the business for fuckin' with me
Is you crazy?
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Yo, yo 
Yo, yo 
Yo, yo 
Once it's on, I come through, guns is drawn
Blam, blam, lungs is gone, sons will mourn
From dusk 'til dawn , night time belongs to the dog
On the street past midnight, look for 'em in the morgue 
Won't play with these cats 'cause I ain't got nothin' to say to these cats 
For the mothers that really do love 'em, please pray for these cats 
'Cause I know niggas is hard-headed, but I ain't got the patience 
Don't want me havin' no patience, turn into more patients
More trips to ICU 'cause I see you
Trying to get away with shit a real nigga wouldn't do
Where my dogs at? 
You see them niggas? 
Get 'em, boys 
That's how we do 
Yeah, this is for my dogs , this is for my dogs 
Yo, where we at, baby? 
From then 'til now, don't ask me how
Know that we gon' roll like them niggas and hit every block on the job
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Yo, yo 
Yo, yo 
Yo, yo 
I get apes doin' crime, stomp niggas like grapes makin' wine 
Five CD's with mad rhymes 
Don't hit me with that positive shit, I know you lyin'
You really wanna stop niggas from dyin'? Stop niggas from tryin' 
'Cause I ain't really got that time to waste
And I thought I told you to get these fuckin' bums out my face 
Lookin' at you in your grill, it might be nice to cut 
Once I split your ass in two, you'll be twice as butt 
Yeah, you right, I know your style pussy, 'cause I'm fuckin' it 
Since we all here, you hold my dick while he suckin' it 
Motherfucker, don't you know you'll never come near me?
Shove your head up your ass, have you seein' shit clearly 
Never heard that D be running , 'cause D be gunning
I beat my dick and bust off in your eye so you can see me comin'
Empty clips and shells are what I leave behind
And if they get me with the joint, they'll hit me with a three-to-nine
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
What?
Where the fuckin' hood at?
Ayy, no one's fuckin' with me, nigga 
For real 
I am the hood 
I am the streets 
You bitch-ass nigga 
Take it how you want, motherfucker 
I'm in the hood all day 
I think I'm, like, the only nigga, dog 
That can go to the projects 
By his fuckin' self and be good 
Yeah, nigga, ask niggas on my projects 
When the last time they seen dog, motherfucker 
D, Y, uh
