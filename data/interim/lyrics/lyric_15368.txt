Lonely fear lights up the sky
Can't help but wonder why
You're so far away
There, you had to take a stand
In someone else's land
Life can be so strange
I wish we never had to choose
To either win or lose
We could find a way
We could find a way
But I won't turn my back again
Turn my back again
Your honor I'll defend
So hurry home till then
Stand tall, stand proud
Voices that care
Are crying out loud
And when you close
Your eyes tonight
Feel in your heart
How our love burns bright
Hurry home
I'm not here to justify the cause
Or to count up all the loss
That's all been done before
Just can't let you feel alone
When there's so much love at home
We're sending out to you
All the courage that you've known
The bravery you've shown
Clearly lights the way
We pray
To make the future bright
To make the wrong things right
Right or wrong
We're all praying you remain strong
That's why we're all here singing along
Hey, hey
Stand tall, stand proud
Voices that care
Are crying out loud
And when you close
Your eyes tonight
Know in your heart
How our love burns bright
Voices that care
Are crying out loud
And when you close
Your eyes tonight
Feel in your heart
How our love burns bright
You are the voice
You are the light
Stand tall, stand proud
Voices that care
Are crying out loud
Are crying out loud, ooh
And when you close
Your eyes tonight
Feel in your heart
How our love burns bright
Stand tall, stand proud
Voices that care
Are crying out loud
And when you close
Your eyes tonight
Feel in your heart
How our love burns bright
You are the voice
And the guiding light
Feel in your heart
How our love burns bright
