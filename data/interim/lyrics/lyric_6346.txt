I was heading south, when I heard the wind
Call something warm against my name
It's lonesome on the road, but there's a reason
I left home, and I haven't looked back since that day
When you left me all along, I found my place
Up on my throne
And embraced visions of my friends
I'd left behind
And lovers from the corners, mixed with
Streets I dream of still
But let them come, I'll wait in the middle
Of the road
I headed for the 'burbs, when I heard birds sing sure
In colors pink and blue
The heater finally stops, so I can hear my thoughts
And find there's nothing new
What's the good in growing, all our brand new
Shows are showing, same old blues, we never quite
Found use in prayer
But I dissected my thumb, and found I'm not really
All that dumb enough to fall for someone worthy
Of pursuit
Hold me, keep me, tie me down
It's the end of the year and I'm feeling restless
I'll sneak a kiss when your eyes are closed
It's worth the slap or hug I've yet to know
Sirens fill the town, just hold my hand and look around
We're better off at a diner than this here
It's a footstep old as mine, and a tip-toe 'cross the line
Of what I want to believe and where I've been
To the girl all alone on New Year's Eve;
To the couple that never lasted just a week;
To the dogs that found a brand new spot to pee;
And to the sun that I'll see rising through the trees;
To every song from which I stole a verb;
To every girl that wishes I would burn;
To freeways, highways, crosswalks, and gators in canals
I've got a brand new motivation, honey
Get a good look at me now;
I'm feeling long gone
I'm feeling long gone
I'm feeling long gone
And wherever you are tonight
I'll drop a drop for honey shores
I'm feeling long gone
