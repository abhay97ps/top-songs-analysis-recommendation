Sweat runnin' all over my chest 
I don't quit, no, I just press
Harder  than I ever did before
Going for the dreams that I have in store
In my mind , and I know that I'm makin' it
I gotta get mine and nobody's takin' it away 
'Cause Hammer don't play that
You try to get mine, boy, you better step back
Freeze , 'cause you don't want none
I hustle for my muscle and you look weak, son 
Yeah, I'm goin' for all that I can get
Kickin' it at the top 'cause I'm too legit to quit 
Too legit, too legit to quit 
Too legit, too legit to quit

Too legit
When I feel high post, don't you play me close
I dig 'em, smack, I'll get you back, and I'll hit with a dose
Of Oaktown power
And chargin' by the hour
I'm shakin' like a quake and funks get devoured
I choose to abuse, misuse, and confuse
Competitors who think that they're makin' up all the rules
Fools in the game, lame and insane
It's a shame I gotta do this but I remain the same
Unchanged, gettin' better never known as a sweater
Kickin' it at the top because I got myself together
So roll with a guy who's physical and fit
Knows the time, and too legit to quit

Step to the rhythm of a sho-nuff winner 
I been here before, yo, I ain't no beginner 
But I been new, tried and true
Survival of the fittest, yo, it brought me through
My crew , we're ready to strike
Trained for the mission, so believe the hype
And sweat it 
'Cause you're gonna regret it
The day that you dissed us
You'll wish you never met us
You remind me of a real short story
One hit record and you start to bore me 
Get ready 'cause this is it
Your crew is through, and we too legit to quit

My people, we don't know defeat
We crush the strong and percolate the weak
Daily , we make our move
To improve our groove because we love to rule
Where we lay, yo , work and play
We started at the bottom, now we're leading the way
