I think you are  something special
I'll take you on a shopping spree 
'Cause I'm so into you 
I'm so into you 
I'm so into you 
I'm so into you , baby 
What you like? What you wear?
Say the name, say the price, put them diamonds on your ear
Shinin' like a chandelier
What's your thoughts? What's your fears?
Yeah, I need that real love , talkin' Bobby and Whitney 
You don't gotta worry 'bout nothin' as long as you with me 
'Cause shit could get sticky, that's why I keep a glizzy
Ride around through my city 
Fuck Cassandra, Kanesha, Kaneeka and Tisha, Lisa and Tricia 
Fuck them hoes 'cause I don't need them, all them bitches treeshas
They ain't in the field, they on the bleachers 
On your back, I start applying that lotion 
So deep, I'ma go in, pullin' all on your sew-in 
I'm Pop Smoke, but you know all my governments
All that gangster shit, she be lovin' it
She love how I'm thuggin' it 
Shawty brown and petite 
Fly and discreet, a demon in the sheets
Mother was a lawyer, her father the police
They be working long hours, so she always had the free
She said I could come with her if it get hot up in the streets
'Cause I'm a 'rilla in the jungle and a shark up in the sea
She like, "Papi, you so fire, but get up out the streets"
I'm like, "Baby, what you mean?" 
Look
I think  you are
You are  something special 
I'll take you on a shopping spree
'Cause I'm so into you 
I'm so into you 
I'm so into you
I'm so into you, baby 
Baby 
You are  my girl 
You are  my girl
 You are 
You are  something special 
I'll take you on a shopping spree 
'Cause I'm so into you 
I'm so into you 
I'm so into you 
I'm so into you , baby
