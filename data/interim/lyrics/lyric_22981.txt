What's your all-time high, your good as it gets?
Your hands down best ever make-up sex?
What's your guilty pleasure, your old go to?
Well if you asked me, mine would be you
What's your worst hangover, your best night yet?
Your 90 proof, your Marlboro Red?
The best damn thing you lucked into
That's easy girl, mine would be you
Mine would be you
Sun keeps shinin', back road flyin'
Singin' like crazy fools
Makin' up our own words, laughin' 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever, my finest hour
My wildest dream come true
Mine would be you
What's your double dare, your go all in?
The craziest thing you ever did?
Plain as your name in this tattoo
Look on my arm, mine would be you
Mine would be you
Sun keeps shinin', back road flyin'
Singin' like crazy fools
Makin' up our own words, laughin' 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever, my finest hour
My wildest dream come true
Mine would be you
What's the greatest chapter in your book?
Are there pages where it hurts to look?
What's the one regret you can't work through?
You got it baby, mine would be you
Yeah, you got it baby, mine would be you
Mine would be you
Taillights fadin', daylight breakin'
Standing there like a fool
When I should've been runnin', yellin' out somethin'
To make you want to hold on to
The best love ever, girl, can you tell me
The one thing you'd rather die than lose?
'Cause mine would be you
Mine would be...you
