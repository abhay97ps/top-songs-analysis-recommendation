Does he love me? I wanna know
How can I tell if he loves me so?
Oh no, you'll be deceived
Oh no, he'll make believe
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
Oh no, it's just his charm
Oh no, that's just his arm
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
Oh oh, it's in his kiss
Oh oh oh, kiss him and squeeze him tight
And find out what you wanna know
If it's love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss
Oh no, that's not the way
And you're not listenin' to all I say
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
Oh yeah, it's in his kiss
Whoa oh oh, kiss him and squeeze him tight
And find out what you wanna know
If it's love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss
Oh no, that's not the way
And you're not listenin' to all I say
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
Oh yeah, it's in his kiss
Oh oh, it's in his kiss
