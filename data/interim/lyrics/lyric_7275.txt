I've been celebrating
'way too long and I've been drinking
I'm shamed to tell
Still feel thirsty
God
I want to drink the water from the well
Still feel thirsty
God
I want to drink and ring the living bell
Ring the bell
Lah
Ring the living bell
Still feel thirsty
God
I want to give and ring the living bell
I'm not a magic lady
But
I wanna sing to help the light
Descend on the earth today
Beacuse it's gonna get warm tonight
Sing for light
Ah
Sing for living light
Still feel weak but
God
I want to give and shine the living light
Still feel weak but
God
I want to give and shine the living light
Been walking down the street all night
And I been feeling kind of cold
Still feel naked
God
I want to be warm before I get old
And I'm cold
Ah
And I'm feeling cold
Still feel hungry
God
I want to give and ring the living bell
Been celebrating 'way too long
And I have eaten much too well
Still feel hungry
God
I want to give and ring the living bell
Ring the bell
Lah
Ring the living bell
