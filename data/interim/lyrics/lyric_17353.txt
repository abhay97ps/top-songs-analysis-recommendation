And if you feel the need to make love till the end of night
And if you wanna make love till you see morning light
It's the rhythm of my love, oh yeah, the rhythm of love
It's the rhythm of my love, oh yeah, the rhythm of love
Ooh we explode on emotional overload
When I come down you get high
Together we could fly
Yo, when it gets real rough
You still can't get enough
No, come at me to do
The things you want me to
Full acceleration to the point of elevation
We were tied above to the rhythm of a love
Nobody can stop us and nobody can drop us
Yo, 1 2 3 4 we got the rhythm!
Yeah check it out
Hey can't you feel it
You can't take my beat and steal it
Issue me, the one and only
Believe me I'm no phony
Yo when I come down
Your mind stop spinning round
You and your soul under my control
Full acceleration to the point of elevation
We were tied above to the rhythm of a love
Nobody can stop us and nobody can drop us
Yo, 1 2 3 4 we got the rhythm!
We got the rhythm 
We got got the rhythm
We got the rhythm
We got got the rhythm
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ooh yeah hea
I got the Rythm
And if you feel the need to make love till the end of night
And if You wanna make love till you see morning light
It's the rhythm of my love, the rhythm, oh yeah, the rhythm
The rhythm of love
It's the rhythm of my love, the rhythm, oh yeah, the rhythm
The rhythm of love
