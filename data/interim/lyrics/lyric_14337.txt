Miss Lady Girl
Is putting her love on the shelf
Cause she don't want
To be hurt by nobody else
She's taken her heart
And put it away under lock and key
But it's high time
Miss Lady Girl sets her heart free and gives her love to me, yeah
But some think that diamond rings, fancy cars
Will make a big impression, yeah, ha! Dah
But I know that all she needs is my tender
Love and affection
Cause she still says
That no one's gonna get it 
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I feel that I will be the one who will 
No one's gonna get it   
No one's gonna get it, oh no 
But someone's gotta get it 
And I know that I will be the one who will 
Gonna get it, her love
Gonna get it, her kisses
Gonna get it, her heart
Gonna get it, get it
Miss Lady Girl, ha! Dah
Has buried her feelings deep inside
Cause she don't want, ah, dah
To be taken for another ride
She's sick and tired, ha!
Of being on that lonely merry-go-round
She just don't know, dah
That the ultimate love
Of her life is about to be found, hoo!
They think that ready cash, flashy clothes
Will fill her life with laughter
But I've got the very thing that she needs
True love forever after
Then no more will she say
That no one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I feel that I will be the one who will
No one's gonna got it
No one's gonna get It, oh no
But someone's gonna get it
And I know that I will be the one who will
I'm gonna get it 
I'm gonna get it 
Gonna get it, gonna get it
Gonna get it, get it, aaow!
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
Gonna get it, gonna get it
Gonna get it, gonna get it
Hoo! Hoo!
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
You ain't gonna get it
You know, dah, ah, hoo!
Aaow!
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
I'm gone gonna get it
