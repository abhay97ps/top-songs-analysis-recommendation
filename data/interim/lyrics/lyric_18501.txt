All you people in the club feel it 
Uh, yeah, come on, baby, now
Baby, I had to stop for a second on the balcony
Scopin' you down, you're lookin' fly to me 
All dressed up and buyin' your own drinks
And that ain't right 
Not that you can't handle it on your own 
But you're too damn fly to drink all alone
Can I come bubble with you?
To you, I'ma make a toast, come on

It's alright, it's alright with me if it's alright with you
Oh, baby
Baby, you got me high dancin' close with the chronic perfume 
Smellin' all good, it's gettin' hot in the room 
All pressed on you and I know you feel it too 
And that's alright 
Pardon me, I'ma back up and be a gentleman
And if it's really real then you can tell me when 
And that's when she pulled me close and said, "Do it again"
Come on

Take a sip, kind of got you feelin' fizzy
