Hello kids its time for education/ about that ska sound sweeping across the nation/ it's so phat I cannot pass it by/ so peep it's history and appreciate it's vibe/ it started way back about 1962/ the Skatelites came out with a sound brand new/ rebellious Rude Boys caught on to the jive/ dug the Fun Boy 3 around 1965/ some time later Jamaica couldn't keep it/ it moved on to England and Europe got to peep it/ skankin in the clubs to a fresh new sound/ mixing European punk to the style that they found/ thrown in jail about this time was Mandella/ then the Rudis in England began a rebellion/ this cycle of sound mixed with social cause/ began to gain popularity and Ðµarn much applause/
That's what goes on in the place of skaville/ it's movin to the music and the way we feel/ stand up for what's right and fight against what's wrong/ then smile for life and sing a happy song/
Welcome to skaville it's all about fun/ put on your zoot suit and we'll skank 'til one/ two-tone rude boys up in the front row/ don't matter which wave we'll still go/ Royal Ruckus can skank we like to move/ when there's a ska show we get into the groove/ feel the funk hit when we kick up our heels/ elbows flyin to music that's real/
Ska trudged on in the night clubs/ punkers and rudis together in the the pubs/ biases were low and people got along/ all in one accord singing the same song/ ska was going strong in it's 2nd wave/ there was respect for the first and that is my fave/ I love the sound of ska it is the best/ for movin and skankin or to sit back and rest/

Now we come to a new wave this one's the 3rd/ birthed in the US for those who haven't heard/ distortion on guitar is taking the lead/ while mainstream peeps begin to take heed/ the jazzy beat will always stay the same/ and the upbeats were maintained so they kept the ska name/ and that brings us to the present ska is climbing the charts/ the boys from Supertones are winning girls hearts/ Five Iron Frenzy keeps it real for Yahweh/ Insyderz and the Hippos get my props today/ ska gets respect from the Royal Kings/ we can be seen at ska shows skanking/
That's what goes on in the place of skaville/ it's movin to the music and the way we feel/ stand up for what's right and fight against what's wrong/ then smile for life and sing a happy song
