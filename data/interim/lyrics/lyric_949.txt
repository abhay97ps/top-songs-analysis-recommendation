I wake up crying
After tossing and turning
And yearning the whole night long
Pretty baby, since you went away
I haven't spent a happy day
I wake up crying
After sobbing and sighing
And wondering just what went wrong
Pretty baby, I was good to you
Why'd you go and make me blue?
I need your arms to hold me tight!
I need your lips to kiss me goodnight!
I'm so unhappy on my own...
Don't, don't, leave me sad and lonely
I wake up crying
After tossing and turning
And yearning the whole night long
Pretty baby, please come back to me
Save me from this misery...
Oh baby, won't you save me from this misery?
Oh baby, won't you save me from this misery?
