Hey now, the well runs dry
Pages of your book on fire
Read the writing on the wall
Hoedown, it's a showdown
Everywhere you look, we're fighting
Hear the call
And you know it's gettin' stronger
I can't last very much longer
Turn to stone
Well, there's a change in the wind
You know the signs don't lie
Such a strange feelin' and I don't know why
It's takin' such a long time
And the backyard people and they work all day
The day gets wasted, it's safe to say
The day's spent makin' words rhyme
And you know it's getting stronger
I can't make'em rhyme that much longer
Turn to stone
