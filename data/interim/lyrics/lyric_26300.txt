Her hands wrapped up in mine
Tears rollin' out of her eyes
No messin' with a made-up mind
Sun settin' on goodbye
Yeah, it's hard to believe
It wasn't me tryin' to leave this time
It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless running, searchin' for something
Leavin' love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away
I've never seen over from this side
Never heard lonely get this quiet
Still, I can't keep from smiling
'Cause, damn, that girl can fly
It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless running, searchin' for something
Leavin' love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away
A tumbleweed heart chasin' that wind
Goin' too far, wherever that is
It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless running, searchin' for something
Leavin' love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away
Rides away
It ain't always the cowboy
