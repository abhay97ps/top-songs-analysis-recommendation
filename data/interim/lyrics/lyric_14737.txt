Are you ready?
Here we go
Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow
Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow
Countdown, it's getting near the flight time
Night stars are shining in my eyes
Ma says I'm gonna be the first one
To dance the be-bop in the skies
Dancing in heaven
I never thought
I'd ever get my feet this far
Orbital be-bop
Dancing in heaven
I never thought
I'd ever get my feet this far
Orbital be-bop
Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow
Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow
I'll be the first to bossa nova
Ten thousand miles above L.ABYogid, mywldybey odn the radar
I'll bring the jive to outer space
Dancing in heaven
I never thought
I'd ever get my feet this far
Orbital be-bop
Dancing in heaven
I never thought
I'd ever get my feet this far
Orbital be-bop
Hey, here I am
I hear the universe sing
The celestial swing
I, I'm not alone
Are you receiving me clear?
There is others out here
Orbital be-bop
Orbital be-bop
Countdown, it's getting near the flight time
Night stars are shining in my eyes
Ma says I'm gonna be the first one
To dance the be-bop in the skies
Dancing in heaven
I never thought
I'd ever get my feet this far
Orbital be-bop
Dancing in heaven
I never thought
I'd ever get my feet this far
Orbital be-bop
Dancing in heaven
I never thought
I'd ever get my feet this far
Orbital be-bop
Dancing in heaven
I never thought
I'd ever get my feet this far
Orbital be-bop
