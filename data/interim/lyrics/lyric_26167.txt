Doja, Gato
Yeah 
Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way
That's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way 
I said, "Do that, do that, baby, all night long"
And I'ma turn off all my phones
You know I hate it when I'm left on read
But he make it all up in the bed
And he take me out, dinin' on nothin' but the best
He got Off-White on right, damn, he can dress
Makin' plans from the East, makin' bands in the West
Rockstar, Black Beatle type, bands on his bread
And baby, I want it, and I'll just be honest
'Cause I just can't front when I look at you
Just keep it one hundred, when I throw these hundreds
I hope that your ass gon' know what to do
Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way
That's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it 
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid 
Just like that, come my way
Gucci El Dorado, we in Rome, I'm a model 
Gucci Mane and Doja Cat, call me El Gato 
I'm the big boss and I got big bread 
I'm gettin' big-headed and I like good head 
I'm not cheap, baby, and I'm sure not selfish 
Shakin' like Elvis, damn near broke my pelvis 
Jumpin' off the top rope, got 'em tag teamin' 
Putting on a show, I got the whole crowd screamin'
Bougie with the bread, I'll knock a top-notch freak 
Act like I'm a treat when a dog see me 
Like a thief in the night, just like she stole my green
Got me walkin' off the scene like a hole in my jeans 
Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's my shit, that's my wave 
Do it like that and I'll repay it 
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid 
Just like that, come my way 
That's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way
Said I like it
I like it
I like it
I like it like that
Said I like it
I like it 
I like it
I like it like that
Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's my shit
