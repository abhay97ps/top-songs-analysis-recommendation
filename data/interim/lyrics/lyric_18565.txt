This is me 
She stole your heart
Only did it because she could
Chewed you up and spat you out
That girl never was no good 
Baby I will never do that
I'll love you faithfully
But your suspicious mind thinks
I'm gonna repeat her story
She's making you crazy
Making you a wreck
Making you follow me
Making me a suspect
You seem to think I'm playing her game
Don't you know my name
That was her, this is me
We're as different as can be
She and I are nothing alike
You're confusing day with night
That was then, this is now
You wanna trust me, but you don't know how
I'm never gonna mess around
Set you down, can't you see
That was her 
And baby this is me 
Stop making me feel bad
I'm the best thing you ever had
The only thing I'm guilty of
Is giving you too much love
She's making you crazy
Making you a wreck
Making you follow me
Making me a suspect
You seem to think I'm playing her game
Don't you know, don't you know my name
That was her, this is me 
We're as different as can be 
She and I are nothing alike 
You're confusing day with night 
That was then, this is now 
You wanna trust me, but you don't know how
I'm never gonna mess around
Set you down, can't you see 
That was her 
And baby this is me 
Don't suffocate me, give me some space
Don't make me pay for all her mistakes
Believe in the love that's in my kiss
That was her  this is me 
We're as different as can be 
She and I are nothing alike 
You're confusing day with night 
That was then, this is now 
You wanna trust me, but you don't know how 
I'm never gonna mess around
Set you down, can't you see 
That was her 
That was her, this is me 
We're as different as can be 
She and I are nothing alike 
You'r confusing day with night 
That was then, this is now 
You wanna trust me, but you don't know how
I'm never gonna mess around
Set you down, can't you see 
That was her 
And baby this is me
