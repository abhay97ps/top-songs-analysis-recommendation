Oh! Omarion 
Yeah, Song Dynasty 
Watch me get it 
I done cut the braids, low cut, got my grown on
Had to switch the label, gettin' money money long long
I be so L.A, got my Chucks and my Locs on
I was M.I.A in M.I.A superman on
I know I got it , I know she on it 
I know you see it , I know she want it 
She got that Cali good , and she kinda hood 
She got me policing and wishing that a nigga would
Cause lil' momma got her back right
She be skating on it, got a nigga seeing flashlight
They be tryna get her, but she holdin' on hella tight
I got that act right, that's what she like
I get it in , I get it in 
I get it in , I get again and again
I get it in , I get it in 
I get it in , I get again and again
Stuntin’ with them boys
Cause she done found a man now
Ain’t no competition chief I’m the one that hangs down
I’ma show her love-love even when my fans ride
G-g-g-get into the music baby tell me how my bang sound
I know I got it , I know she on it 
I know you see it , I know she want it 
She got that Cali good , and she kinda hood 
She got me policing and wishing that a nigga would
Cause lil' momma got her back right
She be skating on it, got a nigga seeing flashlight
They be tryna get her, but she holdin' on hella tight
I got that act right, that's what she like
I get it in , I get it in 
I get it in , I get again and again
I get it in , I get it in  
I get it in , I get again and again 
Burr! Burr! Gucci! Burr! Gucci!
Tennis shoes, Farrakhan, Louis V. carry on
Gucci Mane, Gucci girl, panties she ain't wearin' none
Don't want me to buy her none, man she done fired 'em
Damn near broke her neck when she seen me with Omarion
Double take, double take, let's go have a triple date
Me, you and them twins you be with - y'all think y'all can handle me?
And if I ain't putting it down right, you can cancel me
I'm married to the game, so no, you can't marry me
Champagne wishes, private jet kisses
Shanghai, Bangkok, we overseas trippin'
Pinocchio, your nose will grow, I'm smokin' dro in Tokyo
A trappa but this rappin got me going places you'll never go
I get it in , I get it in 
I get it in , I get again and again
I get it in , I get it in 
I get it in , I get again and again
Hey! Omarion. Hey!
