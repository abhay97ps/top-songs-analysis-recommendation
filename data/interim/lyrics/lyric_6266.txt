Baby, baby you know it's true
I'm a puppet just for you
I'll do anything you say
I won't have it any other way
Take my heart and take my soul
Giving you complete control
If you wanna see me do my thing
Pull my string, pull my string
Puppet man, puppet man
Baby, baby I'm your sweet pet
Just your personal marionette
Wind me up and let me go
Don't you know I'm a one-man show
Raise your finger and I'll perform
I'll cracker jack till the crack of dawn
If you wanna see me do my thing
Pull my string
Puppet man, puppet man
Puppet man, puppet man
Baby, baby I'm more than you need
Satisfaction guaranteed
Any time you feel uptight
I'm at your service
Morning, noon and night
Do what you want me to
I'm a puppet just for you
If you wanna see me do my thing
Pull my string
Puppet man, puppet man
Puppet man, puppet man
Puppet man, puppet man
Puppet man, puppet man
Puppet man, puppet man
