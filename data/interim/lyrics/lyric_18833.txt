Mmm, I really gotta know
If you trust me, do you trust me now?
Hey, I really gotta know
You know that I love you
And that ain't gon' change
And though you're not here with me now
My love for you stays the same
Don't worry about those other girls
They can't take your place
You're the only woman in my world
And you can't be replaced
You know that I love you
Girl, you're everything to me
Just let me show you
Just how much you mean to me
It's been such a long time
Since I've been with you
My friends say I should play around
They wish that they could have what I found in you
You know I'm not that other guy
Who broke your heart, mmm
You're still the only woman in my world
Even when we're apart
You know that I love you
Girl, you're everything to me
Just let me show you
Just how much you mean to me
You know that I love you
Girl, you're everything to me
Just let me show you
Just how much you mean to me
I only have eyes for you
Believe me, what I say is true
You know my heart belongs to you
You know that I love you
Girl, you're everything to me
Just let me show you
Just how much you mean to me
You know that I love you
Girl, you're everything to me
Just let me show you
Just how much you mean to me
You know that I love you
Girl, you're everything to me
Just let me show you
Just how much you mean to me
You know that I love you
Girl, you're everything to me
Just let me show you
Just how much you mean to me
