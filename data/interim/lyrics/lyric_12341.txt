All set - the court's in session
This judge's got no compassion
Witness, show me your right hand
I swear - nothing but the truth now
I was alright till she came along
I was alright, then it all went wrong
Yeah, the Devil made me do it 
It was the act of a man possessed now 
Yeah, the Devil made me do it 
Your Honor, I plead innocent
D.A.'s got a mighty strong case
Lawman saw the whole thing
Confess - yeah, I stole that fur coat
Confess - I stole a BMW
Confess - I was only trying
To keep my baby satisfied
Bullshit! - But that's the truth now
Bullshit! - So help me God!
I was alright till she came along
I was alright, then it all went wrong
Yeah, the Devil made me do it 
It was the act of a man possessed now 
Yeah, the Devil made me do it 
Your Honor, I am innocent 
Innocent! 
See her slide out of her negligee
Her skin was hot, touch intoxicating
And if you were me, you would have done the same
So spare me the gutter, save me from the ball and chain
The Devil made me do it 
It was the act of a man possessed now 
Yeah, the Devil made me do it 
Your Honor, I am innocent, innocent 
The Devil made me do it 
It was an act of self-defence now 
Yeah, the Devil made me do it 
Your Honor, it was an accident! 
The Devil made me do it
