Hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey
She was a disco queen
She came from New Orleans
Catfish was her name
Dancin' was her claim to fame
She took me to a fish fry
The girl danced all night
Catfish sure was nice
She makes my nature rise
Ooh, she was amazin'
She kept her guessin'
But Lord, as she danced across the floor
So tantalizin'
So satisfyin'
So hypnotizin'
So mesmerizin'
What a girl she is
I wanna be with her
And dance forevermore
Oh, let me tell you about
Catfish makes my nature rise
Catfish makes my nature rise
Get on down, girl
Catfish makes my nature rise
Catfish makes my nature rise
Boogie for 'em, Catfish
She makes my nature rise
Hey, hey, hey, hey Catfish
Rise
Ooh, she's amazin'
She kept everybody guessin'
You oughta been there
As she moved
And grooved across the floor
Catfish was tantalizin'
Appetizin', satisfyin'
Mesmerizin', so hypnotizin'
Yes, she can boogie
I just wanna dance with her forevermore
Let me tell y'all
Catfish makes my nature rise
Catfish makes my nature rise
Hey, listen
She's from New Orleans
Former beauty queen
Grandma raised her on collard greens
She did, hey, hey
Catfish makes my nature rise
Catfish makes my nature rise
She's got great big boots
And a booty to boot
Boy, that girl can shoot the coop
She can
Catfish
Catfish makes my nature rise
