In the dawning of the social revolution
In an age when "do you your thing" was never done
I met a woman like I'd never known
A girl with a mind of her own
She spoke freely
She began to talk about a new horizon
She said "come with me babe, we shall overcome"
She said "excuse me while I kiss the sky
You see, some folks were going to die
I was born to run"
She was a free spirit
A gypsy with an angel's wings
She was a free spirit
The answer to a dreamer's dreams
I still dream about the first time we were lovers
And I can't forget how beautiful it was 
It wasn't guilty and it wasn't a shame
It wasn't something that you've got to explain
No, it was free love
She was a free spirit
A gypsy with an angel's wings
She was a free spirit
The answer to a dreamer's dreams
A free spirit
She was a woman way ahead of her time
She had vision when the world was blind
Liberty
She was a free spirit
A gypsy with an angel's wings
She was a free spirit
The answer to all my dreams
