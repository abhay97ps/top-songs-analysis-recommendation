I don't wanna lose
This good thing, baby
That I got If I do, now
I would surely, yeah
I got to, I got to lose a lot
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know
I said it's like thunder
It's like lightning
The way you love me is frightenin'
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
Alright now
Got to tell you 'bout it now
Help them, Carla
I'm not superstitious 
About you 
But I can't take no chance
You got me spinnning, spinning
Baby, I'm in a trance
'Cause your love is better, honey
I tell you it's definitely better than anything I know
I said it's like thunder
It's like lightning
The way you love me is frightenin'
I think I better knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Alright, tell you 'bout it now
I don't see that woman - talkin' about Carla
To feel my loving come up
You got me seeing - she can really see that
That that that I can't get enough now
Otis, just one touch from you, baby
You know it means so much
I said it's like thunder
It's like lightning
The way you love me is frightenin'
I think I better knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Tell you 'bout it now
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
I think I better knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
I think I better knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
