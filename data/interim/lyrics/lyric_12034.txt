Why does your love hurt so much?
Why?
Why does you love hurt so much?
Don´t know why
You know I loved you baby
But all the while you just betrayed me
In the world of a day
All the things that you said were

You said our love was secret
But you left me alone to make it
You want to come back again someday
But darling here´s what I say
