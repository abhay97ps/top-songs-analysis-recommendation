I want it that way
I want it that way
I want it that way
I want it that way
But I don't wanna go out bad, wanna go out sad, wanna go out that way 
I'm with the winnin' team, they make sure I'm not in last place 
If I wake up, don't make no money, that's a sad day 
Twenty-five hundred on my shirt what the tag say 
I want it that way
I want it that way
I want it that way, woah
I want it that way
Woah, she from Atlanta, she went to Cascade, ayy 
She ride the D like she's tryna drag race 
Don't slow me right down, I like it fast-paced, ayy
That is enough about that girl, everyone know it is my world
If he dropped an album, thought it was trash day 
I'm on my own, not talkin' masturbate, yeah 
She gave me dome 'til I graduate, woah
I'ma grab a Bentley, Mean might go and grab a Wraith, yeah
I had to snap back into reality and go grab a fitted 
My jeans, yeah, they fitted 
But Lil Uzi, he is so far from the timid 
The reason I'm rich
'Cause I had to go and just fix my percentage 
You know that I'm winnin'
My white girl got black card and it got no limit 
I don't wanna go out bad, don't wanna go out sad, not that way 
I'm with the winnin' team, they make sure I'm not in last place 
If I wake up, don't make no money, that's a sad day 
Twenty-five hundred for my shirt what the tag say 
And I want it that way
I want it that way
I want it that way, woah
I want it that way
When I'm in DC, make the hoes go-go 
Yes, I'm slimy like a snail, but I'm no slowpoke 
Only reason I didn't kick her out 'cause she gon' deepthroat 
Hit it no protection, injection, yeah, this shit is lethal 
They laugh at me because I'm emo 
I killed my girlfriend, that's why I'm single 
Can't call 911 'cause I'm in Reno 
Gave away my thumbs and I stood three toes 
Diamonds hittin', bling, bling 
Make the chopper sing, sing 
He a killer , same thing 
Eyes low, Simmons, Ming 
I don't wanna go out bad, don't wanna go out sad, not that way
I'm with the winnin' team, they make sure I'm not in last place 
If I wake up, don't make no money, that's a sad day 
Twenty-five hundred for my shirt what the tag say 
And I want it that way
I want it that way
I want it that way, woah
I want it that way
I want it that way
I want it that way
I want it that way
I want it that way
