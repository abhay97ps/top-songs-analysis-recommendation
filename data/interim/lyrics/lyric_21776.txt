Could you be a teenage idol?
Could you be a movie star?
When I turn on my TV, will you smile and wave at me
Tellin' Oprah who you are?
So you want to be a rockstar
With blue-eyed bunnies in your bed, mmm
Well, remember when you're rich, that you sold yourself for this
You'll be famous 'cause you're dead
So don't go higher for desire
Put it in your head
Baby, Hollywood is dead
You can find it in yourself
I don't want to take you dancin'
When you're dancin' with the world
But you can flash your caviar and your million dollar car
I don't need that kind of girl
But could you be the next sensation?
Will you set the latest style?
You don't need a catchy song 'cause the kids will sing along
When you sell it with a smile
So don't go higher for desire
Put it in your head
Baby, Hollywood is dead
You can find it in yourself
So don't fly higher for your fire
Put in your head
Baby, Hollywood is dead
You can find it in yourself
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Well, you can do the money tango
You can start your little band
You can swing from vine to vine while the cuties wait in line
With the money in their hands
But if you get to California, save a piece of gold for me
If it's the only thing you'll save
Then I'll bet you'll never wave when I watch you on TV
So don't go higher for desire 
Put it in your head
Baby, Hollywood is dead, you can find it in yourself
So don't fly higher for your fire 
Put it in your head
Baby, Hollywood is dead, you can find it in yourself
Keep on lovin' what is true and the world will come to you
You can find it in yourself
Love what is true and the world will come to you
You can find it in yourself
No no no no no...
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Come, come, Hollywood is dead
Woo-hoo!
Oh, Hollywood is dead, dead, dead
Hollywood is dead, baby, baby, da da da da
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Hollywood is dead
