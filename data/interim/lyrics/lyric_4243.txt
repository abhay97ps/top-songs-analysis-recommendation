Hey, baby
Could you maybe have some love for me?
If you think so then will I know
All my possibilities of loving a stranger
Even though it can endanger
Love's a gamble
For example:
Take a chance on everything you own
Heads you win, but tails you lose
And if our love was even half that strong
We can overcome
And make two strangers become as one
Do you think it would be so hard
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh
Hey baby 
Could you maybe 
Have some love for me
If you think so 
Then will I know 
All my possibilities
Of loving a stranger
Even though it can endanger 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
