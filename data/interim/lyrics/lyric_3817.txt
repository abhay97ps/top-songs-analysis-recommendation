Do-oo-oo-oo
Hello love, nice to see you again
I hope some day we can still be friends
I know this line won't help you feel better
But a love you don't see just can't last forever
You've waited too long 
I knew I was wrong 
The day we parted I was so broken-hearted
All I could do ws thing of you and how I love started
You said some day you would return
And that's why my heart contined to burn
But you've waited too long 
I couldn't go on 
Now that I've found myself another girl 
And she loves me with all her heart 
To me she's all I need 
To make a brand new start 
For you've waited too long 
I couldn't go on
