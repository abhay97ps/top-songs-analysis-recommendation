The week was long, but now it's gone, the drink is on
So fill your cup and turn the good time music up
Pick up that sweet, somebody wrap your arms around this Friday night
Get a little lost in the party
Float your trouble like a champagne bubble, saying
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Two crazy hearts
Looking in the dark for a place to park it to their life
Find an old school way-and-bee
And put a little shine on the bottle seat
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
The night is young, the night is free, and so are we
So let it out and let me stay inside your drink
Lipstick all along
Next sipping star lie on the window tripping down
Off in the distance the lights of town
Can you see it now?
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Two crazy hearts
Looking in the dark for a place to park it to their life
Find an old school way-and-bee
And put a little shine on the bottle seat
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Two crazy hearts
Looking in the dark for a place to park it to their life
Two shots of Patron, don't wanna go home
2 AM in the morning, just you and I
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just bumpin' the night
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
