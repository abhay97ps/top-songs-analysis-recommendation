The wheel of fortune goes spinning round
Will the arrow point my way, will this be the day?
Oh, wheel of fortune, please don't pass me by
Let me know the magic of a kiss and a sigh
While the wheel is spinning, spinning, spinning
I'll not dream of winning fortune or fame
While the wheel is turning, turning, turning
I'll be ever yearning for love's precious flame
Oh, wheel of fortune, I'm hoping somehow
If you'll ever smile on me, please let it be now
