It's the motherfuckin' queen 
NBA YoungBoy, let's go 
Oh-oh, mmm, rrr 
Can't do buying all the bottles, that you can't do
'Posed to be shining, but she notice that my chain do
Late night sex, I wanna see what that mouth do
Yeah, bounce that ass, do it how your mama taught you
Real made nigga from the trenches, do no pimpin'
I got seven figures bouncin' in the car, it look like switches, uh
Let's have a drink out, after that, we can leave out
I leave the club, drivin' fast, baby, what that speed 'bout?
If you keep it real, say your needs, I'll pay the cost
Tеn thousand for her to go shopping, ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
If it's a problem, get it poppin', blow thе curb out
I spend the whole day wit' you, layin' in the loft
Not one, not two
Girl, you, I wanna see you take it off
Yeah, I'm everything you heard 'bout
Tryna see what your world 'bout, word of mouth
Can't do buying all the bottles, that you can't do
'Posed to be shining, but she notice that my chain do
Late night sex, I wanna see what that mouth do
Yeah, bounce that ass, do it how your mama taught you
Real made nigga from the trenches, do no pimpin'
I got seven figures bouncin' in the car, it look like switches, uh
Let's have a drink out, after that, we can leave out
I leave the club, drivin' fast, baby, what that speed 'bout?
Ayo, throw that bag, I'm a bad lil' bitch, nigga
Got every ex nigga mad and they big bitter
Diamonds on the chain, blingin' off my tits, nigga
I hit his phone, he gon' curve her like a pitch, nigga 
Word to me, pussy good, so he been hooked 
If he got seen out with me, it's a big look
Word to Pop, body smokin' like a big blunt
Some big dick only thing that a bitch want
Left the lot with a big body, thick thot
All my niggas in the spot, you could get got
This that .40 vaccine, you could get shot
Since you wanna be stuntin' like a big shot 
This that pretty little joint from the southside
Fuck a quarantine, all my niggas outside
If I'm sittin' on your face, keep your mouth wide
Nigga, go hard, but be gentle with my chocha
Can't do buying all the bottles, that you can't do
'Posed to be shining, but she notice that my chain do
Late night sex, I want see what that mouth do
Yeah, bounce that ass, do it how your mama taught you
Real made nigga from the trenches, do no pimpin'
I got seven figures bouncin' in the car, it look like switches, uh
Let's have a drink out, after that, we can leave out
I leave the club, drivin' fast, baby, what that speed 'bout?
Skrrt, vroom, she tell me "Face it," I face it
I say "This metal that you ridin', please cherish, don't break it"
You wanna be my girl? Be real, you get put in that placement
I'm in here with my boy Mike WiLL
I meant to say that's who made it 
Uh, ooh, came through swervin' through
In a brand new coupe, with some Forgiato shoes
Real nigga, Blues Clues
If you sleep on that money, then you lose
I don't snooze, you a fool, I'm the truth
Can't do buying all the bottles, that you can't do
'Posed to be shining, but she notice that my chain do
Late night sex, I want see what that mouth do
Yeah, bounce that ass, do it how your mama taught you
Real made nigga from the trenches, do no pimpin'
I got seven figures bouncin' in the car, it look like switches, uh
