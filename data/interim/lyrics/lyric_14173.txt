Can't you find something else to talk about?
Is this song the only one you sing?
Makes you look better when you put things down
Value your opinion
Don't criticize my friends
Criticize my ideas
Don't criticize my lifestyle
I'm fed up 'cause all you wanna do is criticize
Don't just close your mind
Ooh ooh 
You don't realize 
I just want what is right
Still you say
Criticize
Now can't we start this over?
'Cause your conversation ain't right
We can make our love stronger
You don't have to think twice
Don't criticize my friends
Criticize my ideas
Don't criticize my lifestyle
I'm fed up 'cause all you wanna do is criticize
Don't just close your mind
Ooh ooh 
You don't realize 
I just want what is right
Still you say
Criticize
Don't just close your mind
Ooh ooh 
You don't realize 
I just want what is right
Still you say
Criticize
Don't criticize my motive
Criticize my feeling
Don't criticize my business
I'm fed up 'cause all you wanna do is criticize
Don't just close your mind
Ooh ooh 
You don't realize 
I just want what is right
Still you say
Criticize 
Don't just close your mind
Ooh ooh 
You don't realize 
I just want what is right
Still you say
Criticize
Gotta be your man
Stand beside me, baby
Don't you go walking out that door
No no no, no, baby
Don't just close your mind
Ooh ooh 
You don't realize
I just want what is right
Still you say
Criticize
Don't just close your mind
Ooh ooh
You don't realize
I just want what is right
Still you say
Criticize
