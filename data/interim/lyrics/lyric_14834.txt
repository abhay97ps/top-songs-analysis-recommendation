Your cruel device
Your blood, like ice
One look, could kill
My pain, your thrill
I wanna love you, but I better not touch 
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much 
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains
Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace, on sweat
I hear you calling and it's needles and pins 
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't wanna touch you but you're under my skin 
I wanna kiss you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains
Poison
One look,  could kill 
My pain, your thrill
I want to love you, but I better not touch 
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much 
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains
Poison 
I want to love you but I better not touch 
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much 
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
Yeah!
Well, I don't want to break these chains
Poison  no
Runnin' deep inside my veins
Burnin' deep  inside my brain
Poison 
I don't want  to break these chains
Poison
