While browsing through a pawn shop
I saw this old guitar
It's keys were bent and rusty
It's body scratched and scared
Holy- moses
Would you believe that guitar began to talk
I swear it did
Now it's not like your thinkin
I wasn't stoned or drinkin
When I heard that talkin Guitar say
My Daddy was a gibson
My Mama was a Fender
That's why they call me Mindbender
Mindbender. That's my name
You better believe it
It was a mind-bending thing
I said now listen Guitar
What you tryin to do
People will think I'm crazy
If they see me talkin to you
He said
*What's that you say*
I Said You Better Hold Your Tongue
Now it's not like your thinkin
I wasn't stoned or drinkin
I swear I heard that Guitar say
My Daddy was a gibson
My Mama was a Fender
That's why they call me Mindbender
Mindbender. That's my name My Name
You better believe it Brother
It was a Mind Bending thing
And Talk Box
