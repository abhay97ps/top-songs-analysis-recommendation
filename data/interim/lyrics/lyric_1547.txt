One time a long time ago
On a mountain in Switzerland, yo lo lo lo
There lived a fair young maiden
Lovely but lonely, oh oh oh oh
Day after day, she'd pine her heart away
Yo lo lo lo lady yay
But no love came her way
One day, her papa said, "Some day we'll go down to the village
In the valley, there you'll meet a nice young man, he'll ask for your hand
Then you'll be happy"
But every day she grew unhappier
On a mountain in Switzerland, yo lo lo lo
Every day a little bit lonelier
Which way to turn and which way to go
Day after day, she'd pine her heart away
Yo lo lo lo lady yay
But no love came her way
Some say the maiden's dream never came true
She never got to go to the valley
If she did or not, I really don't know, oh oh oh oh
Did she die unhappy?
I'd rather think she found her love
Wouldn't you rather think she did find love?
Somewhere, some way
Yo lo lady yay, yo lo lady yay
