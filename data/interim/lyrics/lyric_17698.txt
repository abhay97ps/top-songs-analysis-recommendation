I still love you, babe
I'm still for you, girl
I'll never leave you, baby 
'Cause I realize I need you in my life 
Girl, it just ain't right
What we said last night
'Cause I know we didn't mean it 
You feel the love is gone 
'Cause we don't get along
But I can prove you wrong
Girl, I swear
'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see you 
And how I wanna live my life is with you
There is no one
You're all I need and all I want
The only one I'll ever love
I still love you, babe
I'm still for you, girl
I'll never leave you, baby
'Cause I realize I need you in my life 
In this relationship we spend alot of time
Now it would be wrong if everything was always fine
Girl, I know we've had our shares of ups and downs 
But it doesn't mean that we can't work this out
Oh baby girl, I care, yeah
You know I do 
'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see you 
And how I wanna live my life with you, oh
There is no one else
You're all I need and all I want
The only one I'll ever love, yeah
I still love you, babe
I'm still for you, girl
I'll never leave you, baby
'Cause I realize I need you in my life 
'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see you
And how I wanna live my life with you
There is no one else
You're all I want and all I'll need
The only one I'll ever love
I still love you, babe
I'm still for you, girl
I'll never leave you, baby
'Cause I realize I need you in my life
I still love you, babe
I'm still for you, girl
I'll never leave you, baby
'Cause I realize I need you in my life
I still love you, babe
I'm still for you, girl
I'll never leave you, baby
'Cause I realize I need you in my life
