If you need a strong hand
To guide you through the night
If you want someone who understands
Then things can't get uptight
If it means anything to you
To know that I care for you
Check it out 
Oh, check it out 
I understand complications
Can sometimes bring you down
A different situation
Doesn't always be around
And if it means anything to you
To know that I care for you
Check it out 
Baby, check it out 
Oh...you know my love is here to stay
And it will always be that way
Look at me 
Oh, look at me 
Oh...surely you must know
My love will always grow
Can't you see 
Mmm, can't you see 
Ooh, can't you see 
There may not be a dreary day
For you to suffer through {No, no, no, no}
If you would let me lead the way
I'd give the world to you
And if it means anything to you
Hey
Check it out 
Baby, check it out 
Check out your mind 
Check it out 
Look into my eyes, girl {Look into my eyes}
Look into my eyes 
Check it out 
Mmm, check it out 
Check out your mind 
Oh, check it out 
Look into my eyes, girl {Look into my eyes}
Look into my eyes 
Check it out 
Check it out 
Check out your mind
