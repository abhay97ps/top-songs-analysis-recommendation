Get get get in line, and settle down
Get in line, and settle down
What's your twenty?
Where's your brain?
Checking in to check you out
Concerned about your whereabouts
Copy that, you're acting strange
So tell me what is going on
So heavy I bet
I'm fine 
I'm hella positive for real, I'm all good no
I'm fine 
It's gotten complicated that's for sure
But you can see it my eyes, you can read on my lips
I'm trying to get a hold on this
And I really mean it this time
And you know it's such a trip
Don't get me started
I'm trying to get a hold on this
Get get get in line, and settle down
Get in line, and settle down
No big deal 
It'll bounce off me 
Been around the block before
Doesn't matter anymore
Here we go again 
Are you insane? 
Underneath the avalanche
So heavy again
I'm fine 
I'm hella positive for real, I'm all good no
I'm fine 
It's gotten complicated that's for sure
But you can see it my eyes, you can read on my lips
I'm trying to get a hold on this
And I really mean it this time
And you know it's such a trip
Don't get me started
I'm trying to get a hold on this
Get get get in line, and settle down
Get in line, and settle down
I'm a rough and tough, I'm a rough and tough
And nothing's gonna knock this girl down
I'm a rough and tough, I'm a rough and tough
And nothing's gonna knock this girl down
I'm a rough and tough, I'm a rough and tough
And nothing's gonna knock this girl down
I'm a rough and tough, I'm a rough and tough
But you can see it my eyes, you can read on my lips
I'm trying to get a hold on this
And I really mean it this time
And you know it's such a trip
Don't get me started
I'm trying to get a hold on this
I'm trying to get a hold on this
I'm trying to get a hold on this
Don't get me started
I'm trying to get a hold on this
Get get get in line, and settle down
Get in line, and settle down
Get get get in line, and settle down
Get in line, and settle down
Get get get in line, and settle down
Get in line, and settle down
Get, get, get
Get, get, get
Get in line, and settle down
