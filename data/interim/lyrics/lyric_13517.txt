Don't count on me, I engineer
On every move we make from here
I'll take the lead
You take the pain
You see, I engineered this game
Who do you think you fool when you talk about us?
Why do you walk on glass when you know it cuts?
There must be a reason why
You put my life in overdrive
I'm up to here with push and shove...
From here on in, I've had enough!
Don't count on me, I engineer
On every move we make from here
I'll take the lead
You take the pain
You see, I engineered this game
I'll leave it all behind in a cloud of dust
There's an even chance I'll shine or rust
On my own I've got the time...
There's a light ahead at the end of the line
Seeing you leaves me no doubt
I'll take the wheel from here on out
Don't count on me, I engineer
On every move we make from here
I'll take the lead
You take the pain
You see, I engineered this game
On my own I've got the time...
There's a light ahead at the end of the line
Seeing you leaves me no doubt
I'll take the wheel from here on out
Don't count on me, I engineer
On every move we make from here
I'll take the lead
You take the pain
You see, I engineered...
