 Wassup, boo? 
Hahahaha, yeah, that's right
Another shady mission 
Tricks, like watching pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love making, take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see 'em grow?
Though I don't know
I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go
No broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in Heaven, 'cause bein' here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothin' but pain, the world is crazy
Still, looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right
I wanna be the one who 
Who you can depend on who 
Who'll be the one who'll be there 
 Through the thick and thin 
Oh, go by the water, we will 
Be there 'til the morning
We won't leave until the night 
And we will be forever more
No one else can do what you do for me
Take me away from the pain I feel inside 
And it's gonna be alright and it'll be ok
If we try and take our time
Please, baby, take your time
And we'll grow, trust I know
I wanna be the one who
I wanna be the one who 
Who you can depend on who 
Who'll be the one who'll be there 
Through the thick and thin
Go by the water we will 
Be there 'til the morning 
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more 
You gotta playa cards right on one 
Can't be rushing like it's a race, nomsayin'? 
If you be patient, and you take your time 
And you finesse it, nine times out of ten times 
Homeboy, you gon' wake up with your breakfast in bed
But if you rush, and you just be manhandlin'
 Yeah, go home tonight, haha
Playa cards right, nigga 
Take your time 
Be patient, go slow, it's better that way 
Haha, playa your cards right 
I wanna be the one who 
Who you can depend on who 
Who'll be the one who'll be there 
Through the thick and thin 
Go by the water we will 
Be there 'til the morning 
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more 
Take your time, nigga 
Don't be in such a rush 
Haha
You got to be patient, man, be patient, haha 
It ain't going nowhere one, haha 
Get some champagne 
Bring some roses or somethin', you know
Play some soft shit, light a fire 
You got to be cool with it 
You got to be slow with it 
You got to be patient, haha
You got to playa your cards right on one
Can't be rushing like it's a race, nomsayin'? 
If you be patient, and you take you time, and you finesse it
Yeah, I'll tell him to take it slow
Everybody's movin' so fast these days
Shoulda listened to every word you said
They gon' you love you 'cause you beautiful
But it's another reason why they wanna hurt you
But you know, rest in peace, bruh
