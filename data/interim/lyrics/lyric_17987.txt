If I had big arms like Aaron Tippin
I could have all the country girls flippin'
Tight jeans like Neil McCoy
I'd have all the ladies sayin' 'come here boy'
An Elvis quiver in my voice
From all the women I could have my choice
John Michael Montgomery charm
I'd have cuttin' wood honeys hangin' on my arms
Yeah I'd be on top of the world
I'd have all the pretty girls
And I'd be in on all the action
If I had long legs like Alan Jackson
If I had George Strait's famous smile
I'd have the women just a goin' hog wild
Eyes just like Tracy Byrd
I'd give 'em love lessons like they deserve
Jump around like Brooks 'n Dunn
Little Miss Honky Tonk would be number one
If I could growl like ol' Conway
Sayin' 'Hello Darlin' when they come my way
Yeah I'd be on top of the world
I'd have all the pretty girls
And I'd be in on all the action
If I had long legs like Alan Jackson
If I had Billy Ray's way of shakin'
I'd have the ladies' hearts achy breakin'
Put the girls in a screamin fit
If I had hair like Travis Tritt
Leather pants like Dwight Yokam
I'd have 'em all on the dancefloor smokin'
Wore a hat just like Garth Brooks
I'd be the one gettin' all the looks
Yeah I'd be on top of the world
I'd have all the pretty girls
And I'd be in on all the action
If I had long legs like Alan Jackson
I'm sure all the girls agree
That I could use some of these things
I'd be in on all the action
If I had long legs like Alan Jackson
I'd be the main attraction
If I had long legs
Like Alan Jackson
