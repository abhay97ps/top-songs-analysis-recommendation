Hahaha
Alright, yeah
Alright
First of all...
When you wake up in the evening and the day is shot
Find yourself complaining about the things you ain't got
Never goes just the way you want it to
Clich√© of the day, "c'est la vie", that's just life
It ain't easy, it's so tough, it ain't easy
Put a smile on your face
Make the world a better place
Put a smile on your face
Put a smile on your face
Make the world a better place
Put a smile on your face
You can say that I'm a dreamer and you think it's uncool
Preaching about the better life I learned in school
But you get what you give in this life that we live
And all that you do will come back to you
Life , it ain't easy
It's so tough, 
It ain't easy
Put a smile on your face
Make the world a better place
Put a smile on your face
Put a smile on your face
Make the world a better place
Put a smile on your face
Yo
When things isn't right, there's not need to fight-a
From when you have life and everything nice-a
Love all your elders, please be polite
Even when you're hurting, don't forget to smile
Give love to all nation, big or small
When you do good, you'll get your reward
United we stand, divided we fall
Put a smile pon your face and greet one and all
Life, it ain't easy, oh it's so tough, it ain't easy
Put a smile on your face
Make the world a better place
Put a smile on your face
Put a smile on your face 
Make the world a better place
Put a smile on your face
Put a smile on your face 
Make the world a better place
Put a smile on your face
Put a smile on your face 
Make the world a better place
Put a smile on your face 
People love you when you smile
And hate you when you screw
Lots of happiness, rasta knows, we are wishing you
You coulda come from Jamaica or Honolulu, aye
Keep a smile on your face and see the good that you do
Wha' me say you fi do?!
Smile , and everything will be fine
You done know a the vibes  it gives me inside
Love it when you smile, you look beautiful like that
Come again from top, haha
Your dimples are so cute, hahaha
I love the happiness, zeen!
Smile
