Welcome all new lovers 
To the land of love 
New lovers here you'll find the happiness
That you've been dreaming of
Welcome all new lovers 
It's so fabulous 
New lovers, when you gave your heart away
That made you one of us
New lovers, you've passed 
You gave 
Until 
For someone somewhere
All the stars are twinkling 
In the sky above 
They're saying "Welcome all new lovers"
"Into the land of love"
