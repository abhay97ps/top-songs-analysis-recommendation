A wild ride, over stony ground
Such a lust for life, the circus comes to town
We are the hungry ones, on a lightning raid
Just like a river runs, like a fire needs flame
Oh, I burn for you
I got to feel it in my blood, whoa, oh
I need your touch don't need your love, whoa, oh
And I want, and I need, and I lust, animal
And I want, and I need, and I lust, animal
I cry wolf, given mouth to mouth
Like a moving heartbeat, in the witching hour
I'm running with the wind, a shadow in the dust
And like the driving rain, hey, like the restless rust
I never sleep
Huh! Oh! Cry wolf baby, cry tough
Going to hunt you like an, uh, uh, animal
Going to take your love and run
And I want 
And I need 
And I lust 
Animal 
And I want 
And I need 
And I lust 
Animal 
And I want 
And I need 
And I lust 
Animal 
And I want 
And I need 
And I lust
Animal
