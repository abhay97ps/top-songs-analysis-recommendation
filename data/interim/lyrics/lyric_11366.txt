All I need is your precious love
Leaving me waiting ain't good enough
A thousand nights pass me by
Needing you near me, keep me alive
How long  can I go on 
Please tell me now, 'cause I don't know how
Help me! 
I'm a lonely girl in an empty world outside
Won't somebody keep me satisfi-i-ied?
We're two of a kind
Baby, baby, baby, don't leave me behind
Love don't last forever, it's only a dream
Keeping the fire burning, if you know what I mea-ea-ean
It's easy to see
Baby, baby, baby, don't tell me
How did I believe in you
Being a part of things that you do
You keep on saying we don't belong
Love is for losers, my love is wrong
How long  can I go on 
Please tell me now, 'cause I don't know how
Help me! 
I'm a lonely girl in an empty world outside
