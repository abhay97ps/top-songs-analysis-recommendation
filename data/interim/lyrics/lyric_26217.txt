 Look
Pop Smoke, I'm on some west coast shit 
In New York, I got a west coast bitch 
Huncho on that west coast shit 
Left wrist, both wrists and some bricks 
If the opps is in the spot, red dot 'em 
Somebody call Batman, I'm robbin' 
I got 'em, smoke, I pop 'em
Put the bitch on Prada and now she proper
T-Raww, I'm on some west coast shit 
LaFeezy, live on the Sunset Strip 
Today was a good day, fly as a blimp 
I just booked a round trip, I don't argue with the bitch 
And my Spanish bitch talk spicy with the lips
When the car worth a M, you don't gotta touch the rim
Don't ask me the price, cost an arm, leg, and limb 
When you in the light, niggas wanna steer you dim 
Where you get that from? Niggas gotta say it's him
Wanna copy my flow, I switch this shit again
Niggas ain't put the work, they don't celebrate the win
When you was ballin' with your bitch, I was shootin' in the gym, motherfucker, ah
Pop Smoke, I'm on some west coast shit 
In New York, I got a west coast bitch 
Huncho on that west coast shit 
Left wrist, both wrists and some bricks 
If the opps is in the spot, red dot 'em 
Somebody call Batman, I'm robbin' 
I got 'em, smoke, I pop 'em
Put the bitch on Prada and now she proper
Christian Louboutins like I stepped in pasta
But I'll still steam his ass, hot grabba
I'm in that new Dior, Quay in that Prada
Don't get it confused, I'll drop him
Four door niggas ridin' strap, get straight hacked to the back
We don't play disrespect, real talk this not just rap
Gang ties in my tat, .22's in the shed
Shotgun in my bag, knock off a nigga dreads
Thirty-six karats on my wrist
That mean there's thirty-six karats on my bitch 
Shit, how Virgil got me drippin'
And it's straight from the faucet in the kitchen
Pop Smoke, I'm on some west coast shit 
In New York, I got a west coast bitch 
Huncho on that west coast shit 
Left wrist, both wrists and some bricks 
If the opps is in the spot, red dot 'em 
Somebody call Batman, I'm robbin' 
I got 'em, smoke, I pop 'em
Put the bitch on Prada and now she proper 
West side, North side, yessir 
East side, south side, let's go to work 
Right hand in the air, let's pop a Perc' 
New coupe off the lot, skrrt in the dirt 
She came in last place, she can get a shirt 
If she go to first place, baby get a purse 
Cook it in the left hand, whip it in reverse 
Dead man in the hearse when the gang purge 
500K on the wrist , look at me scorin' your bitch 
My diamonds close and they kiss, the skelly came with a fish 
I catch a playoff assist, now watch it jump out the pit 
I can't get caught in the mix
I make a hit, I can't miss 
Pop Smoke, I'm on some west coast shit 
In New York, I got a west coast bitch 
Huncho on that west coast shit 
Left wrist, both wrists and some bricks 
If the opps is in the spot, red dot 'em
