While he was schemin'
I was beamin' in the Beamer just steamin'
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'
So I found another way to make him pay for it all
So I went to Neiman Marcus on a shopping spree-ah
And on my way, I grabbed Sole and Mia
And as the cashbox rang, I thought everything away
 There goes the dreams we used to say
 There goes the time we spent away
 There goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that now
 There goes the house we've made a home
 There goes "You'll never leave me alone"
 For all the lies you told
This is what you're owed
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
While he was braggin'
I was coming down the hill just draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in a bag and
Sold everything else 'til there was just nothing left
And I paid, all the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just fade away, away
 There goes the dreams we used to say
 There goes the time we spent away
 There goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that now
 There goes the house we've made a home
 There goes "you'll never leave me alone"
 For all the lies you told
This is what you owe
Hey ladies , when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh , when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
Hey ladies , when ya man wanna get buck wild 
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If you mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
All of the dreams you sold
Left me out in the cold
What happened to the days when we used to trust each other?
And all of the things I sold
Will take you until you get old
To get 'em back without me
'Cause revenge is just better than money, you'll see
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style 
Get your hands on his cash and 
Oh, when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up 
Hey ladies 
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh no, oh no, yeah, oh oh oh
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up 
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild 
Just go back and hit 'em up style 
Get your hands on his cash and 
Oh, when you go then everything goes 
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
