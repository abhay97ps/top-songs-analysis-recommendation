Four black walls
With missing corners
I'm trapped inside this den of torture
This darkness is consuming me
With a silence so still
It's blinding me
My mind goes into overdrive
And it feels like no time passes by
All I can think of is the life I lived
Is this my hell? My seventh sin?
I say to myself
It's all in your head
You'll soon wake up in your bed
There's a demon on my shoulder
Haunting me
You're all poluted
By your own neglect to see
All your past conquests
All your pathetic lack of ideas
We all fail sometimes
That's a fact of life
Just open your mind
And turn things back around
There's no one holding you back but yourself
Let go of the hate
Show youâ€™re free
And paint the world
With your love
With my heart
In your hand
Absorb the tragedies
Fade them from
My memory
Don't let go
Just hold on
Collapse my walls of sanity
I'll finally be free
My mind goes into overdrive
And it feels like no time whatsoever passes by
There is no time to lose
There is no looking back
This is your heaven
This is your hell
You're all polluted
By your own neglect to see
All your past conquests
All your pathetic lack of ideas
With my heart
In your hand
Absorb the tragedies
Fade them from my memories
Don't let go
Just hold on
Collapse my walls of sanity
I'll finally be free
The final sunset
The dawn of man
We're all in limbo
We're out of time
