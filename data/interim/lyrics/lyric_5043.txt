It's a strange, strange world we live in, Master Jack
You taught me all I know, and I'll never look back
It's a very strange world, and I thank you, Master Jack
You took a coloured ribbon from out of the sky
And taught me how to use it as the years went by
To tie up all your problems and make them look neat
And then to sell them to the people in the street
It's a strange, strange world we live in, Master Jack
You taught me all I know, and I'll never look back
It's a very strange world and I thank you, Master Jack
I saw right through the way you started teachin' me now
So some day soon you could get to use me somehow
I thank you very much and know you've been very kind
But I'd better move along before you change my mind
It's a strange, strange world we live in, Master Jack
No hard feelings if I never come back
It's a very strange world, and I thank you, Master Jack
You taught me all those things the way you'd like them to be
But I'd like to see if other people agree
It's all very int'resting the way you disguise
But I'd like to see the world through my own eyes
It's a strange, strange world we live in, Master Jack
No hard feelings if I never come back
You're a very strange man, and I thank you, Master Jack
You're a very strange man, and I thank you, Master Jack
You're a very strange man, aren't you, Master Jack?
