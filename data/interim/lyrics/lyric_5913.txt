Carry me back
Carry me back
Carry me back, I been away too long
I'm goin' home where I belong
Oh for the pillow where my head used to lay
'Fore I left to be a grown man, way back then
I miss the wooden kitchen floor
Painted brown to match the old back door
In my old Kentucky home where I belong
Carry me back
Carry me back
Carry me back, I been away so long
I'm goin' back where I come from
Something I read one day might have heard somebody say
Made me leave my happy home, sure I neer left
Fortune waitin' in the city, pretty women just like in the movies
The craziest mess you ever wanna see
Carry me back
Carry me back, ain't nothin' here for me
Carry me back, I wanna get back home
Take me back where I belong
Yeah yeah Lord Almighty, I sure learned a lot
Enough to send me back where I come from
To that old Kentucky home far away yeah
Carry me back
Carry me back, where I belong now
Carry me back, I wanna get back home
Take me back where I belong
Carry me back
Carry me back
Carry me back, I wanna get back home
Take me back where I come from
