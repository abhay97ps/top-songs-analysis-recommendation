You don't know where we stand
It's true
Know the plan
Last time I wrecked it, last time I whipped around
Last time I did the whippets , last time I live reverse 
Pour the brown, hit the reverend , last time I hit your crib 
Last time there was no tenants 
I done went back in myself, felt like Hell
Fuck, I risked it, patience sеll 
Found you livin', know you thrillin', not for sinnin' 
How I got my stripes and pеndants, backin' out in the street 
What is wild, let it be, ragers out, gotta eat 
Not a vibe  but a wave, with the sound by the way
Count it down, by the days 
To myself, know they wicked, with the moves 
I'm drinkin', off the juice, know I'm drinkin'
I be smooth, then I lose it, yeah, yeah now
You don't know where we stand 
It's true 
Know the plan
Close the opera
Hear the red and blue outside, I think our option's up
I recrossed it 'round the map, I had to line it up
I be swervin' on the waves, it's like a line of us 
Move in 'verse on my turf, I'm outta line, I put in work
I draw the line and cross it first
I need the time, I need to search
It's just like wine, it make it worse
Skrrt, skrrt in the 'Vert, skrrt, skrrt
Ride on land, Boeing jet, make it land
In slow motion when I dance
In your eyes I see your trance
I run away and then you prance 
If I show the hideaway would you hide out and let it blam? 
Ain't no time, I'm facin' scams, nah, nah 
You don't know where we stand 
It's true 
Ooh
