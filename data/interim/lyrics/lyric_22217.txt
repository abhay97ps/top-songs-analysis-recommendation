Yeah
You know a nigga don't really wanna take his cool off, uh
 I'll express this, though
She call me early in the morning 
When she’s all alone 
I'ma take my time 
Do it how we want 
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, yeah
She love the way I’m doing it 
So good she won't put my tattoo on it 
Bottom line is , you the finest
Gave you a new name
 My bitch
Hold up, hold up, whoa there
Let's capture this moment 
If I hit it then I own it, marijuan'-in' every mornin' 
And Patrón-ing, girl, we groaning 
But that pussy got me feeling like a kid with the street lights on
 'Cause you know I gotta go in 'til it's
Early in the morning 
When she's all alone 
I'ma take my time 
Do it how we want 
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play 
The long way 
The strong way 
It's our day 
It's our way 
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up
Talk to the, talk to the hand
Bitch, you talking to a grown ass man
It's, like, way-way-way too much up in your pants
For us not to make the bed squeak
Everybody rip the swag off 'fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off? 'Cause I'm rapping my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it? The fucking anthem?
Ah!
Early in the morning 
When she's all alone 
I'ma take my time 
Do it how we want 
They say, "Yeezy, yeah, he just did it again!"
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play 
The long way 
The strong way 
It's our day 
It's our way 
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
I be saying, I, uh, I think
When I know, uh, just because
I don’t really wanna, uh, talk too much shit
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when you blazin'
And I swear you turn at least half-Asian
And we about to have a liaison
She so cool, give head with her shades on 
You should just go and throw a cape on 
And it's just so amazing
So amazing, so amazing
Take it to the car, bloop, bloop
That shit look like I'm speed racing
Leavin' with me, it'll boost your reputation
West side is where I'm stationed
Spend all night, just champagne-tasting
Ain't no rush, girl, let's just pace it 'til it's
Early in the morning 
When she's all alone 
I'ma take my time 
Do it how we want 
Just to set the mood, girl 
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play 
The long way 
The strong way 
It's our day 
It’s our way 
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
And this was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
