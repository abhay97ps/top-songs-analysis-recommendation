Another smooth production
High intelligence
Masterful compositions
I'm seeing shit at different angles...
Fur coats, radio bump the Hall & Oates
I was a youngin tryin to learn the ropes
Makin trips, tryin to earn the dough
I build a solid foundation
You off balance with the vertigo
Take a sip, strong drink, shit will burn your throat
Dressed to kill, fresh to death, far as murders go
Been a couple, that's what the cops searching for
Took em down on my first approach, no witness
No prejudice, I'm where the money is
Benefits, splitting profit percentages
Reup trips, scales making on point measurements
Kush smoke fill the room with no residence
Vacant houses turn to laboratories
Cops tryin to hunt us down, serve us cacciatore
I don't know a damn thing and that's the story
Pour the liquor for my people that done passed before me
My dude Big Bird, shit is different now
The Dolphins on the come up, the Raptors winning now
Been a minute though somewhere I know you still livin
I'm just tryin to be big pimpin
These are scribes of my last hours
Man power, whole team profit off grams of powder
Cops hit you then the plan's sour
Florida rain, another sun shower
Another sun shower
Yo they say I'm old school like it's '72
Feel the essence when I enter the room, yo it's real
Cause these youngins all got a hot head and it's true
Point the metal and shoot
That's how they settle disputes
I'm feelin hungry, whole team gonna eat soon
Fuck a French model bitch inside the steam room
Took it back to the penthouse, that's 4 seasons
4:30 in the morning, that's a short evening
Hangovers, waffle house got the remedy
Brush my teeth with 2 shots of Hennessy
Greek goddess in the sheets feel heavenly
Travel round the world till I piss in all 7 seas
I don't need a diamond chain without the carrots in
I'm bout to take a trip to Paris with a pair of twins
I'm in the field, villains in the caravan
And that's the don Skuddy Ranks patrol the garrison
Make the pot crumble, play the block humble
Oh you got bundles? Then I cause fumbles
Perfect the hustle with the repetition
Yo I'm painting pictures so you get the vision
These are scribes of my last hours
Man power, whole team profit off grams of powder
Cops hit you then the plan's sour
Florida rain, another sun shower
Another sun shower
