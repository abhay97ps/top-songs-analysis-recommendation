I don't like cities, but I like New York
The famous places to visit are so many
Other places make me feel like a dork
I told my grandpa I wouldn't miss on any
Los Angeles is for people who sleep
Got to see the whole town right from Yonkers on down to the Bay
Paris and London, oh, baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep
Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad except New York, New York
It's a wonderful town 
I love New York
I love New York 
I love New York 
New York, New York
If you don't like my attitude then you can get lost
 Are dressed in silk and satin
 Isn't that where they golf?
 important in Manhattan
New York is not for little wussies who scream
AAAHHH!
Pick up a date
Maybe seven or eight
Paris and London, oh baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep!
Other cities always make me mad {Make me mad}
Other places always make me sad {Make me mad}
No other city ever made me glad except New York, New York
It's a wonderful town 
I love New York
I love New York 
I love New York 
We've sailed the seas
And we've been the world over
Made the Mandalay
We've seen the Sphinx
And we've seen the Cliffs of Dover
And we can safely say
New York!
Other cities always make me mad 
Other places always make me sad 
No other city ever made me glad except New York, New York
It's a wonderful town 
I love New York
I love New York 
{I love New York} 
I love New York
New York now
New York, New York!
