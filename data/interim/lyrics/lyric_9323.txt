Forever lovers, forever friends
A lifetime's a short time
When love never ends
They checked into a small hotel
She blushed when he asked
For the bridal suite
Was the beginning of their lives together
Anxiously they'd waited for the moment
That their love would be complete
She reached inside
Her brand new traveling bag
And found her brand new negligee
And then she shyly slipped it on
And suddenly, he realized
The beauty of the tender prize
He'd waited for so long and finally won
She climbed into the bed
He snapped his fingers
Said, I've got to get champagne
There's a little store right down the block
I'll only be a minute, close your eyes
And, hon, I'll be right back again
And time goes by so slowly
She's not sure how much has passed
When she hears the siren
Screaming through the night
And seven hours later, they find her
Rocking on the bed
Just singing in the early morning light
Forever lovers, forever friends
A lifetime's a short time
When love never ends
She checks into the old hotel
And pays a little extra for the suite
She slips into the faded negligee
And brushes down her hair of gray
And lays her body down to wait
And the night air through the curtains
Makes a sound like someone breathing
And she reaches for him with her fingertips
And they find her in the morning
With tear stains on her pillow
And a smile like a kiss upon her lips
Forever lovers, forever friends
A lifetime's a short time
I knew I'd see you again
Forever lovers, forever friends
A lifetime's a short time
When love never ends
