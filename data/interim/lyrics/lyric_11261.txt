You're so afraid of being wrong
Your chances will be gone
Before you choose one
And someone has to lose
It's getting late
So throw it in
'Cause everyone loses
If nobody wins
Whatever you decide
Whatever you decide
It's alright
You can try and play two sides
You won't make love
But you won't have to fight one
It never is clean cut
Black or white
Wrong or right
That high wire you're on
Wears thin 'til it's gone
Whatever you decide
Whatever you decide
It's alright by me
Whatever you decide
Whatever you decide
It's alright by me
