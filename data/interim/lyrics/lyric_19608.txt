I've got some big news
The bank finally came through
And I'm holding the keys to
A brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside?
It sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake
There's a place I know about
Where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl, I can hardly wait
To get a little mud on the tires
Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere
Only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires
Moonlight on a duck blind
Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine
This time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singing in the background
And more stars than you can count
On a night this clear
I tell you what we need to do
Is grab a sleeping bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck
We might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires
Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere
Only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires
And then with a little luck
We might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires
