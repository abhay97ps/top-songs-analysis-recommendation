Ay
Started from the bottom now i'm getting figures, but
Way before this rap shit bitch I been that nigga
Ay, 16 fucking bitches 30 they can't get enough, cause
Way before this rap shit bitch I been that nigga
I know that they mad i see their temper tantrums
Wonder why i'm humble they can't understand it
When I got them racks up I just rubber band em
Nigga now my momma live in a mini mansion
And i'm at the top now and they still can't stand it
They know where i come from i'm a fucking bandit
Started from the bottom now i'm getting figures, but
Way before this rap shit bitch i been that nigga
Big G Herbo bitch I been that nigga Ay
Ever since i was 15 been about my figures
By my 17th birthday i had a 50 remember right before my 18th birthday i crashed them Hemi
Way before this rap shit Lil Roc knew i had it in me
Way before this rap shit white folks knew i had it in me
Freestyling on that hot shit block shit few blocks past the enemy
Fully autos we got plenty bitch we blast at any
Start sipping 8s of act with kobe made me break my kidneys
And now I still might sip a 4 way just because I miss him
And i rap about that trap shit i was in the kitchen
Folk nem copped their first book i was right there my left wrist a 50
And if the feds come I won't write them I might forget to mention
They ain't cut from my cloth they ain't like that man these niggas bitches
I don't want no fuck niggas around me thats a disposition
I don't do no rap beef nigga try me pistol whip or strip him
Pussy better mind your business my little killas itching
Disrespect No Limit thats a bad decision
Lil bro tote that glizzy and he got precision
Told him just get money and play your position
Bitch i been that nigga ever since elementary
Always in the mix I used to get suspensions
Now my whips like bitches cause thats how I switch em
Got my bitches switching kissing lied say that i missed them
Growing up I ran the streets I learned a lot of wisdom
Always use your head and duck that prison system
Broski told me take care of business I can't lie I listened
He supposed to be still here right with me and thats why i miss him

Two 30s and one 50 round thats how I ride around
Fuck nigga you don't fit around you on the wrong side of town
And you best turn that 50 around I mean correct it now
If this was back in 2009 folk nem would of wet you down
RIP grandma I miss you I won't let you down
I know you ain't hurting no more you ain't stressing now
Member on the phone you said you want a platinum Album
Its 3:21 i'm thinking of them records now
Coming up my momma said I wasn't a bad kid
I just made my choices and dealt with them as is
Now i pay my momma rent i'm talking cash shit
I see their fake smiles in my face like they ain't mad shit
I know they hating when i did it they still say I didn't
Street nigga I can't even count the blessings i been getting
All the commas I been spending bad hoes I been hitting
Fuck around in the new car brand new limit froze up to much spinning
Walk in the bank pulled out 30k they like what you doing today
I look at the teller I ain't know what to tell her I need something to do with my day
She like okay if you don't spend it all please bring it back in
And you know how that story went I might as well threw it away
Every weekend I just pull up and go get that back in
Somewhere for 5 to 15k and i just did 2 in a day
Imma keep on pulling up making them sick until they get blue in their face
With something new on my waist Rolex day pearl blue in her face
