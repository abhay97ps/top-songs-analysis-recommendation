Let's go
We see the hype outside 
Right from the house, uh
Took it straight from outside 
Straight to the couch 
We put the mic outside 
Air this shit out, uh 
You lettin' THE SCOTTS outside 
We runnin' the scouts 
Ain't no controllin' the gang 
They never leave 
I got tats over my veins 
'Cause that what I bleed 
She drink a lot of the bourbon 
Like she from the street 
We got control of the flows and, huh, uh, uh 
We heard that your way went dry 
We floodin' the drought, uh 
Heard that your hood outside 
We added some routes 
We havin' the goods outside 
Move it in and out 
You lettin' THE SCOTTS outside 
We runnin' the scouts
Nigga, the cops outside 
Lock up the house 
We keep the team on high 
Some gold in they mouth 
Nigga, the Porsche outside 
Without the top 
She want a mimosa-sa 
Bring in the shots 
Tell these phony bitches, "Beat it"
With that Photoshoppin' body, Adobe, help me
She in there makin' panini
She know I got all the bread, she know me, got it
On my hustle, havin' visions
It's been a minute since my niggas done owned it, howdy 
Cleveland boy, he make 'em pay
Yes, that Cleveland boy, he done made a way, hey
Headed for somewhere to go, anywhere cinema these, these
Niggas don't know where to go, gotta keep givin' em heat, heat 
Time to go double though, time they add up the math, mad
And I've been dealin' with so many things, havin' so many dreams
Let's go
