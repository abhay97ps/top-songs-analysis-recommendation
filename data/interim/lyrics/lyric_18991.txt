I always said that'd be it
That I wouldn't stick around
If it ever came to this
And here I am
So confused
How am I supposed to leave?
When I can't even move
In the time it would have took to say
Honey I'm home how was your day?
You dropped a bomb right where we live
And just expect me to forgive
Well that's a mighty big word for such a small man
And I'm not sure I can
Cause I don't even know now who I am
It's too soon for me to say forgive..
I should ask but I won't
Was it love or just her touch
Cause I don't think I wanna know
So get you some things
And get out 
Don't call me for a day or two
So I can sort this out
Well you might as well've ripped the life
Right out of me
Right here tonight
And through the fallin tears you said
Can you ever just forgive?
Well, thats a mighty big word for such a small man
And I'm not sure I can
Cause I don't even know now who I am
It's too soon for me to say forgive..
