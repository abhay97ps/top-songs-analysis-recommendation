Gee baby, what can I do when you're gone
Gee baby, everything's cool from now on
Gee baby, what can I say
Alone for every minute that you've gone away
Gee baby, everything swings when you're hear
Gee baby, How can I go when you're near
Gee baby, hold me so tight
I wanna hold you close, I want you tonight
Ooh, you've got me and I can never go-o
I wanna hold ya all the time
Oh can't you see you're on my mind
Please don't leave me, hold me darlin'
Gee baby, how can I say what I feel
Gee baby, maybe I know it's for real
Gee baby, what can I do
I only think of one girl and baby that's you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Mm-mm-hmm
Ooh, I want you
But I can't make you stay-ay
Tell me what I got to do
I only wanna be with you, hold me
Gee baby, everything's right when you're near
Gee baby, whisper those things in my ear
Gee baby, what can I say
I want you for my darlin', don't you go away
Ohh-oh no-o 
Darlin' please stay-ay
Baby don't go 
I wanna hold you close
I'm hopin' you'll stay-ay oh-oh
