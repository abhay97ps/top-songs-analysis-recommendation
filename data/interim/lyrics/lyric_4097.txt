I can't weep and I can't eat
Since you walked out on me
Holy smoke, what you doin' to me, yeah?
I can't eat and I can't sleep
Since you walked out on me, yeah
Holy cow, whatcha doin', child, child?
Holy cow, whatcha doin', child?
Whatcha doin', whatcha doin', child?
Holy smoke, girl, it ain't no joke, no joke
Hey, hey, hey
Hurts my bones, job I lost
Since you walked out on me, yeah
Holy smoke, what you doin' to me, yeah?
Walkin' the ledge, my nerve's on edge
Since you walked out on me, yeah
Holy cow, whatcha doin', child, child?
Holy cow, whatcha doin', child?
Whatcha doin', whatcha doin', child?
Holy smoke, girl, it ain't no joke, no joke
Hey, hey, hey
I can't weep and I can't eat
Since you walked out on me
Holy smoke, what you doin' to me, yeah?
I can't eat and I can't sleep
Since you walked out on me
Holy cow, whatcha doin', child, child?
Holy cow, whatcha doin', child?
Whatcha doin', whatcha doin', child?
Holy smoke, girl, it ain't no joke
