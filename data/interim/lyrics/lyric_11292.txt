Nothing you could say could
Tear me away from my guy
Nothing you could do cause
I'm stuck like glue to my guy
I'm sticking to my guy
Like a stamp to a letter
Birds of a feather
We stick together
There is nothing you could do
To make me untrue
Nothing you could do could
Make me untrue to my guy
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
Now when it's cold outside
I've got the month of May
Well, I guess you could say
What could make me feel this way
My girl, I'm talking bout my girl
I've got sunshine 
On a cloudy day 
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May
Well, I guess you could say
What could make me feel this way
My girl  I'm talking
Bout my girl 
Oh, whoa, my girl 
There's nothing you could do
To make me untrue
Nothing you could do to make me
Untrue to my guy 
Nothing you could do to make me
Untrue to my guy 
Nothing you could buy could
Make me tell lies to my guy 
I'm sticking to my guy
Like a stamp to a letter
Birds of a feather
We stick together
There is nothing you could do
To make me untrue
Nothing you could do could
Make me untrue to my guy
 my guy
There's nothing you could do
To make me untrue
Nothing you could do could
Make me untrue to my guy
My guy 
Nothing you could do
To make me untrue
Nothing you could do could
Make me untrue to my guy
Gonna stay true to me, baby
Gonna stay true, gonna stay true
There's nothing you could do
To make me untrue
Nothing you could do could
Make me untrue to my guy...
