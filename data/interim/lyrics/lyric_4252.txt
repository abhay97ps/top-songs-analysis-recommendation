I dig you, baby, I dig you, yes, I do
I dig you, baby, I dig you, yes, I do
Every man when he's young and free
Gets hung up on some new chick he meets
Though it doesn't usually last too long
Little girl, your love is strong
I have to say
I think I like you, darling
I really love you, baby
Yes, I do
You're that special kind of girl
That makes a guy feel like he rules the world
You add that special something to my day
Lord knows you make it so easy to say
I dig you, baby
I wanna testify
I really, really love you, baby
Yes, I do
Now you are my inspiration
And I dig your hip conversation
The way you smile, oh, that's outta sight
And everything you do, girl, it's all right
Do I have to say anymore
I really, love you, love you, baby
Yes, I do
Oh, I dig you, baby
Tell the whole wide world
