Hello
Who is this?
I came home knocked out after work
That's when my telephone goes berserk
How can I unwind or get some rest
Receiving sick phone calls from a lonely pest?
 Find someone else to bother
 Obscene phone caller
 Get off breathing on the phone?
 Leave me alone
Why did you have to pick me
Out of all the people in the directory?
I don't know what's going through your mind
But these naughty phone calls are a waste of time
I must have my number changed
Or trace these calls from whence they came
If Alexander Bell were alive today
Would he want the telephone to be used this way?
 Find someone else to bother
 Obscene phone caller
 Get off breathing on the phone?
 Leave me alone
Listen here
I don't understand why you're callin' me, you know
I don't know who you are
You know, you call me every day, you breathe on the phone
Just let me know if you're a girl or something, maybe I'll talk to you
But you know, you don't say anything but...
 Find someone else to bother 
 Obscene phone caller
 Get off breathing on the phone? 
 Leave me alone
Find someone else to bother 
 Obscene phone caller
You dirty little nasty twit
