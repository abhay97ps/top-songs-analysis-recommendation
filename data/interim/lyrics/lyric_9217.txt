Twisted trains, unseen chains
And broken bars of steel
Dangling hopes, lengths of rope
And a chase that seems surreal
Renegade, renegade
Somebody dealt you
The 'Ace of Spades'
You lost your bet
Now your debt is paid
But you know your strongest
Hand has not been played
Idols so well known
Just faces turned to stone
Now you always go alone
Or you're betrayed
Dead end canyon rim
And you're hanging on a limb
As your whole mirage
Begins to fade
Renegade, renegade
Somebody dealt you
The 'Ace of Spades'
You lost your bet
Now your debt is paid
But you know your strongest
Hand has not been played
Loose at last
Loose from your past
And loose from an image
That tries to change too fast
Now you're deaf to any voice
Trying to change your choice
There is no role
Because there is no cast
You're just a renegade
You're a renegade
Renegade, renegade
Yes, a renegade
