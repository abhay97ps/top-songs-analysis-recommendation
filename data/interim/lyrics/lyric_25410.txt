Hold on, hold on, speed it up, hold on
Speed it up, speed it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, speed it up
Speed it up 
Beat it up 
Speed it up 
Speed it up 
Speed it up, high... speed it up
Scotty Hotty 
Jolly wallet 
Cheddar, cottage 
Good brain, college 
Her frame, body 
Mulsanne, bought it 
My plane, private 
Diamond chain, wallets 
No shame, I got it 
Couple plain watches 
I lay in Versace 
The hate, can't stop it
Speed it up, speed it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, speed it up
Speed it up 
Beat it up 
Speed it up 
Speed it up 
Speed it up, high... speed it up
Godly, baby
Katie, coupe, Mercedes
Wheezy, wavy, eyes lazy 
My life's crazy 
A price, pay me 
My eyes, HD 
My eyes, 3D 
I'm high, geeking 
I lied at the precinct 
I didn't sign a 360 
I got mine, not greedy 
I'm in the ride, speedin'
Speed it up, speed it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, speed it up
Speed it up 
Beat it up 
Speed it up 
Speed it up 
Speed it up, high... speed it up
