Uh, yes sir 
Yeah
I was wondering
If I could take you home 
But would you still love me baby 
If I could take you home
I was wondering
If I could take you home 
But would you still love me baby 
If I could take you home 
I got a call from my girls around eight 'bout that Friday spot
'Round twelve hit the highway stop, I need gas
Car behind me on my ass, speed past
Turn the radio on it's my joint, got me amped
I need to dance, pull up in the truck and it ain't my man's
You screaming "Hey, yo", you don't got a chance, son
You are speaking a language I don't understand
Know the dude I hang with, I don't hold his hand
'Cause me, I'm free to choose, it's possible to leave with you
When we get through, I drive passenger seat for you
Let's ride, at one I arrive
Walk past the line, damn, his ass is fine
Some guy now we up in the spot, watch
Place hot, couple of bottles, champagne popped 
And that's how we doin' it now
I'm scheming while the DJ's movin' the crowd
I was wondering
If I could take you home 
But would you still love me baby 
If I could take you home
I was wondering
If I could take you home 
But would you still love me baby 
If I could take you home 
It's around 2 a.m., the mood is trend
The club is snug, I see him watching, love is love
Caught him when I looked up, gave him a glance
Promoter chick walked over while I'm shaking her hand
I'm looking over her, sorry, but I'm waiting for this man
Is what I told her so she could leave, no breaking up my plans
No time for talking about shows or dates that I could host
Damn, he walking over to me, they breaking out the jokes
My girls laughing, they see me already imagining
He whispered in my ear would I dance with him? I answered him
He took my hand with him, dancing close
I turned around and gave him my back, he passed a smoke
He put his hand on my hip then my stomach, he must want it
And I was really just 'bout to leave, his clique fronted
Like they don't see that they man bout to tell 'em peace
And to think I wasn't even gonna go out, see?
I was wondering
If I could take you home 
But would you still love me baby 
If I could take you home
I was wondering
If I could take you home 
But would you still love me baby 
If I could take you home
Would you be my boyfriend 
Would you be my boyfriend 
Would you be my boyfriend
For tonight? 
Would you be my boyfriend? 
Would you be my boyfriend? 
Would you be my boyfriend? 
For tonight?
All I need is my lip gloss, ID, gum and I'm straight
Especially if it's Envy at Bungalow Eight
We making it hot on the dance floor to the day
But my girls wanna leave cause there's nothing to take
Nothing to meet, spot dead, nothing to see
Then we all agree that we won't leave
'Cause some spots the papis still come at three
That's when I tell the DJ to run that please
He dancing behind me, I feel what's under his jeans
And I had one too many, so I'm on to his scheme
I mean, I'm cool and the gang, the music is playing
Think I found what I'm looking for, no purpose in waiting
Almost time for breakfast, standing by the coat checkers
Looking for my parking lot ticket, that's it
And this night just ended
Can't say with who, what, or where, but it'll definitely be remembered
I was wondering
If I could take you home 
But would you still love me baby 
If I could take you home
I was wondering
If I could take you home 
But would you still love me baby 
If I could take you home
