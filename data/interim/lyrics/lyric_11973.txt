You say you're not sure about love
If this thing we got together is real
But I say what are you afraid of?
You're a man now
And you know how to feel
Look to your heart
And the answer will be such a very simple thing
But if the love fits
Wear it, baby
And if it feels good
Put it on
And if it's not right
Then just maybe
You'd be better off to leave it alone
But if the love fits
Wear it, baby
And if it feels good
Put it on
And if it looks right
Then just maybe
This love we have is where you belong
Baby, you've got nothing to lose
You can try it on
And see if it suits you
And maybe if it's not right for you
You can turn
And walk away if you choose to
I want you to stay
'Cause you feel good to me
But I'll leave it up to you
And if the love fits
Wear it, baby
And if it feels good
Put it on
And if it's not right
Then just maybe
You'd be better off to leave it alone
But if the love fits
Wear it, baby
And if it feels good
Put it on
And if it looks right
Then just maybe
This love we have is where you belong
I'd like to hold you
For I love you a lot
And try to make you understand
We got a good thing
And it fits us so tight
But what can I do?
It's up to you
But if the love fits wear it, baby
And if it feels good
Put it on
And if it's not right
Then just maybe
You'd be better off to leave it alone
But if the love fits
Wear it baby
And if it feels good
Put it on
And if it looks right
Then just maybe
This love we have is where you belong
