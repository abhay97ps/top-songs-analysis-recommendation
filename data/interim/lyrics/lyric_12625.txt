I saw an old friend of ours today
She asked about you, I didn't quite know what to say
Heard you've been making the rounds 'round here
While I've been trying to make tears disappear
Now I'm almost over you
I've almost shook these blues
So when you come back around after painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you
You're such a sly one with your cold, cold heart
Maybe leaving came easy, but it tore me apart
Time heals all wounds, they say, and I should know
'Cause it seems like forever, but I'm letting you go
Now I'm almost over you
I've almost shook these blues
So when you come back around after painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you
I can forgive you, and soon I'll forget all my shattered dreams
Although you left me with nothing to show, full of misery
Now I'm almost over you
I've almost shook these blues
So when you come back around after painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you
When you come back around after painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you
