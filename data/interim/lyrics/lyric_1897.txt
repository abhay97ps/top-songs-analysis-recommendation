Shy girl, shy girl
Don't shy away
Little shy girl
I'd like to make you my girl
But each time I try to catch your eye
You always look away
Little shy girl
I wish that you were my girl
If only you knew I'm shy like you
You might not run away
Then maybe you might stay
And even when you're near
You're like a distant star to me
How can you be so near
Yet seem so very far from me
Little shy girl
If only you were my girl
If only you knew I'm shy like you
Then maybe you might stay
Oh please don't shy away
I've got so much to say
Don't go away shy girl
Don't go away shy girl
Don't go away shy girl
