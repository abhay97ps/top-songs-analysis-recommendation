Came up out the trees, everything achieved 
Blessed me with the keys, never want to leave, yeah

Yeah, ten hundred thousand, apply the pressure 
Yeah she couldn't drive it, she took a Tesla 
Told her wrap around me just like a necklace

Really don't see you sorta , movin' in and out the border 
Really ain't takin' orders , livin' a dangerous life 
Hell try to melt the ice , levitate through the night 
What's the meanin', these niggas schemin'

My coupe too fast, police didn't see me

All these bales that we layin' on that scale, nigga 
All my niggas they free outta jail, we on the way up, nigga 
Still a true player 
Fuck on your bitch and don't lay up 
Black and Chinese, meds on relieve 
Pop it for me please, hands on your knees 
Came up out the trees, everything achieved 
Blessed me with the keys, never want to leave, yeah
Lambo' drivin', you pedestrian 
Yeah, ten hundred thousand, apply the pressure 
Yeah she couldn't drive it, she took a Tesla 
Told her wrap around me just like a necklace
