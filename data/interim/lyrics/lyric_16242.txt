Says she's had enough of me
I've had enough of her too
I might as well go on and set her free
She's already turned me loose
No fault, no blame, nobody done no wrong
That's just the way it sometimes goes
Sometimes two people just don't get along
It's time to hit the road
Goodbye, farewell, so long
Vaya con Dios, good luck
Wish you well, take it slow
Easy come girl, easy go
We tried to work it out a hundred times
Ninety-nine it didn't work
I think it's best we put it all behind
Before we wind up getting hurt
No hard feelings darling, no regrets
No tears and no broken hearts
Call it quits, calling off all bets
It just wasn't in the cards
Easy come girl, easy go
Vaya condios, good luck
Easy come, easy go
