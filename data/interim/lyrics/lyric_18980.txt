Ho...oh...
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Oh, yeah, yeah
Sitting here
Daydreaming about you
Oh, everything we had
Wish I could get it back
‘Cause if it ain’t you
Then I don’t want it
And if it ain’t you
Then it ain’t for me
I can see your face
Whenever I be sleeping
But it hurts when I realize I’m dreaming
So if I can’t have you
I’ll just be single or the rest of my life 
‘Cause you can’t be replaced by nobody else
I’ll go crazy if I can’t have you for myself 
If I can’t have you 
I’ll just be single for the rest of my life
I’ve decided that
Nobody could compare to you 
There’s nobody that can make me feel the way you do
There’ve been a few
Who’ve tried to take your place
I’ve been on many dates
Still it just ain’t the same
If it's not a letter sent from you
Then I don’t read it
If it’s not a gift sent from you
Then I don’t need it
I’ve been longin’ just to find
Somebody like you
But nobody can just do it quite like you
If I
So if I can’t have you
I’ll just be single for the rest of my life
‘Cause you can’t be replaced by nobody else
I’ll go crazy if I can’t have you for myself 
If I can’t have you
I’ll just be single for the rest of my life
I’ve decided that nobody could compare to you
There’s nobody that can make me feel the way you do
I took your pictures off the wall
That didn’t seem to help at all
So I’mma put it out there
I’mma let you know
If you need to rest your head
You can come back home
I thought that I could live without your love
You know I tried
But I feel incomplete when
I don’t have you in my life
So I’mma put it out there
I’mma let you know 
If you need to rest your head
You can come back home 
Nobody can make me feel like you do
Oh, no, nobody
Can make me feel the way you do
