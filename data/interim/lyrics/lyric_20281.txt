Ride till I die, Lord knows I stay high
And I love it 
And I love it 
We count hundreds on the table , twenty's on the floor 
Fresh outta work and on the way with some more
And I love it , and I love it 
I got gangstas in the crowd, bad bitches at my show 
It's parked outside, and it's sittin' on fo's
And I love it , and love it 
Once again it's on, I'm back in the motherfucking booth 
These niggas still lying, I'm the motherfucking truth 
I don't believe I need some more fucking proof
I ain't want the four door, I copped the motherfucking coupe 
They tryin be me, I'm just tryin be G 
And everything comes to the light you'll see
These niggas in the dark baby I'll just shine 
I do it from the heart homie they just rhyme 
Check your watch nigga it's my time 
Mind made up I was on my grind 
So pay attention, yeah, you on my time
In that case time waits for no man 
Do it again I done that before man 
M.O.E., he ain't part of the program 
Or maybe you niggas ain't listening
Open your eyes I'm a blessing in disguise
We count hundreds on the table , twenty's on the floor 
Fresh outta work and on the way with some more
And I love it , and I love it 
I got gangstas in the crowd, bad bitches at my show 
It's parked outside, and it's sittin' on fo's
And I love it , and love it 
Yeah, I blew up but they ain't like that 
They switched up on me, and I ain't like that 
Sold my first brick yeah, I came right back
Fast forward the tape, nigga look at me now
And I never turn back, so motherfuck that 
Nikes is on the ground got my head to the sky 
Smoked all day, Lord knows I stay high 
I stay on top, Lord knows I'm gon' try 
And live for the moment, Lord knows I'm gon' die 
And when I get to hell, Lord knows I'm gon' fry 
Woke up this morning so I'm still alive 
36 O's I sold them all for five, let's go
We count hundreds on the table , twenty's on the floor 
Fresh outta work and on the way with some more
And I love it , and I love it 
I got gangstas in the crowd, bad bitches at my show 
It's parked outside, and it's sittin' on fo's
And I love it , and love it 
Been around the world, it's the same ol' caine 
Been around the world, it's the same ol' thang 
All the real niggas either dead or in jail
And if you're looking for me homie, I'm in the A-T-L 
You gotta play it how it go, you can't cheat on life 
Ya better drink a Red Bull, you can't sleep on life 
I ain't tryna do you, I'm tryin' do me
Last album did two, I'm just tryin' do three 
Fresh out the pot yeah the work was hard 
Ride with the top down so I'm closer to God
My P.O. telling me I need a 9 to 5
But I already got a job, and that's stayin' alive
We count hundreds on the table , twenty's on the floor 
Fresh outta work and on the way with some more
And I love it , and I love it 
I got gangstas in the crowd, bad bitches at my show 
It's parked outside, and it's sittin' on fo's
And I love it , and love it 
Ride till I die, Lord knows I stay high
And I love it 
And I love it 
Ride till I die, Lord knows I stay high
And I love it 
And I love it
