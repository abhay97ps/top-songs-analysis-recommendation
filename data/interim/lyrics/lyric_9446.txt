I can breathe, I had nowhere to go
I can breathe, I've been goin' through things
I feel nothing but pain, through the mud and the rain
In the cold with no coat, I had nowhere to go
All this shit I been through got my heart frozen like snow
How could it be?
It was just me and my team
Nothing to sit on but boards and sits
Feel like I'm rockin' Florida over me
Innocent cold, pullin' me beneath
Real niggas shed tears, I wasn't showin' no fear
I'm still rockin' with the steel, prayin' I don't get killed
Before I run me a mill, give a fuck if you wrong or you right
You my brother, I'm gon' ride 'til I die
He say he 'bout it, that's a lie
My jewelry, ain't as hot as I
We came here together, we all gonna ride
Fuck with a nigga, it's homicide
Whole lot of niggas down , young nigga, keep that on 'em 
Nigga, let me find out, we come from the front and behind now
We pull up with choppers, we shoot some rounds 
I'ma pull up on him, I'ma gun that boy down 
No, we ain't playin', nigga , pull up and get to sprayin' 
Know how I get the bands, she suckin' me using no hands 
Hey, fuck nigga, get to the cake 
My nigga pull up, they gon' spray 
You came too late, it's too late, bitch
Pull up with choppers we spray, bitch
I got the fire on my waist, bitch
No, we not goin' on dates 
I brung that bitch to the place 
Baby girl bad, I might just eat the cake 
Ran up a check, we eatin' everyday
At first it was noodles, now we eatin' steak
Hater, he like "boo-hoo" 
'Cause all the cash on me 
Ain't no cash on you, hey 
I do what I wanna 
Gotta be in ya, not on ya 
I can breathe, I've been goin' through things
I feel nothing but pain, through the mud and the rain
In the cold with no coat, I had nowhere to go
All this shit I been through got my heart frozen like snow
All this shit I been through, I can't even cry no more
You ain't been what I been through, so this pain you might not know
This money on my mental, all I know is stack my dough
Don't know what they gon' see, you free my brother down the road
They know I'm gettin' paper, okay
Trappin' out the two way, only one way
Can't eat on my plate, no way
Niggas hate but smile in your face
Can't trust you niggas, you snakes
I get the- I get the money, the profit
Blue- blue- blue Benjamins in my pocket
My youngins like what's in your wallet?
You can't come to the hood, we robbin'
We from the bottom but we goin' up
Fifty my wrist, my chest and up
.40 my waist, the stick in the cut
The fifth in the blunt, a four in the cup
Why these niggas wanna hate on me?
Thuggin' with the streets, life wasn't easy
Where you gon' go when there's nowhere to go?
I know some niggas that tow
No nine to five, I work on the stove
I'm in the trap with a load
Monkey nigga can't stop no show
Kick rocks, you is not my woe
Hit opps with a Glock four-oh
I was broke, well not no more
Gotta ride on all of my enemies
You ain't real, I could tell by your energy
And we come from the mud and the concrete
Nigga play with the gang and he lunch meat
Gotta ride with the stick on the front seat
We really livin' what you don't see
Old demons tryna haunt me
In the day they took my pop away from me
I can breathe, I've been goin' through things
I feel nothing but pain, through the mud and the rain
In the cold with no coat, I had nowhere to go
All this shit I been through got my heart frozen like snow
I can breathe, I've been goin' through things
I feel nothing but pain, through the mud and the rain
In the cold with no coat, I had nowhere to go
All this shit I been through got my heart frozen like snow
