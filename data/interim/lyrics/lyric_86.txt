If I could change a wrong to right
That's just what I’d do tonight
This life of mine's so hard to live
What I did you can't forgive
If I could live my life all over
I would change it from the start
I would never ever do wrong
And I’d never hurt your heart
Just one more chance
Is all I ask of you
Just one more chance
So I can prove I'm true
That's why I'm standing here before you
Such a loser in romance
I would gladly give my life dear
If you would give me one more chance
Just one more chance
Is all I ask of you
Just one more chance
So I can prove I'm true
That's why I'm standing here before you
Such a loser in romance
I would gladly give my life dear
If you would give me one more chance
