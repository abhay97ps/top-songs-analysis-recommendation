Well I don't know, But I've been told
There's something goin' on at the North Pole
Santa and his elves at a factory
Dancin' around the world's biggest Christmas tree
They're doin' the Santa Claus boogie
It's the Santa Claus boogie
You've got to take some time to believe in Santa Claus
My uncle Henry's got a bad back
When he tries to walk, you hear him pop and crack
But at Christmas time, the spirit sets him free
He jumps and hollers...
Doin' the Santa Claus boogie
It's the Santa Claus boogie
It's the Santa Claus boogie
You've got to take some time to believe in Santa Claus
I knew an indian girl...
She was way too young
She liked to talk dirty in her native tongue
You've never seen nobody shake and shimmy
Like an indian dancer doin' the Santa Claus boogie
It's the Santa Claus boogie
It's the Santa Claus boogie
You've got to take some time to believe in Santa Claus
