When your heart is all alone every second
Seems so long
When it's just you, you can't see through
Those old clouds that rain so blue
But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
The way I love you
When it's late, the sun hangs low
By yourself, nowhere to go
Sing a song, you dance alone
Play solitaire and stare at the phone
So let's put aside our foolish pride
And let our hearts say hello
We both agree we're just no good
At being on our own
The way I love you
The way I love you
