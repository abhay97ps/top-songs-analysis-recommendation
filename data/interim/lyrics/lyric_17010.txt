Have I never told you I love you
Have I never told you I care
Have I never told you how much I need you
Have I ever, ever not bein' there
If I never told you a care
Girl, I swear to you it's not because the feeling's not there
I'll promise to you from the top of my soul
The bottom of my heart, girl, don't you know
I love you then, I love you now and will forever more
Have I never  told you I love you 
Have I never told you the words
Baby, I love you, you know I love you
Just know that I love you
Have I ever told you I miss you
Have I ever hurt your heart
Girl, I never ever meant to mistreat you
I could never knowingly break your heart
If I ever called you to feel
The words I speak straight from my heart are not very real
I promise to you from the tip of my heart
To the depths of my soul I pray that you know
I love you now, I love you then and will forever more
Have I never  told you I love you 
Have I never  told you the words
Baby, I love you , you know I love you
Just know that I love you 
Oh, baby , baby
You will always  be my lady
And I promise  I will never  break your heart 
Â€˜Cause I love you , I need you  and will forever
Have I never told you I love you 
Have I never  told you the words
Baby, I love you , you know I love you
Just know that I love you
Have I never  told you I love you 
Have I never  told you the words 
Baby, I love you , you know I love you
Just know that I love you
No, no, no, no, baby
I love you
Oh, baby, just know that I love you
