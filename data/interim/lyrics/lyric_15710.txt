Break it on down
Bless you
Bless you
Oh, bless you
Bless you
Where are you going, my beautiful friend?
Is this the road that we take 'til the end?
And if we break down, are we left behind?
Is this the highway of all mankind?
Axis spins, so round and round we go
Where we're goin' no one really knows
Here we, here we, here we, here we go
Feel the fire way down below
Come on and dim the lights 
Switch on the strobe 
We're gonna have a ball tonight 
Down at the Globe
Come on dim the lights 
Switch on the strobe 
We're gonna have a ball tonight 
Down at the Globe
Get up and clean your teeth and have a shave
It's 1 am, let's go out to a rave
One more in before we hit that grave
It's hotter than a microwave, wave
Come on and dim the lights 
Switch on the strobe 
We're gonna have a ball tonight 
Down at The Globe 
Come on and dim the lights 
Switch on the strobe 
We're gonna have a ball tonight 
Down at The Globe
"Well, I am the Bishop of Brixton
On me way to the garden party in the palace"
"Where's the party, officer?"
Come on and dim the lights 
Switch on the strobe 
We're gonna have a ball tonight 
Down at The Globe 
Where is the fair, dear? Not in this land
But still, you try to get what you can
You know that it's bad, but if you insist
Here's one more chance, now, that you just missed
Come on and dim the lights 
Switch on the strobe 
We're gonna have a ball tonight 
Down at The Globe 
Come on and dim the lights 
Switch on the strobe 
We're gonna have a ball tonight 
Down at The Globe
Awaking up the global warming way
Napalm cornflakes for my Special K
What's the health department got to say?
Don't smoke more than fifty fags a day
So have you ever asked yourself
Come on and dim the lights 
Switch on the strobe 
We're gonna have a ball tonight 
Down at The Globe 
Come on and dim the lights 
Switch on the strobe 
We're gonna have a ball tonight 
Down at the Globe
