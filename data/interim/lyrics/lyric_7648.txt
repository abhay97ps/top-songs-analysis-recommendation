When my best friend said she had lost her man
To her babysitter I thought she was lying
I said no sixteen-year-old schoolgirl
Could ever take a man of mine
Staying home with our baby all the time
It kept me kind of brokenhearted
So I went and hired myself a babysitter
And that's when my trouble all started
This sixteen-year-old chick walked in
With a skirt up to her waist
She had a truckload of you know what
And all of it in place
I should have been aware
Mhm, ooh, ooh, of the babysitter
Oh, yeah, yeah
I should have known from the jump, yeah
She was a man-getter, mhm
I should have been aware, uh-huh
Of the babysitter, aah-ha
I should have known from the jump, yeah
She was a man-getter, yes, she was
When I found out exactly what was going on
There wasn't much that I could do
The babysitter had his heart and soul
And all of his money, too
You know, I should have been aware, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, of the babysitter, hoo-hoo
I should have known from the jump, yeah
She was a man-getter, yes, she was
So, girls, if you want your man
And no one else
Buy yourself some sizzle pants
And babysit your baby yourself
Beware, girls
You better beware
Of the babysitter, mhm, yeah
Rock, rock, rock your baby
Rock, rock, rock your baby
Rock, rock, rock your baby
