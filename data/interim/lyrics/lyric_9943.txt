And he'll tell her he's working late again
But she knows too well there's something going on
She's been neglected, and she needs a friend
So her trembling fingers dial the telephone
Lord, it hurts her doing this again
He's the best friend that her husband ever knew
When she's lonely, he's more than just a friend
He's the one she longs to give her body to
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime
And shake hands in the light of day
When it's over, there's no peace of mind
Just a longing for the way things should have been
And she wonders why some men never find
That a woman needs a lover and a friend
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime
And shake hands in the light of day
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime
And shake hands in the light of day
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime
And shake hands in the light of day
