He called me baby, baby all night long
Used to hold and kiss me 'til the dawn
Then one day I awoke and he was gone
There's no more baby, baby all night long
He called me baby, baby all night long
Lord, I feel so empty since he's been gone
Now I lie here and I die here until the dawn
I miss my baby, baby, baby all night long
He called me baby, baby, baby all night long, yes, he did
Kissed my tears away when things went wrong
What I'd give, what I'd give if he'd come on back home
And call me baby, baby, baby all night long, oh, yeah
Mmm hmm, yeah
He called me baby, baby all night long
Held me up so high and made me strong
Now each night in dreams, just like a song
I can still hear baby, baby, baby all night long
I can still hear baby, baby, baby, baby
All night long
I can still hear him call me baby, baby, baby, baby
All night long
Oh, what you do is just hold me, baby
Squeeze me, baby, all night long
I just wanna hear you say baby
