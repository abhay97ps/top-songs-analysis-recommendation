Well, here comes the night
Its dark shadows passing over me
I've been feeling the chill
Ever since you been gone
I'm thinking of you, girl
Wondering if you're going
To return to me
Or was it a waste of time
All we've been through
When I'm all alone
I don't have someone I can run to
Baby, I ain't got no place to go
Don't you know that the night
Keeps moving on 
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
 I keep
Looking over my shoulder
The night, I pray for the dawn
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
Baby, you're gone
We could start again
If only you would
Reach out and touch me, baby
Like a blind man
I feel you deep down inside
I'm over the edge
I'm sorry I hurt
You so badly, girl
The things that I said
Just cannot be denied
When I'm waiting here
Hoping that someday you'll
Return to me cause, baby
Feel like I'm losing control
Don't you know that the night
Keeps moving on 
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
 I keep
Looking over my shoulder
The night, I pray for the dawn
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
Baby, you're gone
My mind's running wild
I feel like a child
Who's been lost again
You've stolen my heart
Captured my soul
Don't you know that the night
Keeps moving on 
It keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
 Keeps
Getting colder and colder
The night, I pray for the dawn
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, I pray for the dawn
Yeah, the night, the night
Yeah, colder and colder
The night, always too long
 it keeps
Getting colder and colder
The night, keep moving on
 keep
Looking over my shoulder
The night, it's always too long
