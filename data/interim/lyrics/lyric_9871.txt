I rented my apartment
On a Monday at one
A-singin' do lolly, lolly
Shicky bum, shicky bum
Started movin' in it
On a Tuesday at two
A-singin' do lolly, lolly
Shicky do, shicky do
Wednesday at three
I called the phone company, singin'
Hey baby, put a phone in for me
Thursday at four
He came a-knockin' at my door, singin'
Hey, baby, I'm your telephone man
You just show me where you want it
And I'll put it where I can
I can put it in the bedroom
I can put it in the hall
I can put it in the bathroom
I can hang it on the wall
You can have it with the buzz
You can have it with the ring
And if you really want it
You can have a ding-a-ling
Because-a hey baby
I'm your telephone man
Can you believe that?
And then he says
Now when other fellas call ya
Tell 'em how it all began
Well, can you imagine?
My heart began a-thumpin'
And my mind began to fly
And I knew I wasn't dealin'
With no ordinary guy
So while he was a-talking
I was thinkin' up my plan
Then my fingers did the walkin'
On the telephone man
Singin hey lolly, lolly
Hey lolly, lolly
Hey lolly, lolly
Get it any way you can
Right? Ha, ha, ha, so
I got it in the bedroom
And I got it in the hall
And I got it in the bathroom
And he hung it on the wall
I got it with a buzz
And I got it with a ring
And when he told me
What my number was
I got a ding-a-ling
A-singin hey lolly, lolly
Hey lolly, lolly
Hey lolly, lolly
Just-a doin' my thing
Ha, ha...I've never done anything
Like this before
