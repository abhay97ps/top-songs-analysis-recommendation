I knew it all the time
That you would leave me
And you would go
And leave me cold
Yep, I knew it all the time
(Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You left me high and dry
And broken hearted
We simply parted
And that was all
Yep, I knew it all the time
(Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You came to me again
You said you're sorry
You learned your lesson
You cried your tears
(Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah)
