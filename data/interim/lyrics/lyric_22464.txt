My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote
Make me your radio 
And turn me up when you feel low 
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
Gym Class Heroes, baby!
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf 
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that? 
Like it Yeah!, check it Trouty, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks 
Its just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that 
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you 
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote 
Make me your radio 
And turn me up when you feel low 
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh oh
To my stereo
Oh oh oh
So sing along to my stereo
Let's go!
If I was an old school fifty pound boombox  {Ooh}
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops  {Yeah yeah yeah}
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop {Yeah}
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me 
When you have to purchase mad D batteries {Oh}
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know we come and go like we're on the interstate
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hands
Keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you 
My heart's a stereo 
It beats for you, so listen close 
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote 
Make me your radio 
And turn me up when you feel low 
This melody was meant for you 
Just sing along to my stereo 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
To my stereo
Oh oh oh
So sing along to my stereo
I only pray you never leave me behind 
Because good music can be so hard to find  
I take your head and hold it closer to mine {Oh, yeah} 
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind
 {Yeah!}
My heart's a stereo {Yeah}
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote  {Oh oh}
Make me your radio {Aha}
 {Turn me up}
This melody was meant for you  {You}
Just sing along to my stereo 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
To my stereo 
{It's yo' boy, Trouty! Gym Class Heroes, baby!}
Oh oh oh 
So sing along to my stereo!
