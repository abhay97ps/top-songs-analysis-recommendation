Show up in the same dress
We don't know who wore it best
Not make a big deal
Act like it's a new trend
Look good when we go 'round here
Try on these boots
I found this boy who said you're sweet
He's got a best friend
Be, be, be my BFF
'Cause IDK what's coming next
And I'll be LMHO with the rest

I'm a better me when you're
Here next to me

Who needs words when we got hearts, smile
T-t-t-time goes by so fast
But we are meant to last
Be, be, be my BFF
'Cause IDK what's coming next
And I'll be LMHO with the rest
