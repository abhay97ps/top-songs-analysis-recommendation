Yesterday, I met a boy so fine
Right away I knew
He'd captivate my mind
So strong
The kind you dream about
Baby, together
We could really turn it out
I showed him to
Some friends of mine
They said, girl
Don't waste your time
That boy's no good for you
Listen, girl
I'm telling you
I think it's time you knew that
All that glitters isn't gold
Everything you see isn't what it seems to be
Oh, no
All that glitters isn't gold
Sometimes we make the mistake
Of thinking everything
That looks good is great
We all seem to go for what shines
And then we leave all of
The other things behind
Some people always give a show
Cause it's the only way they know
But you don't have to play that game
Because the only thing that matters
Is what's inside your heart
So here's my advice to you
Everything you see's
Not always true
Take the time to look inside
And find out for yourself
What's really on their minds
No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold
No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold
No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold...
Oh, no, it isn't gold
No, no, it isn't gold
Everything you see's
Not what it seems to be
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
All that glitters isn't gold
No, no, no
All that glitters isn't gold
No, no
All that glitters isn't gold
No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold
No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold
No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold
