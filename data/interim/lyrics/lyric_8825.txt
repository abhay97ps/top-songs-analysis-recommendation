Sandy, the aurora is rising behind us
Those pier lights, our carnival life forever
Oh, love me tonight for I may never see you again
Hey, Sandy, girl
My, my, my, my baby
Sandy, the fireworks are hailin' over Little Eden tonight
Forcin' a light into all those stony faces left stranded on this warm July
And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like Latin lovers on the shore
Chasin' all those silly New York virgins by the score
Sandy, the aurora is rising behind us
Those pier lights, our carnival life forever
Oh, love me tonight, I promise I'll love you forever
Oh, I mean it, Sandy, girl
Oh, my baby
Hey, Sandy girl
My, my, my, my baby
Sandy, the waitress I was seeing has lost her desire for me
I spoke with her last night, she said she won't set herself on fire for me anymore
Did you hear the cops finally busted Madame Marie for telling fortunes better than they do?
For me, this boardwalk life's through
You ought to quit this scene, too, ooh
Sandy, the aurora is rising behind us
Those pier lights, our carnival life forever
Oh, love me tonight, for I may never see you again
Hey, Sandy, girl
My, my, my, my baby
Hey, Sandy, girl
Oh, my baby
Hey, Sandy girl
My, my, my, my, my, my baby
Hey, Sandy, girl
Oh, my baby
Hey, Sandy, girl
My, my, my, my baby
