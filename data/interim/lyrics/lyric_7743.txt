I come up hard, baby, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it sugar, playing by the rules
I come up hard, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checking trouble, sure moving down the line
I come up hard, baby, but that's OK
Because Trouble Man don't get in my way
I come up hard, baby
I've been for real, baby
Going to keep moving, going to roll to town
I come up hard, come on, get down
There's only three things that's for sure:
Taxes, death and trouble
This I know, baby, this I know, child
Yeah, let the sweat through you, baby
Got me singing, yeah, yeah, ooh
I come up hard, baby, I had to fight
Took care of my business with all my might
I come up hard, I had to win
Then start all over and win again
I come up hard, but that's OK
Because Trouble Man don't get in my way
I know some places and I've seen some faces
I got good connections aimed in my direction
When people say; that's OK, they don't bother me
I'm ready to make it, don't care about the weather
Don't care about no trouble, got myself together
I feel the kind of protection that's all around me
I come up hard, baby
I've been for real, baby
With the Trouble Man
Moving, going to town
I come up hard, come on, get down
There's only three things for sure:
Taxes, death and trouble
This I know, baby
This I know, baby
Hey ain't gon' let it sweat me, baby
I come up hard, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it, baby, playing by the rules
I come up hard, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checking trouble, sugar, hey, moving down the line
