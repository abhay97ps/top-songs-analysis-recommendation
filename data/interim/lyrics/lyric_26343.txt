I'ma slide anytime you want
Put you in Chanel, I'ma teach you how to stunt 
Slip and slide like a waterfall
You need some TLC, we can creep if you want 
Ayy, turn your phone off, take your clothes off 
I'm a savage, but I fuck her to a slow song 
Turn the lights down , lay the pipe down 
I ain't Mr. Right, but I'm Mr. Right Now 
She want me to fuck her to Beyoncé 
But I don't treat her like she my fiancé 
Make that thing sing like Sade 
1942, it ain't no Chardonnay 
In a Lam' truck , with my Richard on 
Got a pretty girl , that I'm feelin' on 
We in quarantine , but my M's long 
Buddy lame-lame, he got friend-zoned 
Got a couple spots , and they all owned 
Bought a penthouse , 'cause I'm never home 
Threw my heart out the window, feelings gone 
Threw my heart out the window, but
I'ma slide anytime you want 
Put you in Chanel, I'ma teach you how to stunt 
Slip and slide like a waterfall 
You need some TLC, we can creep if you want 
Ayy, turn your phone off , take your clothes off 
I'm a savage, but I fuck her to a slow song 
Turn the lights down , lay the pipe down 
I ain't Mr. Right, but I'm Mr. Right Now 
Turn your phone off, take your clothes off
I'm a sav', but I fuck her to a slow song
Said the nail lady went and did her toes wrong
Said her last man was always playin' Drake songs
Yeah, cellphones out when I roll up
Yeah, the nigga had a problem 'til I showed up
Everybody with a "at" before they name tough
Yeah, more concerned with blowing up than growing up
Yeah, said she wanna fuck to some SZA, wait
'Cause I used to date SZA back in '08
If you cool with it, baby, she can still play
While I jump inside that box and have a field day
I'm the slow stroke king, hit me anytime
And my goal is to get you to the finish line
I seen good movies end bad plenty times
So let me finish strong, girl
I'ma slide anytime you want
Put you in Chanel, I'ma teach you how to stunt 
Slip and slide like a waterfall
You need some TLC, we can creep if you want 
Ayy, turn your phone off , take your clothes off 
I'm a savage, but I fuck her to a slow song 
Turn the lights down , lay the pipe down 
I ain't Mr. Right, but I'm Mr. Right Now 
She want me to fuck her to some Keith Sweat 
But she stay in apartments I got beef at 
Pussy so good, I had to sneak back 
Hit her with my Glizzy, boy, I keep that
You fuck with the ones that fuck with you, what?
The niggas—, the bi—, the dumb-ass bitches wanna come up and lay up and give you pussy at, what?
Twelve? One o'clock at night? Face-ass nigga, do I look dumb, stupid or slow?
Nigga, please, what the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Just like you wanna stick a dick up in me, I want some motherfuckin' money
And don't get in your motherfuckin' feelings when you see me in the motherfuckin' club randomly
And one of your niggas wanna get down on me
And I wanna give them some pussy 'cause they gave me some money
Know what I mean? It's easy
