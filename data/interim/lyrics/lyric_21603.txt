Every day is so wonderful
And suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure from all the pain
I'm so ashamed
I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today, no no no no
To all your friends, you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone
Is that the way it is?
You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, oh no
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today
No matter what we do 
No matter what we say 
We're the song that's out of tune 
Full of beautiful mistakes 
And everywhere we go 
The sun will always shine 
But tomorrow we might awake
Over on the other side
'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes words won't bring us down, no no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes words can't bring us down, no
So don't you bring me down today
Oh, don't you bring me down today
Hey, yeah, oh, don't you bring me down today
