I need to belong to someone
It hurts to be known as no one
Will ever some sweet girl
Bring love into my world, 'cause
I need to belong to someone 
I wanna be kissed and held tight
Want to be missed on a cold lonely night
Somebody hear my plea and call out to me, 'cause
I need to belong to someone
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
No one cares for me, I've never known sympathy
I hide my needs from the world with a smile
But understand, I'm only a man and a man
 yes he does 
A man hates to be known as no one
Will ever some sweet girl, bring love into my world, because
I need to belong to someone
Oh, I hide my needs, from the world with a smile
But understand, I'm only a man, and a man needs 
To belong,  to someone
A man hates to be known, as no one
Oh send me a girl, to bring love into my world, 'cause
I need to belong to someone  mm 
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
Well I wanna belong  to somebody 
Just like you  
Someone I can tell 
My troubles to
