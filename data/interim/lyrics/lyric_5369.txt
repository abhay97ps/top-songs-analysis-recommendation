For to see Mad Tom of Bedlam
Ten thousand miles I travelled
Mad Maudlin goes on dirty toes
For to save her shoes from gravel
The Gypsies, Snap and Pedro
Are none of Tom's comradoes
The Punk I scorn and the cutpurse sworn
And the Roaring boys bravadoes and...
Still I Sing Bonny Boys, Bonny mad boys
Bedlam boys are Bonny
For they all go bare and the live by the air
And they want no drink nor money
This staff has murdered giants
And me bag a long knife carries
For to cut mince pies from children's thighs
With which to feed the faeries
This bivit's white as lightning
Would on me travels guide me
The Moon would shake and the stars would quake
Whenever they espied me
With a host of furious fancies
Of which I am Commander
With a burning spear and a horse of air
To the wilderness I wander
By a knight of ghosts and shadows
I Summoned am to a tourney
Ten Leagues Beyond The Wild Worlds End
Methinks it is no journey
Still I Sing Bonny Boys, Bonny mad boys
Bedlam boys are Bonny
For they all go bare and they live by the air
And they want no drink nor money
