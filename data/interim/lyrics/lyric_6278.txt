Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can!
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can!
Take a little time out of your busy day
To give encouragement
To someone who's lost the way
Or would I be talking to a stone
If I asked you
To share a problem that's not your own
We can change things if we start giving
Why don't you
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can!
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can!
If you see an old friend on the street
And he's down
Remember his shoes could fit your feet
Try a little kindness
You'll see
It's something that comes very naturally
We can change things if we start giving
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can!
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can!
