You know I never ever do you wrong
I never ever put no pressure on
Even though instead
I guess your bed hear me coming
Baby I been thinking bout it for a long time

Tonight is the night
Will you be the one to change my life?
When I touch you 
Start to feel good 
All the night and 
You’ve got me going all the way
Wanna be the first
Wanna be the last
Wanna be the best
That you’ve ever had
Baby cause tonight we go all the way
And then tomorrow we won’t be the same
Baby take it slow I’ll tell you where to go
Take it from the bed down to the floor
Baby girl tonight we go all the way
And then tomorrow we won't be the same
Baby would u trust me

I know we’ve talked about it a thousand times
But that’s on the phone so
Now that we’re alone I
Think its time
Im not afraid
I know you’re gonna make my body shake
I hope you think I was worth the wait
Were doing big things
Your patience I so appreciate
When I touch you
My heart beats
Start to feel good

Wanna touch you
Boy set me free
Tonight were going all the way
Wanna be the first
Wanna be the last
Wanna be the best

Baby cause tonight we go all the way
And then tomorrow we won't be the same

Tell me where to go
Take it from the bed down to the floor
Baby girl tonight we go all the way
Then tomorrow it won't be the same

And baby I won’t hurt you no!
You’ve got my heart and you rock my world
And its gonna be everything that you could ever want in your dreams
Wanna be the first
Wanna be the last
Wanna be the best
That you’ve ever had
Baby cause tonight we go all the way
And then tomorrow we won't be the same
Girl I'll take it slow
Tell me where to go
Take it from the bed
Down to the floor
