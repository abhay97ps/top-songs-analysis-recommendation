Thinking of you
What would I do?
I'd be true
I-I-I'm thinking of you
Not to say that I'm a matchmaker
When it comes to you
You met your match
You're inclined to
Leave me fascinated
By the things you do
My baby dance, oh yeah
You can bet your bottom dollar
Honey, I will be with you
Through thick and thin, oh yeah
I would love to give a testimony
'Bout the way you are
You're my best friend
I've been thinking
Got me wondering
Got me thinking
Oh, oh, got me wondering
You're the one that
Makes my love light shine
Every time, morning 'til night
With the sentimental way you show
The kind of love
Makes it alright, yeah
What you give is extraordinary
It's the way of life I like to live
I could be with you forever
'Cause lovin' you gives me a thrill
I've been thinking
Got me wondering
Got me thinking
Oh, oh, got me wondering
You got me thinking 
Thinking about you, baby
Got me thinking 
What would I do
Got me thinking 
I'd be true
Got me thinking
I-I-I'm thinking of you
Girl, I appreciate
The love we generate
You keep me satisfied
Just the sun that shines
Deep in this heart of mine
Your love keeps shining through
Thinking of you
What would I do?
I'd be true
I-I-I'm thinking of you
You got me thinking 
Thinking about you, baby
Got me thinking 
What would I do?
Got me thinking 
I'd be true
Got me thinking
I-I-I'm thinking of you
