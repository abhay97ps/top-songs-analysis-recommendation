Oh troubled water, give it up
Why don't cha, why don't cha, let it be
Yeah, yeah 
Still water why be 
Yes it do, yeah
When you're down and out
When you're in the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort
I'll take your part
Yeah, whoa, when darkness comes
And there's no one
No one you love around
Just like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
I will lay me down, yeah yeah, ooh
Come on
Sail on Silver Boy
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
And all your dreams are on their way
See how they shine, 
 {Need a friend}
Look around, look around
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
Like a bridge over troubled water
Oh troubled water 
Give it up 
Why don't cha, why don't cha let it be
Still water runs deep 
Yes it do 
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh troubled water 
Give it up 
Why don't cha, why don't cha, let it be
Still water run deep, yes it do 
Ohhhhh, yeah...
Oh troubled  water 
Give it up
Why don't cha, why don't cha 
Let it be 
Still water runs deep 
Yes it do 
Oh troubled water...
