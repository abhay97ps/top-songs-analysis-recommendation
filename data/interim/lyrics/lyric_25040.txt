Every now and then, you know what I'm sayin'?
Most of the majority of the time, you dig?
We in that mode
Yeah 
Yeah
This is a moment of clarity
Everything VVs, I'm gone to the maximum 
Young nigga flood out a 'axima
Flawless the face then run through a pack of them 
Everything classical, everything magical
When they was checking my catalogue
Eating on caviar, smash on a stallion
Draped in medallions, yeah 
Depending on the caliber, put on the passenger 
Whatever time, wherever I was at 
Look on the calendar, yeah, we compatible
I have her flying wherever I'm at 
You astronomical, way too phenomenal
I have her naked where I land 
I got a second option and a fourth
And fifth one wherever a nigga staying
I had them falling right out of my pocket
When I was just smashing her, she seen the bands
Her body Coca-Cola and she seen a can
The Glock was still on me while we was romancin' 
Think I fell in love with this girl, came from France 
She caramel without getting a tan 
I need to pay her when I get a chance 
Gave her some drip, gave her a whole lot of splash 
Talkin' that shit, he get smoked like a blunt
Took a few Pakistani-ans to lunch
Got some little slim shit in Milan
These niggas be hatin', putting on a front
Money get made 
These bitches don't ever get saved 
Saint Laurent shades 
Cookin' up dope, gettin' paid 
Shawty gettin' laid 
She been with me 31 days 
She like bitches anyways 
So we been on the same damn page 
I took a little E 
Got red bottoms sittin' on my feet 
I ran it up, beep 
I got your baby mama knee-deep 
She ain't got no teeth 
She know a young nigga eat beef 
She want me to leave
She know I'm not a rat, I got cheese 
I was quieter than a mouse 
When I got it in her mouth she couldn't breathe 
I was thinking like, "Jeez"
She done got a little slob on my tee
I done took a little E
I fucked her and made her pee
Made her part of my team
Then she asked me for a ring
I was already red bottom
Came on the scene
It's hard to trust you
When I'm paintin' this carpet green
Money get made 
These bitches don't ever get saved 
Saint Laurent shades 
Cookin' up dope, gettin' paid 
Shawty gettin' laid 
She been with me 31 days 
She like bitches anyways
So we been on the same damn page
Doin' it on a chinchilla, oh yeah 
You fuckin' a couple of strippers together, yeah 
Shawty my rider, she down for whatever 
Y'all give her capital murder, her swagger killer 
Shawty got more bags than a drug dealer, wait 
I put her in a Patek, I put her in the Cs
I'm on a whole 'nother level with her
Had to get a penthouse just for the freaks
So they can all come sleep with us
We don't do nothing that's normal
Everything we do is super gigantic 
We don't put on fugazi
Everything we wear is super titanic 
I just caught me a wave 
Feel like a nigga done jumped in Atlantic 
One hell of a car collection 
Pulling it up, it's panoramic 
Picked her up in a Cayenne
Soon as she got in she ain't have nothing on 
Shawty gettin' laid 
She been with me 31 days 
She like bitches anyways 
So we been on the same damn page 
I took a little E 
Got red bottoms sittin' on my feet 
I ran it up, beep
