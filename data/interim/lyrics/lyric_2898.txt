Come on do the jerk 
Come on do the jerk 
Everybody now gather around
Get hip to the new sensation
There's a brand new dance coming to your town
And sweeping across the nation
Come on do the jerk 
Come on do the jerk 
Now snap your back like a bullwhip crack
Now jerk your hip, let your backbone slip
You've done the Monkey, you've done the Twist
And the Mashed Potatoes too
The Swim and The Fly have all gone by
There's a brand new dance for you
Come on do the jerk 
Come on do the jerk 
You've got to bob and weave
Come on bob and weave
And when you do
Let your neck snap too
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's alright
Well now jerk children jerk 
Come on jerk children jerk 
Well now jerk children jerk 
Well jerk children jerk 
Well now jerk to the left and jerk to the right
Jerk all day and jerk all night
Jerk it hard and jerk it soft
Jerk your hands and arms right off
Come on do the jerk in the morning 
Come on do the jerk right now 
Now snap your back like a bullwhip crack
Now jerk your hip, let your backbone slip
Yeah, come on do the jerk right now 
Everybody come on do the jerk right now 
Jerk children jerk
