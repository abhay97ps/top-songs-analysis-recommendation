Where the world going, y'all
Where  the world going, y'all
Polluted  match
Polluted air
Keep on moving but getting nowhere
Won't  nobody listen to the cold-hard facts
Water's  bad
Trees are gone
Ain't  no place to sing our song
Looks like everybody's just blind as bats
How much more can this world stand
Before we destroy all of the land
One  of these day's we're going up in a puff of smoke
Say it y'all
Gonna choke
While the world going up in a puff of smoke
Religions end. Religions die
Seems like half the world's in dire
We just keep on pushing aside the good book
Cause every day
And every night
When we hear about a fight
We all break our necks just to get a look
If we stayed at home
To do our thing
We'd all be a better man
Then we might not go in a puff of smoke
Gonna choke
While the world going up in a puff of smoke
Gonna warn y'all
Politics
They contradict
You know who's going to benefit
Not me and you cause we don't carry a big stick
We gonna follow fountains of gold 
But when the world begins to fall
We all going up in a puff of smoke
I'm gonna choke
While the world going up in a puff of smoke
I'm gonna choke
While the world going up in a puff
Where the world going, y'all
Where the world going, y'all
Where the world going, y'all
I'm gonna choke 
While the world going up in a puff 
I'm gonna choke 
While the world going up in a puff 
Tell me what you gonna do y'all
