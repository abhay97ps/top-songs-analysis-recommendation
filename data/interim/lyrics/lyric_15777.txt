Silent prayer
I send to you my silent prayer
Before I sleep at night
I send to you my silent prayer
Baby, so you'll be alright
Every morning I think of you
I just can't shake up my dreams, no, no
I read the paper and watch the news
I don't know what it means
When you do what you got to do
You must know that I'm there with you
Every breath that I take
I hope and I pray, sweet baby
Baby, we're okay
Silent prayer
 Silent prayer
 Silent prayer
 I send to you my silent prayer
I hold a picture of a golden sunset
And I'll take your hand
We're gonna walk down that promise road
Just like we planned
'Cause I know what I'm gonna do
Just as soon as I'm back with you
Every breath that I take
I hope and I pray, sweet baby
Baby, we're okay
Silent prayer
 Silent prayer
 Silent prayer
 I send to you my silent prayer
I send to you my silent prayer
I send to you my silent prayer
I send to you my silent prayer 
My silent prayer
 Silent prayer
 Silent prayer
 I send to you my silent prayer
Silent prayer
