Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down
When you're down and out, when you're on the street
When evening falls, when it falls so hard I will comfort you
I'll take your part
When darkness comes, oh yeah, and pain is all, all around
Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down
 I will lay me down,  I will lay me down
Sail on silver girl, sail on by
Your time has come to shine
 All you dreams,  All those dreams are on their way
 See how they shine
 Oh-oh
If you need a friend, if you need a friend...
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down, I will lay me down
 Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
I will ease your mind
I will ease your mind
I will ease your mind
I will ease your mind
I will ease your mind
