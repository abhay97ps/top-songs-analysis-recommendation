Finally made contact
She touched my soul and I
Felt the full impact
And the night stood still
Then I kissed her eyes with mine
And she knelt before me
Poured the wine
And told me her story
We lit a fire that wants to grow higher
Sunshine girl won't you stay with me 
Sunshine girl won't you stay with me 
Sunshine girl won't you stay with me in the night
It's a good thing
Magic all around like I never felt before
And the only sound was the cracklin' fire
Then all at once, the day
Was melting the night-time
Shades of dawn burst into sunshine
I took her hand
And ran through the morning
Sunshine girl won't you stay with me 
Sunshine girl won't you stay with me 
Sunshine girl won't you stay with me in the night
It's a good thing
We watched the day - melting the night time
Sha-ades of dawn - burst into sunshine
I took her hand
And ran through the morning
Sunshine girl won't you stay with me 
Sunshine girl won't you stay with me 
Sunshine girl
Sun-shine girl
Sun-shine girl
Sun-shine girl
Sunshine girl
Sun-shine girl
Sun-shine girl
Sun-shine girl
