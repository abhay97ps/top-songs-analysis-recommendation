And get it off of my shoulders
And make the world go away
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'll make it up day by day
Just tell me you still love me
And make the world go away
Just get it off, off of my shoulders
Only you can make it go away
You remember when you loved me
Before the world took me astray
If you do then forgive me
And make the world go away
Just get it off, off of my shoulders
And make the world go away
