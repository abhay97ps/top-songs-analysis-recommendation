Now see, the Asian man forced us into this battle like them Pearl Harbor jet pilots
Forget bias you could never get by us
See if that funny shit worked for the first time like test pilots
No! It's the first time you'll cross beam challenge at these heights like test pilots
So it's them London boys, fuckin' up the middle class like them thug and protest riots
But this battle is like a fuckin' joke, let's run a little test by them
Like, you know when your boy's talkin' to a bangin' chick and next to her is the fattest bitch?
You know you have to win and you know you have to chat to it
Cause you can't abandon him
That's what this battle is
You know when you really have to shit
It's like an hour before you can get home and handle it
So you reluctantly pay 20 P at a tube station to save your own embarrassment?
That's what this battle is
You know when alcohol's got you smashed a bit
You're really hungry but you don't know where the nearest market is
So you end up gettin' the skattiest kebab and chips?
I guess that's what this battle is
You know when your favorite TV is on but you're at your chick's and she doesn't want to see an action flick
So you watch a program where even the fuckin' ads are shit?
That's what this battle is
So you worthy to engage in this war?
I'm feeling like we've missed something
That's a green card marriage, you can take the title but the title means nothing
So you came here to stomp my reign/rain, well you couldn't withstand the weather
Man's a jester,  so your show's getting cancelled fellas
Better than me as a rapper? Never
I put my hands up to Shuffle like I'm like I'm doing the macarena
I'm thinkin' irony's something man's a friend of
Instrumental in your own demise
Cause your flow's so shite they only wanna hear you accapella
That's why it ain't hard to see you can't bar on beat
I mean that snowboarding excuse sounds a bit bizarre to me
This hip hop combat
So when we start to speak and our army's meet
It's like we're using machine gun fire and you're just using your arms and feet like Bart and Lisa
Different artistry
Our fit the bars regime
Yours is that well we can't rap so we use humor to get a laugh from Leeds
Nah, let me jump on Charlie's steez
He told Tony he flopped so he only reps half his league
So if you can't rap in a rap battle then you only rep half the scene
So I can't really knock the guy's writtens but, what you rappin' for?
For, if you can't even follow time signature?
See, I'll have you headin' to the doc
When I finish bud, T leaves in a bag like when we callin' out India
So forgive me if I don't see you as a conquest or a challenger
A bit part of half of the solos you took the wrong step and got battlin'
Your longevity is not set to be happening
Cause if you're only good at concept battles you don't understand the concept of battlin'
Cause you could never out rap us, so judge we on some next shit
But what do you know about runnin' 'round the circuit when you had no money for the 'lectric?
While it was cats we starved you had caviar that mommy did for breakfast
I've been in studios since I was 13
Shuffle for this hustle I've been destined
But you don't even rap outside battles
Hence why you spend months and weeks on preppin'
It's st-st-st start stammer so much you sound like you're gonna fuckin' stumble into next spring
So while you came out of the blue with bars lyricists query
We came from the ground up, that's Darwinian Theory
But have you ever wonder how Shuffle's rounds quickly got madly greater?
About the time I introduced you to my boy in fact
Now I'm not sayin' man's a traitor
But he helps you get straight to the point
And you act like it's not a massive favor
So if his phrases sound frank today that's due to Frankie Phraser
And Eurgh, I'd have a little second poll if you think this man's mate is a 
He told me you an arrogant sad waste
Who does what he wants, just cause you were mad late
Then you didn't say the shit to a man's face
He's the only reason you have a fan base and the sole reason anyone knows your damn name
And Shuffle, remember when you told me half your fans are retards?
Real talk
You want to say it to 'em now
What's up cousin? You wasn't so shy when they wasn't around
They see you as a king but try to win this on favors from the crowd
Nah you King Charles the 1st man they'll slay you for the crown
Time
You guys are sooo pissed off about this
Cracker, you look furious mate
 Truly enraged
 Eurgh was like-
 "You gotta go through with it mate"
 And you were like-
 "Yeah, yeah, nah, nah I'll do what you say."
 Awww, don't worry, we know you don't agree we're in a suitable place
But if that's truly the case then we'll lose anyway and the views will be great
So dude, it's okay!
 In your blog diss to us, you guys were swooning with praise
You said we'd lose here today but we do entertain
And that's what I think these dudes got confused in a way
Cause it's called Don't Flop Entertainment boy...the clue's in the name
And you guys only won that tournament cause we weren't there
Just face it the bets through
Only got that title cause we basically let you
But now we made it our houses, the change of address due
But we hope that you enjoyed your stay in the guest room
 And if you put this all into context it spits itself
I mean you guys won this great big contest and it was swell
But now, we've been offered to win bell four rounds after getting bodied by Mick' and L
 battles now we're here
Didn't have to battle for the whole damn fuckin' year
We thought we'd get rid of Cracker this round since you two have already battled
And now I'm here and I'm lookin' to accept the challenge
You-
-I LET YOU WIN
You hated, HATED those ginger jokes
Look, I'm sorry you have red hair
I didn't realize before we battled you didn't actually know that
I never planned to expose Crack but his reactions were so sad
Which leads me to believe he hadn't been shown that
I expected rolled eyes and a sarcastically slow clap
Now the most fucked up cry face since Carrie from Homeland
You need to stop gettin' mad when other battlers address the fact
That your head is red ya twat
Like, of course it's comin' up, I mean imagine you're against a man with legs for hands
You're gonna wanna mention that
What have you got to complain about?
You won this big tourney and got fuckin' half the prize
I bet you went and fuckin' partied, right?
I bet you were burning money for cigars to light
Nope! He used it pay his overdraft in time
What's next Crack? Win first place in Masterminds
So you can finally pay off that parking fine?
When Cracker got his money, I thought maybe he made a stash
The fact that he was in debt, the moment he had it he paid it back
And Marcus gave his to the Mosque so we're just restating facts
He and Cee Major have, a complete waste of cash
Who needs money when you've got baaaars Leeds
You don't have baaaaars Leeds
Cracker just forced his simple simile shit delivery inconsistently to fit the imagery
Seriously, you always use similes that don't spark
 Like a wack lighter
 You just google it and say "like"
 Like a fact finder
 You always take the longest route to get there
 Like a cab driver
 Underneath it you just write bad
 Like a bad writer
Now you said the word "Shawshank" in a rap battle
Now I'm not saying I don't understand the words you speak
Oh wait, I am, and I'm saying it perfectly
See for Cracker the speaking matter can be a hazard
 I mean imagine, he's on a date
 Pizza tavern
 That's okay
 She's a slapper
 It's goin' great
 Cheeky banter
 Til the waiter comes and asks him what they would want for starters
 Leans to Cracker
 Who says he'd like a medium platter of caesar salad
He'd like a medium platter of cae-
He'd like a medium platter of cae-
 Forget it man forget it, forget it
On our journey to Plymouth I was next to this guy
Imagine the following but for the length of the drive
"Who the fuck is KennedySpikes75?
And why is he saying I'm desperate for hype?
Fuck it, that's it I'm pressing "dislike" that'll send a message but Christ
How pathetic is that prick tellin' me lies?
I love how-I love how they think they're gonna get to me guys."
If you see him in the crowd during the battle and he's on his phone
He's not takin' notes so he can judge a round on content
He's on his Olde English battle thumbing down the comments
 Now you guys seem to think that when it comes to bars Leeds will never listen
 Like they're only after laughter and don't seek your depth of wisdom
 The same Leeds that went crazy when they received the Flex' decision
 The same Leeds that went insane when Tony had beaten Deffinition?
Baring that in mind we don't wanna see you ever bitchin'
 The same lame complaints claimin' Leeds won't get your writtens
That excuse is wearing thinner than a fiend with meth addiction
Just poppin' out to a needle exhibition
The fact in the book is you can rap from the hood
But to get reaction you actually have to be good
See I think that it's wild you look up to another man so much you became a mimicking child
And they think it's just tricks up your sleeve, nah but give them a while
I clock from day one with his emo fashion
That's just that Mark Grist in your style
You took another man's style, and I ain't talkin' 'bout Neo
Mark Grist got 3,000,000 views and you crept in the scene on the D. lo'
Now you can say that's a coincidence but we know
You have to see it from Mark's point of view like Peep Show
We really didn't wanna do this battle but we sorta had to
Cause you spark up a lil' interest and we were forced to match you
But really the only way you want performance value
And we got three grand, four battles, oh, how much is your performance value?
Cause we're like Heisenberg when we write a verse
Not one poor step man will make that paper
Jesse Pinkman penning writtens throw it on your doorstep like, "take that player"
When I hear a good Shuffle bar I'm like, "Yeeeeah, kinda rate that Phraser"
But uncle Crack' made up his mind to kill him ten minutes ago
He's Asac Schrader
But if it's a question of who comes harder it's Futurama
Feel the irony of an iron sentence
He's tried and tested cryogenics
Flow cold enough to fry your bredren
Pound for pound I'll break your unit down, it's fine
I can divide the metrics
Run up on bars over heads like I'm trying to apply the methods of plyometrics
Cause you look like you haven't been the same since you went through that Abba phase
They put lions to savage on a random stray cat today
It's all a masquerade
Faggot, where the passion mate?
I throw it down til I can't see shit like a flash grenade
I play patty cake with Adam's face til it looks like a pasta bake
Back gets caved, one punch smash his place like Greeks when they're at a rave
Freddy Kruger I'll hold the camera the same minute you grab the tape
Cause he won't even realize he's sleepin' til we're at a wake
Cause you got killed by Cracker the first time you battled
Now it's about time you try lyin' dead
You went from your tryout then
Went from fox huntin' with your posh cousin and jumped straight into the lion's den
Literary architect
When I pick up my writin' pen
Uni boy best get to Spark Notes to revise the texts
Cause Marlo I heard your shitty mash up music man
It's dark as  listen
Cause your mixes sound like the start up of a Tony Stark system
If I drop that whack bollocks now, that's a Math Hoffa round
You see half of the bomb missin'
So when his Krusty set drops I'll say "I didn't do it" and they'll laugh I'm Bart Simpson
And you dissed RS for being Christian
 How does that shit work?
 When you look like Jesus
 Yeah, Catholic jerks
 But your girl's an Indian from a Muslim family
So if you choose to play religion
It's cause you felt the restraints from the shake/Sheikh like Haitian victims
They say I'm arrogant, egotistical
 Nah state the difference
 I'm out to kill for honor like her family when she claims she's with him
Cause she's ashamed of you
Ain't told her relatives about the way you live
Cause you can't take care of her like her relations do
So it's not due to their devotion to faith
It's due to her lack of faith in you
And that's why she's straight aborting if you...papa Don
Cause she don't want none of it
She been fuckin' wit that Marlo kid
Cause she can't believe how dull he is
So if she ever claim that she's carrying your offspring
Don't be surprised if it looks like a younger Boris Johnson
And I'm sorry for the awkward journey home brother
But these were foreshadowed words
She's a musician named Aaliyah, it was plain/plane to see that was gonna crash and burn
Cause you told Anton Murphy God wouldn't come down to help him win a battle
And then you said-
 "I'm Thomas Aquinas with God on my side"
 You flippin' fraggel
Now if God's on your side I'm not sure which part you save through Him
But I'm pretty sure the last person he'll possess is a middle class atheist
So feel the adrenaline hit your heart like Uma Thurman
I'll fuck up your whole system
I'm not no Willis but the two punch combo pop won't miss him
Tom's no Christian, fuck divine intervention
God won't visit as if my shots won't hit him
Call the Wolf when I leave posh dome missing like that car scene shot in Pulp Fiction
Okay, hold on, time out, back up a sec'
We've all had a good laugh, rapping with threats
The atmosphere's tense, Cracker's in sweats
But now there's really something impressive that we have to address
That angle you penned, about Bamalam's rent having to end
Don't you ever, EVER, make Bagnall feel that fuckin' awkward in a battle again
Doin' jokes in this battle? It's fuckin' hard
I mean how can this clash be a big wonderful laugh
When you got Cee over here with a stick up his ass?
I can imagine him writin', Cracker 
Tongue's gettin' bored so he cracks a lil' random quip
Cee Major's used to this by now he's practiced it and has to grin like, "Ha ha ha...yeah, can we, actually get back to this."
Fuck this man's depressing line of business slides
And that sad expression hiding in his eyes
He's on that no humor tactic, so bureaucratic
You can actually sense him tightening his tie
But hold on, wait
Can anyone back up this man's age?
I mean it's 14 plus, right?
 Yeah
 Was there an allowance for Crack's mate?
 You could walk into a GCSC exam and it wouldn't be weird
No one would say
 "You shouldn't be here."
 They'd just be like
 "Aww, look at the kid pushin' the beard."
You're literally six, you haven't grown into an adult bro
I don't think Marcus is even old enough to be acne prone
Type to answer the door at the flat he owns just to be asked, "Is your mummy or daddy home?"
Marcus you act all hard but we're baffled
How are you the geekiest looking guy in this battle?
Just imagine this fuckin' nerd clubbin'
A bet a ton of girls love it when he jump and turn struttin' like a Thunderbird's puppet
 {imitating Cee Major}
Nah, nah, nah but you claimin' bein' tough is all humor
All with that peace trainin', must've had a poor tutor
You got more shooters than Storm Troopers
Nah, you soundin' less Walt' White and more Walt Jr
I got a good one, I got a good one
You know what rhymes with "Cee Major's religion"?
 I suppose you'll want to tell me
 How about, "He changes for women"?
Nah nah
How 'bout, "He details his opinion for three days and then switchin'
A week later it's different from a weed blazin' addiction to refraining from drinkin'"
 Yeah I guess that rhymed
 Chill, chill...she's made the decision
His wife's the man, it's kinda sad how he's whipped like a flan
He stays under the thumb like a hitchhiker's bags
This prick tries to act like he lives like a man but his chick style of pants...that is kinda bland
Cee's girl? She stays in power
She don't just wear the pants she makes you MAKE the trowsers
I know she's taught you to revere Mecca
And religion is alright...but beer's better
Since you already look like the year 7th, you're going to give in to the peer pressure
I've got some true fuckin' shit I'd like to chew up and spit
Cause Cee's in a religion but the shoe doesn't fit
I mean when you've stuck to script I bet it's lubed up your chick
But when you entered in a contest and you threw money in...that gambling see, regardless of who won the chips
You went against your own beliefs for a few bloody quid
And I don't think the mosque would approve of such a sin
But you've truly disregarded how true Muslim's live
When you partnered up with this guy...cause that's a HUGE fuckin' risk
And let's face it you guys are hardly content
And I love how hard Cee pretends but to be honest you guys aren't even friends
They suck at being friends
They run into each other at events like, "Oh I didn't know you were comin' with weekend."
Hey, even their handshakes are messily disgraced
He goes to give him respect cause he's your mate
And he accidentally decks him in the face
I reckon Cee just hates Cracker and Cracker has no idea
How can we truly prove this to make it work?
 On the count of three say each other's date of birth
 Ha ha ha; 5th of February
 29th of October
 We are way better mates than you two are!
We're better best friends than you'll ever get with your respective best friends that neither of you have respectively ever met yet
 I'm gay for this guy, no homo!
 I'm gay for you too, no Bono!
 It's every second spent together
 Friends forever!
 Penn & Teller
 Sketch and Sensa
 Pesc' & Bender
 Egg and pepper
 Meth and Ke$ha
 Ed and Bella
 Yeah whatever!
What we're sayin' is, you never could predict such a chemistry as this
I said the energy is sick and we're intelligent with it
You were the two remaining losers paired together at the gym
So you're never going to bring the same magnetism in
You got together for the shit but you never should've mixed
You were definitely pissed all the  wasn't missed
You're like a fella and a chick who got a wedding as a fix
And now you're only keeping it together for the kids!
Yo, don't listen to what they said these faggots are just shoutin'
We were the best from the first round of the tournament there was no gamblin' about it
But don't think you winnin' just cause we in Leeds, Don
Ease off my foot in your face taste the Reeboks
I'll have him spittin' kicks like
 "Damn, I didn't know you could beatbox"
Winners of the tournament look at how many teams drop now
T's dawg's surrounded by the dead as he dies in front of this bitch like T-Don
 stand grand on his land two feet
But don't step into my vicinity the quicksand too deep
Yeah you climbin' the ladder but don't let the support gas you please
You'll be left with no leg to stand on if you fall for the way they amp you T 
And now posh boy gonna love it
Cause you put Shuffle into spar but I'm snuffin' him
Cross cuttin' him, Marli shufflin' every bar
These queens ain't got a W, spit nothin' from the heart
So now you got kings out of place cause of Shuffle in the cards
But deal me in it's 21, you're now fuckin' with the best
Don't show me your hands, that shit's bread and butter to the vets
We already said we're two kings so hittin' us is somethin' you'll regret
And now the deck ain't gettin' shuffled, nah Shuffle gettin' decked
Because you men are actors I see it well
Stand up guys/stand up comedians hell
Ridin' for a dime, no lie man was in need of help
Cause really how the fuck you diss the man who's already a parody of himself?
Marlo! I love the way you handle a stage
The way you get reaction for your rappin' and turn back into rage
 I bet your gap here was cray
Because your still show standard displays of all your traveler ways
Cause one minute you're here the next he's back in your face
I understand this isn't my actual accent but hey
I just came to shuffle with the hand that you gave
Just to prove without an accent your shit is average and plain
I had to mirror image this shitty spitter so I could snap on these fakes
 But oh shit maaaan
How are you a gangster when you can't even make a decent hit maaaan
 Now that may sound like a Bad Bar and that we're fuckin' with his gimmick
 But we quotin' that shit straight out of Shuffle vs Liquid
 See that was your bad bar
 Before Bad Bars
 So Marlo and Shuffle T were takin' a piss out of people makin' the shit so anyone who had a bad bar before it was labeled a prick
 No need to wait for the twist, I'm here to say what it is
You did bad bars but you're part of the reason it even came to exist
Because every solo battle all you do is stoop and stumble, dudes will crumble
 Act royal then T us to a rumble
 Yet your crew's are knuckled in and that boy might lose the struggle
 Cause weak vines won't save you when you in this fruitless jungle
 You and your girl
 Lose a couple
 I take her and leave you in trouble
I understand you give her pounds
 Me? I make her lose a couple
 And she can pass a lonely one, and I don't mean to boot shoot your bubble
 But I make you walk it by yourself, without Cupid, Shuffle
Cause I've got that heavy ammo, fuck up your band like a  Django
Don't rap bro, old school went over your head like Kangol
I took first when we last battled, shit got messier than Rambo
Thought I was done, until I pop up in the end and kill him like Benny Blanco
Look, I'm William Tell with arrows, I'll definitely get his mango
You said you wanted sperm on your face
 Don't think we were forgettin' that bro
 To me that's duty free I'm just here to send these fags home
To sayin' they wanted to be undercover with Lefty like that fella Brasco
 So yeah you popular now, risen a couple of tiers
 But there's no passion in your accent you just do it for the love from your peers
 The difference between us, we never done it for cheers
 So what's flavor of the month to two rappers that been hungry for years?
Speakin' of Bad Bars...in your Olde English battle you did somethin' I didn't believe
I mean you said it was an Olde English literature scheme
That literally puts you at the height of idiocy
Cause the title should've been "English At Least"
And your wordplay schemes never seem over to me
So go on and on about crap we can't cope to believe
Then the wordplay's barely even literature it kinda goes to a beat
This could genuinely pass as one of their associate schemes
 For that Diana; Ross
 If Cee saw  if he plain too let that Coco Pops
 I'm that final cut
 Bro so you know
 When I Han Solo shot
 They ain't got the key for  Sutherland
They walk in  Dead
 He don't  J, son born again
 Flying monkeys, watch that Zoo land Er 
 If he Mike & The Mechanics, I'm a  Cracker bottle
Amelie, it's a mixture of the two
But the fact is...you are a cunt
 I  can sir 
 Bitch
But fuck the jokes, we haven't come to roast
The Shuffle bros can fuck off home
We've come to turn these buns to toast with schemes that drag longer than Shuffle's coat
The stuff we wrote could cut your throat
The stuff you wrote is a loving poke, a hug at most
No originality just a couple clones sayin' the same shit over and over like Lux's choke
To us you're both a running joke, so it's punches thrown til our knuckles broke
We pulled you out your comfort zone, so your championship's a sunken boat
 Skull and bones
 Up in smoke
 Covered over with undergrowth
 Cause we're nothing more than luck you've drove up the road to the Double's throne
 But wait wait wait wait
What's the talk about how they won the doubles, just one more joke
 Go on then
 You know what rhymes with "Crack' and Major"?
It's "Frankie Phraser"
 I know what you're insinuating
But they got bars on their own Crack' and him
 Name one
 Dog's spots like Cruella Deville
 Frankie's gem
 Ah, braise sweater/Swave Sevah
 Frank again
 Ah, venom snakebite, Devil May Cry
 I actually wrote that but fuck it, Frank again
 Your voice ain't been the same since Bulletz like Curtis Jackson
 Pssst yeah that was them
That is fine if you're okay with takin' Frankie's line
That's not the problem, the problem is you robbed him
Frankie Phraser! What happened Frankie Phraser?
I don't know why they haven't paid ya
See the fact is, if we had written with Frank to be given some cash
It'd be a vicious attack if we didn't give him some bag
He gave you your best lines it's as simple as that
He was a huge part of you two even winning a match
So for not looking out for him for scripting your clash
You have to live with the fact that you're stabbing him in the back
Don't get it confused it ain't about being tight with cash
This is about that money going back into it's rightful hands
The shit that you actually write? You claim you're sick with pen and paper
But your bars are just a simpler replication of a bigger presentation
Without the fuckin' nuts; Snicker celebration
Motherfuck this, I feel a pinch of devastation
When kids attempt to claim these boring pricks could rep the face of a thing of entertainment
It would be like the league tried enlisting Kevin Bacon
Cause they'd risk the reputation of everything, everywhere with their cringy desperation
But look, I think it's about time to describe it bluntly
Fuck this childish dummy and the Bride Of Chucky
You act surprised we succeed with a style that's funny
But of course we're entertaining it's required of us, see?
It's what makes us top 5 doubles inside the country
Like Bagnall, Bam' and Crug' on their final cut steez
We've rendered our entire timeline a must see
From driving up fleet tryin' to bust free's
To the greatest thing to happen online since 
You guys are lucky I couldn't find the fuckin' time or money for the signing up fee
Cause though you seem to think you'd have wiped the rug clean
It would've been a very different final trust me
You guys act like you're some giant name that are battlin' like you've acquired fame
But no one believes those lies you claim
And when we swoop in and take the title chain
You'll even have to hide away from cyber space like Pirate Bay
See we made Don't Flop's climate change like tidal waves or seismic plate  when they slide and shake
We bring in the black clouds and sky's of grey
You just fill in the background like Skylar Grey
 It's the lightest flame to a fireplace
 Shania Twain to Brian Mays
 A Twilight page to Snipe's Blade
 You're tryna place us some live grenades
 It's child's play
 You think you go overheads like a bride's bouquet
 Nope, you bore them so much they hibernate
 You act like you get to work and grind away, night and day like Miley Ray Cyrus made
But what comes out is you both is a cryin' shame
 You'll both lead Don't Flop to it's final grave
 And we're here to save it
 It's time for change
 It's changing time
 Your fame and hype has gained in size
But claim that you can keep running the game's a lie
You can break the ice and race for life
Cause all I see is a couple ladies takin' strides
But hats off to Crack dawg and Maj'
I mean three grand on the plate and absolutely no help from Frank
On the way
 At least that's what they'll say
But they're gassed off the fame
They'll slack off and make the fans want to hate and that's got to change
 Our aims to have everyone back on today like that was the day that chance got replaced
Cause yeah our pronounced voices may sound bad posh and gay
But at least everybody understands what we say!
See no one expected us, but we're the covert forces in the Trojan Horses at your stony fortress
Tricked you into an open drawbridge
Goin' forward til there's only loads of bonus corpses and broken swords it's
No performance or vocal cords vs the overloads of Roman warships
And now you're gettin' tossed overboard and thrown towards the open waters
 Think about it, how quickly we've been leapin' over borders
 Three battles as a pair and now we're beatin' those before us
 The staff pushed us forward, we've got heaps of close supporters
 We don't need to prove why we're the champs
 The league has spoken for us!
