Cross my heart
Hypnotised, with just one look at you
I'm paralysed
I can't explain why just one touch of you
Drives me insane
You've got me head over heels
You better believe it
Baby, and I know how it feels
Cross my heart
Hope to die
May lightning strike me if I'm telling a lie
Cross my heart
I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone more than I'm loving you
Cross my heart, it's true
Heavenly, Something happens when you're next to me
I get chills
You can ask me anything and baby I will
You've got me out of control
You better believe it
Baby from my head down to my toes
Cross my heart
Hope to die
May lightning strike me if I'm telling a lie
Cross my heart
I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone like I'm loving you
Cross my heart, it's true
You're my valentine every month of the year
Baby really shine I'm so happy you're here
I want you all the time
Am I making myself clear
My love's gonna last forever
Cross my heart
Cross my heart
I've never loved anyone more than I'm loving you
Cross my heart
Hope to die
May lightning strike me if I'm telling a lie
Cross my heart
I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone like I'm loving you
Cross my heart, it's true
Cross my heart
Hope to die
May lightning strike me if I'm telling a lie
Cross my heart
I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone like I'm loving you
Cross my heart, it's true
