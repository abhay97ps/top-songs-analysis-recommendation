Exhibit F
Hail up Spooky
Yo, don't get it twisted cause I MC
Air Force Ones and an ArdWear tee
Snapback, no backpack and trust me
When I say I'm so F to the T
Came to the game through the back door
True say dem man dere was hiding the key
Now I just sit back, laugh
Watch all these debris float on top of the sea
MCs running around with flows
I gave 'em back in double-O-three
But it's OK, but it's all good
Cause I got a new one that ain't free
Girls get wet when they see me stunt
I'm stunting hard like Mr T
Man wanna know where the runaway flows come from
I told 'em 'let me be'
Don't get it twisted cause I'm online
I'll slap man's wig with a rusty nine
Mind all over the doormat
Postman Pat, they're thinking 'what's inside?'
You ain't a badboy
All of the real badboys told me you run and hide
Where's your heart? Where's your pride?
I don't wanna hear that talk 'bout Tride
Out there chasing girls ain't shit
Ain't gonna save you when it's riding time
Get into beef, you little chief
And the only phone you ring is mine?
Ain't got a clue, well then, you
Get off the strip, get a 9 to 5
Show me the best MC in the room
One 16 wind him straight to the side
