Hey
Seen nothing like that shorty with the fat back movin' to the vibes 
Say, "I'm just up in my habitat, playin' little Ratatat, kickin' with my tribe" 
I'm sayin' it's a known fact, show 'em, nigga, no act, sucker, fall in line 
I'm out to get mine, woah, woah, niggas seein' me shine 
Catch me baked outside, wonderin' daily, why, why?
Will she let me get behind? Baby, just close your eyes 
You see we takin' off, leave the stress, no time 
This ain't televised, see I'm her surprise, I
Ooh-ooh, ooh, that vibe
Ooh-ooh, ooh, that vibe
Ooh-ooh, I need those fuckin' vibes
Doo-doo-doo-doo, and we ragin' 'til daylight
Things are gettin' gnarly, got my whiskey by my side
Soarin' through my world and I'm 'bout to take a dive
This is just the sadness in me, sad times
Just another evening and I'm leanin', oh 
Uh, ready, go, set, we won't hold you, neither 
Salute when you see that nigga 
Tell him, "Go off," when you see him, greet him 
Talkin' shit, fuck ya, legend of the cold one, nice
This my life, all my nights
Walkin' like a disco ball, all this ice, aye
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy 
Ayy, ayy, ayy , ayy 
Ayy, ayy, ayy , ayy 
Ayy, ayy, ayy , ayy 
Slightly paranoid, can't believe 'em simply 
Nah, bullshit, miss me , ahh
Call it what it is then, lies
This my fantasy high, sayin' goodbye
I lay at night, it intensifies
