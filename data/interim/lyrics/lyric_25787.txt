Take you down
What I'm about
Take you down
What I'm about
Take you down
I really wanna take you down
And show you what I'm about
Can I take you down?
Your body, body, oh
Your body, body up and down
I'm gonna put you in seven positions for seventy minutes, you get it, babe
You got a lot on your mind, and I wanna ease it up and lick it and slip it in
You do a light scream on that ice cream when I scoop it and dip it in
Unzippin' the tight jeans and that feminine hygiene is magnificent
Tryna show you, girl, I'm different
I get to lickin', and stickin', and lickin', and stickin' it
'Til the pussy get too wet and it's drippin'
And splittin' both them legs like dividends
If it ends up how I want it, then you'll end up sittin' all over my bottom lip, baby
The feelin' of fuckin' you, feelings all up in you
Make it hard for you to bottle 'em, baby
This dick is too big just to swallow it, baby
But still you do it like it's Thanksgiving
And you gobblin', gobblin', gobblin', gobblin', baby
Like what's a goon to a goblin, baby?
That pussy hotter than the summer June in Metropolis, baby
No hidin' it, baby
She know what it is when I come around
Let me take you down
It ain't my first time, but baby girl, let's get it in, yeah 
Bump and grind, already know 
I wanna take you down again 
Hit that rewind button, oh-oh 
Now let me take you down
Really wanna take you down, you down, you down 
Take you down , right now 
You know I know how 
Come put that shit all on top of me, baby
I'm the one they feelin', so they copy me, baby
Got it copywritten, that's my property, baby
And the way that she whip it, it's drivin' me crazy 
Think I've been hittin' the lottery, baby
Buy you a Wraith, I'ma give you my safe
Put you in apartments, you parkin' in places
Yeah, that's the real-life Monopoly, baby
We got all night to get it right, babe
So let me play
We got our whole damn life, baby
So here we are, all alone in this room
Girl, you know what I came to do
Know you got me on your radio playin', old school CB
It's just me and you
It ain't my first time, but baby girl, let's get it in, yeah 
Bump and grind, already know 
I wanna take you down again 
Hit that rewind button, oh-oh
Now let me take you down
Really wanna take you down , you down, you down 
Take you down, right now 
You know I know how , ooh
Ooh, yeah, love
I promise not to give it to nobody, babe 
And promise you won't give it to nobody, babe 
And promise when you promise, keep them promises 
I promise not to give it to nobody, babe 
And promise you won't give it to nobody, babe 
And promise when you promise, keep them promises 
I promise not to give it to nobody, babe 
I promise not to give it to nobody, babe 
And promise you won't give it to nobody, babe 
And promise when you promise, keep them promises 
I promise not to give it to nobody, babe 
I promise not to give it to nobody, babe
And promise you won't give it to nobody, babe
And promise when you promise, keep them promises
