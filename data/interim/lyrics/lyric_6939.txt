I'm gonna wade in the water
I'm gonna walk in the sea
Underneath the ocean
Underwater's where I want to be
We're gonna wash our sins away
Going under's gonna set us free
Off the deep end but for Jesus
And the deep end's deep enough for me
Now Jesus came to Jordan
He came from Galilee
Well he said to John the Baptist
John I wish that you would baptize me
That Baptist started trembling
Jesus took him by the hand
John I found that if we jump in now
We're gonna see the promised land
We're gonna wade in the water
And we're gonna walk in the sea
Underneath the ocean
Underwater's where we want to be
We're gonna wash our sins away
Going under's gonna set us free 
Off the deep end but for Jesus
And the deep end's deep enough for me
Some people thirst for money
Some people thirst for love
Some people thirst for Jesus
I swear by all that shines above
Now the good lord said believing
Makes the wine and water flow
So believe in him
Be the first one in
Or you may be the last to know
We're gonna wade in the water
And we're gonna walk in the sea
Underneath the ocean
Underwater's where we want to be
We're gonna wash our sins away 
Going under's gonna set us free 
Off the deep end but for Jesus
And the deep end's deep enough for me
We're gonna wade in the water
And we're gonna walk in the sea
Off the deep end but for Jesus
And the deep end's deep enough for me
We're gonna wade in the water
And we're gonna walk in the sea
Off the deep end but for Jesus
And the deep end's deep enough for me
Off the deep end but for Jesus
And the deep end's deep enough for me
