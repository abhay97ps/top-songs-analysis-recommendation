Don't my baby look good in them blue jeans?
Tight on the top with a belly button ring
A little tattoo
Somewhere in between
She only shows to me
Hey we're going out dancin'
She's ready tonight
So damn good-lookin' boys
It ain't even right
And when bartender
Says for the lady
What's it going to be?
I tell him man
She ain't into wine and roses
Beer just makes her turn up her nose, and
She can't stand the thought of sippin' champagne
No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila
She needs
Somethin' with a little more edge
And a little more pain
She's my little whiskey Girl
She's my little whiskey Girl
My ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like 'em rough
Baby got a '69 mustang
Four on the floor
And you oughta hear the pipes ring
I jump behind the wheel and it's-a-way we go
Hey, I drive too fast
But she don't care
Blue bandana
Tied all up in her hair
Just sittin' there
Singin' every song on the radio
She ain't into wine and roses
Beer just makes her turn up her nose
And, she can't stand the thought of sipping' champagne
No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila
She needs
Somethin' with a little more edge
And a little more pain
She's my little whiskey Girl
She's my little whiskey Girl
My ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like 'em rough
2:51 - 3:10
No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila
She needs
Somethin' with a little more edge
And a little more pain
She's my little whiskey Girl
Oh, she's my little whiskey Girl
My ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like 'em rough
Yeah, I like 'em rough
I like 'em rough
