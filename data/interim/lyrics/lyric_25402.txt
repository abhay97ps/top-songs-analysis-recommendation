Diamonds on fleek
Bitch, I ain't talking about the heat, oh
Put it on, streets
We straight out the streets
We straight out the streets
Straight out the streets to a penthouse
Straight out the streets to a penthouse, Miami beach 
Niggas talk crazy on tweets 
They don't want it 'cause I come to defeat 
I peep, these niggas all sweet 
Bamboo sticks all in the Jeep 
There's a new weirdo every week 
Get the whip, put it up for my seats 
No cure for the IG disease 
Do anything for clout 
They do anything for clout 
Do anything for clout 
They do anything for clout 
Do anything for clout 
They do anything for clout 
Do anything for clout 
Bitch, watch your mouth 
Bitch, stay in your place 
Bitch, get out the way 
My bitch on your ass, Kim K 
No disrespect 
The nigga be tripping, but we love Ye 
Swapping our cars with my bitch
I bought her the Lambo she bought me the Wraith 
Practice, practice, practice make perfect
Nigga, it's never too late 
I took the ssss outta the snake 
Then I take the bills up out of the bank 
The blog and the media fake 
Shorty DM me, I'm straight 
I'm not gon' bite on the bait 
Sippin' on toxic waste 
On the low with your bitch and it's great 
Mask on her face, Jason
Run to the set, we in shape 
If I go broke she gon' leave, escape 
I put two mill' in the safe just in case, don't go my way 
My kids gotta have money, not just me 
That's selfish 
Oh, I took the crown off the king like Mike did Elvis 
Ooh, the world is wild, he dying
Don't lie, that don't help him 
Ooh, your bitch want to eat up the drip, and you cannot help it
Straight out the streets to a penthouse, Miami beach 
Niggas talk crazy on tweets 
They don't want it 'cause I come to defeat 
I peep, these niggas all sweet 
Bamboo sticks all in the Jeep 
There's a new weirdo every week 
Get the whip, put it up for my seeds 
No cure for the IG disease 
Do anything for clout 
They do anything for clout 
Do anything for clout 
They do anything for clout 
Do anything for clout 
They do anything for clout 
Do anything for clout 
Look, whole lotta people need to hear this 
It's a lotta names on my hit list 
Mouth still say what it wants to 
Pussy still wet like a big bitch 
I should run a whole blog at this rate 
They using my name for clickbait 
Bitches even wanna start fake beef 
To sell their little weave and a mixtape
They know I'm the bomb, they ticking me off
Saying anything to get a response
I know that mean they traffic is low
Somebody just gotta practice to launch
So fuck being tamed, I'd rather be wild
Bitches is Brandy, they wanna be down
Soon as these bitches got something to sell
They say my name, say my name, Destiny Child
Everybody wanna be lit, everybody wanna be rich
Everybody wanna be this, if I was you, I'd hate me bitch
Free my Primes, nigga, suck my dick
All of that talk and I'm calling it out
Public opinions from private accounts
You not a check, then you gotta bounce
I got the drip, come get an ounce
They do anything for clout 
Do anything for clout 
Bitches is mad, bitches is trash 
Oscar the Grouch 
Seeing me win, they gotta hurt
Ooh, ooh, ouch
Said when they see me, what they gon' do?
Bitch, not from the couch, bah
Do anything for clout 
They do anything for clout 
Do anything for clout 
They do anything for clout 
Do anything for clout 
They do anything for clout 
Do anything for clout
