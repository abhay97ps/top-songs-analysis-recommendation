Your love could be sweeter
Than the sweetest apple tree
But I can't taste the goodness
If you keep it far from me
Your eyes could be brighter
Than I've ever seen the sun
But I walk in the shadows
I'm a lonely son-of-a-gun
Daisy Mae 
You've been running around too long
Daisy Mae 
Come on back where you belong
It's okay 
I will always be your friend
Daisy Mae 
You're going to find out in the end
That I'm the one who's going to bring the good times to you
I'll be the first to say
That I need you more than ever, Daisy Mae
Think about what you're missing
And what you've got waiting here
There's so much I'm keeping
Just to whisper in your ear
C'mon Daisy, now, don't hold out
Just to make me want you more
There's no one in this big old world
I'd rather be pulling for
Daisy Mae 
You've been running around too long
Daisy Mae 
Come on back where you belong
It's okay 
I will always be your friend
Daisy Mae 
You're going to find out in the end
That I'm the one who's going to bring the good times to you
I'll be the first to say
That I need you more than ever, Daisy Mae
Daisy Mae 
You've been running around too long
Daisy Mae 
Come on back where you belong
Daisy Mae 
You've been running around too long
Daisy Mae 
Come on back where you belong
Daisy Mae 
You've been running around too long
Daisy Mae 
Come on back where you belong
Daisy Mae 
You've been running around too long
