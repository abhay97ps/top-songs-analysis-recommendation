You can bet there's nothin' but net
When I am in a zone and on a roll
But I got a confession, my own secret obsession
And it's making me lose control
Everybody gather 'round
Well, if Troy can tell his secret, then I can tell mine
...I bake
What?
I love to bake! Strudels, scones, even apple pandowdy
Not another sound!
Someday, I hope to make the perfect crême brûlée!
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you wanna be cool, follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no, no
Stick to the status quo
Look at me and what do you see?
Intelligence beyond compare
But, inside, I am stirring, something strange is occurring
It's a secret I need to share
Open up, dig way down deep
Hip hop is my passion! I love to pop and lock and jam and break
Is that even legal?
Not another peep!
It's just dancing! Sometimes, I think it's cooler than homework
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far to keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no, no
Stick to the status quo
Listen well, I'm ready to tell
About a need that I cannot deny
Dude, there's no explanation for this awesome sensation
But I'm ready to let it fly
Speak your mind and you'll be heard
Alright, if Troy wants to be a singer, then I'm comin' clean
I play the cello!
Awesome! What is it?
...A saw?
No, dude, it's like a giant violin
Not another word!
Do you have to wear a costume?
Coat and tie
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you wanna be cool, follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no, no
Stick to the status quo, oh
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far to keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no, no
Stick to the status quo
This is not what I want
This is not what I planned
And I just gotta say
I do not understand
Something is really—
Something's not right!
Really wrong
And we gotta get things back where they belong
We can do it!
Gotta play!
Stick with what you know
We can do it!
Hip hop, hooray!
She has got to go
We can do it!
Crême brûlée!
Keep your voice down low
Not another peep, no
Not another word, no
Not another sound, no
Everybody, quiet!
Why is everybody staring at you?
Not me. You!
Because of the callbacks?
I can't have people staring at me, I really can't!
No!
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know 
If you wanna be cool, follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no, no
Stick to the status quo, oh
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know 
It is better by far to keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no, no
Stick to the status—
Stick to the status—
Stick to the status quo
