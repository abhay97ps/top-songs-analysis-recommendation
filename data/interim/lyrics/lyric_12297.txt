They were young
Living for the moment
Hearts on fire
Burning in the night
Hopeless love
Driving them together
I don't know why
Vicious words
Cut them like a razor
Filthy lies
Tearing them apart
So they run
Clinging to each other
Can't get too far
So wrong, so wrong
How could they be
So wrong, so wrong
How could love be so wrong
I don't know why
Late at night
Tryin for the border
Through the police rendezvous
Warning shots
Flyin all around
What can they do
So wrong, so wrong
How could they be
So wrong, so wrong
How could love be so wrong
I don't know why
