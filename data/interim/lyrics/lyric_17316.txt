And so the hustlers continue to hustle
And the player's continue to play
I'm a man today
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
Got a hold on life
Taking each day, by day
Being strong, know just where I'm going to
As I get higher and higher
Dreams grow, visions flow by
This is as good as it gets
As I take another hit, sugar
I can't stop, I won't stop
Cause I'm too cool 
And what they say is true
Oh, I'm full of smoke
Cause I'm too cool 
And what they say is true
Oh, I'm full of smoke
Watching my life go down 
Watching my life go down 
Watching my life go down 
Watching my life go down 
And all the day, time just passes by me slowly
But I'm alright, you'll see
Faces and places catching different cases
True runners it's glorified
Same situation, nothin' ever changes
Just being a bonafide hustler
Hustler, baby
From day to night
Business is as good as it gets
As I take another hit, honey
I won't stop, I won't stop
Cause I'm too cool 
And what they say is true
Oh, I'm full of smoke 
Cause I'm too cool 
And what they say is true
Oh, I'm full of smoke 
Watching my life go down 
Watching my life go down 
Watching my life go down 
Watching my life go down 
I'm the man today
Can't tell me nothing
Cause I'm too cool
And what they say is true
Oh, I'm full of smoke 
Cause I'm too cool
And what they say is true 
Oh, I'm full of smoke
Watching my life go down 
Watching my life go down 
Watching my life go down 
Watching my life go down 
Watching my life go down 
Watching my life go down 
Watching my life go down 
Watching my life go down
