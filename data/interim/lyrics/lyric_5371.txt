Well, at five thirty-five at the corner of Franklin and Walnut
A blue station wagon comes slidin' around the corner
And on down Franklin Pike Circle all you're seein' is a streak of blue
And pulls in the drive at the address of 1432
And he says "My head aches and my back hurts and I don't feel like talkin'"
"Don't wan' go the show to see Doctor Zhivago"
"Don't wanna take the dog out walkin'"
"I wanna sit right here in this easy chair, it's been a jungle all day, you know"
The 1432 Franklin Pike Circle Hero is home
He was out pitching ball with the kids in the neighborhood yesterday
And the ole major-leaguer had to quit 'cause he said he threw his arm away
And the kids all hid behind the hedge and laughed at him but wouldn't let it show
Because they love him so

Well , he won a little pony at the Hill High auction just the other day
And he di'n't mean to do it and he wanted to give the pony away
A-When they called out his name he tried not to claim it
But the kids started cryin' 'cause they'd already named it
And who's up ev'ry Saturday morning?
Saddling his new toy? You guessed it-

Well the ten-thirty news usually finds our hero is a sleepy head
And Peter's out somewhere wreckin' the car
And the rest 'the kids have gone to bed
So she takes his hand, they climb the stairs and he falls asleep
And she bends over him so tenderly to kiss his cheek
'cause she loves him so, and she's lucky, you know?
To be married to the 1432
