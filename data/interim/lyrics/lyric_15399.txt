C'mon, man
And with the local DBC news
LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
Word 
Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
I'm rocking my peers, putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions, overpowering
Over the competition, I'm towering
Wrecking shop when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying the price
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Muhammad Ali, they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
That you know I had beef with
Why do you riff with me? The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready 'cause it might go blaow
How ya like me now?
The Ripper will not allow
You to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blasting, outlasting
Kinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out , breakdown
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie 
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie 
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie 
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie 
Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio
Uh, I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new tour
I'm going insane
Starting the hurricane, releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain
I maintain unless ya say my name
Ripping, killing, digging and drilling a hole
Pass the ol' gold
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill at will
The man of the hour, tower of power
I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you
Understand that I'm not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
Damn
Ooh, listen to the way I slay
Your crew
Damage, uh, damage, uh
Damage, uh, damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy-soft sucka, I'll slay him
Farmers  Farmers 
I'm ready 
I think I'm gonna bomb a town 
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
'Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock hard
Knock you out
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie 
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
