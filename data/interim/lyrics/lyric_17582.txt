I can't forget
The way things used to be
Felt so good
Had me saying oh
You know it ain't always money
But don't it sound funny
Everyday is my day when I'm loving no one
Is it reality to think true love was made for me?
Cause of the pain I feel
When the phone rings and it ain't for me?
Most of the time
I read myself to sleep 7 days a week
And I can go on and on and on, you see
But this time could mean I'm running outta love
Late at night
When there's no one around
I can feel the tingle in my hand
Felt so good
Had me saying uh
You know it ain't always money
But don't it sound funny
Everyday is my day when I'm loving no one
Is it reality to think true love was made for me?
Cause of the pain I feel when the phone rings
And it ain't for me?
Most of the time
I read myself to sleep 7 days a week
And I can go on and on and on, you see
But this time could mean
I'm running outta love
Running outta love
I remember love
I remember like it was yesterday
I remember love
