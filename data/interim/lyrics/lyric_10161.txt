Oh, little one
It's so nice to have you near me
To feel once again the love you bring here
Ooh, my little one
I am sorry for the pain you've felt
Say the word, and Daddy will make it disappear
Oh, little one 
Bring your love here
Oh, little one 
I need you near
Oh, little one 
Don't live in fear
Of the future
Because I will always be there
Oh, little one
Music is my life, I hope you understand
Traveling on the road with me, you can see the way we live
Oh, little one
I will always cherish these days with you
As time goes by, I hope you see the love I tried to give
Oh, little one 
Let your love flow
Precious one 
Like a flower, you'll grow
Oh, little 
Someday you'll have your own little one
And you will always be there
Oh oh whoa oh
Little one, it's so nice to have you near me
To feel once again the love you bring here
Oh little one, I am sorry for the pain you've felt
Say the word, and Daddy will make it disappear
Oh, little one 
Bring your love here
Oh, little one 
I need you near
Oh, little one 
Don't live in fear
Of the future
Because I will always be there
Oh, little one 
Let your love flow
Precious one 
Like a flower, you'll grow
Oh, little 
Someday you'll have your own little one
And you will always be there
Oh, yeah
Ooh ooh
Yeah, yeah
Oh oh
My little one 
My little one 
My little one 
Yeah
My little one 
My little one 
My little one 
What do you get, yeah?
My little one 
What are you thinking?
My little one 
Oh whoa oh
My little one
