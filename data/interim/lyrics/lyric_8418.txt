Well I had just got out from the county prison
Doin' 90 days for non-support
Tried to find me an executive position
But no matter how smooth I talked
They wouldn't listen to the fact that I was genius
The man said, "We got all that we can use."
Now I got them
Steadily depressin', low down mind-messin'
Workin' at the carwash blues
Well I should be sittin' in an air conditioned
Office with a swivel chair
Talkin' some trash to the secretary, sayin'
"Hey now mama, come on over here."
Instead I'm stuck here rubbin' these fenders with a rag
And walkin' home in soggy old shoes
With them steadily depressin', low down mind-messin'
Workin' at the carwash blues
You know a man of my ability
He should be smokin' on a big cigar
But till I get myself straight
I guess I'll just have to wait
In my rubber suit rubbin' these cars
Well, all I can do is just shake my head
You might not believe that it's true
For working at this end of Niagara Falls
Is an undiscovered Howard Hughes
So baby, don't 'spect to see me
With no double martini
In any high-brow society news
Cause I got them
Steadily depressin', low down mind-messin'
Workin' at the carwash blues
So baby, don't 'spect to see me
With no double martini
In any high-brow society news
Cause I got them
Steadily depressin', low down mind-messin'
Workin' at the carwash blues
Yeah, I got them
Steadily depressin', low down mind-messin'
Workin' at the carwash blues
