I don't like snails, or toads, or frogs
Or strange things living under logs
But, mmm, I love onions
I don't like dancin' with crazy Ted
He's always jumpin' on my head
But, mmm, I love onions
Onions, onions, la la la. Onions, onions, ha ha ha
Root toot doodle-ee-oot doot doo doot
Onions, onions, la la la. Onions, onions, ha ha ha
Root toot doodle-ee-oot doot doo doot
I don't like rain, or snow, or hail
Or Moby Dick, the great white whale
But, mmm, I love onions
I don't like shoes that pinch your toes
Or people who squirt you with a garden hose
But, mmm, I love onions
Onions, onions, la la la. Onions, onions, ha ha ha
Root toot doodle-ee-oot doot doo doot
Onions, onions, la la la. Onions, onions, ha ha ha
Root toot doodle-ee-oot doot doo doot. Yeah!
The onion is a tuberous vegetable and is a member of the genus stinkus delicioso. It was highly prized by the ancient Egyptian pharaohs, and their friends and cousins-a. They cause watering of the eyes and rubifaction of the skin, but it is very, very tasty. 
Onions, onions, la la la. Onions, onions, ha ha ha

Root toot doodle-ee-oot doot doo doot
