Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Oh-oh oh-ooh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Oh-oh oh-ooh
Baby
Since you been gone
I been hanging 'round here lately
With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car
Tried to clear my mind, didn't help me
I guess I'm all messed up now, baby
As soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play, yeah
A song comes on, on the radio
And there you are, baby
Once again
It's just another sad love song
Racking my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
And be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you
Since you been gone
I keep thinkin' about you, baby
It gets me all choked up
This heart of mine keeps dreamin' of you
And it's crazy, babe
You'd think I'd had enough, yeah
Soon as I get you out my head
I'm in my car again, ooh darling
Just one request from the radio
I'm back in love, sugar
Once again
It's just another sad love song
Racking my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
And be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you
It's just another sad love song
Racking my brain like crazy 
Guess I'm all torn up
And be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me 
Here come the strings
Then somebody sings
Only takes a beat
And then it starts killin' me, darling
Only takes one note, I tell ya
From that radio
It's just another lonely love song
It's just another sad love song
Racking my brain like crazy 
Guess I'm all torn up 
And be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me 
So sad
So sad, so sad 
So sad, sad love song
Ooh, I heard it on the radio last night
So sad
So sad, so sad 
So sad, sad love song 
You got me singin' another love song all night, darling
It's just another sad love song
Racking my brain like crazy 
Guess I'm all torn up
And be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you
So sad, so sad
So sad, sad love song 
And it's all because of you
So sad, so sad
So sad, sad love song
