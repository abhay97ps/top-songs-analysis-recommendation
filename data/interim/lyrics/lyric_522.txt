Have you ever been lonely
Have you ever been blue
Have you ever loved someone
Just as I love you
Can't you see I'm sorry
For each mistake I've made
Can't you see I've changed, dear
Can't you see I've paid
Be a little forgiving
Take me back to your heart
How can I go on living
Now that we're apart
If you knew what
I've been through
You would know why I ask you
Have you ever been lonely
Have you ever been blue
Be a little forgiving
Take me back to your heart
How can I go on living
Now that we're apart
If you knew what
I've been through
You would know why I ask you
Have you ever been lonely
Have you ever been blue
So lonely and blue
