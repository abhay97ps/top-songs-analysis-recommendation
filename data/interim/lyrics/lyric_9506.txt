Foxy from the Roxy
Might turn some heads tonight
Flashlight dream
Peaches and cream delight
Roxy Roller
Five-bob job
She gets bubble-gum on her knees
Down between the seats
Sometime she'll pass you the keys
Roxy Roller
Oooh Roxy Roller
Roxy Roller, Roxy
Her daddy, le commissioner
Took far more than his share
So Roxy joined the syndicate
Knowing it wasn't fair
Roxy Roller
Oooh Roxy Roller
Roxy Roller, Roxy
Oooh Roxy Roller
Oooh Roxy
