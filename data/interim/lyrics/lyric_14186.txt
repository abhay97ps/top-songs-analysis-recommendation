She's fly and fresh
She's fly and fresh
She's def
Truly def
Hey
You got me jumping
You're beautiful body sure is thumping
Hey I just want to talk to you
But you keep digging me
Like you got something else to do
She's fly
You're fly
And fresh
And fresh
Girl is truly def
Girl won't you be mine
She's fly
So fly
And fresh
And fresh
She's def
And I want to be your man
Hey
I didn't get your name
You got your numbers all in the air
Tell me what's your claim to fame
Hey
So you don't wanna listen
Well I'm just super cool crushin' to start dissin'
You walk around here with your butt on your back
Tell me baby, what's up like that
You have to drive off in a Cadillac
Tell me, baby 
What's up like that
She's fly
You're fly
And fresh
And fresh
Girl is truly def
Girl won't you be mine
She's fly
So fly
And fresh
That girl's the best
And I want to be your man
Girl, don't be shy
'Cause I'm not your average guy
Listen to me if you can
'Cause I want to be your man
She's fly
You're fly
And fresh
That girl's the best
She's fly
You're fly
And fresh
That girl's the best
