I’m gonna tell you what it’s all about
Sweet things trying to put me out
She gone and found herself another man
She trying to let me down as fast as she can
It's only love, it drives me crazy
It's only love pretty baby
Baby, what you trying to do
Well after runnin’ round a time or two
I found out only the best will do
Well it's your own fault for letting her go
So maybe now you'll take it slow
It's only love, it drives me crazy
It's only love pretty baby
Baby, what you trying to do
Well, it's all over now but the crying
I keep on paying the price for my lying
Don't let it get you down it ain't nothing new
You ain't the only one that it's happened to
It's only love, it drives me crazy
It's only love pretty baby
Baby, what you trying to do
It's only love 
It drives me crazy 
It’s only love 
, it drives me crazy
It’s only love , it drives me crazy
It’s only love pretty baby
Baby, what you trying to do
