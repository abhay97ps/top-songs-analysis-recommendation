Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
Every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn
And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
Our love is pastured, such a mournful sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
So I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa
And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest  {Before the dawn}
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
And given half the chance, would I take any of it back?
It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone
It's always darkest before the dawn
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
Looking for heaven
Found the devil in me
Looking for heaven
Found the devil in me
But what the hell
I'm gonna let it happen to me, yeah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa 
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh woah 
And it's hard to dance 
With a devil on your back
{So shake him off} oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out 
Shake it out, shake it out, oh woah 
Shake it out, shake it out 
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa 
And it's {Mercedes: hard to dance} with a devil on your back
{So shake him off} oh woah
Shake it out, shake it out 
Shake it out, shake it out, oh woah 
Shake it out, shake it out 
Shake it out, shake it out, oh woah 
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off
Oh whoa
