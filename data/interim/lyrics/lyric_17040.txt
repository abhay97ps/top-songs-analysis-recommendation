Baby, please don't go 
Stay right by my side 
Rainy days
Brings back memories of you
And I will never lie
I want you by my side
Thinking of you
Makes me really not want you to go
Please stay
Stay with me
Baby, please don't go 
Stay right by my side 
Oh, I can't change the fact
That I want you in my life
Don't go
My heart's not strong
Now all I see
To you, you are my friend
Don't leave
I'll do anything
These rainy days bring back memories
These rainy days bring back memories
These rainy days bring back memories
Of you
These rainy days bring back memories
These rainy days bring back memories
These rainy days bring back memories
Of you
Baby, please don't go 
Stay right by my side 
These rainy days bring back memories 
These rainy days bring back memories 
These rainy days bring back memories 
Of you 
These rainy days bring back memories 
These rainy days bring back memories 
These rainy days bring back memories 
Of you
Baby, please don't go 
Stay right by my side 
Baby, please don't go
Stay right by my side
Stay right by my side
Stay right by my side
Stay right by my side 
Stay right by my side
