Last night I gave up on myself
I hit the bed, tell me, what should I do?
And in a dream I saw your face
It's more than just a face
You make me want to give my heart away
I feel the magic
Like I never felt before
I imagine that it's always been there
I feel the magic
There's an angel looking after me
Angel baby, give me more and more and
Today I woke up by myself
I hit the streets, I wondered "what should I do?"
I never noticed from the start
That I could feel alive again
That I could feel a part of
I feel the magic
Like I never felt before
I imagine that it's always been there
I feel the magic
There's an angel looking after me
Angel baby, give me more and more and
I never noticed from the start
That I could feel alive again
That I could feel a part of
I feel the magic
Like I never felt before
I imagine that it's always been there
I feel the magic
There's an angel looking after me
Angel baby, give me more and more and
I feel the magic
Like I never felt before
I imagine that it's always been there
I feel the magic
There's an angel looking after me
Angel baby, give me more and more and
I feel the magic
Like I never felt before
I imagine that it's always been there
I feel the magic
There's an angel looking after me
Angel baby, give me more and more and
I feel the magic
Like I never felt before
I imagine that it's always been there
I feel the magic
There's an angel looking after me
Angel baby, give me more and more and
I feel the magic
I feel the magic
