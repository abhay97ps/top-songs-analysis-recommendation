Well alright y'all, now it's time to get tough
So everybody say Mr. Big Stuff 
Mr. Big Stuff 
Ha ha ha
Well it's T-Ski and I'm back again
Just to rock your mind down to the end
I'm not a conductor, faster than lightning
Listen to my rhyme but don't start biting
You can dance with them, you can dance with us
I'm gonna rock you, from dawn to dust
But if you want to dance but don't know how
You listen to my voice and let it move you around
I got a MC voice that's always rockin'
To keep your fingers steady poppin'
So people, you get ready to move
Scream it out and say Grand Groove 
Grand Groove! 
Ha ha ha
So ladies get on out your chair
Stop twirling your fingers in your hair
You like the music and the atmosphere
All the ladies say Oh yeah 
T-Ski y'all
Well I got my name in the Hall of Fame
And ten years later it will still be the same
'Cause you can see my mic in the wax museum
Right in the LA Coliseum
'Cause I rock my mic with power and pride
If you're not really down, you better step aside
Maybe that way you won't get hurt
About the music coming to you by the expert
Mr. Big Stuff
Ah yeah
I'm your lower, your higher, set your soul fire
I aim to inquire that the freaks desire
I cannot require many techniques
To make you all wanna do the freak
I'm your hipper, your skipper, your big dipper
When it comes to the check I'm a big tipper
The rookie of the year so listen here
My name is T-Ski, I have a better idea
It's like having a watch that can't tell time
It's like me on the mic and I don't know a rhyme
Like going to the beach and there ain't no sand
Like a Ku Klux leader without the Klan
Like fish like to swim, birds like to fly
You wanna go to heaven but don't wanna die
Like the Daily News without Ann Landers
Like Kentucky Fried Chicken without the Sanders
Like going to my wedding and forgettin' my ring
Like calling me the , it ain't no thing
So let's rock, freak to my beat
But you check rock and you don't stop
C'mon man, give me a break!
Now if the break was on and you do agree
Everybody say T-Ski 
T-Ski 
Making money
Now you dip and dive, you socialize
You didn't understand but you better get wise
'Cause my name is T-Ski and I'm qualified
Mr. Big Stuff
It's so rough y'all
Mr. Big Stuff
So ladies get on out your chair
Stop twirling your fingers in your hair
You like the music and the atmosphere
All the ladies say Oh yeah 
T-Ski y'all
A little taste of the bass
Now bring up the drum
Now we gonna get sweet on the keyboard one time
Now c'mon mister guitar man
Ha ha, ha ha!
Ah yeah, just wanna get funky 
What?
Ah man
Come on now
Give me a break
