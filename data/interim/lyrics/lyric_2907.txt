I know it's crazy, but I can't stop
Yeah I ought to, but I can't stop
In all my dreams I've never found
Somebody like you
I know it's crazy, but I can't stop
Yeah I ought to, but I can't stop
When we're together I'm in heaven
I don't know what to do
I can't stop the beat of my heart
You've driven me wild from the start
I, I want you so
When, when I'm with you I know
But I know
I know it's crazy, but I can't stop
Yeah I ought to, but I can't stop
In all my dreams I've never found
Somebody like you
I know it's crazy, but I can't stop
Yeah I ought to, but I can't stop
When we're together I'm in heaven
I don't know what to do
Yeah!
I can't stop my lips when we kiss
We can't go on kissing like this
I, I want you so
When, when I'm with you I know
I know it's crazy, but I can't stop
Yeah I ought to, but I can't stop
In all my dreams I've never found
Somebody like you
I know it's crazy, but I can't stop
Yeah I ought to, but I can't stop
When we're together I'm in heaven
I don't know what to do
I know it's crazy, but I can't stop
I know I ought to, but I can't stop
I know it's crazy, but I can't stop
