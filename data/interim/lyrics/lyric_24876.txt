You know how I'm rockin', but my watch is freezed up 
I can't wait until they drop that Lamborghini truck 
I'm careful where I park it, hoes will have it keyed up

Slim waist, ass fat , my shit is caked up
My bad bitch activate , without no makeup
This that collard greens, cornbread, neck bone, back fat

Put it on him, then your nigga never comin' home

Expensive weave, and my checks is worth some racks, ugh
Yeah, pop that pussy like you ain't popped that pussy in a while
Pop that pussy like poppin' pussy is goin' out of style
Pop that pussy while you work, pop that pussy up at church
Pop that pussy on the pole, pop that pussy on the stove
Make that pussy slip and slide, like you from the 305
Put your tongue out in the mirror, pop that pussy while you drive
Spread them asscheeks open, make that pussy crack a smile
Lock your legs 'round that nigga, make him give your ass a child 
Gimme some neck, gimme a check
Pussy so good, make a nigga invest
Get a little spit, I'm gettin' it wet
