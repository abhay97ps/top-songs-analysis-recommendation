Moon River
Wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
Oh, dream maker
You old heartbreaker
Wherever you're going, I'm going your way
Two drifters
Off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon River and me
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon River and me
