It's like jumping it's like leaping
It's like walking on the ceiling
It's like floating
It's like flying through the air
It's like soaring
It's like gliding
It's a rocket ship you're riding
It's a feeling that can take you anywhere
So why they call it falling?
Why they call it falling?
Why they call it falling?
I don't know
There was passion
There was laughter
The first morning after
I just couldn't get my feet to touch the ground
Every time we were together
We'd talked about forever
I was certain
It was heaven we had found
But you can't live your life
Walking in the clouds
Sooner or later
You have to come down
It's like a knife
Through the heart
When it all comes apart
It's like someone takes a pin to your balloon
It's a hole
It's a cave
It's kind of like a grave
When he tells you that he's found somebody new
And why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Now I know
Why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Now I know
