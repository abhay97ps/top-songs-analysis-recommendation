I can't be with you again
Don't remind me of the good times we had
Learned a lot from us since then
And I never want these feelings to ever come again
You'll never hear me crying
You'll never see my trying
To love you once again
Your love is so past tense
Please don't tell me that you've changed
Don't wanna hear of how you've lost your evil ways
A lot has changed, this time it's me
And I won't go back to feeling helpless and deceived
You'll never hear me crying
You'll never see my trying
To love you once again
Your love is so past tense
You'll never hear me crying
You'll never see my trying
To love you once again
Your love is so past tense
To think that you had me fooled every now and then
You had me believing that I was the reason that you left
But I won't fall back in love with you again
I don't even wanna be your friend
You'll never hear me crying
You'll never see my trying
To love you once again
Your love is so past tense
You'll never hear me crying
You'll never see my trying
To love you once again
Your love is so past tense
