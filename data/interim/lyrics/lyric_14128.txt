You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
What kind of girl do you think I am?
It's just too soon
Can't you understand?
I'm not the kind of girl who has to
I lay you down before I fall in love
It's been kind of nice here waiting
But baby, you got to slow down
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
Please just be patient if nothing else
Oh, babe
Just know that I respect myself
Yes, I do
But I hope I didn't lead you to thinking
Thinking that I was that easy, boy
I know that we're living in the '80s
Yet some things never change
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
I'm just an old fashioned girl
When it comes down to love
Before I give you some love
I've got to be sure your intentions are pure
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
You're puttin' a rush on me
You're puttin' a rush on me
Baby, can't you see
Puttin' a rush on me
Yeh, ey, hey, hey
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
You're puttin' a rush on me
Oh, baby, can't you see
Puttin' a rush on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'd like to know
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
You're puttin' a rush on me
But I'd like to know you better
