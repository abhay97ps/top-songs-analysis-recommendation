For as long as you're willing girl
Want you to know that I'm willing too
And where you want me to go girl
I'll be willing to go there for you
If you want me to take my time
I'll be willing to spend the night
All you gotta say is please stay Joe
And I'll be staying as long as you saying...
More and More
More and more
More and more
More, more
More and more
More and more
More and more
More, more
If you want me to make your love come
I'll be willing to do anything
Even if you me to kiss places
I'll be willing to make you scream
Said I'm down for whatever you say
All you gotta do is speak your mind
Want me here Monday to Monday
Then baby girl its fine
As you screaming more..
Girl we'll be going
From the bed to the floor baby
From the bedroom to the kitchen
From the kitchen to the dining room
Straight to the living room
Taking you up the stairs baby
Guarantee I'm bout to drive you crazy
We'll be all over the house
As long as you screaming for me, saying give me more..
All the ladies sing with me..
