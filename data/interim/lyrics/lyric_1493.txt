You broke my heart
Cause I couldn't dance
You didn't even want me around
And now I'm back
To let you know
I can really shake 'em down
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Ah, do you love me?
Now that I can dance
Watch me now, hey
Ah, work it out baby
Well, you're drivin' me crazy
With a little bit of soul now
I can mash-potato
And I can do the twist
Now tell me baby
Mmm, do you like it like this
Tell me
Tell me
Do you love me?
Now, do you love me?
Now, do you love me?
Now that I can dance
Dance
Watch me now, oh
Ah, shake it up, shake it
Ah, shake 'em, shake 'em down
Ah, little bit of soul now
Ah, shake it, shake it baby
Ah, you're driving me crazy
Ah, don't get lazy
I can mash-potato
And I can do the twist
Well now tell me baby
Mmm, do you like it like this
Tell me
Tell me
Do you love me?
Now, do you love me?
Now, do you love me?
Now...that I...can dance...
Hey!
Ah, I'm working hard baby
Well, you're driving me crazy
And don't you get lazy
Ah, hey hey baby
Well, you're driving me crazy
And don't you get lazy
