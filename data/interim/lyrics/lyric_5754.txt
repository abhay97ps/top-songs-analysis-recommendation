Hush hush
Hushabye
Hushabye
Hushabye
Oh my darlin' don't you cry
Guardian angels up above
Take care of the one I love
Hush hush
Hushabye
Hush hush
Hushabye
Lullabye and goodnight
In your dreams I hold you tight
Lullabye and goodnight
Til the dawns early light
Pillows lying on your bed
Oh my darling rest your head
Sandman will be coming soon
Singing you a slumber tune
Hush
Hush
Hushabye
Hush
Hush
Hushabye
