See the clouds adrift so far below
Ever changing as they come and go;
Makes me wonder why I'm up so high
When really I am down so low
Of all the wonders I was one allowed
I think that I would always choose a cloud
Always bring my feelings right out loud
Whether I'm ashamed or proud
And on this airplane coming home to you
Sometimes I think I've flown my whole life through
My whole life through
As I wing my way to you
See the clouds, they're giving life below
In colors that the canvass cannot show;
Keeping secrets no one else could know
For I'm the one who told them so
Now and then I get up close to you
Like to stay, but I'm just passing through
So I'll have to say goodbye
Until next time I fly
