Bro got the 9, I got the 4 tucked 
Niggas wanna keep talkin', they gotta show us 
Pull up in a Rolls same color as pour-up 
Told her bend right over, do the toe-touch 
Aventador, my doors, I lift 'em like, "Sure 'nough" 
I pull up in a Lam', this not a Lotus 
I see my opps again, I gotta load up
I got a demon in my engine, I did a donut 
Oh no, no, no, not you again
Baby girl, yeah, you a ten
On the real, yeah, you a ten
But you cannot pay your rent
Got her rubbin' on my skin
Sing to her like Boyz II Men
Tired of her, give her to my friend
Then I proceed to her twin 
This a UZI, not a MAC, I got no pin
I bet you couldn't tell the difference and that girl a gem 
Gucci pants come out the Gucci store, come with a hem 
My pants, they so tight, don't know if they for her or him 
Niggas want my style, I got some swag that you can lend 
Balenciaga with the Prada, still rock Phillip Lim 
Louis bandana tied around my chin 
Gosha socks, them bitches pulled up all the way to my shin 
Yes, I'm off a 30, psych, nah, I just took three 10s
We rock spinners, we rock spinners on my rims 
You sucker niggas do anything cause y'all wanna win 
Oh, no, no, I won't fold, I won't bend
Aventador, my doors, I lift 'em like, "Sure 'nough" 
I pull up in a Lam', this not a Lotus 
I see my opps again, I gotta load up
I got a demon in my engine, I did a donut 
Oh no, no, no, not you again
Baby girl, yeah, you a ten
On the real, yeah, you a ten
But you cannot pay your rent
Got her rubbin' on my skin
Sing to her like Boyz II Men
Tired of her, give her to my friend
Then I proceed to her twin 
No, I don't drink lean, but pour that four up 
I get so high that I might throw up 
They keep judging me, but I'm like so what? 
Yeah, let's get geeked, girl, let's load up 
I bet these niggas never thought I'd blow up 
Yeah, so much check but I get more bucks 
That nigga mad because his bitch still chose us 
I got her tweakin' on the six, she goin' nuts 
Yeah, she goin' nuts 
She said "How the diamonds on your neck so polar?" 
Baby, my ice on my neck can't get no colder 
And I'm from outer space, top of my Wraith so solar 
Aventador, my doors, I lift 'em like, "Sure 'nough" 
I pull up in a Lam', this not a Lotus
I see my opps again, I gotta load up 
I got a demon in my engine, I did a donut 
Oh no, no, no, not you again
Baby girl, yeah, you a ten
On the real, yeah, you a ten
But you cannot pay your rent 
Got her rubbin' on my skin
Sing to her like Boyz II Men
