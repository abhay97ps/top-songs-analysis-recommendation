You better leave  my kitten alone 
You better leave  my kitten alone 
I done told you big bad bulldog
You better leave her alone 
Don't you know my kitten is a dream?
Don't you know my kitten is a dream?
So, get your hands off of her, 'cause I'm her lovin' man
*Mr. Dog I'm gonna hit you on the top a yo' head
The Batgirl's gonna miss you
And you'll wish that you were dead
If you don't lee-ee-eave my kitten alone
Yes, I love my little kitten
Like you hounddogs love your bone
Mr. Dog, I'm gonna hit you on the top a yo' head
The *Batgirl's gonna miss you
And you'll wish that you were dead
If you don't lee-eee-eave my kitten alone
Yes, I love my little kitten
Like all you hounddogs love your bone
Oh yeah
You better leave
You better leave
FADES-
You better lee-eee-eee-eave
