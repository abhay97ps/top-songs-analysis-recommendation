Aaaaaaahhhhhh..oooooohh
You know the sun comes up in the morning 
And that, summer comes June 
You know that, rain comes out from the sky 
And it makes the flowers bloom 
But you don't know nothin'
'Til you know that I love you 
Boy I luv you
Said you don't know nothin'
'Til you know that I love you 
'Til you know I love you
Hmm, you know that one plus one equals two 
And that two times two is four 
You know that roses are red 
And violets are blue 
But you can stand to learn a little more 
'Cause you don't know nothin'
'Til you know that I love you 
Boy I love you
Said you don't know nothin'
'Til you know that I love you
You
Baby I know
I know I, can reach you
I'll show you, I'll teach you
'Cause you don't know nothin'
'Til you know that I love you 
'Till you know, you know that I love you!
You know I love long walks in the park 
Like the ones we always say 
You know I love long talks in the dark 
And how it makes us stay away 
But you don't know nothin'
'Til you know that I love you
You 
Boy I love you
Said you don't know nothin'
'Til you know that I love you 
Baby I know
I know I, can reach you
I'll show you, I'll teach you
'Cause you don't know nothin'
'Til you know that I love you 
Baby if you
Just follow the yurning
Then soon you'll be learning!
'Cause you
Don't, don't, don't know nothing 
Know nothin'--------Youu Don't 
Know nothin'--you don't know  
Yooou don't know nothin' 
Don't...
Know nothin'
'Til you know that I love...
Yooou don't know nothin'
Don't, don't, don't know nothing
Know nothin'--------Youu Don't
Know nothin'--you don't know 
Don't...
Know nothin'
'Til you know that I love...
Yooou don't know nothin'
Don't, don't, don't know nothing
Know nothin'--------Youu Don't
Know nothin'--you don't know 
Don't...
Know nothin'
'Til you know
'Til you know
'TIL YOU KNOW!
'Til you know that I love
YOU!
