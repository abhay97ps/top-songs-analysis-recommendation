Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit' this one
Y'all know what this is... So So Def
Add the whole top diamond and the bottom rosegold
Got 30 down at the bottom, 30 more at the top
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changing grills every day, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely  In my white tee 
Or on South Beach  in my wife beat
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
Cause when I...
Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleaming 
Eyes stay low from the Chiefing 
I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gumdrops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say...
Smile for me daddy 
Let me see ya grill 
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Smile for me daddy 
I want to see your grill 
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Add a whole top diamonds and the bottom rose gold
What it do, baby, it's the iceman Paul Wall 
I got my mouth looking something like a disco ball 
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath 
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling, showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil 
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
20 carats 30 stacks let 'em know I'm so for real 
My motivation is from 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouthpiece simply symbolize success 
I got the wristwear and neckwear that's captivating 
But it's what smile that's got these onlookers spectating 
My mouthpiece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad 
My teeth are mind-blowing, giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman 'cause I'm selling everybody grills
Smile for me daddy 
Let me see ya grill 
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Smile for me daddy 
I want to see your grill 
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Add a whole top diamonds and the bottom rose gold
Gipp got them yellows, got them purples, got them reds
Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box
It's what it do, in the Lou', ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks and the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot 'em, on the top, on the bottom
Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham
I ain't dissing nobody but let's bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah, these hoes can't focus 'cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's, you can see my mouth jewelry
I got four different sets, it's a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same got my name in the mold
Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom row's gold
Smile for me daddy 
Let me see ya grill 
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Smile for me daddy 
I want to see your grill 
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom rose gold
Sing to me
Boy, how you get ya grill that way?
And how much did you pay?
Every time I see you
Tha first thing I'm gon' say, hey
Smile for me daddy 
Let me see ya grill 
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Smile for me daddy 
I want to see your grill 
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Add a whole top diamonds and the bottom rose gold
