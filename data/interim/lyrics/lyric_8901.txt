We used to play out in the rain
Your mother scolded us
She said that we were bad
I thought I'd better go on home 
You watched till I was gone
Ooh, girl, you looked so sad
I picked you up when you fell and cut your knee
I told you not to cry and held you close to me
As I was running through the storm
To get my umbrella
I stopped in shock when I saw you
With another fellow, oh, wow
Can you remember the rain?
Can you remember the rain?
You left me for somebody else
Now I must face life by myself
You broke so many rules in school
I took the blame for you
I guess I was the fool
You used to sneak me notes in class
I winked my eye and laughed
Those days went by so fast
I've got remarks that torn us all apart
I'm still tryna put back the pieces to my heart
And I'll be crying your name, girl
Until my very last breath
'Cause my existence without you
Ain't nothing but a little death
Gosh
Can you remember the rain?
Can you remember the rain?
You left me for somebody else
Now I must face life by myself
Think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it
Oh! Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Can you remember
The rain?
Can you remember
The rain?
Can you remember
The rain?
Can you remember
The rain?
