Dumb head 
I'm a stupid little girl
Just a dumb head 
Do do do do
I had him where I wanted him
He was saying he'd be mine
And none could take my place
And I laughed in his face
Well, I made some goofs
But this one tops them all
So I think I'll go bang
My head against the wall
Cause I'm a dumb head 
I'm a stupid little girl
Just a dumb head 
Do do do do...
I had him where I wanted him
He was giving me his heart
And begging me to stay
And I just walked away
Well, gee, now I'm convinced
That I must be insane
Or else I was born with
A peanut for a brain
Cause I'm a dumb head 
I'm a stupid little girl
Just a dumb head 
Do do do do...
I couldn't see the
Forest through the trees
The boy I loved was
Down on his knees
And I played the game
And acted like a tease
Somebody kick me, please
Cause I'm a dumb head 
I'm a stupid little girl
Just a dumb head 
Do do do do...
Now I'm convinced
That I must be insane
Or else I was born with
A peanut for a brain
Cause I'm a dumb head 
I'm a stupid little girl
Just a dumb head 
Goofy little girl
Just a dumb head 
Silly little girl
Just a dumb head 
Stupid little girl
Just a dumb head 
Stupid little girl...
