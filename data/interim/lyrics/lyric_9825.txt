Body began to spin
Please help me pretend
That I don't see
Who just walked in the door
I'm weak in the knees
But I gotta make believe
That I'm hurt free
I just can't let him know
That my heart is breaking apart
Music, rescue me
I gotta keep dancing 
Smiling 
To keep from breaking apart
I gotta keep dancing 
Smiling 
To cover up my broken heart
Don't let the music stop
I've gotta camouflage my feelings
He's not here with me
I should have known
That I never should
Have come to the party
I must listen to the beat
Music, can you take my away
Help me hide the pain
I gotta keep dancing 
Smiling
