Uh-huh, are you? 
And no one cares 
To hell with stares 
And no one's there 
Tonight I'm here 
I'm up against the speaker, try'na take on the music
It's like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in the zone 
I wanna get in the zone 
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm
Try'na hit it, chic-a-tah

And now's your turn  
I'm up against the speaker, try'na take on the music
