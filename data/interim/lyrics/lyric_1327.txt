In the beginning, you really loved me
But I was too blind and I couldn't see
But now you've left me, oh, how I cry
You don't miss your water, till your well runs dry
I kept you crying, sad and blue
I was a playboy and I wouldn't be true
But when you left me and said 'Bye, bye'
I missed my water, my well ran dry
Now, I sit and wonder and how can this be?
I never thought, you'd ever leave me
But now you've left me, oh, how I cry
You don't miss your water, till your well runs dry
You don't miss your water, till your well runs dry
