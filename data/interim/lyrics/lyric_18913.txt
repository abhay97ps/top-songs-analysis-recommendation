That's all it took to get started back then
A trip to the courthouse across the state line
No one could stop her, she'd made up her mind
He was eighteen, she wasn't
But she said she was and never thought twice
Came back home as my daddy's wife
She just shook her head when her momma said
"Are you sure he's the one?" She was
He took a job and farmed on the side
He made the ends meet, but she kept 'em tied
Changes were coming to their little world
She said "What would you like, a boy or a girl?"

In what seemed like the blink of an eye
I held her hand as I leaned down to ask her
"Momma, Are you ready to say goodbye?"

Holdin' my hand as she let go of life
Daddy always said a woman like her
Would be hard to give up
And she was
She was
If there ever was a picture of love
She was
