I used to run around
You never tied me down
My feet are homeward bound
And I do love you
What are you waiting for
Come on and close the door
I couldn't love you more
Than I do love you
She put the light on
She put the light on
Lady, put the light on
Light on me
She put the light on
She put the light on
Lady, put the light on
Light on me
The day I ran away
Was only yesterday
But now I'm here to stay
And I do love you
It doesn't matter now
I got you anyhow
Come on and take a bow
'Cause I do love you
She put the light on
She put the light on
Lady, put the light on
Light on me
She put the light on
She put the light on
Lady, put the light on
Light on me
She put the light on
She put the light on
Lady, put the light on me
She put the light on
She put the light on
Lady, put the light on me
She put the light on
She put the light on
Lady, put the light on me
She put the light on
She put the light on me
Don't you know that my baby?
She put the light on
She put the light on
Lady, put the light on me
Put the light on me, oh, yeah
She put the light on
She put the light on
Lady, put the light on me
Light, light, light, right on me
She put the light on
Lady, put the light on me
She put the light on
Lady, put the light on me
Come on, don't you know
She put the light on
She put the light on
Lady, put the light on me
She put the light on
She put the light on
Lady, put the light on me...
