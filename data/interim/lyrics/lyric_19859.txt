Cry...Cry...Cry...
One set of footprints in ah di sand
And yuh ah grumble and ah so you think it should ah be two
'member one thing me youth ah Father God had ah di plan
So when yuh see one set of footprints ah God ah carry you
"Hurry up and come back"
Was the last thing she said to her son
The day his life was taken
She didn't know he wouldn't come back
He died from the bullet of a gun
And now her little boy is gone
She said "Help me, Lord help me"
And she looked up to the sky
And she heard the voice reply
When you cry, I cry
I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile
I smile along with you
When you cry, I cry
I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile
I smile along with you
Another baby left homeless
Abandoned when he was two
So the street side kids at the shopping mall was the family he knew
It's not easy being homeless
Sometimes you have to do what you have to do
And he didn't have a mom or dad to help him get through
He said "Help me, Father help me"
And he looked up to the sky
And he heard the voice reply
When you cry, I cry
I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile
I smile along with you
When you cry, I cry
Based on a true story
I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile
Keep yuh head up
I smile along with you

Her brother had to die
She heard ah voice reply
When you cry, I cry
I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile
I smile along with you
When you cry, I cry
I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile
