Make it stop
Sounds so good, I just can't take no more
Turn it down, turn it up, I don't know
I don't know 
But don't stop, don't move
Just keep it there 
Keep it right there 
Keep it right there
I wanna put you on repeat
Play you everywhere I go, e-e-everywhere I go
Play you everywhere I go
Put you on repeat
Play you everywhere I go, e-e-everywhere I go
Play you everywhere I go
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay
I can listen to it all day
I can listen to you all day, yeah, you all day
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay
We can start all over again, and again
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay
Don't stop 
Turn it on, turn it up, make it louder
I don't wanna miss a single thing
I wanna hear every melody 
B-b-b-beating 
Beating so loud you can feel it 
B-b-b-beating 
Beating for you
I wanna put you on repeat
Play you everywhere I go, e-e-everywhere I go
Play you everywhere I go
Put you on repeat
Play you everywhere I go, e-e-everywhere I go
Play you everywhere I go
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay
I can listen to it all day
I can listen to you all day, yeah, you all day
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay
We can start all over again, and again
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay
Feel it all, feel it all crashing down 
I'm so lost, I'm so lost in your sound
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay 
Put this song on replay
List-listen to you all day, to you all day
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay 
I can listen to it all day
I can listen to you all day, yeah, you all day
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay
We can start all over again, and again
Yeah, wanna put this song on replay
