Turn me up YC , go
I ain't ever ran from a nigga , if I did, cut my legs off 
I ain't ever been with the ho talk, snitch talk, always talking 'bout his fault 
Yeah, I'm a stand up nigga, got my bands up, nigga, you don't wanna see me pissed off 
Never tell a lie to a bitch, dawg , when it come to them, you gotta play it raw
And I ain't never ever let the fuckery get to me  Niggas ain't worth my energy 
Cut 'em off, make 'em feel it, I ain't dealin' with nothin' if it don't make sense to me 
I'll never ever, ever go against my kind for some niggas on the other side 
I'll never ever, ever put a bitch 'fore the money, gotta get it when it come to mine
Lately I feel like it's me versus me, don't see competition, why would you compete? 
Don't even gotta be woke, still gon' be up , I make a bag in my sleep 
Can't get the hood outta me, you know where I be  Still posted up like I lease 
Trust me, them choppers gon' bang, cavity teeth, you better not think this shit sweet 
If the bitch bad put a stack in her rack 
I'm Dr. Seuss, give me cat in the hat 
Booty poke out and her stomach on snatch
Way to pretty to be fucked from the back 
Count up some money then smoke me a plant
This shit got me higher than Ja Morant 
Toxic lil' bitch and she knowin' she that
I said I was done, still doubled back
If you a side bitch you can not question me
You did some foul shit, you threw a TEC at me
Cook it up right, they done gave me the recipe
I'm in a Z06, police ain't catchin' me
I'm still duckin' this bitch that's obsessed with me
'Cause I'm the dope like the coke in the '70s
Big body double R truck, I got Bo with me
Hoggin' the lane, now they can't get close to me 
I ain't ever ran from a nigga , if I did, cut my legs off 
I ain't ever been with the ho talk, snitch talk, always talking 'bout his fault 
Yeah, I'm a stand up nigga, got my bands up, nigga, you don't wanna see me pissed off 
Never tell a lie to a bitch, dawg , when it come to them, you gotta play it raw
And I ain't never ever let the fuckery get to me  Niggas ain't worth my energy 
Cut 'em off, make 'em feel it, I ain't dealin' with nothin' if it don't make sense to me 
I'll never ever, ever go against my kind for some niggas on the other side 
I'll never ever, ever put a bitch 'fore the money, gotta get it when it come to mine
Check the thermostat, I've been hot four summers 
Try me, you get whacked, make it hard for your mama
Moneybagg Runtz in the pack, get a bundle
Plaque and the sack, both of 'em doing numbers
I ain't got a heart for a ho, that's a big no 
No-life worry 'bout the next ho 
Took back the keys to the Benzo
All in her feelings, throwin' clothes out the window 
Let's take a AK, cut it in half and call it a Draco 
I'm back on my old ways, ridin' with that five, volcano that fuego
Life insurance on my chain 
Reach for it, bust your brain 
Loose noodle, no lo mein 
Going out the way I came 
I ain't ever ran from a nigga , if I did, cut my legs off 
I ain't ever been with the ho talk, snitch talk, always talking 'bout his fault 
Yeah, I'm a stand up nigga, got my bands up, nigga, you don't wanna see me pissed off 
Never tell a lie to a bitch, dawg , when it come to them, you gotta play it raw
And I ain't never ever let the fuckery get to me  Niggas ain't worth my energy 
Cut 'em off, make 'em feel it, I ain't dealin' with nothin' if it don't make sense to me 
I'll never ever, ever go against my kind for some niggas on the other side 
I'll never ever, ever put a bitch 'fore the money, gotta get it when it come to mine
