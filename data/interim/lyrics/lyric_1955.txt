Well I pulled outta Pittsburgh
A rollin' down that Eastern Seaboard
I got my diesel wound up
And she's a runnin' like a never before
There's a speed zone ahead, well alright
I don't see a cop in sight
Six days on the road
And I'm a gonna make it home tonight
I got me ten forward gears
And a Georgia overdrive
I'm takin' little white pills
And my eyes are open wide
I just passed a Jimmy and a White
I been a passin' everything in sight
Six days on the road
And I'm a gonna make it home tonight
Well it seems like a month
Since I kissed my baby goodbye
I coulda had a lotta women
But I'm not like a some other guys
I could find one to hold me tight
But I could never make believe it's alright
Six days on the road
And I'm a gonna make it home tonight
ICC is a checkin' on down the line
Well I'm a little overweight
And my log book's way behind
But nothin' bothers me tonight
I can dodge all the scales alright
Six days on the road
And I'm a gonna make it home tonight
Well my rig's a little old
But that don't mean she's slow
There's a flame from her stack
And that smoke's a blowin' black as coal
My hometown's a comin' in sight
If you think I'm a happy, you're right
Six days on the road
And I'm a gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road
And I'm a gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road
And I'm a gonna make it home tonight
