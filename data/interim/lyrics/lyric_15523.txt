Ooh
Baby, baby, baby
I wanna get romantic
Oh
Turn the lights down
It's time to get romantic
Light a candle
It's time to get romantic
Let's be romantic
Take me in your arms, caress me gently
Oh, I can't get enough, ooh
Thrill me, say the word, I will surrender
To your poetic charm, oh
'Cause when the night falls
I hear seductive voices sing
Romantic songs of love
Let's get intimate
Turn the lights down
It's time to get romantic
Do everything romantic now
Light a candle
It's time to get romantic
The night has just begun, so baby, let's be romantic
Kiss me, I feel the waves of steamy passion
I'm burning with desire
Baby, free me from the heat, my heart's on fire
'Cause I still need your love
Under the moonlight
With the stars shining so bright
Baby, my mind is on love
When we get home tonight, ooh
Turn the lights down
It's time to get romantic
Do everything romantically
Light a candle
It's time to get romantic
I wanna get, I wanna get, ooh, romantic
Turn the lights down 
It's time to get romantic 
Do it, do it, do it, do it, oh, you and me
Light a candle
It's time to get romantic
Just you and me romantically, yeah
Just keep loving me, oh baby 
Sweet ecstasy, oh yeah 
Baby, we're all alone
And I got this burning flame that's in my heart
It's gonna let the romance start, woo
Oh yeah, romantic, romantic
If you want romance
You got to work it every chance you get
To love your woman right
There's no better time, let's start now
Ooh ooh, oh, I, I, I, I
Ooh ooh, I wanna get romantic
Ooh ooh, oh baby
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's get romantic , now let's fall in love
Make me surrender to your tender touch 
Keep being tender, I can't get enough 
 Let's be romantic
Your loving, it's just oh so tender
Just say the word, I will surrender
Underneath the silver moonlight
I'll give you my love, love, love, love, love
Oh baby, tonight
Turn the lights down
It's time to get romantic
Do everything romantic now
Light a candle
It's time to get romantic
