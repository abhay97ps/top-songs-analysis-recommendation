Outside my window
You're walking by with someone new 
Outside my window
The way I used to walk with you 
Smiling while you're walking
Laughing while you're talking
Happy as can be 
With your arm around him
You're so glad you found him
You never once look up to see me
Inside my window
I'm just as sad as I can be 
Inside my window
I'm wishing you'd come back to me 
Some day if you're lonely and you want me only
Here's what to do 
Call me, my darling 
Outside my window 
And I'll come running to you
