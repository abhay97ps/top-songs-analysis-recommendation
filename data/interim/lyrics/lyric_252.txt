Every time it rains, it rains
Pennies from heaven 
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven 
You'll find your fortunes falling all over town
Make sure your umbrella is upside down 
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, you must have showers
So when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me
You'll find your fortunes falling all over town
Make sure that your umbrella 
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, you must have showers
So when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me
