All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I'm locked up I wanna be free
Out in the courtyard and over the wall then
My friends are waiting for me
Sixteen people are waiting to get me
Hoping to take me outside
I hear the sound of the snub nose behind me
I went along for the ride
Wind in my face and my bones they are aching
My soul must weather the storm
I must run till my back it is breaking
Desperately I must keep on
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I went along for the ride
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I saw a new morning
I saw a new morning
I saw a new morning
