If I could dig down in my heart
My feelings would flood on the page
Would it satisfy you, cheatin' heart
Would I have to ease the pain? Ease the pain-ain-ain
If I could win you, if I could sing you
A love song so divine
Would it be enough for your cheating heart?
Or would I break down and cry?
Would I cry-y-y?
I said I know it's only rock and roll but I like it
I know it's only rock and roll but I like it, like it, yes, I do
Well I like it, I like it, I like it
Can't you see that this old boy has been a lonely
If I could dig down deep in my heart
My feelings would flood on the page
Would it be enough for your cheating heart?
Would it help to ease the pain? Ease your brain
I said I know it's only rock and roll but I like it
I know it's only rock and roll but I like it, like it, yes, I do
Oh, well, I like it, I like it, I like it
Can't you see that this old boy has been a lonely
C'mon
Do you think that you're the only girl around
I bet you think that you're the only woman in town
I said I know it's only rock and roll but I like it
I know it's only rock and roll but I like it
Well I know it's only rock and roll but I like it
Well I know it's only rock and roll but I like it
But I like it, like it, yes I do
Well I like it
I like it
I like it
Will you do this "it's only rock and roll" with me?
Like it, it's only rock and roll
It's only rock and roll
One more time, c'mon
It's only rock and roll
Yeah
It's only rock and roll
It's only rock and roll
Alright, c'mon!
I said I know it's only rock and roll but I like it
It's only rock and roll
But I like it, like it, yes, I do
