I don't need a whole lotsa money
I don't need a big, fine car
I got everything that a man could want
I got more than I could ask for
I don't have to run around
I don't have to stay out all night
'Cause I got a sweet, a sweet lovin' woman
And she knows just how to treat me right
My baby, she's all right
My baby, she's clean out of sight
Don't you know she's
Some kind of wonderful
Yes she is
Some kind of wonderful
Now hold it
Let me tell you one more thing
When she holds me in her arms
She sets my soul on fire
Oo, when my baby kiss me
My heart becomes filled with desire
When she wraps her lovin' arms around me
Almost drive me out of my mind
I get funny little feelings inside of me
Chills run up and down my spine
My baby, she's all right
My baby's clean out of sight
Don't you know she's
Some kind of wonderful
Yes she is
Some kind of wonderful
Now hold it
Let me tell you one more thing
Now tell me
Is there anybody
That's got a sweet little woman like mine
There's got to be somebody
That's got a sweet little woman like mine
Now tell me
Now can I get a witness
C'mon brothers
Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness
Now hold it
I wanna talk about my baby
Talkin', talkin' 'bout my baby
Sometimes I wanna scream
