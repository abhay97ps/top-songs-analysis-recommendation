We're gonna have a good time
Just listen to the band
Groovin' with the music
Everybody clap your hands
We're gonna have a good time
Everybody gather 'round
Smile a while, loosen up
And listen to the sound
Of the laughter, of the people
Keeps them smiling, feeling good
Moving with the music
While they're getting in the mood
To have a good, good time 
Gonna have a good, good time 
Yeah, we're gonna have a good time
Just thought you ought to know
Well, it's up to everybody to let everybody know, hey
People coming closer, just bring a friend or two
'Cause helping making 'em happy makes a difference to you
'Cause the laughter, of the people
Keeps them smiling, feeling good
We're moving with the music
While they're getting in the mood
To have a good, good time 
They're gonna have a good, good time 
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Have a little wine, feel so fine, yes I do, yes I do
And life is just a ball of freezy freezy freeze
Stick it in then use it, really use it
So when you're feeling low, don't act cold
Try to fly a little higher
Or take the time to ease your mind
The music is the same in every chorus
Now here's the chorus
We're gonna have a good time
Just listen to the band
Groovin' with the music
Everybody clap your hands, yeah
We're gonna have a good time
Just thought you ought to know
Well, it's up to everybody to let everybody know
'Cause the laughter, of the people
Keeps them smiling, feeling good
We're moving with the music
While they're getting in the mood
Gonna have a good, good time 
Said we're gonna have a good time 
We're gonna have a good time
Now, people come in closer
We're gonna have a good time
A good, good time
We're gonna have a good time
Everybody come in closer
We're gonna have a good time
Go 'head now, have a real good time
We're gonna have a good time
Said we're gonna have a good, good time
We're gonna have a good time
Said we're gonna have a good time
We're gonna have a good time
Gonna have a good, good, good time
