Are you sure I
Haven't loved you somewhere before
In another time, another place
On some distant shore?
You know me so well
Better than I know myself
And you loved me tonight 
Like you loved me all my life
All my life
And with the touch of your hand
You took me farther than I've never been
You love me like
You've loved me all my life
Love like we made
Could have taken a lifetime to find
But you found the way
To my heart in a moment of time
You know how to care
Just like you've always been there
Just like you've always been there
And you loved me tonight 
Like you loved me all my life
All my life
And with the touch of your hand
You took me farther than I've never been
You love me like
You've loved me all my life
With the touch of your hand
You took me farther than I've never been
You love me like
You've loved me all my life
You love me like
You've loved me all my life
