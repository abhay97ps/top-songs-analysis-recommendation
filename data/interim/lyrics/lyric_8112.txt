Well, here I am in the wind again
Floatin' where it takes me
Laughin' and splashin' in the summer sun
Until the alarm clock wakes me
Then it's coffee and a kiss
And two cigarettes
And I'm back out in the cold, cold weather
Chasin' my dream but I just can't seem
To rub two coins together
Sing it
Life ain't easy
They never said it would be
Life ain't easy
Whoever said it should be
Life ain't easy
And nothing comes free, free, free, free
Life ain't easy
Tell me all about it
Life ain't easy
No, no, no, no
Life ain't easy
And nothing comes free
For you or me
That woman
She don't understand
The way my mind keeps driftin'
And the Lord don't always
Lend a hand, when my poor heart needs liftin'
Is home and kids really all there is
Or is there something better?
And how much soul must a poor man sell
To rub two coins together?
Don't you know that
Life ain't easy
No, no, no, no
Life ain't easy
Ahh! Nobody said it would be
Life ain't easy
And nothing comes free, free, free, free
Life ain't easy
Can you hear me?
Life ain't easy
Tell me all about it
Life ain't easy
And nothing's free, free, free, free
Life ain't easy
Tell me all about it
Life ain't easy
No, no, no, no, no
Life ain't easy
And nothing comes free, free, free, free
Life ain't easy
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Life ain't easy
Life ain't easy
