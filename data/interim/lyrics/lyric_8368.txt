{Instrumental}
I never read it in a book
I never saw it on a show
But I heard it in the alley
On a weird radio
If you want a drink of water
You got to get it from a well
If you want to get to heaven
You got to raise a little hell
I never felt it in my feet
I never felt it in my soul
But I heard it in the alley
Now it's in my rock and roll
If you want to know a secret
You got to promise not to tell
If you want to get to heaven
You got to raise a little hell
{Instrumental}
I never thought it'd be so easy
I never thought it'd be so fun
But I heard it in the alley
Now I got it on the run
If you want to see an angel
You got to find it where it fell
If you want to get to heaven
You got to raise a little hell
{Instrumental}
If you want to get to heaven
If you want to get to heaven
If you want to get to heaven
If you want to get to heaven
