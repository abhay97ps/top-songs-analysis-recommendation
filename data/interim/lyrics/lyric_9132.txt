When you feel down and out
Sing a song 
For you, here's the time to shout
Sing a song 
Sometimes it's hard to care
Sing a song 
A smile is so hard to bear
Sing a song 
Sing a song
Sing a song
Sing a song
Sing a song
Well, bring your heart to believing
Sing a song 
Life ain't about no retrieving
Oh yeah 
Give yourself what you need
Sing a song 
Smile, smile, smile and believe
Sing a song 
Sing a song
Sing a song
Sing a song
Sing a song
Sing a song
Sing a song
Sing a song
Sing a song
If you sing a song a day
You will make a better way
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, uh huh
