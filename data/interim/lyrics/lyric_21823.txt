God... our heavenly Father
Oh, God... and my father, who is also in heaven
May the light... of this flickering candle
Illuminate the night the way your spir't illuminates my soul...
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you see me?
Papa, can you hear me in the night?
Papa, are you near me?
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?
Looking at the skies I seem to see a million eyes
Which ones are yours?
Where are you now that yesterday has come and gone
And closed its doors?
The night is so much darker
The wind is so much colder
The world I see is so much bigger now that I'm alone
Papa, please forgive me
Try to understand me
Papa, don't you know I had no choice?
Can you hear me praying?
Anything I'm saying?
Even though the night is filled with voices
I remember everything you taught me
Every book I've ever read...
Can all the words in all the books
Help me to face what lies ahead?
The trees are so much taller
And I feel so much smaller
The moon is twice as lonely and the stars are half as bright
Papa, how I love you
Papa, how I need you
Papa, how I miss you
Kissing me good night...
