Darling, just relax
You melt me like hot candle wax
One touch and my whole body melts
Yet you say, you say you can't express yourself
Ohh, just keep doing what you're doing
Fancy words would only ruin it
Touch, that very special touch
If I satisfy you, ooh, baby
How you satisfy me 
Don't worry, don't worry about cries
These are tears of love in my eyes
I feel this love flowing through
Like a river, boy, straight through me to you
Oh, your touch says more than words
In any language ever heard 
Touch, oh honey 
Every brand new day 
I wake up wanting you the same way
Hey, hey, hey baby 
Your touch says more than words 
In any language ever heard 
Keep on doing what you're doing 
Fancy words would only ruin it
Touch, touch
Groove me, groove me, groove me
Groove me, groove me, groove me
Groove me, groove me with your touch
Touch me, touch me, your touch express so much
Just keep doing what you're doing
