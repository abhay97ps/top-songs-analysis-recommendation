Your words are quick
And they cut so deep
The walls go up
Waiting here
Wishing here
Wishing here
Waiting
You forget I know your tender spots
I can hurt you too
But I'm the one loving you
So come on and love me
Lay down your arms
Lay down, down, down, down
Why'd you want to go?
And shoot love to the ground
Lay down your arms
Lay down, down, down, down
Lay with me
So close then the moment's shattered
Like nothing mattered
Pushing me
Pulling you
Pulling me
Pushing
Don't want to tear our love apart
I want to give my heart
Can't we start living here, giving?
Lay down your arms
Lay down, down, down, down
Why'd you want to go?
And shoot love to the ground
Lay down your arms
Lay down, down, down, down
Lay with me
So we are in love
So we are at war
But we can be on the same side
Lay down your arms
Lay down, down, down, down
Why'd you want to go?
And shoot love to the ground
Lay down your arms
Lay down, down, down, down
Lay with me
