He's a lean and hungry hunter, on the street tonight the fire's bright
She's in his sights
She's a lonely little dancer, out to find a daring new romance
The girl takes a chance
Chorus:
They're hunters of the night, find their love where they might
We're all hunters of the night
Yeah
She can see her lonely stranger, standing in the cold street corner light
There in the night
She can feel his arms surround her, wanting this embrace to never end
Still once again
Ohhh-ohhh, we're all hunters of the night
See the lean and hungry hunter, standing in the cold street corner light
There in the night
She can feel his arms surround her, wanting this embrace to never end
Still once again
We are hunters, we all hunt the night, findin' love wherever they might
We're all hunters, we're hunters of the night
Ohhh-ohhh, we're all hunters of the night
Ohhh-ohhh, we're all hunters of the night
Ohhh, we hunt the night, we hunt the night, we hunt the night...
