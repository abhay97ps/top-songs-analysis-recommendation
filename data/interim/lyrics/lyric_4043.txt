Don't you here the music... 
Don't it feel good... 
Let it get to you... 
Try and let go... 
You don't have to worry
About a thing
So come on up
Come on uh uh up
Just come on up baby
And have a good time
Love to watch it happen... 
When I dance with you
Love to see the music... 
Right up to the moon
And you don't have to worry
About a thing
So come on up
Come on uh uh up now
Just come on up baby
And have a good time
Come on now and give it a try... AhhOhh!
Start it nice an easy... 
Take it real slow... 
Just let it take you... 
Where you wanna go... 
Come on with me... 
Don't let me go alone
Keep on pushin baby
Until we get home
Don't it feel good
Don't it feel good
You know...
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
AhhOhh!!
