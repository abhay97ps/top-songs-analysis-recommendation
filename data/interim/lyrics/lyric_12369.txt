When I met you, oh
You know at first you had me so confused
We used to lay awake at night
Strugglin' with the feelings I so long refused

I saw you turn your heart too cold to ice, darlin'
I put my heart on the line for you
Oh I did, I put my heart on the line, yeah
First you take me to the highest ground
Then you keep me hanging like some village clown
It's such a fools' game, yeah
It's such a fools' game
I keep playing such a fools' game, yeah
I keep on playin', keep on playin' this fools' game

I don't mind, I had to swallow my pride

Got the secret in the palm of your hands
Will you keep it woman, will you break this man
It's such a fools' game, yeah
It's such a fools' game
I keep playing such a fools' game, forever
I keep on playin', keep on playin' this fools' game

Girl I know, you're playin' full time
But it may be too late, when you make up your mind

Forever in your fools' game

Such a fools' game,.. How long... fools' game
How long ..will you keep me in this smooth game
Forever such a smooth game...Yeah Fools game
There's no way to win
As long as I'm in
To such a fools game
You waste my precious time
I put my heart on the line
You better make up your mind
Girl, don't try to keep me no more
You're tryin to keep me in your
