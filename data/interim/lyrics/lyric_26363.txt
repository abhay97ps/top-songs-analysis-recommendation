There are many people who drink in moderation with no problems
Social, moral, or medical
They have learned to enjoy liquor without letting it upset
The functioning of their body and mind
It relaxes you, makes you more congenial 
This helps make a gathering cheerful and friendly
It ain't my fault, so don't blame me
I swear I just came here to unwind and have one drink
The way it looks, it ain't what you think
This Cabernet has a way of vanishing on me
There's a hole in the bottle leaking all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even supper time
Honey, no, I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine
I keep my cool, play by all the rules
I swear ten minutes ago that bottle was full
But I won't cry about love gone wrong
'Cause tears would water down this ruby red I'm sipping on
There's a hole in the bottle leaking all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even supper time
Honey, no, I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine 
I went and got a new one
'Cause the other one was broken
Now this one's halfway gone
And it's barely even open
There's a hole in the bottle  leaking all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even supper time
Honey, no, I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine
You may ask me where it's going
But I can't even find
The hole in the bottle of wine
