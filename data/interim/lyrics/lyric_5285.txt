I walk along those city streets
You used to walk along with me
And every step I take recalls
How much in love we used to be
Oh, how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me, whoa-oh-oh
When shadows fall, I pass a small caf√©
Where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling
How it felt to kiss and hold you tight
Oh, how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
If you should find you miss
The sweet and tender love
We used to share
Just come back to the places
Where we used to go
And I'll be there
Oh, how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me?
When there is always something there to remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
When there is
When there is
When, there, is
Always something there to remind me
Oh, always something there to remind me
Oh, always something there to remind me
When there is always something there to remind me
When there is always something there to remind me
