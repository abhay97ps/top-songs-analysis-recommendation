She knows when I am lonesome
She cries when I am sad
She's up in the good times
She's down in the bad
Whenever I am discouraged
She knows just what to do
But girl
She doesn't know about you
I can tell her my troubles
She makes them all seem right
I can make up excuses
Not to hold her at night
We can talk of tomorrow
I'll tell her things that I wanna do
But girl
How can I tell her about you?
How can I tell her about you?
Girl, please tell me what to do
Everything seems right whenever I'm with you
So girl, won't you tell me
How to tell her about you
How can I tell her I don't miss her
Whenever I am away
How can I say it's you I think of
Every single night and day
But when is it easy telling someone the truth
Oh girl, help me tell her about you
How can I tell her about you?
Girl, please tell me what to do
Everything seems right whenever I'm with you
So girl, won't you tell me
How to tell her about you
