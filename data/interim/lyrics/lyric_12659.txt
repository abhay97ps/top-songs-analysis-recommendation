Pimp dolls, jam
Jigglettes, slam
Pimp dolls, jam
Jigglettes, slam
Turn it
Just because I shake and party
And roll my sexy body
Don't mean that I'm tryin' to tease
It's called body talk, it's not like the walk
'Cause this time
You're wearin' blue jeans
You rub your left leg slow
And let your body go
And do a little sexy scream
Jam, let's party out
Make your body sweat and shout
A visual sex machine
You're talkin', body talk
Talk body to me, body talk
Body talk
Talk body to me, body talk, oh
Jigglettes gonna slam
Yeah, pimp dolls jam
Let your body talk to me
You're lookin' real fine
You're workin' overtime
You're footloose and fancy free
Now it's all about the feel
'Cause now you know the deal
So pump your body 'cross the floor
And put it in the groove
Gonna make it real smooth
And then you're gonna want some more
You're talkin', body talk
Talk body to me, body talk
Body talk
Talk body to me, body talk, oh
Say baby, what's that you're doin'?
Well, it looks like your body is talkin' to me
I'm hearin' something, what's that?
Go on, get it, girl
Sexy body, sure looks good to me
Your sexy body
Sure looks good to me
Come on and shake your body
I want to hear your body
So come on and shake your body
I want to hear your body
Hey, you got to baby, baby, you got to baby, your body
Hey, you got to baby, baby, you got to baby, your body
Hey, you got to baby, baby, you got to baby, your body
Hey, you got to baby, baby, you got to baby, your body
Your sexy body, sure looks good to me
Your sexy body
Sure looks good to me
Body talk
Talk body to me, body talk
Body talk
Talk body to me, body talk, oh
Mmm, there she is again
I wonder what she's tryin' to say to me
B O D Y T A L K, talk baby
Body talk
Talk body to me, body talk
Body talk
Talk body to me, body talk
I like the way you walk, baby
I wanna hear your body talk, baby
You know it's really not your fault, baby
Oh, baby
Oh
I like the way you walk, baby
I wanna hear your body talk, baby
You know it's really not your fault, baby
Oh, baby
Body talk, talk body to me
Body talk, talk body to me
