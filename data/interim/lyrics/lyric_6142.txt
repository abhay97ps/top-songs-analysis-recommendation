Come on people, come on children
Come on down to the glory river
Gonna wash you up, and wash you down
Gonna lay the devil down, gonna lay that devil down
Come on people, come on children
There's a king at the glory river
And the precious king, he loved the people to sing
Babes in the blinkin' sun sang "We shall overcome"
I've got fury in my soul
Fury's gonna take me to the glory goal
In my mind I can't study war no more
Save the people! Save thе children!
Save the country, savе the country now
Come on people, sons and mothers
Keep the dream of the two young brothers
Gonna take that dream and ride that dove
We could build the dream with love, I know
We could build the dream with love
I've got fury in my soul
Fury's gonna take me to the glory goal
In my mind I can't study war no more
Save the people! Save the children!
Save the country now...
Save the people! Save the children! Save the country!
Come on down to the glory river
Save the people! Save the children! Save the country!
Come on down to the glory river, yes sir
Save the people! Save the children! Save the country!
Come on down to the glory river, yeah, hey
Save the people! Save the children! Save the country!
Come on down to the glory river...
