You know that you're riding
In a canoe that's only made for two
And if you should overload it
Trust my soul you'll break my heart in two
So don't rock the boat
Don't rock the boat
Can't you see that he's fishin'
Only for fun
So don't just swallow his faith
He's gonna leave you stranded at sea
When you know that you can't swim
So don't rock the boat
Don't rock the boat
I wanna be your captain
Please let me stay your captain
You're one and only captain
Yeah, yeah
You know that you're ridin'
In a canoe that's only made for two
And if you should overload it
Bless my soul you'll break my heart in two
So don't rock the boat
Don't rock the boat
Don't rock the boat
Don't rock the boat
No don't rock the boat
No don't rock the boat
Don't rock the boat
Don't rock the boat
