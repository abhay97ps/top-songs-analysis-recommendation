 Oh I love you the way-a-ay you are
 Oh I love you the way-ay you are
Always be faithful to me
And near each tonight to hold so tight
'cause I lo-o-o-ve you
Love you the way you are 
Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never lose the charms you possess
You-our loveliness, the way you caress
'cause I lo-o-o-ve you
Love you the way you are 
Don't have to change your color of hair
The clothes you wear may all become you so
And don't listen to what friends may say
I will love you till my dy-y-y-in' day
Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're my girl, you ought to know
The way-ay we kiss, I'm all aglow
'cause I lo-o-o-ve you
Love you the way you are 
Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're my girl, you ought to know
The way we kiss, I'm all aglow
'cause I lo-o-o-ve you
Love you the way you 
Oh, I love you the wa-a-ay you are
 Oh, I love you the wa-ay you are
