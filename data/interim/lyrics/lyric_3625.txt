I wanna go with you
To that other world
The one your love takes me to
I wanna go with you
I wish I were glass
So you could see through
Then you'd know before you ask
That I wanna go with you
I wanna go with you
To that other world
The one your love takes me to
I wanna go with you
You take me away
To a world I never knew
But what else can say
I wanna go with you
I wanna go with you
To that other world
The one your love takes me to
I wanna go with you
The one your love takes me to
I wanna go with you...
