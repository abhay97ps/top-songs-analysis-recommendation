Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Oh, oh
Yo JoJo, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Isn't it funny the things you said and done to me?
You said you want me but now lady, I wanna be free
You lied to me, you said you never would play me
But I found out that you were lying all the time
Girl, you pick me up 
And you bring me down 
When I thought I found in you solid ground 
You turn my smile 
Into a frown 
Girl, you promised that you'd never let me down 
And now you're not around
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
When I was up, girl, you brought me down
Played me like a clown, you thought I'd stay around
So you could, you could abuse me, take my heart and use me
And you see I'm still around for your talk and for your smile
Girl, you pick me up 
And you bring me down 
When I thought I found in you solid ground 
You turn my smile 
Into a frown 
Girl, you promised that you'd never let me down 
And now you're not around
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
There is something I have to say
Something I can't delay
You hurt me so bad
And you made me feel so sad
It's a feeling I can't explain
I won't let you wreck my brain
You said you'd never hurt me
But then you go and desert me, baby
Oh, oh, ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Girl, you pick me up 
And you bring me down
When I thought I found in you solid ground 
You turn my smile
Into a frown
Girl, you promised that you'd never let me down
And now you're not around
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
