You see it every day in every way
We all hear the same routines
They all say that it's okay
Just let us take care of everything
So we lay it on the line
Layin' it on the line 
Layin' it all, right on the line
Just layin' it on the line 
Layin' it all, we're livin on the front line
I can see it in the faces
We got trouble in the streets tonight
And power keeps us in our places
And it doesn't matter if you're left or right
You lay it on the line
Layin' it on the line 
Just layin' it all, right on the line
Layin' it on the line, 
Layin' it all, right on the line
Take it to the wilderness
Into the jungle sun
Lookin' for the voice of reason
Inside this Babylon
Got U.S. boys on foreign soil
Spillin' their blood to keep the peace
Cities will vanish in turmoil
While the sheiks lay sleepin' on the beach
We lay it on the line
Layin' it on the line 
Layin' it all, right on the line
Just layin' it on the line 
Layin' it all, right on the line
Layin' it on the line
Just layin' it all
Layin' it on the line
Just layin' it all
