Gangster, but my jeans too tight 
I see my opps through the sight 
Hit that bitch once and then tell her good night 
All white on my ice, look like rice 
Stacked up, then get right out the sight 
I just went up in my price 
I just went up in my price

Money, my bank account, this shit precise 
I just went up in my price

I drive my whip like it stolen 
Yellow diamonds look like Homer 
Heard that Rolls-Royce is your homie's 
So your whip, that is a loaner 
My money aroused like my boner
I fucked your bitch and did that off aroma 
We whip it up, no bakin' soda
I turn a fuck nigga right to organ donor 
Okay, I feel like I own her 
That girl so smart that she walk for diploma 
Off-White, my G-Fazos, they MoMA
She give me head all the way 'til I'm in coma 
Ice is so cold, like pneumonia
I might hit that bitch with that Super Soaker 
I heard that boy gettin' bread
So we gon' heat his ass up with the toaster 
Got a model  with vitiligo 
She got a condo  out in Cabo
Got a side ho  for my side ho 
I get high the most, mix my highs with my lows 
Uh, you is a lie

That lil' bitch still could go and pop 
You keep flexin' with that drop 
Best believe you gon get dropped 
I get my looks from my mom 
I get my swag from my pop 
You did not wanna do no time 
So you start talkin' to the cops 
I skipped in that pussy, then hop 
I heard that bitch, she was hot
Hickory, dickory, dock 
VVS all in my clock 
Get money like Anthony Hop
Silence the lamb and your ass'll get chopped 
Clean up, his brain on aisle five
Somebody, please can they go get the mop? 
And I'm with my boys
So you know that the gang shit will not stop
You know that little bitch gon' look around
So if she let me fuck, then the shit is co-op
Yeah, I take more pills and she takin' more shots
Man, watch the way I had to drip on the block
Overseas on the jet, I had to slide
I went all way to Germany, back to Gera 
Uh, you is a lie
Uh, you is not cut from this side, uh
You cannot come to this side, yeah
