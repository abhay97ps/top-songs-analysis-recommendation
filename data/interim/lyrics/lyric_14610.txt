Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, yeah yeah yeah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Whoa, whoa, oh oh
On a perfect day, I know that I can count on you
When that's not possible
Tell me can you weather the storm?
'Cause I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad times
She will always, always be right there
Sunny days, everybody loves them
Tell me, baby, can you stand the rain?
Storms will come
This we know for sure 
Can you stand the rain?
Love unconditional, I'm not asking just of you
And girl to make it last
I'll do whatever needs to be done
But I need somebody 
Who will stand by me 
When it's tough, she won't run
She will always, be right there for me, hee
Sunny days, everybody loves them, tell me, baby
Can you stand the rain? 
Storms will come
This we know for sure
Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
This we know for sure
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
Come on, baby, lets go get wet
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
Yeah, it's gonnaâ€”but I know, I know I'll be right there
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
