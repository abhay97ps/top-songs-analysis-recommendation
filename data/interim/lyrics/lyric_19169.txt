What you hear is not a test

I'm on a mission
Sun is out, my skin is glistening
Got my jeans on, tank top, chillin'
With my girlfriends, lookin' fabulous
My tan is just amazing
Turn it up, that song is blazing 
I'm headed to L-A and
Gotta make sure I ask Timbaland
Can you give me a song like rock the boat 
Rock the boat , rock the boat 
Can you give me a song that you and Missy wrote 
Missy wrote , Missy wrote 
Something like Get Ur Freak On
Cause Kiley needs something to sing on
Make me something I can get my groove on 
Something I can get my groove on 
3 O'clock, hit the studio
Timbaland is playing  kinda low
Feel the love in the room soon as I hit the door
Bubba's pacing around gettin ready to flow
Tim is in the corner doing a track
Bobbing his head, I know he's feeling that
Take his headphones off and he looks my way
And he asks me what I wanna do and I say
Can you give me a song like rock the boat 
Rock the boat , rock the boat 
Can you give me a song that you and Missy wrote 
Missy wrote , Missy wrote 
Something like Get Ur Freak On
Cause Kiley needs something to sing on
Make me something I can get my groove on
Something I can get my groove on
And then he asked if I liked this
Or do you like this
But do you like this
And then he flipped it
And then we start to move
We're getting in the groove
He says it's just for you 
And I'm glad I asked, whoa
Can you give me a song like rock the boat 
Rock the boat , rock the boat 
Can you give me a song that you and Missy wrote

Oh, I think I got something for you
Oh, I think I got something for you
Oh, ha, I think I got something for you
