You call me a cheater
Well, maybe that's true
But if you could hold heaven
What would you do?
She offered me true love
That I never knew
I saw the doors to heaven
And just walked through
You'll never believe me
I tried to be true
But with heaven at my fingertips
What else could I do?
Maybe you'd be different
If this happened to you
But with your feet in my shoes
I wonder what you'd do?
--- Instrumental ---
If it's wrong to long for lost love
Then I'm wrong as I can be
You say it's wrong and that may be true
But it sure seems right to me
And you say you'd be different
If this happened to you
But with heaven at your fingertips
What would you do?
