Maggie was a buck and gain
Following the hookin' game
Boo-lah rooka hook and chain
Maggie's eyes could cook a man
But oh, she loved to tantalize
Make it feel like paradise
Oh, nobody cry when Maggie die
When Maggie die - um um um
Boom boom like a shi shi hand
Take her to the rock and hang
Rum and boogie love to dance
Maggie didn't stand no chance
But oh, she love to tantalize
And make it feel like paradise
And oh, nobody cry when Maggie die
When Maggie die - oh oh oh
Boom boom boom - boom poor Maggie
Boom boom boom - poor Maggie
Boom boom boom - boom poor Maggie
Boom boom boom - poor Maggie
Maggie was a buck and gain
Following the hookin' game
Boo-lah rooka hook and chain
Maggie's eyes could cook a man
But oh, she loved to tantalize
And make it feel like paradise
And oh, nobody cry when Maggie die
When Maggie die - mmmm
Boom boom like a shi shi hand
Take her to the rock and hang
Rum and boogie love to dance
Maggie didn't stand no chance
But oh, she love to tantalize
And make it feel like paradise
And oh, nobody cry when Maggie die
When Maggie die - oh oh oh now
Boom boom boom - boom poor Maggie
Boom boom boom - poor Maggie
Boom boom boom - boom poor Maggie
Boom boom boom - poor Maggie
