In the fire
It was burning
Sweetheart, I know
I should have been learning
But my pockets
Were full of money, yes they were
I had someone, yes I did
To call my honey
 it's love 
That makes a woman  
Yes, it's love 
That makes a woman 
Something told me that this wouldn't last
Now my heartache is in the past
I had to swallow all of my pride
And admit to myself deep down inside
Diamonds and pearls
Don't you know that I've had enough
But I feel so much better, yes I do
Dressed in love
What she is, yeah
What she is
