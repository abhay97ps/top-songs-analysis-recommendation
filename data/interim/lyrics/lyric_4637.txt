Jill, between you and me
I can see the gleam in your eyes
And I can hardly wait to see you, Jill
Just as if you were here
I can hear your voice softly call
And no, no Jill is here at all
My love is only a dream away
Jill is only a dream
All my life, I've done crazy things
Gonna find a bird that sings to me
La la, you, la la la, ooo ooo
Jill, are you thinking of me?
I'll be thinking of you all my life
La la you, la la la, ooo ooo
Jill, are you thinking of me?
I'll be thinking of you all my life
Jill, Jill, Jill
