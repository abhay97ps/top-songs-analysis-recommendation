Oh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby, listen
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Oh, yeah, you
I was sitting at home
Thinking to myself
I started thinking 'bout you
How much I do love you, I really do
I would never trade you, never forsake you
'Cause nothing could be better
That's why I wrote you this letter
I love you always, lady
Last night 
I wrote a short letter 
And it went this way 
Dear, baby, I love you, just thinking of you 
Love always 
Last night 
I wrote a short letter 
And it went this way 
Dear, baby, I love you, just thinking of you 
Love always 
Now I know I could've called
But it seem much better this way
'Cause I'm missing my baby
I'm so blessed your my lady, lady 
Now I know I can't wait until tomorrow
When you're in my arms again
Holding and kissing you
Doin' the things we love to do, until then
Last night 
I wrote a short letter
And it went this way 
Dear, baby, I love you, just thinking of you 
Love always 
Last night 
I wrote a short letter 
And it went this way
Dear, baby, I love you, just thinking of you
Love always 
You, oh, baby
You, all the things you do for me, all the things you wanna do for me
You, baby, oh, baby
You, hey, hey, ooh
Last night 
I wrote a short letter 
And it went this way 
Dear, baby, I love you, just thinking of you 
Love always 
I love you, I love you, I love you
And there is nothin' that I wouldn't do 
Just to prove that I really, really love you
And baby, I want you, I want you, I want you 
And there is nothing that I'd rather do 
Than to love you 
I love you always 
Every night and every day
