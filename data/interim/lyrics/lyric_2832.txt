I met a fine beautician
In a very fine condition
She was long and lean
And you know what that means
She's a good lovin' mama
A hard workin' woman
She makes a lot of money
I don't have to worry about a thing
She works hard all day
Dressin' hair
Man you can bet
I want to get somewhere
With my good lovin' mama
My hard workin' woman
She makes a lot of money
I don't have to worry about a thing
I meet the finest woman
From everywhere
Because my baby
Dress their hair
I'll be her lover boy
She treats me like a king
She makes a lot of money
Don't have to worry about a thing
Yes, she keeps her hair
So neat and fine
And every pound of her is mine
I'll be her lover boy
I'll be happy as a king
She makes a lot of money
Don't have to worry about a thing
