Yeah, white color sand , frost in my hand, yeah 
Lost in the game , ghost, Danny Phantom 
Dipped in a trance, yeah , ten in the van, yeah
Ones make her leap, yeah, shh, not a squeak 
Coupe outside , she say let me ride
Bust down Rollie with the ice 
Ride 'round the city with a pipe
Wrist frozen 
Blessed, I guess I'm chosen 
Hit a lightskin from Oakland
In my old school sideshow
Supersport 
Crash the Porsche 
I was gettin' head 
She was killin' it 
Caught an Uber to the dealership 
Cash out on some new shit 
Bitch, I surround myself with all this loyalty
Swear to God I'm the one, my girl just might propose to me 
Clique full of CEO's , none of us got a degree 
Made it from the underground, now they back tryna bury me 
I lean, I sway , with Quay , and Tay 
I give and hardly take, you level up, I levitate
Bitch you a culture , vulture , poser 
Hungry for exposure, I'm with my Migos soldiers, gone
White color sand, yeah , frost in my hand, yeah
Lost in the game, yeah, ghost, Danny Phantom 
Dipped in a trance, yeah , ten in the van, yeah
Ones make her leap, yeah, shh, not a squeak 
Drank color pink, dirty bags, wash it clean 
Coupe got wings

On the top like toupee 
Play no games, no 2K 
Crap game in the Blue Flame 
Pull out the coupe like Bruce Wayne 
Pull up the curtains to the Mulsanne 
Pav√© my set and clip Blu-ray 
Run to the bag like Usain 
When I lay my head down, got two K's 
Ferrari in Miami Beach 
I paid one twenty for rose Philippe 
I took her soul for keeps, yeah 
Back to back Rolls like Meech 
Check my balance, the cash I'ma double up 
P-90, two-three with the monkey nuts 
When I look at my wrist it's a hockey puck 
When I get with a bitch I'ma pipe her up 
Pour that lean on that ice 
Leaving my dreams covered in ice 
Wedding band rings, ain't no wife
Tryna get the demons out of my sight 
Nigga we ain't hiding we straight 
I'm talking big plate with that steak 
Niggas be watchin' out 'cause they scoping 
Geeked off of Adderall, they all focused 
Sipping on Tylenol, having codeine withdrawls
A nigga must got to be joking 
Don't want the pack, it ain't potent 
Look at wrist, water came from the ocean 
I'm laughing, never lacking 
Everlasting, flipping work like gymnastics 
Wrapping it up in the plastic 
Smoking it up in the ashes 
Looking and watching which ass is gon' be the fattest 
I pick the bitch up and smash it
2018 we don't pass, we trash it
Yeah, white color sand, yeah , frost in my hand, yeah
Lost in the game, yeah, ghost, Danny Phantom 
Dipped in a trance, yeah , ten in the van, yeah
Ones make her leap, yeah, shh, not a squeak 
Drank color pink, dirty bags, wash it clean
