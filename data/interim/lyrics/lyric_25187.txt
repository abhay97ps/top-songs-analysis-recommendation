Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close 
I was afraid to leave you on your own 
I said I'd catch you if you fall 
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all 
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries 
Just runnin' from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine 
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind
Said I'd catch you if you fall 
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all 
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah
You don't have to say just what you did 
I already know 
I had to go and find out from them 
So tell me, how's it feel? 
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why
