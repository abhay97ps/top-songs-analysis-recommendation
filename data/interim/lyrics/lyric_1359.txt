Sharing you, I know I'm sharing you
I'm not the only one who's in your heart
When I'm with you, your love belongs to me
But you have someone else when we're apart
There are two of to kiss you
Two of us to miss you
And two of us to wish there were two of you
And though it hurts me so to go on sharing you
I know my helpless heart just can't be free
But even though I must keep sharing you
You know you'll never be sha-a-rin' me
Oh, no, you'll never be shar-a-rin' me
Ah, ah, you'll never be shar-a-rin' me-ee
