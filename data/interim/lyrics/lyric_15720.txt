When I saw her walking down the street
She looks so fine, I just have to speak
I asked her name but she turned away
And she walked, all that I could say was
Mmm mmm, yeah, yeah, mmm mmm, yeah, yeah
Mmm mmm, yeah, yeah, all that I could say was
Mmm mmm, yeah, yeah, mmm mmm, yeah, yeah
Mmm mmm, yeah, yeah, all that I could say was
Oh wo, Nu Nu
I can't get you out of my mind
Oh wo, Nu Nu
I can't get you out of my mind
Nu Nu tells me, "Why you treat me so?"
I don't know you but I can't let go
You're so fine with your sexy ways
My heart sings and it sounds this way
Mmm mmm, yeah, yeah, mmm mmm, yeah, yeah
Mmm mmm, yeah, yeah and it sounds this way
Mmm mmm, yeah, yeah, mmm mmm, yeah, yeah
Mmm mmm, yeah, yeah and it sounds this way
Oh wo, Nu Nu
I can't get you out of my mind
Oh wo, Nu Nu
I can't get you out of my mind
Just give me a chance and I will show
How much I want you, oh, how I want you so
Nu Nu, if he's been sometime, sometime would be today
You make me want to sing, sing in a special way
Mmm mmm, yeah, yeah, mmm mmm, yeah, yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah, sing in a special way
Mmm mmm, yeah, yeah, mmm mmm, yeah, yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah, sing in a special way
Oh wo, Nu Nu
I can't get you out of my mind
Oh wo, Nu Nu
I can't get you out of my mind
Oh wo, Nu Nu
I can't get you out of my mind
Oh wo, Nu Nu
I can't get you out of my mind
