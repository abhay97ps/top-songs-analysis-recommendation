This is not America, sha la la la la
A little piece of you
The little peace in me
Will die 
For this is not America
Blossom fails to bloom this season
Promise not to stare
Too long 
For this is not the miracle
There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea
For this is not America
Sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la
This is not america, no
This is not, sha la la la la
Snowman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals to the ground
So bloody red, tomorrow's clouds
A little piece of you
The little piece in me
Will die 
For this is not America
There was a time
A wind that blew so young
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea
For this is not America
Sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la
This is not america, no
This is not, sha la la la
This is not america, no
This is not
This is not america, no
This is not, sha la la la
