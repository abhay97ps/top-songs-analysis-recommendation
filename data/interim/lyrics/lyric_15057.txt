When the rain is pouring down
And no one is around
All the doors are closed
You're a stranger in this town
Wandering around and you feel lost
CHORUS:
Please try to find me and I'll try to find you
You know I need you just like you need me
Please don't give up cause we're almost together
We've almost made it, hold on and you'll see
When nobody wants to hear
What you want to say
And you feel down when your hope has disappeared
Like a morning train
You can't slow down
CHORUS
I'm just like you
Oh you know it's true
Don't give up my friend
This is not the end
CHORUS
