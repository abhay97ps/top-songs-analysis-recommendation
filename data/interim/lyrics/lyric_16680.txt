For the love of money
Gotta make that money, man
That money, man, it's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
That money, man, it's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
That money, man, it's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
That money, man, it's still the same now
Gotta get on the grind, pop in the clip of my 9
And, bitch, if you slip, you hit the chalk
And fall in the night time, gotta get mine
Ain't takin' no shorts or no losses
Hop on the phone, call up my nigga, sittin' at home
Polishin' that MAC-10 chrome
Got a lick we can hit, so bring yo' shit
'Cause once again it's on 
To the dome with a fifth of Bourb'
My wig to the curb so we swerve and rolled out
To pick up the triple six thug
And follow the murder for robbin' the dope house 
Smoke up outta me bong
So high, now comin' to slay with four grenades
And a gauge, I'ma play
Watch all 'em fall in their grave and lay 
Pullin' in the driveway
Wish spotted the place and quickly rolled up
Bulldozed through the livin' room
Hopped out of the car and started to blow up 
Buck buck and a kaboom
And blew all them bodies all over the room
Them doomed, and gotta move fast
Why? The po-po's comin' 
Snatch up me yummy
So nigga, don't think it's funny
I'm comin' up quick in the nine-quad
'Cause Flesh be lovin' his money, his money 
I'm given up love to the hustlers, all them St. Clair thugstas
Makin' that money, stayin' on your feet
And you better believe, gotta have that cheese
For the green leaves, never catch me sleep 
Steady on the grind, get mine
Stayin' down for my crime, man I hit up the nine-nine
Givin' up that yayo
Makin' me sale, twenties, nickles, and dimes 
Beat up and stick up a lick up, that 2-11
Gotta get what's mine, then bailin'
Me kickin' up dust, I'm trailin'
Failin', 1-8-7 
That's how it is
And I gots to have it in the nine-quad
Mission to check a mil'
And still be real, thuggin' on the Glock-Glock 
Creepin' on the come up, won't sleep 'til I'm done up
Gotta blaze me blunt up
Hunt up another plot and scheme
Gotta make some green cause soldiers nut up 
What up? Gotta get that business on
Even though the Buddha run me
Stun me, feelin' lovely
But I'm just in it for the love of the money 
Gotta make that money, man
That money, man, it's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
That money, man, it's still the same now 
Gotta make that money, man
That money, man, it's still the same now 
Gotta make that money, man
That money, man, it's still the same now 
Standin' on the corner, straight slangin' rocks
Aw shit! Here comes the motherfuckin' cops 
So I dash, I ducks and I hides behind a tree
Makin' sure them motherfuckers don't see me 
Now my fat sack of rocks, hell yeah, I stuffed 'em
Police on my drawers, I had to pause 
And yeah, it's still motherfuck 'em
Now my game is tight, tight as fuck is my game 
Eazy-motherfuckin'-E or Eric Wright, it's all the same
Now niggas might trip on how I stacks my grip 
I gotta have it, bitch
Gotta make that money, man
That money, man, it's still the same now 
Gotta make that money, man 
That money, man, it's still the same now 
Gotta make that money, man
That money, man, it's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
That money, man 
When dough got me thugsta
Thuggish ways, down for my crime every time
Follow me down the nine-nine
And you will find all of me kind 
Check out the Ripsta now, drop down
Run 'em up outta me hood
Rip straight when makin' me grip with-a me click
Rollin' with Ruthless, the thug I be 
Me put 'em in mud, buck 'em, and pump blood
Got nothin' to lose, bitch
You better respect rip
Or you best just check this slug 
It's goin' down, steady pump
And peel rounds, gunnin' witha me gang
Bang, gotta make that money, man
It's still the same, steady runnin' thing wild 
And follow me now
While I take you up into a barrel of a gun
See, for the dub you're done
For the bud, I run, for the love of money 
Gotta get down for my thang off in this thug game
So peep as me creep or me crawlin'
Off on the mission to back in the days
When niggas was bailin' with sawed-offs and wanted to get paid
 Runnin' to my side, little nigga
Ripsta, both on the mission for money
You give up the cash, oh, that was your ass
'Cause me and my nigga was hungry 
And, bitch, if you're stallin'
You might just catch one to the temple
And um, Bone raw doggin'
So nigga, just make this shit simple and run 
To catch one nigga
Me fill 'em with bullets and dump 'em in rivers
Remember, me killer now 
For money, me dig you six feet in a ditch
And get richer cause bitch, you were slippin'
I'll cut you and rip you, then buck you down 
Steady robbin' and stealin', makin' a killin'
Nigga drug dealin', needin' a million
Hustlin' drugs when the thugs be chillin'
For the money, these niggas be sinnin'
Off in the cut 
Where you find a nigga thuggin' off in braids and skullies
And when I stick you and lick you
Remember I get 'em up for the love of money 
Love of money

And I'm that nigga Krayzie Bone 
In the motherfuckin' house
