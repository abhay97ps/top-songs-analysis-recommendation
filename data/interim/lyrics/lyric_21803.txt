When I was younger I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart as I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I’d never sing of love if it does not exist
But darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
Maybe I'd know, somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone, keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself
That I’m content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa
I've got a tight grip on reality but I can’t
Let go of what’s in front of me here
I know you’re leaving in the morning, when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it’s not a dream
Woah, oh, ooh
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
And I’m on my way to believing
Whoa
And I’m on my way to believing
