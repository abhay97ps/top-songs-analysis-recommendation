To be blessed with forgetfulness, oh yes
To be glad to be alive
Like a bee out of the hive
I don't know how I have survived
But here I am 
And it's a
California day 
California weather 
Take the clouds away 
I'll feel a whole lot better, California day
There's nothing like the sunshine
To get me out of doors
And I'd paddle you in my canoe
If I could find some oars
Goodbye, big time, hello, wind chimes
Yeah, esprit de corps
It's a
California day 
California weather 
Take the clouds away 
I'll feel a whole lot better, California day
I ran into an old dream
I remember well 
It used to be a daydream
 Now it's beginning to feel so real
California day
California weather
Take the clouds away
I'll feel a whole lot better, California
California day
California weather
Take the clouds away
I'll feel a whole lot better, California day
To be blessed with forgetfulness, oh yes
To be glad to be alive
Like a bee out of the hive
I don't know how I have survived
But here I am 
Blown away and gone again
Blown away and gone again
Blown away and gone again
Blown away and gone again
