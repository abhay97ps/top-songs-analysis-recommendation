We got a laid back love
A love that's got a groove that's all its own
We've got a laid back love
That's got us feeling good down to the bone
We got our own special rhythm
That's just different enough to suit us
We'll just follow our drummer
And give one another love
We got a laid back love
And we're gonna make it while we're young
We got a laid back love
And we're going to take it as it comes
We got our own kind of living
Nice and easy does it
Just right for us
â€˜Cause there's no sense in rushing
Not when you're making love
We've got a laid back love
That's beautiful the way it is
We got a laid back love
That's giving us happiness
We got a laid back love
A love that's got its own identity
And I just can't get enough
Of laying back with you next to me
We got our own way of acting
The world's not trafficking love without us
So there's no sense competing
We'll be defeating love
We've got a laid back love
That's beautiful the way it is
We got a laid back love
That's giving us happiness
Lay back
Lay back
Lay back
Lay back love
Hey, girl in the blue notes
You know I'm talking to you
