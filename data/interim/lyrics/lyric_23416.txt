Mustard on the beat, ho!
Uh, tell 'em where I'm from
Finger on the pump, make the 6 straight jump from SoCal
Hollywood to the slums
Chronic smoke get burnt by the California sun
On the west side, east coast where you at?
Just got to New York like a net on a jet
To London, to Brazil, to Quebec
Like the whole damn world took effect to Ferg
Tell 'em
Laid back, slow down
Better represent when we come to your town
So lay back, slow down
Whatchu represent when we come to your town
Say, get in with the business
I'mma be there in a minute

Thinking Russia need a visit

And be on my way to Venice

Everything phat
Got Mustard on a track
My girls all stack
When I roll down the window, let me know where you're

Texas grill, Cadillacs through Miami then back
To London, Jamaica, then France
The whole damn world took effect to Ferg
Tell 'em
Laid back, slow down
Better represent when we come to your town
So lay back, slow down
Whatchu represent when we come to your town
Say, get in with the business
