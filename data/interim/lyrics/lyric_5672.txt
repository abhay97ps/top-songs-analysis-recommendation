Ooh, baby, we've tried love's recipe
Added each ingredient tenderly
A little bit of you, a little bit of me
And we've got honey love
Gone are the clouds
That darkened your sky
Gone are the tears I used to cry
'Cause we've got H-O-N-E-Y
Honey, honey love
Oh, darling, every life needs
Sugar and spice sometimes
Each kiss adds a little sugar
Just a pinch of spice
Ooh, we've got a love divine
One day we'll put the icing on top
The very day we tie that knot
Ice cream soda, ginger ale pop
Hey, it's sweet as honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey
We'll take a little sunshine, one loving cup
Just a little sunshine and divide it up
We'll have sweet tomorrows
'Cause with love and tender care
We'll build a sweet cottage for two
With all the tenderness love can do
A little bit of me, a little bit of you
And we've got honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey
We've got it, baby
Nothing can ever come between us
'Cause we've got honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey
Life is so sweet now...
