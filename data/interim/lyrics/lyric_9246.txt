There's a place not too far away from here
Out with the cows and the Lone Star beer
Where the living and loving is quite all right with me
Well they call it Texas and it's a mighty fine place to be
Runs from Texarkana to El Paso
And Oklahoma down to old Mexico
And there's Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antone
People in Texas sure do make you feel at home
They just want everybody to leave them alone
While they drink their whiskey and roll their own
And they like their music with a little bit of southern sound
They kick up their heels every evening when the sun goes down
And you can call them country and they don't care
And if you don't like the way they wear their hair
You can take you like and shove 'em on up the line
People in Texas don't care if the sun don't shine
