Ha-ha, ha-ha, come here, girl
Ha-ha, ha-ha, come here, girl
Ha-ha, ha-ha, come here, girl
Ha-ha, ha-ha, yeah, girl, oh
Ooh, baby, what's your name?
Ooh, are you wearing Bugle Boy jeans? 
Ooh, I heard you was from Atlanta
Ooh, but, baby, please excuse my manners
I just wanna know, are we cuttin'?
Are we cuttin'? Are we cuttin'?
Ooh, hell yeah, hell, hell-hell yeah
Ooh, she won't see tomorrow if I don't cut tonight 
Friday night 
Ballin', holmes 
Got a nigga smelling fresh as a rose 
Grab my kicks and tuck my clothes
Sharp as a knife
And this is the life, Pastor
Yeah, tell me how ya love that
Let a nigga see that pussy cat, where you at? 
Dance floor 
That's my shit 
Baby girl, let your hair down
Show a nigga what you workin' with, twerkin' with
I am low-key
You don't wanna leave? 
You don't wanna go back to the suite 
Let you caress my feet, huh? Now what you wanna know?
Ooh, baby, what's your name?
Ooh, are you wearing Bugle Boy jeans? 
Ooh, I heard you was from Atlanta
Ooh, but, baby, please excuse my manners
I just wanna know, are we cuttin'?
Are we cuttin'? Are we cuttin'?
Ooh, hell yeah, hell, hell-hell yeah
Ooh, she won't see tomorrow if I don't cut tonight
Off the chain 
Damn, boo 
Where ya been all my lifetime?
Let me fuck ya 'til the sun shine , uh-huh 
What I do? 
Mind my biz 
No, I can't take you home with me
Baby girl, it is what it is, showbiz
Saturday morning 
Damn, I'm weak 
Knew what's up when you came to the room
Talkin about getting some sleep 
The truth 
Shorty got loose 
So pretty, but all I needed
Is a pretty red substitute 
Ooh, baby, what's your name?
Ooh, are you wearing Bugle Boy jeans? 
Ooh, I heard you was from Atlanta
Ooh, but, baby, please excuse my manners
I just wanna know, are we cuttin'?
Are we cuttin'? Are we cuttin'?
Ooh, hell yeah, hell, hell-hell yeah
Ooh, she won't see tomorrow if I don't cut tonight
What you talkin'?
I bring heat when it's hawkin'
'Cause I can't stand a man that don't understand
I'm weighing kilos and grams, the bitch with the upper hand
I'm 'bout to kill it
You dealing with the realest
Fuck the strawberries and chocolate, Hennessy and a condom
Save the kissin' and grindin', it's all about the timing
I really like vice-versa
But tonight's much worser, and, um
Philly chicky, only travel for the best of men
Had me out Atlanta just to see you on your boat in Timbs
Pastor Troy
Won't you just pass the boy
In a split second I'm answering all questions
You dummies are still confessin' how much money make you undress us, so tell me
Ooh, baby, what's your name?
Ooh, are you wearing Bugle Boy jeans? 
Ooh, I heard you was from Atlanta
Ooh, but, baby, please excuse my manners
I just wanna know, are we cuttin'?
Are we cuttin'? Are we cuttin'?
Ooh, hell yeah, hell, hell-hell yeah
Ooh, she won't see tomorrow if I don't cut tonight
