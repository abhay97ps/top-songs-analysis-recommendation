Musta been the way that you touched me
Coulda been the way that you looked
Musta been the way that you loved me
Coulda been the way that you shook
But I need you, need you bad yes I need you, need you bad
I'm in pain when your not around me
I'm in pain when I'm not around you and I need you, need you bad
Musta been a true desperation
Couldn't put a feeling aside
Maybe I was just getting horny
It's a feelin that I just can't hide
