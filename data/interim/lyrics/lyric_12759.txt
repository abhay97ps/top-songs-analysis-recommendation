I used to think that I was made of stone, I only wanted to be on my own
It gets so lonely when youre all alone and you just can't take anymore
Look at the passion in my eyes tonight
Comin at you through the clear moonlight
I want a lover who can hold on tight til I just can't take anymore
Chorus:
Give me no heavenly knight, make him a devil in a fast car
Send me no angel in white, I want it just the way that you are
Other eyes are watching everywhere
Tryin hard to catch us but I just dont care
I gotta touch you just to prove youre there, not some dream I had before
Here comes that feeling that I can't understand
Can't put it in the back, can't hold it in my hand
Gave all the love time on those one-night-stands
Just to see what lies in the store
Chorus repeats 2x
Flyin east to the risin sun, for ninety minutes Ill be under the gun
Ill dream about you while Im on the run til I just can't dream anymore
Chorus repeats out
