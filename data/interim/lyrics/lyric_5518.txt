May I! may I!
May I, may I
May I be your boy
May I speak with you
May I bring you joy
Girl I've been searching
May I, may I, may I, may I
Touch your hand in mine
Such a thrill divine
Girl I've been searching for someone like you
Well I've said everything that I can say
Done everything that I can do
For you girl
Yes I have
So in love with you
May I, may I, may I, may I
Touch your hand in mine
Such a thrill divine
Girl I've been searching for someone like you
I'm gonna walk with you
Girl I'm gonna talk with you
I'm gonna be your boy
I'm gonna bring you joy
(Fade out while singing may I, may I
