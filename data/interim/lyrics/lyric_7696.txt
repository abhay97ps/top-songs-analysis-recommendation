Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke
Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke
They ask me how I knew
My true love was true, ooohooohooo
I of course replied
Something here inside
Cannot be denied 
To my smoke gets in your eyes
They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind, ohoho
When your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes 
Yes, I know 
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love 
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, ohoho
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes 
I said sm-smoke 
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, ohoho
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes
