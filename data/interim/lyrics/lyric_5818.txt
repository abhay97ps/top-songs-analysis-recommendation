Why can't you stay and love me all summer?
Don't go on vacation
I can't live through the separation
Stay in town, girlstay around, girlI need
Why can't you stay and love me all summer?
Why can't you stay and love me all summer?
Last year we were parted
Till September I was downhearted
Skies are so gray when you're away, so baby
Why can't you stay and love me all summer?
Why can't you stay and love me all summer?
They say there is no place like home
But I can't face this place called home alone
Pity, have some pity
Spend your summer here in the city
Share my warm nights, share the bright lightsI want you
Why can't you stay and love me all summer?
Why can't you stay and love me all summer?
