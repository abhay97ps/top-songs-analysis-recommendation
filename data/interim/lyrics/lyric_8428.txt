That song is driving me crazy, I gotta hear it again
First time I heard it I was with some friends
It's a simple little song you can sing along with an old time melody
So would you play that crazy little song again for me?
That song is driving me crazy
I love that part about break my heart and baby please come home
And I love that line about hurtin' my mind
And my beer ain't got no foam
Well, you'll sing high and I'll sing low
And everybody sing along
But everybody quit while I get my kick
Singin' bring that boogie home
Mhm, that song is a driving me crazy
Okay gang, well, that song is driving me crazy
