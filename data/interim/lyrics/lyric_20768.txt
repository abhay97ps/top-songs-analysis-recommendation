Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Keep it movin' bounce, hey
Keep it movin' bounce, hey 
Keep it movin' bounce, hey 
Keep it movin' bounce, hey 
Once again, nothin' jumpin' up in your place
Sick of your Berry buzzin' all in my face
Way too much to tolerate
Time to roll, y'all know I gots to migrate
Speed-dial connecting me to Rae Rae 
Click in Shawnte and Mae Mae 
"Treat it as a holiday," 'cause he's a wrap
Y'all know I had to migrate
So, I'm on my way home
'Cause my jeans, yeah, they fit, but it might benefit
Me to throw somethin' on
To feature my hips, accentuate my ahh
And steal the show
Soon as we walk through the door
Fellas be grabbin' at us like "yo"
Tryin' to get us goin' off that Patrón
We sippin' Grigio, slow
If your neck and your wrist coordinate
Hair braided or faded, okay
We can move this back to my place
It's time to migrate
From my car into the club, we migrate 
From the bar to VIP, we migrate 
From the party to the after party, migrate 
After party to hotel 
As we proceed getting buzzed the envious ones
Hatin' but they can't take their eyes off us
But we don't see none of that
They playin' my jam and the floor is packed
See, ya'll need to migrate up out the door
We're clinkin' glasses, compliments of the club
We raise their status, so you know they show us love
Everywhere we go, they gon' flock
Them boys migrate to where it's hot , it's, it's
Soon as we walk through the door
Fellas be grabbin' at us like "yo"
Tryin' to get us goin' off that Patrón 
We sippin' Grigio, slow
If you're inked up thuggin' that swag I like
Face, body and Lamborghini outside
Obviously, boy, you qualify
Otherwise migrate 
From my car into the club, we migrate 
From the bar to VIP, we migrate 
From the party to the after party, migrate 
After party to hotel, 
This is where it begins and ends at the very same time
Teddy Pain, the main man of the hour
Got a flow that'll flat your tire
Got stacks, plus I'm back with Mariah
We stay down like four flats on a Cadillac
Back to the back, we fall flat, girl
If you feel like doin' a dance, I'm gonna pull up my pants
C'mon back, girl
But I gotta migrate to the bar, from the bar to the floor
From the floor to the car, from the car to the crib
Then it's back to the club, we can migrate in that
Mini Coupe sitting on dubs
Ooh, whatcha waitin' on? I can't stand in one place
I'm on a Platinum Patrón and I hate when I don't get it my way
So don't wait for me to buy drinks or you gon' dehydrate
It's time to migrate, yeah
Soon as I walk through the door 
They know I'm from the 8-5-0 
I need three bottles of that Patrón
I can make the Chevrolet grease up slow
If your ass and your titties coordinate
Shawty, show it like it ain't okay 
We can move this back to my place
Shawty, best believe, it's time to migrate
Soon as we walk through the door
Fellas be grabbin' at us like "yo" 
Tryin' to get us goin' off that Patrón 
We sippin' Grigio, slow
If you're inked up thuggin' that swag I like 
Face, body and Lamborghini outside 
Obviously, boy, you qualify 
Otherwise migrate, bye 
Keep it movin' bounce, hey
Keep it movin' bounce, hey
Keep it movin' bounce, hey
