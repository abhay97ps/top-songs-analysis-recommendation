A love you can't deny
I'll never give up
No, I'll never give up on you
I'll never give up
No, I'll never give up
I've just got to be with you
I'll never give up on you
I'll never give up
No I'll never give up
'Till I make this dream come true
I'll never give up on you
I'll never give up
No I'll never give up
I've just
