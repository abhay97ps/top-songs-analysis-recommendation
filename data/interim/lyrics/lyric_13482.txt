The whispers in the morning of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now as I look into your eyes
I hold on to your body and feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender, a love that I could not forsake
Cause I am your lady and you are my man
Whenever you reach for me, I'll do all that I can
Lost is how I'm feeling, lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you
Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
But never wonder where I am
Cause I am always by your side
Cause I am your lady, and you are my man
Whenever you reach for me, I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something, somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love
The sound of your heart beating made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on is light-years away
Cause I am your lady, and you are my man
Whenever you reach for me, I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something, somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love
We're heading for something, somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love
Ooh, the power of love
The power of love
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn 'bout the power of love
