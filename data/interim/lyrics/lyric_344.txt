Don't be fooled by big blue eyes
By a smile or a golden curl
Because she'll love you now and then break every vow
Because she is just a honky-tonk girl
Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one
She knows all the arts of love, she'll give your heart a twirl
Because she is just a honky-tonk girl
She can never change your ways
Though you'll give her all the world
She's had more than one or two and each day there's someone new
Because she is just a honky-tonk girl
Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one
She knows all the arts of love, she'll give your heart a twirl
Because she is just a honky-tonk girl
