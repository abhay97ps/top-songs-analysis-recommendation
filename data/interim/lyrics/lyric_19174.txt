I just touched down 
Quarter after two 
I know it's late 
But I'm callin' you 
Tryna figure if I 
Can 
Come 
See 
You 
I know you're sleep 
But you're on my mind 
And I'm wide awake 
And I wanna stop by 
So can you get up and get out of the bed
Cause I wanna see you
And I been wonderin'
Can I come over 
Come over 
Come over 
Come over 
Can I come over 
Come over 
Come over 
Come over 
Can I come over 
Come over 
Come over 
Come over 
Can I come over 
Come over 
Come over 
Come over 
So tell me what the deal
You're not that far
I just got my bags
And I'm headed to the car
Say yes or no, cause I'm on the road
{​Um, wait a minute my battery's low... lemme, aight}​
Baby, I wanna come see you
Said I really wanna come see you
Don't you worry about a thing
I'm just wanting to hold you
Embrace you, I want to
Look at you and tell you
How much I love you
I want you, I need you, I miss you
Can I come over 
Come over
