Back upon an old dirt road next to a swamp full of toads
Was a slanted wood shack with three little kids and a mama
Papa died in '63 left little Jenny and me
To plant those taters and pull up another tomorrow
Rocky mountain music
Fills my memory
Rocky mountain music
Papa can I hear you playing for me
Little brother was never quite right, he used to sit on the floor in the sunlight
Play with the dust that danced on the beams in the window
And sister had to cook and clean, 'cause momma she got sick and lean
Sometimes I think she just died away missing papa
Rocky mountain music
Fills my memory
Rocky mountain music
Mama can I hear you singing to me
Well every thing has changed today and little brother he was taken away
And sister, she married a soldier and lives in Toledo
And me I'm in a Nashville bar and I've never been so far
From that old gravel road and the rivers that run through my memory
Rocky mountain music
Fills my memory
Rocky mountain music
Brother can I hear you calling me
Rocky mountain music
Fills my memory
Rocky mountain music
Papa can I hear you playing for me
