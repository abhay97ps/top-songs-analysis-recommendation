Ghetto, ghetto
Ghetto, ghetto livin'
These streets remind me of quicksand
When you're on it, you'll keep goin' down
And there's no one to hold on to
And there's no one to pull you out
You keep on fallin', no one can hear you callin'
So you end up self-destructin'
On the corner with the toolie on the waist line
Just got up out the thing doin' state time
Teeth marks on my back from the K-9
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine
‘Cause they said that I wouldn't make it
I remember like yesterday
Holdin' on to what God gave me
‘Cause that's the life
When you're livin' in the 
And eatin' in the 
Oh, sleepin' in the 
Ghetto, that's the life
When you're livin' in the 
And eatin' in the 
Oh, sleepin' in the 
No need to cherish luxuries
‘Cause everything come and go
Even the life that you have is borrowed
‘Cause you're not promised tomorrow
So live your life as if every day is gon' be your last
Once you've moved forward
You can't go back just to remove your past
‘Cause you gotta be willin' to pray
Yes, there gotta be, there gotta be a better way
Yes, you gotta be willin' to pray
‘Cause there gotta be, there gotta be a better day
Whoever said that the struggle would stop today?
A lot a niggas dead or locked away
Teenage women growin' up with AIDS
‘Cause that's the life
When you're livin' in the 
Oh, eatin' in the 
Oh, sleepin' in the 
Ghetto, that's the life
When you're livin' in the 
Oh, eatin' in the 
Oh, sleepin' in the 
Gun shots every night in the 
Crooked cops on sight in the 
Everyday is a fight in the 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Got kids to feed in the 
Sellin' coke and weed in the 
Everyday somebody bleed in the 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
‘Cause that's the life
When you're livin' in the 
Oh, eatin' in the 
Oh, sleepin' in the 
Ghetto, that's the life
When you're livin' in the 
Oh, eatin' in the 
Oh, sleepin' in the
