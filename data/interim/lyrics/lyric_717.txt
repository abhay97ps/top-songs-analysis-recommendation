Time to say goodbye I know I've said it before
Though I hate to go I can't be hurt anymore
You've never seen me with a tear in my eye
The next kiss is the last goodbye
When I'm not around there's someone else you can call
Half a love is worse than havin' nothin' at all
I needed your love and my darlin' that's why
The next kiss is the last goodbye
No more holding hands
No more whispering words tenderly
Know it breaks my heart
There's no other way for me
Time to say goodbye is nothing else that I can do
Wish you all the luck with your somebody knew
If I said I'd forget I'd be telling a lie
The next kiss is the last goodbye
Just one more kiss and then baby goodbye
Well one one more kiss that means goodbye
End
