Saucers are a-flyin'
Flyin' in the sky
The saucers are a-flyin'
Flyin', oh, so high
My woman's a sexy lady
She makes love like a dream
Burnin' like a fire, boy
Ever for eternity
We're on our way
We're on our way
We're on our way, we're on our way
We're on our way
Where she rides on ask a movie
A sparkle in the night
She shines in the sky like a blood of high
I mean, baby, it's a out of sight
Hurricanes, thunder
A spaceship's on the run
We're gonna bring the truth to planet earth
We're gonna move it on and on
We're on our way
We're on our way
We're on our way, we're on our way
We're on our way
Ahaha...
