I’m lost in her there holding that pink rod and reel
She’s doing almost everything but sitting still
Talking about her ballet shoes and training wheels
And her kittens
And she thinks we’re just fishin'
I say, “Daddy loves you, baby” one more time
She says, “I know. I think I got a bite.”
And all this laughing, crying, smiling dying here inside’s
What I call, livin'
And she thinks we’re just fishin' on the riverside
Throwin' back what we could fry
Drownin' worms and killing time
Nothing too ambitious
She ain't even thinkin' about
What’s really goin' on right now
But I guarantee this memory’s a big’in
And she thinks we’re just fishin’
She’s already pretty, like her mama is
Going to drive the boys all crazy
Give her daddy fits
And I better do this every chance I get
Because time is tickin'
Yeah it is
And she thinks we’re just fishin' on the riverside
Throwin' back what we could fry
Drownin' worms and killing time
Nothing too ambitious
She ain't even thinkin' about
What’s really goin' on right now
But I guarantee this memory’s a big’in
And she thinks we’re just fishin'
She ain’t even thinkin' about
What’s really goin' on right now
But I guarantee this memory’s a big’in
And she thinks we’re just fishin'
Yeah, aww, she thinks we’re just fishin'
We ain’t only fishin'
