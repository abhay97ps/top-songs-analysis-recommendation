Just one look and I fell so hard
In love with you, oh-oh, oh-oh
I found out how good it feels
To have your love, oh-oh, oh-oh
Say you will, will be mine
Forever and always, oh-oh, oh-oh
Just one look and I knew
That you were my only one
Oh oh-oh oh
I thought I was dreamin' but I was wrong, oh yeah, yeah
Ah, but I'm gonna keep on schemin'
Till I can make you, make you my own
So you see, I really care
Without you, I'm nothin', oh-oh, oh-oh
Just one look and I know
I'll get you someday, oh-oh, oh-oh
Just one look, that's all it took, hey
Just one look, that's all it took, well
Just one look, that's all it was, baby
You know I love you, baby
I built my world around you
C'mon, baby
