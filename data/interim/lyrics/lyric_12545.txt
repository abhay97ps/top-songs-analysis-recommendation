Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh
You better stop, girl, doggin' me around 
Stop it, baby
Cause if you don't stop, I'm gonna put you down
I can't take it much longer
My heart's getting weak, it's not getting any stronger
You keep me so upset, my head's in a whirl
But, if you wanna,  if you wanna be my girl
You better stop, girl, doggin' me around 
Stop it, baby 
Cause if you don't stop, I'm gonna have to put you down
You go out at night and  have yourself a ball
Sometimes you don't, you don't  make it home at all
I don't mind you having yourself a real good time
But now whatcha trying to do, trying to make me lose my mind
You better stop girl yeah
You better stop
Hey you better stop
You better stop, girl, doggin' me around 
Stop it, baby 
Cause if you don't stop, I, I'm gonna have to put you down
Don't make me do it 
Stop it, baby, yeah
