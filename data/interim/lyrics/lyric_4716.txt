This is how i begin holding headphone on head, &
Play the track & completely vibe with the wave
& search for alphabets & keep on pulling the thread
Invade around like erupted lava outbreak
I see the universe when i close my eyes like a fire sphere
I'm try to show adverse effect to acquire flare
Like a human torch in fantastic four
& drop the heat on mike to rock bombastic show
Drastic blow, while im writing I'm sarcastic yo
You think i spit light uhh !! but i melt concepts like a plastic bro
So if possible drop crown on my orb & hand me throne
Do not poop the sound else a gland will grow on yo neck region
Ima caged demon behind bars who's gonna break prison
Now I'm coming to annihilate ya'll backstabbers
So fuck ya fake reason, once i set the mic off, I commence division
Hooks :/>
Music is floating in the air, like light feathers, all above the sphere
Its trying to share,  rhy-thms & glare, the message in atmosphere   X 2

Instruments and words takes me in a lyrical voyage
When i contemplate ma vision strips concepts like lopez
Then flow levitates like golden compass ta show ways
Ablaze the entire concepts like just the way i blow haze
As i vive with the beat my pen/pain lost/lust in between lines
& bring more controverseries than lidsay lohan kinds
3ye put tied on syllables  coz its deep as emotion
Coz concept is like pearl in oyster which sleep in an ocean
I'm too desperate to feel your flower love
When im on a to fro motion bitch !! shower drop
Verbally I'm too strong to kick off , power pop
Just like 9/11 attack on newyork tower drop
Tower drop ? yea grizzily i devour top of Emcees anatomy
Bring lyrical disaster like tsunami
Drop the tornado on their heads & they be rolling in the deep
Bring adele, & control her clitoris

I play with words and phrase as if they are Demi And Selena
Gaze my eye ta see tities/city tease when i have Remy With Katrina
Be doped up in the words like mind in a Cocaine
As ma brain goes on thinking impulse Connects The Main ideas
Sketch on the paper, set off Context On Plane/plain
But before i drop it ma pen steals ma Concepts From Brain
I'm so insane that even I'm uncertain that i am
But when I'm in the booth, i glamour mic & entertain
& murk cats on game, blow their hats and frame,show the facts and flame
Tryina fuck me over bitch !! i crush an axe on lame
Rappers i make a chain of words to concatenate connection
Then show direction musical affection..
Fuck an idea as if its miley during erection using protection
Leave ma thang inside the body like medical injection
Coz whatever the thang i do is an epitome of perfection
