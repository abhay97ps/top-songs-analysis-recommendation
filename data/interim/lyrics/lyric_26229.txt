Yep 
Yep 
Uh-huh
Yeah, nigga
Yeah, it's been a minute, but I'm back in it 
Y'all ain't dealing with the same boy 
Got a little trippy, then I transitioned 
New attitude mixed with that pure raw 
The night game, your girl called
She like, "Do me, baby, down to get busy, busy?" 
No dice, chill, whoadie 
In life, feeling dizzy
Oh, having visions of the city and I go to war
See me in the day through the late night 
Tell 'em it's the charm, I'm in freeze mode
To the gods, can't stop a hero when he in flight 
I'm swimming in the light right
Go and get you some, go and show 'em something, this a new thang
Yeah, I let my nuts hang 
Knock your top off with LeBron or Dwyane Wade 
Aww, lift off
Can't stunt a nigga growth, better get gone, move along 
You don't wanna trip, wanna get it on 
You don't wanna act, don't get me wrong 
They don't listen to the words in the song 
We ain't gotta tell 'em, we just getting ready 
See 'em fronting, we ain't kidding
If you want it, you can get it
Members of the rage, come and get you some
Next step's out the jet from the lean back
Running 'round the world and we ain't packed
Hit 'em, vroom, vroom, leave 'em stuck, oh, you seen that?
I'm chillin' where the team at
See a black Benz pull up with some jawns, yeah, I need that
So crazy, can't believe it
No cams, damn, no filming at all, real nigga facts 
Years ago, rehab
All good, helped me figure out another plan
It got bad, so bad
Nah, I ain't fucking love that, man
Then I hopped out in a new zone with my Louis bag
True story, take you through the dark and the light 
Godson, got through new
Back up in the world, it's the day in the life 
Hit the blunt and get it 
Raised bars , same song, we did it 
Hot sauce, pour it on all jams, explicit
Carry on, smoke strong, got your mama down with it 
And the game fuckin' needed something dirty raw
Tell them this the law and we weeded 
So if it's God you believe in 
Bob your head and just nod in agreement 
They say time's undefeated
I'ma be the first one who can beat it 
I had hoop dreams, now I shoot threes 
Got a lil' green , but I don't do weed 
Purp nor lean , that's Tunechi 
That's New Orleans , fuck Drew Brees 
Snoop D-O-double , that's two G's 
I probably spent on paper, ooh-wee
Since Tuesday, probably killed a few trees 
But the only ones I smoke are the loose leaf
Not high, but I'm your highness 
And secretly, you're on my dick 
But you haters are butthurt , bunch of sore hind-ends 
I was just a poor white kid 
Now if rap was B-ball, I'd be Jordan-like, bitch 
You wish you could score like this , yeah
Not even at half court, I'd miss 
I'm mouthwash, 'cause if I was on the floor, I'd swish 
But I cannot lie 
I got you in my top five
Worst rappers of all time 
I lost my spot, y'all got Alzheim' 
King of rap? Nah, their words, not mine 
King of swear words and not lying 
You should never compare yours 
A toll-free number , only way you'll ever have a hot line
Fuck's going on, man? 
Bunch of half-wits up in office 
Half of us walking around like a zombie apocalypse
Other half are just pissed off and 
Don't wanna wear a mask and they're just scoffing
And that's how you end up catching the shit off 'em
I just used the same basket as you shopping
Now I'm in a fuckin' casket from you coughin' 
Always stay ahead of haters, let 'em hate
But never let a traitor penetrate your circle
Separate yourself from those who try to pull you down
The real ones never stray, it's sort of like Medusa 
That's how you stay ahead of snakes 
Emcees pull out gats, I don't give a fuck how strapped
You're gonna out-rap me? I doubt that
Please, bitch, I'm a house rat
These raps are 'bout that cheese like mousetraps
Earthlings, I adapt to 'em
Certain things, I don't want to do, but have to in
Order to just act human
Like using a bathroom and vacuuming 
Rapping in the booth in a triple fat goose hazmat suit
Bubble wrap and a mask too and
I don't think that's what they meant by trap music 
Running through ink like I'm tattooing 
This is music to be murdered by, you love
Turn the volume up, I am fired up like a blunt
Bread is long like an Italian sub, I am drugs
That is probably why your opinion of me's high as fuck
And it's nonstop fury 
'Cause I ain't holding 'em up like an armed robbery 
And God's my jury, so when I die, I'm not worried 
Prayers to George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery 
How the fuck is it that so many cops are dirty? 
Stop, man, please, officer, I'm sorry
But I can't breathe when I got you on top of me
Your goddamn knee's on my carotid artery 
The adventures of Moon Man & Slim 
Yes, who want it with them?
The trilogy continues
Serving niggas, yes, see what's on the menu 
Watch 'em panic, hot damnit 
Hope you fuckers understand it
The realer for you niggas
Come and get these scriptures 
Rap God 
Rager
