Barbed wire fence carving out a hillside
Cutting holes in the midday sun
Like a postcard framed in a windshield covered in dust
I love the rhythm of an old grey blacktop, 33's just whistling by
Steer the wheel, one handed on a two lane, hugging that line
I got the windows down, no one else around singing
Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
Come on, come on sing along, sing along to my backroad song
I hit the brakes for an old New Holland, hammer down and pass him on up
The breeze smells like a summertime hay field's just been cut
I got the windows down, way out of town singingâ€¦
Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
The only way today could get better, girl what I'm thinking
Is I can pick you up, you slide in this truck
And I can hear you singing
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Let me hear you sing it
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Freedom is the miles we're rolling on
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
This is my backroad song
This is my backroad song
Come on, come on, sing along
To my backroad song
