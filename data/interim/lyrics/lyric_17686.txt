Nothing could be harder to believe
When you told me that you needed to be free, free
I'm only gettin' by on memories
Hopin' maybe time will help you see, see
*Chorus*
Remember when
I could see forever in your eyes 
Remember when
Together we could leave the world behind 
Ooh, I've got nothin' to lose, nothin' to hide
Can't live without you, I'm dyin' inside
Can't we get it back again
Remember when
I'm searchin' for the one abandoned dream 
Heaven's in the love I cannot reach
 can't reach 
You know I'm longin' for the magic of your touch
And I thank God, I'm never givin' up the chance to trust you'll come
Back to me
*Chorus*
Remember when
I could see forever in your eyes 
Remember when
Together we could leave the world behind 
Ooh, I've got nothin' to lose, nothin' to hide
Can't live without you, I'm dyin' inside
Can't we get it back again
Remember when, yeah
I know I'll be holdin' on to thoughts of yesterday
I keep holdin' on to the times we shared, baby
You know I'll never let you go, let you go
I could see forever  in your eyes
Remember when
Together we could leave the world behind
I've got nothin' to lose, nothin' to hide
Can't live without you, I'm dyin' inside
Can't we get it back again
Remember when
