Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
End of the spring
And here she comes back
Those summer days those summer days
That's when I had most of my fun back
Those summer days those summer days
Aww we can bum bum where we want to
Hey we're out of school
County fair in the country side
And everything is cool
We can do what we want to
Out of school
We can do what we want to
First day of fall and there she goes back
Those summer days, those summer days
Aww we can bum bum where we want to
Hey we're out of school
County fair in the country side
And everything is cool
We can do what we want to
Out of school
We can do what we want to
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah what we want to
