Darling, please stay, don't go away
What a heartache, for Heaven's sake
Don't leave me blue of wanting you
Don't be untrue, what could I do?
Don't you know you
You gave me the world, little girl
When you gave me your love
So if you take your love
You take my world with you too
Hey, look at me, now can't you see
Hear what I say, stay here, I pray
Why must I plead, you know I need
Don't put me down, keep me around
And I say, baby
Hey, pretty little baby
Don't leave me baby
Pretty little baby
Darling, you give me joy, am I your toy?
I always share your every care
All through the years, we have no fears
You leave the tears falling for years
Baby please, baby
Pretty little baby
