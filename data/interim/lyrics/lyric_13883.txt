I thought you were my girl
Then you came and rocked my world, well, well
Our love was right on time
Now you've gone and blown my mind, yeah
I got the feelin', it's over
The funny feelin' that it's over
I got the feelin', it's over
The funny feelin' that it's over now
I thought we had such a love affair, baby
Was I so wrong? Is it over now, over now?
Ooh, I'd like to know what you feel for me, sugar
Is it really real or is it just a lie, yeah?
I'd like to know, baby
Is there a chance for us or is this the end, baby
Of our romance
Got the feelin' it's, got the feelin', it's over
The funny feelin' that it's over now
Got the feelin', it's over
The funny feelin' that it's over now
