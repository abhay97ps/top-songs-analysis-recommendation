If Young Metro don't trust you I'm 'gon shoot you
On demand, bags on demand 
On demand, bags on demand 
On demand, bags on demand 
On demand, bags on demand 
I need the cash on pronto 
Nigga, a lottery ticket 
I get the bands at the bando
Full of the white like it's Iggy 
Five milli' in cash, a wide load and we 'bout to get it 
We from the North, I'm just sayin' though
No name on my hitter
Yeah, Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there 
Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there 
Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there 
Come in the middle of night like it's a nightmare 
You open your eyes, not dreaming, nigga, we right there 
Open your eyes, real life 
Ain't no facade 
You tryna rob, get penalized 
You taking your life
Run up a bag, a milli' in cash then cover your body in gems 
Fucking a thot but I don't go for the plot so I'm fucking this bitch on film 
Come in the night, you won't see 'em 
Black gloves, black hoodie and Timbs 
You don't wanna be him 'cause soon as they see him they shoot off his limbs 
I know I might shine, animated 
A hundreds racks have a nigga waiting 
You got a Rolex, it outdated 
I got your ho outside, be patient 
Back of the Maybach, this ain't a 'Rari, this is the latest Mercedes 
Spent two-hundred thousand on my whole rider
500K just to play 
Open your eyes and your face 
I got the MAC today 
Pay or get whacked today 
Pull up in 'Cats and Wraiths 
Yeah, Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare 
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there 
Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare 
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there 
Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare 
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there 
Come in the middle of night like it's a nightmare 
You open your eyes, not dreaming, nigga, we right there
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
