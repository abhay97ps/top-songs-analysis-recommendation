Ooh damn, how he do that? Flip and Bake it
Ooh damn, do you know me? No relation
Never had a friendship
"Ooh, he a star girl. Who representing him?"
Just me and my dawgs, it's repetition
All I know is fucking get it, I'm never finished
You don't speak the language
Mmmmm
All my niggas different, but we be on the same shit
Stay away from basics

My nightmares bring better dreams
