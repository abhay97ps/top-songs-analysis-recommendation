Let me be the one to always love you
Let me be the one to take care of you
When you want someone to go to
When your day is through
Darling, let me be the one for you
Let me be the one when you are lonely
Let me be the one you think of only
When you're looking for a girl
To tell your troubles to
Darling, let me be the one for you
Let mine be the lips to kiss you sweetly
Let mine be the arms to hold you tight
Darling, give your heart to me completely
Let me be the one you pray for every night
Let me be the one to stand beside you
Let me be the one to help and guide you
When you're looking for a girl
Whose love is always true
Darling, let me be the one for you
 To always love you
 To take care of you
