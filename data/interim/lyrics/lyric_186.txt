Well I make it alright 
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends
Since you left me 
I'm as lonely as I can be
Oh, those lonely weekends
You said you'd be  good to me 
You said our love  would never die 
You said you'd be  good to me 
But baby, you didn't even try
Well I make it alright 
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends
You said you'd be  good to me 
You said our love  would never die 
You said you'd be  good to me 
But baby, you didn't even try
Well I make it alright 
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends
Oh, those lonely weekends
Oh, those lonely weekends
