Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Baby, I need your loving.  
Baby, I need your loving.  
Although you're never near, 
Your voice I often hear.  
Another day, another night, 
I long to hold you tight, 
'Cause I'm so lonely
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Some say it's a sign of weakness for a man to beg
Than weak, I'd rather be
If it means having you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losing sleep
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Empty nights echo your name
Whoa, sometimes I wonder
Will I ever be the same
Oh yeah
 When you see me smiling, you know
Things have gotten worse.  
Any smile you might see 
Has all been rehearsed.  
Darling, I can't go on with you.  
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside me, darling, 
Makes me feel half alive.  
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
