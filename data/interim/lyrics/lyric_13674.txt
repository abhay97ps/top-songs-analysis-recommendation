Say one, say two, say three
Darling, I love you very, very, very much
And I really am relying on your touch
But with all these people listening in
I don't know where I ought to begin
Maybe we could hit upon a word
Something that the others haven't heard
When you want me to love you
Just tell me to press
Right there, that's it, yes
Oh when you feel the stress, don't just stand there
Tell me to press
You can give me what I want I must confess
My body needs attention, my mind is in a mess
Oklahoma was never like this
Never like this, it was never like this
Ever like this, say was it ever like this?
Oklahoma was never like this
Oh it was never like this
Darling, I know it really wouldn't be a crime
If I say I want to love you all the time
But with all these people listening in
I don't know where I ought to begin
Maybe we should have a secret code
Before we both get ready to explode
When you want me to love you
Well just tell me to press
Right there, that's it, yes
When you feel the stress
Don't just stand there
Tell me to press
My minds's in a mess
Oklahoma was never like this
Tell me to press 
Right there 
When you feel the stress 
Oh come on now 
Will you tell me to press 
Will you tell me to press 
Right there 
That's it yes 
Yeah yeah 
Tell me to press
Well just tell me to press
Whoa been so good
Like you knew that it should 
Oh you tell me to press 
A little bit higher 
Woo that's right 
Whoa you feel the stress 
Tell me to press 
A little bit harder 
A little bit higher 
A little bit farther 
Go on now 
Will you tell me to press 
Right there 
That's right 
That's right 
Well you feel the stress
