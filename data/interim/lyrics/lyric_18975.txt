Just Blaze, yeah
Check me out now
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Check me out now
Yo, yo, yo
Let me hear ya say
 Uh huh
 Uh huh
 Uh huh
 Yeah
Put your hands in the air everybody, c'mon
Where them dogs at? 
I'm immaculate, come through masculine
Wide-body frame, E-Dub's the name whoa
In the field of rap, I'm superb, I'm fly
I should be in the sky with birds 
I ride twenty inch rims when I lean yo
I know, I keep 'em clean though
Come through storm the block like El Ni√±o
Scoop up an Arabic chick before she close
She goes 
Those my people
Yeah watch how the E locs 64
Black rags, black interior, shift on the floor
Burn out, I do it for the kids
They're hopping the turnstile, the E going wild
Yeah I'm worldwide, MTV and BET, nigga
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react
Do I gotta go ape or go nutty
I leave your eye like a 9-9 Benz-buggy, puffy
Brick niggas get real ugly
Trust me, keep your four if you feel lucky
Mug me, I ain't got nothin' but four figures
And weed and hash chopped in the coffee blender
My shots like squeegee men on your window
Usual Suspect, I'm the crippled member
Get away when I sat down in the office
Heat in my lap keep me walking awkward
While y'all talk it, the doc reinforce it
The mic, it's hard to keep my paws off it
Your bitch is my bitch when it's over
No Cristal, I pulled up a King Cobra
Out in the Nova, don't bother
My Nino Brown bust, it'll shut down the corridor
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react
Hey yo Red, he's over 
We the shit right now
Watch this  told ya
Chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chilling
 I'm that kid Gizmo, we Top Billing
Yo, when the roof is on fire, believe it, it's me
Sparks when I rock the mic like Sigel and Free
When the pen hit the pad, the evil in me come out
Total Recall for people to breathe
I got dogs in the backyard shitting in lawns
Round and round we go, circle the area
Do-si-do with cowboys where they saddle at
 R.E.D
Crack cost money  yeah
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react
