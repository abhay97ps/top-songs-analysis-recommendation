Wonder who is waiting for me
At the end of Heartbreak Road
Hope that she'll be tender
Someone I can know
Heartaches just don't, don't last forever
But it's a lonely road
A road that we all must travel
Once before we go
I believe that love's a good teacher
When you're in it
Girl, Lord, and even if it don't work out
You ain't gon' never understand it
‘Til you're all down in it, hey hey, Lord
And find out what it's all about
That's all right because
Heartaches just don't, don't last forever
But it's a lonely road
A road that we all must travel
Once before we go
I believe that love's a good teacher
When you're in it
And even if it don't work out
You ain't gon' never understand it
‘Til you're all down in it
And find out what it's all about
That's all right because
Heartaches just don't, don't last forever
But it's a lonely road
A road that we all must travel
Once before we go
