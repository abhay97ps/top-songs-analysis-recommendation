Another night is gettin' colder
Just when I thought that it was over
I realized that I can't be denied your love
It's taken me over
Many times I've tried
Just been too many lies
But I've forgiven you
But you've got your foolish pride
And you know down deep inside
I'm breakin' all the rules
But what else can I do?
'Cause for tonight
A little love and candlelight
For tonight
A little love and candlelight
Can't we be in love for just one night?
I couldn't see that deep inside of me
I couldn't hold on any longer
Can't believe how you get to me, I know
It keeps getting stronger
Many times I've tried to tell you
All the reasons why I'm leaving you
But you've got your foolish pride
And you know down deep inside
I'm breakin' all the rules
But what else can I do?
'Cause for tonight
A little love and candlelight
Can't we be in love for just one night?
For just one night
Give me one more night
For just one night
Give me one more night
For just one night
Give me one more night
For just one night
Give me one more night
For just one night
Give me one more night
For just one night
Give me one more night
'Cause for tonight
A little love and candlelight
Can't we be in love for just one night?
A little love and candlelight
'Cause for tonight
A little love and candlelight
Can't we be in love for just one night?
For just one night
Give me one more night
For just one night
Give me one more night
For just one night
Give me one more night
For just one night
Give me one more night
For just one night
Give me one more night
For just one night
Give me one more night
For just one night
Give me one more night
For just one night
Give me one more night
