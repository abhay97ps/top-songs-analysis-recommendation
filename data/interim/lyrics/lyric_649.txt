Let's go again
Where we went last night
Let's go again, baby
Let's go do it up right
I know you got things to do
But everybody's expecting you
So let's go again
Where we went last night
Let's rock again
Baby, don't be shy
Oh, let's rock, let's rock
Let's just set the house on fire
You don't have a thing to lose
So put on your dancing shoes
And let's go again
Where we went last night
Baby, baby, don't forget
We're gonna dance
Til we're soaking wet
The band's gonna swing
And the band's gonna rock
And we're gonna jump
All round the clock
Come on, come on
Come and go with me
Well, come on, come on, baby
You know I need your company
Oh, baby, don't
You feel so glad
When you think
About the fun we had
So let's go again
Where we went last night

Baby, baby
Baby, don't forget
We're gonna dance
Til we're soaking wet
The band's gonna swing
And the band's gonna rock
And we're gonna jump
All around the clock
