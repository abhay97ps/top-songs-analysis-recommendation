Started writing songs when I was 15
Chasing my dreams by 17
Way focused than all my peers
To do all this I had to break up with my fears
Stay locked up all day I vibed only with my playlist
Ain’t trying to make no friends only wanna make me some records
Stayed away from the world loneliness became my idol
Kept huzzling everyday needed cash to record my songs
Ain’t nobody to go to ain’t nobody knew I was into music
I kept my life locked up and I knew threw away the keys
This kind of life ain’t pretty only I see the joy in it
Fantasizing about my dreams I knew one day I’d get it
I got some feelings I been hushing and they not good
A lot of females who done left but they still want me
Aunties and uncles who ain’t shit but want control me
But I don’t care just feeling dizzy off this backwood
Cy, Khalito support me like I’m their own son
They know I’m stubborn try to change me but they love me
For what is right make sure  I put them in a hellcat
Pen and paper by my side I love you realest
You’re my sidekick
I want go out on a high note
I don’t even have no spare time
Never really liked being normal
Men that shit just looks farcical
Just know if you’re trying to fit in
Then you took the easy way out
Its a very very strong world
And I’m just a hopeful sinner
I been living very lavish I just bought some balenciagas
I’m never caught unfresh your girl and I inamorata
I done glowed up really well I blossom like a portulaca
For my niggas I’m gon' ride Jimmy, Khulman, Stormy familia
All this rapping got me hectic right now I just want Clarissa
William see your vision through me we about to make them look retarded
Tunes hit harder than explosives reason why I’ve been a target
20 songs without no sponsors homie please don’t get me started
On that Gang shit n*gga
The way blues went hard on this one
It’s like he knew this was finna be my intro
Slime
Live lit Die stunnin fam
I ain’t ghosting no more I want reach there quicker
If I wanted to play ball I’ll be a winger
I ain’t sipping nothing I need me a brimmer
You a busybody why not be a stringer
I don’t text these thotties only stay on twitter
Always looking very fly I’m not a swinger
My voice messed up right now I’ma need some ginger
Get this cake all by myself I think that I must be a wizard
Elise heard all of my songs thank you for always being supportive
Christian Khulman Knew I was gifted they was always willing to hear me
First day TK heard my songs he told me not to ever give up
I told broski he need not worry I be living for this music
All that striving and travailing is about to get rewarded
Im gon' end up in a can before I ever think of stopping
Two years ago I was free styling and I posted it on snap
Sick replies from all you bitches yeah I didn’t expect more
Took that as a sample test learnt how most you humans think
That nigga bossdude was calling my phone
He told me he want free his mo'
Burnt that joint and we was faded Nazy max was cracking jokes
Plenty bitches very tekky homie loves to play football
I failed math I had four papers homies used to 
When I finally get exposure they gon' claim to love my flow
I don’t care I ain’t even bothered I don’t care about none of that
Blues is the man
He told me to get in beastmode 
I told him I’m built like this
None of this new to me 
Slime
