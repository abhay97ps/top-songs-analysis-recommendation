Verse:
I cannot save you...you got some issues..like magazines
Its all undercover...you're wearing a mask..distracting with all of that ass
The scars from the past..your squad is the cast...acting up...its a movie
Im outchea really tryna do me...you’d rather have me as a groupie
Such a Diva...high hopes like they smoked Sativa
To be blunt...im like Wiz Khalifa
I might pick a rose based on her features
A bad bad is my typa creature
Thats Too bad coz she's not a keeper
She plays games like its all Fifa
Gotta ball if you wana keeper
I need some new kinda people
I swear my patience is feeble
I need a break from my ego
...might end up looking like im smeagle
I need to know what is precious
Avoiding the wrong kinda pressures
Been chasing the wrong kinda pleasure
Thats putting my heart on a stretcher
Sirens
Girl: Hi Michael, Im so sorry I took so long to reply but..I just really needed to think and I just want you to know that ai really enjoy spending time with you..I like you but...I just feel like my heart isnt ready for something like this..so Im realy sorry but I can't do this...

Verse 1
I hate the way you acting...you going off script...I do not feel any passion
You the vibe assasin..dressed to kill....screenshots & chill
Keep it real..only with the lady in the mirror
...Reflection makes pain much clearer
Looking back on it...See the knife in back..Lotta sweet nothingthat I need to take back
But I am not blameless...gotta admit that some actions were aimless
Throwing a fit..when I was lowkey on the same shit
Giving you dick..your homegirl on the same shit
So I ain’t shit...but my pride's never gonna let me say shit
Now we both on some imma need some space shit
Different worlds relationship to spaceship..swoosh
Verse 2
This was exciting
But now we're just fighting
Back then we were vibing
This whole thing's enlightening,r
I know I dont need this
I was too careless
That made you careless
We're both out of patience
Outro:
Some Scholars actually argue that Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare..wasn't to glorify love but to actually show how crazy love makes us get...and it was actually a work of Satire and im starting to think that we have all these standards and expectations of the way love should go and we end up trying to fix our problems through another person when ultimately we're responsible for our own feelings and emotions...I dont know...I dont have the answers..till next weekend
