(Life ain't easy
Gonna change
Don't just listen
Think about it, life ain't easy)
When I see those people sitting hungry in the street
I put myself in their shoes, finding safer places to sleep
People just walk past them when they know there's something wrong
When all I want to know is why this whole thing's going on because
 And how we are is 
And make this world a better place 
Oooh, you gotta take it in
Think about it and then we can begin 
Life don't fast forever and forever isn't long
So take a chance in life at the moment you can hear this song
No use just thinking about what tomorrow brings
You've got to lift your head up high and do the right thing because
 And how we are is 
And make this world a better place 
Oooh, you gotta take it in
Think about it and then we can begin 
 Ooohooohooohooo
No, no, no (It ain't easy
It ain't easy)
What I'm telling you is 
 I'm saying
 Oooh, life ain't easy 
Ooohooo, ooohooo, darling 
You gotta take it, take it
Think about it) and then we can begin 
 It ain't easy
 No, life ain't easy
 Take it in, ohoho
