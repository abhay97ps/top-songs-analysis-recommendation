When you rolled out of bed and stubbed your toe
And I heard you almost cuss
And I fought back the urge to laugh
Just listen to you fuss
Then you overdid the coffee
Couldn't get your hair just right
When I smiled and said good morning
You looked mad enough to fight
Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in a love with too
Yeah, that minivan's a far cry
From the sports car in your dreams
And that dead end job is pushing back
Vacation more, it seems
You got soccer at four-thirty
And ballet class by five
Then I call you talking flirty
You ask have I lost my mind
Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too
When you lay down in my arms
Let go of all that stress
Whisper, honey I love you
With your head on my chest
When the world's strongest woman is my lady
When the day is through
Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too
If I had to do the things you do
Well, I'd just lose my mind
Somehow you get 'em fed and bathed
And settled down by nine
And I hear you down the hallway
As you're laying down to sleep
And pray the good lord watches
Over them and you and me
Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too
Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too
