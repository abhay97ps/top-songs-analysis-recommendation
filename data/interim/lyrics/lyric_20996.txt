Got to meet the hottie with the million dollar body
They say it’s over budget, but you'd pay her just to touch it, come on
Needs to hit the big screen and shoot a little love scene
If Hollywood had called her, she'd be gone before you hollered, come on
Dirty little lady with the pretty pink thong
Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long
Doesn't care about the money, she could be with anybody
Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along
You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey
You shake your ass around for everyone
I love the way you dance with anybody
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb
You’re so much cooler when you never pull it out
'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth
Crafty little lip tricks
Tattoos on her left hip

There’s no end to it, so baby, come on
Dressed up like a princess

Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long

You’re so much cooler when you never pull it out
'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth
She loves the night scene bar queen
Living for the fun taking over every dance floor like she's the only one
In the spotlight all night dissing everyone
And trying to look so innocent while sucking on her thumb
 When you never pull it out
 With something in your mouth
You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey
You shake your ass around for everyone
I love the way you dance with anybody
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb
You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey
You shake that ass around for everyone
I love the way you dance with anybody
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb
You’re so much cooler when you never pull it out
