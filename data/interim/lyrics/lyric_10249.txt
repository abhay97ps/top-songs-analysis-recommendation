Oh, we're goin' out tonight
Finger poppin'
You look out-a-sight
Won't be no stoppin'
All the discotheques
Better be ready
We're gonna hit em hard
Hard and heavy
Party strong
All night long
Just you, girl, and me
You're my million dollar baby
My pretty sexy lady
Oh 
Oh what a night 
For dancing
Oh what a night 
For romancing
We're, we're gonna laugh and dance
Half the night away
We're gonna scream and shout
While the music plays
Then around about two
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Girl, I'm gonna take you home
And stick plenty love to you
Let's get it on
All night long
Just you, girl, and me
You're my million dollar baby
My pretty sexy lady
