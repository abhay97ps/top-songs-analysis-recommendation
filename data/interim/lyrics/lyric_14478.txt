Baby before hang around this old moldy
Mildewy 'n' crappy scene holding hands with you
There's a whole list of things you're gonna have to do
Jump off the Empire State in a paper sack
Talking lovey-dovey to a camel scare the hump off his back
Get the Queen of England's golden shoes
Put 'em on your feet and sing the St. Louis blues
Look here
Seven days a week with you is more than I can handle
Seven nights of love and dirty laundry on your floor
Baby, I can see this whole thing heading into trouble
I'm out the door
I'm not your man
'Cause you're looking for a hero
Baby, it ain't me, I'm not your man
I ain't nothing to hold on to
Baby, I ain't what you need
It's easy being here but I've got ground to cover
There's nothing you can do to make me wanna stay
Though I've been here awhile don't think that
I've stopped moving, I'm on my way
I'm not your man
'Cause you're looking for a hero
Baby it ain't me, I'm not your man
I ain't nothing to hold on to
Baby I ain't what you need
I might be a clown but I can get down
On my guitar, so here y'are
I'm not the one you're gonna take home to your daddy
I'm not the one to sit around with making plans
I'm not the one you're gonna settle down and marry
I'm not your man
I'm not your man
'Cause you're looking for a hero
Baby it ain't me, I'm not your man
I'm not the one you wanna cry to
Baby, in your sleep
I'm not your man
'Cause you're looking for a hero
I'm not your man
I ain't nothing to hold on to
There ain't no tomorrow baby, there's just right now
You know you got to have some fun while you still know how
Do a monkey chasing line up a coconut tree
A sweet little angel that I ain't ever gonna be
I, I, I, I, I, ooh
I'm not your man
I'm not your man
I'm not your man
I, I, I, I, I, ooh
I'm not your man all the way
I'm not your man, like I said
I'm not your man, look here
I, I, I, I, I, ooh
I'm not your man all the way
I'm not your man, hey
I'm not your man, look out
Y'gotta look out
I, I, I, I, I, ooh
