We've been together now for such a long time
Through every trial we'd ever care to go
When I look back I almost can't believe it
We're not the same people that we used to know
With all the years behind me spent pretending
I didn't need someone like you around
It makes it even harder to imagine
The life I'd be livin', if I hadn't found
Someone to hold me, the way that you do
Someone who needs me, the way I need you
Someone to show me, a way that is true
Someone to love me.......the way that I love you
When there was no one left for me to turn to
When all the world I knew was fallin' down
Oh there were times I could not face the mornin'
But everything's changed since the day that I found
Someone to hold me, the way that you do
Someone who needs me, the way I need you
Someone to show me, a way that is true
Someone to love me.......the way that I love you
Come on-Come on-Come on-Come on now!!
Someone to hold me, the way that you do
Someone who needs me, the way I need you
Someone to show me, a way that is true
Someone to love me.......the way that I love you
Someone to hold me, the way that you do
Someone who needs me, the way I need you
Someone to show me, a way that is true
Someone to love me.......the way that I love you
