The circle of the moon
The rising of the sun
We'll be together soon
Our story's just begun
Time will bring us near
I'll never be too far
Oh, baby, don't you fear
I'll always be right where you are
You can dry my tears
But you can't stop the pain inside
I'm trying to hide
As I hold you near
I know I have to pull away
You know that I can't stay
All of my life
No one has touched me the way that you do
Wherever I go
I know that the road will lead back to you
So don't say goodbye, don't turn away
It doesn't have to end today
Don't say goodbye
'Cause I will love you 'til the end of time
Don't say goodbye
Even though we'll be apart, we'll see the same stars
Just close your eyes and I'll be where you are
Don't say goodbye
'Cause if you say that word, my heart won't survive
Don't say goodbye
Can you feel my desire?
The way my body's aching with your every breath
I try to memorize
Every move you're making
So I will never forget
The way that you feel
Whenever your heart is beating with mine
Wherever I go, I'll keep my memories of you inside
Don't say goodbye, don't turn away
It doesn't have to end today
Don't say goodbye
'Cause I will love you 'til the end of time
Don't say goodbye
Even though we'll be apart, we'll see the same stars
Just close your eyes and I'll be where you are
Don't say goodbye
'Cause if you say that word, my heart won't survive
Don't say goodbye
The circle of the moon
The rising of the sun
We'll be together soon
Our story's just begun
Time will bring us near
I'll never be too far
Oh, baby, don't you fear
I'll always be where you are
No me digas adiós, quédate aquí conmigo
Don't say goodbye
Adiós no es una palabra para nosotros
No te vayas, quédate aquí conmigo
So don't say goodbye , don't turn away
It doesn't have to end today 
So don't say goodbye 'cause I will love you 'til the end of time
Don't say goodbye even though we'll be apart, we'll see the same stars
Just close your eyes and I'll be where you are
Don't say goodbye 'cause if you say that word, my heart won't survive
Don't say goodbye,  don't turn away
It doesn't have to end today 
Don't say goodbye 'cause I will love you 'til the end of time
Don't say goodbye even though we'll be apart, we'll see the same stars
Just close your eyes and I'll be where you are
Don't say goodbye 'cause if you say that word, my heart won't survive
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
