Did she tell you it's over?
Did she throw you out in the night?
Here you come to your other lover
Thinkin' that a restless heart
Will get you high again
But I changed the number on my telephone
You won't find me when you come callin'
And I'll say
Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be
Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be
Did you think I'd be waiting for you?
Did you think I'd be holding my breath
To hear the sound of your footsteps?
Sayin' it's all over with her
And now you need me
You need me
But I changed the number on my telephone
You won't find me when you come callin'
And I'll say
Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be
Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be
So don't try to call me anymore with your lies
Don't be a fool and make the mistake
Of thinking I still love you
Anyone can tell I'm fine
And I don't need you
But I changed the number on my telephone
You won't find me when you come callin'
And I'll say
Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be
Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be
