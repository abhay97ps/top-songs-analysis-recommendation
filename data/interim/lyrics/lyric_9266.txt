Hit the Road Jack and don't cha come back
No more no more no more no more
Hit the Road Jack and don't cha come back
No more
What'd you say
Old woman old woman, oh you treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I ever have seen
Well I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go 
Now Baby, listen Baby, don't you treat me this-a way
'Cause I'll be back on my feet some day
Don't care if you do, cause it's understood
You got no money, and you just ain't no good
Well I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go 
Well
Uh, whud jou say?
I didn't understand you
You can't mean that
Aw now Baby, Please
What you tryin to do to me!?
