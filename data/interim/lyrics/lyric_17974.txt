Baby it's over
Tryna forget about ordinary things
Typical, predictable
Baby I knew the end before we started
You got me feeling like I owe you something
Cause you were there at times when I had nothing
But you threw it all away with the shady things you do
Baby please forgive me
For what I'm 'bout to say
And what I'm 'bout to do
I can't take no more
I know you ain't been true
Ain't got no love for you
Chorus:
You been cheating and telling me lies
You been creeping while I'm sleeping at night
And you been chasing every girl in sight
And you been messing 'round and now you down
It's over now 
I ignore my intuition and pass it off as a suspision
But you were just so bold, you kept putting it in my face
I can't deny I let you hurt me
When you were down I helped to pick you up
Instead you kept looking for the one
When all the while what you were searching for
Was in front of your face. Just forget it...
You'll regret it...It's really over now
Just turn around and walk me watch I'm gone
