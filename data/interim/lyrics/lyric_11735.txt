I just can't believe all the things people say 
Am I black or white? Am I straight or gay? 
Do I believe in God? Do I believe in me? 
Controversy 
I can't understand human curiosity 
Was it good for you? Was I what you wanted me to be? 
Do you get high? Does your daddy cry? 
Controversy 
Do I believe in God? Do I believe in me?
Some people wanna die so they can be free
 life is just a game, we're all just the same...

Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever

People call me rude, I wish we all were nude
I wish there was no black and white, I wish there were no rules
