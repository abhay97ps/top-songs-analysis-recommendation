===============================================================================
11.  Assembly of Nihilo
SOUL:
The Mantra attacked the Assembly of Nihilo. Is this the end of Nihilo?
[You enter the Assembly of Nihilo. You see a strange pillar in the center of
the room that is dripping with Magatsuhi. You speak to an Oni demon.]
DEMON:
Hahaha! World of stillness, my ass! Creation? Yeah, right! The Assembly of
Nihilo is in shambles! Hahahahahaha!
[You can hear sounds coming from inside the room.
HIJIRI:
*sigh* Thank god it's just you. I thought I was ambushed. Don't scare me
like that! ...Well, you look like you're alright. I'm sorry about what
happened last time. Yeah, I screwed up...But, it worked out for the best. I
had no idea they had a base this big...If I had used that thing correctly,
you would have been here all by yourself! ...I have some idea what's going
on. The Mantra launched their assault at just the right time. Thanks to
them, my arrival went unnoticed.
.....
Hey, this might sound crazy, but... Did you join the Mantra?
	       CHOICES
	  1)   Yeah, I did.
	       ...I see.
	       Well, it's your decision, so I won't say anything.
2)   Why would I do that?
	       Oh, so it's just a rumor. You seem so much stronger, I
	       thought it might be true...Oh well.
HIJIRI:
This entire room is a facility for collecting Magatsuhi. We're at the center
of that big hole you see from outside. It was destroyed during the assault,
and now it's completely shut down. But, this place was filled with tons of
Magatsuhi just a moment ago. Those Mantra guys beat the hell outta this
place. I don't blame them... Anybody would assume that this is the core of
Nihilo. They just left here, acting like they ruled the world...
...not realizing that Hikawa fooled them. I wouldn't have known either, if I
didn't use the Amala Network to get here...The flow of Magatsuhi seems a
little strange. It's cleverly disguised, but this is just bait. The real
core must be located somewhere else inside the base...And that's where
Hikawa will be.
HIJIRI:
Damn it, I better not stick around much longer...The commotion caused by the
Mantra has pretty much died down. It'll be even more dangerous now. I wanted
to meet Hikawa in person, but... I'm not gonna fool myself. I know I won't
survive that long. On your way here, did you see a corridor that you
couldn't enter, one that was spinning? I deactivated it, so you should be
able to go through it now. That's about all the help I can offer...It's up
to you to decide how to deal with Hikawa. You've come this far...If you turn
back now, you'll regret it, right? Alright then... See ya.
[You enter and see two demons talking in front of another strange, spinning
pillar.]
KOPPA:
Those idiot Mantra demons fell for it hook, line and sinker. They're
probably getting cocky, thinking that they destroyed the core unit.
Power-shmower. Power's nothing without brains!
KOPPA:
.....Hm? Who're you?
INCUBUS:
Hmmm...I don't know who you're with, but it looks like you have some brains.
You just wanna make a name for yourself by taking Commander Hikawa's head,
huh? Just our luck... We were getting bored of the Mantra's stupidity. We
need to welcome our guests and show them off to their afterlife comfortably.
BOTH:
Diiiiiieeeeeeee!!
.]
SOUL:
...Oh, a wise guy, eh??? Did you come here after Commander Hikawa?
	 CHOICES
1)   Yes.
	       Commander Hikawa is on Floor B15 of the core. But,
	       you need the , stakes that control the
	       Magatsuhi in this structure, to get to him. You saw
	       those four pedestals on the way here, right? Use the
	       Kilas there...Occasionally, there are visitors like
	       you, but they all disappear up ahead. They all fall
	       prey to the traps made by the great Commander Hikawa.
	       So, why tell you all this? I figure you have the
	       right to know before you die...
2)   No.
	       If you're just here to get in some rubbernecking, I
	       suggest you turn back. I can't guarantee your safety
anywhere past here.
SOUL:
..........
This is the storehouse for Magatsuhi. It's separated into three floors, and
each leads to a storeroom where a Kila is kept. You see that switch? It's
set up so that it changes the flow of Magatsuhi. *chuckle*  In other words,
if you don't use the switches properly, you'll never make it to the
storerooms.
SOUL:
In each of the storerooms is a demon guarding the Kila. Even if someone
were to make it that far, they'd be killed anyway. So, that's why we don't
have to panic.
ELIGOR:
I am Eligor, one of the fallen angels. I guard this Kila under the order of
our commander. Now... You seem to have some brains, unlike those Mantra
fools. I like those with intelligence. To show you my respect, I will kill
you painlessly. I won't let you have the Kila... Die!!
.
You complete the next puzzle room and enter another room where an Eligor
appears.]
DEMON GUARD:
Alright, that's enough...
. When you attempt
to leave the room, you see a Berith demon.]
BERITH:
Halt...
I am Berith, the great duke of hell.
Insolent scoundrel, put down the Kila and begone!
	       CHOICES
1)   Yes.
	       Then, hurry and begone! No, wait... I can see your
	       future...I can see your face and body bloodied by my
	       hands...If that is the future, then so shall it be!
	       Die!!
	  2)   No.
	       I see...Then, prepare yourself...
	       ...for my spear shall pierce through your insolent
	       skull!
[You finish another puzzle, and move on the the next. During the final
puzzle, a Kaiwan will occasionally appear to switch things up and say the
following.]
MYSTERIOUS DEMON:
Oh, no you don't! I won't let you get past here. How's this?
[You will eventually come to the Green Treasure Room. You open the cache cube,
but it is empty. You leave the room and are stopped.]
VOICE:
Hahahaha... What took you so long? Had a hard time figuring out those
switches at the storehouse?
KAIWAN:
I'm Kaiwan... Sorry, but I can't let you have the Kila. So, take a hike.
Hahahaha!!
[You chase after him, and in the room with many doors you enter the third
door on the left.]
KAIWAN:
That's right... I'm the real one. It's been fun! It's truly regrettable,
but I have to kill you now...Playtime's over.
.]
[You go back to the main room and use the Kilas on the light pillars. A
stairway is revealed. You go down the stairs and take the elevator to floor
B15. You head to the True Core.]
[You enter and see one of those strange blue pillars. Magatsuhi flows from
it into the floor. Hikawa is standing in front of the pillar.]
HIKAWA:
Interesting...So, you found your way here. I guess the members of Mantra
aren't as thick as I thought...
HIKAWA:
Now, this is a big surprise. You're that boy from the hospital, correct?
I'm amazed that you're still alive. And judging by your appearance...you've
gained considerable strength. Why have you come here?
...Are you here to see me?
CHOICES
:
	  1)   Yes.
	       ...I see. Even though I nearly killed you, you've
	       tracked me down to obtain the answers you seek.
	  2)   No.
	       Then, are you here to steal the Magatsuhi, like the
	       Mantra? No... That's not it. But, I have an idea why
	       you're really here.
HIKAWA:
...Very well. I commend you for reaching this place on your own.
If it is truth that you seek, then I will reveal everything...
...all there is to know of this world. Take a look at this device...
Its function is to collect the Magatsuhi.
You must have seen one like it on the upper level.
Do you know why Magatsuhi exists?
	  CHOICES
	  1)   Yes.                                                                                                                   :
	       No, not simply for demons to consume. That's a
	       ridiculous oversimplification...
	  2)   No.
	       Remember this... In this world, you might as well be
	       dead if you don't fully understand Magatsuhi.
HIKAWA:
Magatsuhi... It's used as an offering. It is the power needed to call
forth the god of creation. It is essential to this world's existence. One
who possesses a strong will can change everything in this world. When
'Reason'--one's ideology--has been spread, and Magatsuhi has been gathered,
god will descend from above and reshape the very foundation of the world.
Yes, for the sole purpose of creation, this world of chaos was brought into
existence...by me. Soon, my dream will be realized. A complete circle of
stillness, in harmony with the workings of time... The world of Shijima will
be born. Mantra believes they've destroyed this base, but as you can see,
the core is fully functional... Nothing more needs to be done. The targeted
amount of Magatsuhi will be reached shortly. However, they deserve to be
punished. We'll use them as an example...of what happens to those who oppose
the Assembly of Nihilo. This is a good opportunity. Witness what is about to
take place. Using the Magatsuhi stored here, I will call on my new strength.
The time has come... Activate the Nightmare System!
[The True Core shakes, and the Magatsuhi stops flowing. The True Core goes
dark, and the opening on the top of the Assembly bursts forth with Magatsuhi.
You see above the tower at  Ikebukuro - Magatsuhi starts to rise slowly from
it.]
HIKAWA:
Do you understand what is happening? It's a system which gives me total
control over the flow of Magatsuhi on a worldwide scale... This tiny facility
pales in comparison. As my first target, I have selected Ikebukuro, the home
of Mantra's headquarters. The Magatsuhi in that area will be depleted, and
the Mantra will die out in no time.
HIKAWA:
...Oh, I forgot to mention. Yuko Takao plays a key role in this system.
She's been a great help to me. Her abilities as the Maiden have been
invaluable...Are you worried about Yuko?
CHOICES
	  1)   Yes.
	       I am sorry to say, but she is not here. I doubt that
	       you will ever see her again. She is the Maiden of
	       creation...not the teacher you once knew.
	  2)   No.
	       You risked your life and came all this way, and you
say it was not for her? ...Well, it doesn't matter.
	       She is not here anyways.
HIKAWA:
You were not meant to survive the Conception in the first place. Your
attachment to the previous world will only serve to deepen your despair...
I should not have been so merciful back then. Your pain, your suffering...
I shall end it here. I don't know what hopes and dreams you brought with
you here, but...there is not a single things that you can accomplish in
this world.
HIKAWA:
Now, go and join the others that you have lost...
.]
OSE:
...So you defeated me. But, you will never be able to find our commander, or
the Maiden. The Nightmare System has been activated. This base will soon be
closed down, and the way to the Maiden will be lost forever... Begone, demon!
It is we, the Assembly of Nihilo, who will create the new world!
SOUL:
What's going on? Didn't the Mantra win??? I heard that a bunch of Magatsuhi
was sucked up from Ikebukuro!!
[You go back to Ginza, and transport to Ikebukuro. You enter Mantra
Headquarters, where you see Chiaki leaning against a pillar.]
CHIAIKI:
...Hi, Hero. I heard about the trial by combat, and I thought it might be
you who was the winner. Getting here was tough, to say the least...but I'm
glad I made it.
CHIAKI:
Hero...There's something I want to tell you. I decided to play by the rules
of this world. You know what the purpose of this new world is, right?
CHIAKI:
I...I want to try my hand at the creation.
...You probably think I'm crazy. But, I remembered that voice...
...that voice I heard when the world changed...
You must've heard it too, Hero, since you survived.
[She walks further toward you. White light surround her. You suddenly see her
in a room of red silhouettes of people sitting at desks in a classroom.]
CHIAKI:
...After we went our separate ways, I started thinking. Not just about what
I have to do in this world, but why the world ended up like this. And then,
I realized...that there were too many unnecessary things occupying the
previous world. There were lots of things, and lots of people...But,
nothing new was being made. Time passed, and nothing changed. What the world
really needed...it was not getting.
CHIAKI:
...it's true that I lost everything. It was the saddest thing imaginable.
But, I survived the Conception. I was chosen...That's what I'm going to
believe, and now,  I have to look forward. I still feel a great sadness in
my heart... but if I can swallow it down... endless possibilities await...
The power of creation...will be mine.
[Chiaki sits on the teacher's desk as the student desks and chalkboard melt
away, leaving only Chiaki, the front desk, and whiteness.]
CHIAKI:
'Choose,' the voice said to me.  The world doesn't need any more worthless
things... That's why I want to create my ideal society, a paradise ruled by
the strong, the chosen...The world of Yosuga. Hero, you've fought your way
this far. You know what I'm saying, don't you?
CHOICES
	  1)   Yeah, I get it.
	       ...I'm happy to hear that. I knew you'd understand,
	       Hero. I might ask you to help me out, then.
	  2)   I don't see your point.
	       .....
	       ...That's too bad. I was hoping you'd understand.
	       But, no matter what you say, I won't change my mind.
	  3)  I don't know what to say.
	       ...I see. But I believe in you, Hero.
	       I believe that one day you'll come to accept it.
CHIAKI:
I'm going to start collecting Magatsuhi. Honestly, I don't know where to
begin... But, since Yosuga is the Reason of the strong, I'll see what I can
do on my own first...I'm glad we had the chance to talk today.  We both
survived the Conception...I'm sure we'll cross paths again. See you later,
Hero.
[You enter fully and head for the top floor. Magatsuhi rises all throughout
the Headquarters. You enter Gozu-Tennoh's Chamber.]
GOZU-TENNOH:
You have returned, mighty demon... Have you not seen it with your own
eyes...? The stronghold of Nihilo was laid to waste by my army...
Then, why...?
GOZU-TENNOH:
Behold... Magatsuhi escapes from my body, against my will... And I am not
the only one! All the members of Mantra are being drained of their
Magatsuhi...!
MANIKIN:
Curse you, Nihilo! ...What sort of devious trick did they use!? Oh, the
humiliation! I can see...the Maiden...where the Magatsuhi is drawn to...But
alas, we are utterly powerless... We have no choice but to wait for our
doom... Woe to our leader! Gozu-Tennoh!!
GOZU-TENNOH:
...No! I will not die! My body may perish, but my spirit will live on! In
time, the one worthy of my power will come. It is there that I shall return!!
I will not let them create a world of stillness!! What good is a world
without strength!? I will not forget this rage, this fire that burns my
flesh and soul! My kingdom shall rise again...!!
...Gu...oh.....
[Gozu-Tennoh crumbles, bursts, his head falls to the ground. Hero ducks out
of the way. The light from Gozu's yellow eyes goes out. You are now outside
the chamber.]
VOICE:
I knew you would be here...
THOR:
Gozu-Tennoh has... No...The Mantra has been utterly destroyed by Nihilo's
attack...The Assembly of Nihilo had a higher goal than just ruling over
Tokyo. We, on the other hand, did nothing more than enforce a reign of
terror....That is the reason we lost. And all those that we called comrades
have deserted us...You had a friend who was being held prisoner here, did
you not? Both of you are free to do whatever you want... I have no business
here anymore. There is no point in guarding an abandoned city...Farewell.
I will go on a quest to realize my dream of a world where the strong thrive.
If you are truly strong, then we shall meet again...
[Thor leaves. You head for the basement of the Mantra Headquarters, and see
Isamu behind a door.]
ISAMU:
...Yo, Hero. It's been a while... I heard about you...even from this cell.
You participated in the attack on Nihilo, huh? ...Did you know that Ms.
Takao is the Maiden? That's what I wanted to tell you when I got caught,
but... Either way, it doesn't look like you brought her back... Damn, even
you couldn't pull through...I was counting on that demonic power of yours...
The Mantra's finished, Nihilo's gaining ground...and we still have no idea
where our teacher is...
ISAMU:
What the hell are we doing, wandering around in this godforsaken world...?
ISAMU:
...I guess I have to place my bets on that guy. I heard a rumor about this
incredible Manikin. They say he can see the future...He actually predicted
the fall of the Mantra. Maybe he can tell us about Ms. Takao...and what we
should do from here. The last thing I heard was that he was taken to prison,
so he's probably still there. I'm gonna head off to Kabukicho and look for
him. There's no place where I can be safe...So, I'll take my chances. Lates.
[A door in the east part of the Headquarters that was previously guarded is
now clear. You go through it, and head toward Kabukicho prison.]
===============================================================================
12. Kabukicho Prison
SOUL:
This is Kabukicho Prison...Huh? This is just a run-down building? You got
that wrong. This is a prison!!  Even though the Mantra fell, there's still
loads of Manikins being held here.
[You check out various rooms, and they are empty. In a few, though, you hear
voices.]
VOICE:
Save us... We're trapped in the mirage...
VOICE:
Mizuchi is holding us captive in his mirage... Someone save us!
EX-GUARD:
Heheheh... Gozu-Tennoh is gone. This prison now belongs to ...
I feel like torturing those ! I think I'll go do
that right now. Heheheh...
EX-GUARD:
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! You better keep it up, or you'll be dead! You want me
to stop? You REALLY want me to stop? ...Well, too bad!
Hyahahahahahahahahahaha!!
VOICE:
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!! Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!!
EX-GUARD:
Hyahahahahahahahahahaha!! Phew!! I think I'll let you off with that for
today. I have , so I can come and go into the mirage as I please...
I'll be back!
EX-GUARD:
Who the hell are you!? Wait, you couldn't be...!?
	 CHOICES
	  1)   You better believe it.
	       ...I-I don't care! This is paradise for us ex-Mantra!
	       Whatever you did during that attacks on Nihilo doesn't
	       mean shit here!!
	  2)   It's just a coincidence.
	       Whaddya think you're doing here then, punk!? This is
	       paradise for us ex-Mantra! I'll give you a taste of my
	       torturing techniques!!
.]
[Everything turns upside down - you are walking on the ceiling. All of the
colors change to black and white. You can now see the Manikins entrapped
there...they appear right side up because they were hung upside down in their
cells. You come across a Manikin who is not chained by his feet.]
DIGGING MANIKIN:
.....Shit! A Mantra demon!?
..........? Nooooooooooooo! My spoon broke! Look what you did! I was almost
done digging, too...It's your fault! I needed that spoon... Take
responsibility! ...I know. How about you getting me another spoon? The
 should be around here somewhere. He has just about
anything. Find him and grab a . You got that? You're responsible!
COLLECTOR MANIKIN:
*cough*
.........?
...I know you!
You're the demon I met in the Great Underpass...
...Huh? A spoon?
.........
...I see.
...Alright, then.
You did help me... with the Bill...
*cough* I'll give you my spoon...
.]
COLLECTOR MANIKIN:
...While you're at it, could you rescue me...?
DIGGING MANIKIN:
Did you bring me the spoon?
CHOICES
	  1)   Yes.
	       Whoa! This is one powerful spoon!
	       The Manikin began digging.
	        The hole was dug instantly.
	       ...This is incredible. I dug the hole in a flash.
	       Alright, I'm outta here. See ya!
	        The Manikin jumped into the hole.
	  2)   No.
	       What the heck!? I was counting on you!! Hurry up and
	       get that spoon from the Collector Manikin!
[You use the Umugi stone and head back to this room to jump in the hole that
was dug by the Manikin. You walk walk for a bit, and hear his voice.]
DIGGING MANIKIN'S VOICE:
...Dammit!!  I was able to escape from my cell...
But I need to defeat Mizuchi to escape from the mirage...
SCREAM:
Argh! Stop it! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
MANIKIN PRISONER:
You there, listen to what I have to say! You see those doors over there?
Mizuchi, the boss of this prison, is in there! Defeat him and save Futomimi,
please!!
MIZUCHI:
DAMN YOU PESTS! YOU THINK YOU CAN BEAT ME? NOT A CHANCE! I'LL TEAR YOU
APART!
.]
[You open the door that was behind Mizuchi, and a Manikin enters from other
room.]
MALE MANIKIN:
............!
.....You're.....
...a human...? No, a demon...? ...I see. You are the 'Demi-fiend' I
prophesied about. Very interesting. Thank you for defeating Mizuchi. Now,
we can finally escape from this prison. My name is . You may know
it already, but I can see into the near future. I've been waiting for you
to come and save us, you who are both human and demon... You may be
interested to know that there is a  trapped in the other room. It
seems he came to see me, but he was also caught. Hm...?
FUTOMIMI:
...I see, he is your friend. You should see him, then. I sense a strange
energy in him. I am worried about the other Manikins, so I must be going.
Thank you again for saving us...Now, if you'll excuse me.
[You go to the other room, and see Isamu standing in front of a blue pillar.
He turns around.]
ISAMU:
Well, look who we have here...Hero.  Don't tell me you came to save me.
You're way too late.
	       CHOICES
	  1)   Talk back.
	       What are you pissed off for?
	       It's not like you went out of your way to help me.
	  2)   Apologize.
	       I don't want your apology. It won't change anything.
	  3)   Leave the room.
	       You're leaving? Sure, go ahead. I didn't expect
	       anything from you anyway.
ISAMU:
It's obvious I can't count on you or Ms. Takao anymore. No one's gonna help
me in this world...I'll have to survive on my own.
ISAMU:
When this world was created... I heard a voice that told me to search for
the truth. At the time, I didn't know what that meant... But, when I was
locked up in this room, I came to realize. Truth isn't something other
people can give you: you have to find it within yourself.
ISAMU:
And I opened the way without anybody's help. The Amala Network... What I'm
looking for is in there. The great power that'll lead me to the truth...
It's calling me...
-
FUTOMIMI:
I have come again to thank you once more...We Manikins plan to leave the
area. Together, we will find a way to live without suffering...Let me
prophesy your future as a token of my gratitude.
FUTOMIMI:
...A man... at Ginza...
...It seems that there is a man waiting for you at Ginza. Go and see him...
We must get going now. Again, thank you so much...Now, if you'll excuse us.
HIJIRI:
...Hey, Hero! Looks like you're doing alright. How did you know I was here?
I heard what Hikawa did. I didn't think he would wipe out the Mantra
completely. Man, that Nightmare System... It's more powerful than I ever
imagined. But, I haven't given up just yet. If he makes a move, it may give
us some clues. Maybe we can figure out where the Nightmare System is located,
or more about the Maiden...It's too bad this terminal is under Nihilo's
control. I can't do much digging without raising a red flag. We need to find
a terminal that Nihilo doesn't know about... Remember those Manikins that
were enslaved by the Mantra? I heard they're rebuilding the town of
. Maybe there's a terminal over there that Nihilo's unaware of.
With the Mantra out of the way, you should be able to get to Asakusa. It's
way too dangerous for me to come along, though. I'll see what I can do with
this terminal...Wait a minute. I completely forgot about you. Hey, do you
feel like going to Asakusa? If you can get there and contact me through the
Amala Network, it'll make my job much easier. I'm sure you're strong enough
to make it to Asakusa. So... will you do it for me?
	    CHOICES
	  1)   Okay.
	       Thanks, I appreciate it. I'll tell you everything I
	       find out there, so let's stay in touch, alright?
	  2)   I'd rather not.
	       Oh, come on. You're not gonna let Nihilo have things
	       their way, are you? I'll tell you everything I find out
	       there...about Nihilo and the Maiden. Most importantly,
	       we have to stop Hikawa. So, you're going. Case closed.
HIJIRI:
I'll be waiting, then. You should check out the tunnel in .
If the rumor is true, it'll take you to Asakusa. I'll be working on this
terminal, but you'll probably have more luck than me. I'm counting on ya.
===============================================================================
13. Ikebukuro Tunnel
[You must fight four Oni in the Tunnel. Once you beat the first three (in
no particular order), you must fight the fourth.]
KIN-KI:
...........
...WHAT DO YOU WANT? I AM KIN-KI. YOU FILTHY DOG...
> Kin-ki is not listening. What will you do?

.
You leave the Tunnel and come out in Kuramae Station. You head from there to
Asakusa.]
===============================================================================
14. Asakusa
MALE MANIKIN:
Welcome to Asakusa, the city of the Manikins...Ah, it has such a sweet ring
to it.
HIJIRI:
Hey Hero, you made it. Sorry if I pressured you too much, but I managed to
get here after all. It took a while, but I was finally able to pinpoint the
route to this terminal. Not bad for an ordinary human, eh?  Oh yeah, I found
out something interesting about Asakusa. This is where the Manikins are
created. They're made from the black mud that's scooped up from a river
around here. No wonder they want to rebuild this town...Anyways, like I
suspected, the terminal here isn't under Nihilo's surveillance. It's perfect
for monitoring their activities and finding out about the Nightmare System.
I just started investigating, so I need some time. It shouldn't take too
long, though. Why don't you go look around for a while?
[You look around Asakusa. You approach the door to Mifunashiro, and
Futomimi appears.]
FUTOMIMI:
...Hello, and welcome. Just as I foresaw, you have come to Asakusa. We are
fated to meet again...Although, that is all I can say at this point. Have
you looked around Asakusa? Everyone is doing their best to restore the city.
This is the first city we Manikins have ever considered as our own, after
all. However...Though you may 'see' our land, you may not 'enter' it any
further. This is the holy land of the Manikins, . Beyond here
is our motherland, where we were born... Even if we owe you our lives, I
cannot allow you past here. I'm truly sorry... Now, I must return to my
meditations. I have to foresee our new future. I need to find out what I
need to do to create a world where Manikins can live in peace.
..........
...Oh, yes. Beware of a Manikin named . He's a traitor to our
cause, having committed various atrocities. He's probably hiding out
somewhere in Asakusa... He might cause you some trouble, but please
understand that he is not one of us.
..........
Now, I must be going...
MALE? MANIKIN:
Those days when I used to be tortured by the Mantra...
Oh, it felt sooooo good!
SOUL:
I heard there was a human girl hanging around the Mantra's headquarters
when they fell. She must have some guts.
FEMALE MANIKIN:
We're working hard to restore the city, but there's a bad Manikin that's
ruining our peace. He's ruthless, tearing off the skins of other Manikins.
He might be around here, so be careful!
[You further investigate, and after going through west gate, you enter a
place that has blood all over floor.]
MALE MANIKIN: 
Uh... Ugh.....
It's Sa......
Th-That traitor, Sakahagi is going wild... up ahead...
[You enter and see a Manikin covered in what appears to be a sweater made
from the skin of human faces, crouched over the body of another Manikin.
There is a knife in his hand.]
STRANGE MANIKIN:
You should've just handed over your Magatsuhi... But instead, you decided to
oppose me...That was too funny. Well, I'm not complaining. Now, I have this
new skin to add to my collection...
...!!
STRANGE MANIKIN:
Who's there!? Damn, you had me scared for a second... I thought those
Manikins were back. They're pretty weak, all of them except this one guy
that escaped from the Mantra... He's been giving me a headache recently.
It would've made my life a lot easier if he'd been killed in Ikebukuro. I
should thank him, though, for bringing his followers here. It's like free
Magatsuhi. I've been collecting Magatsuhi... Eventually, I'll have enough
power to dominate all demons. You're a demon: you know how it is.
You're thirsty for some Magatsuhi yourself, aren't ya?
	    CHOICES
	  1)   Yeah, I am.
	       That's what I thought.
	       Hey, I think you and I will get along just fine.
	  2)   Not really.
	       You don't want Magatsuhi?  ...You're one weird demon.
STRANGE MANIKIN:
...Well, it's time for me to go. Maybe we'll meet again, maybe not. We'll
see. Just remember... I'm Sakahagi, the future ruler of the demons...
HIJIRI:
Hey, good timing. How was Asakusa? About the Nightmare System...I've got
good news. They say a picture is worth a thousand words...so here, take a
look.
[The pillar spins. You see a tall tower absorbing a large amount of
Magatsuhi.]
HIJIRI:
You see it? That's the  in Chiyoda. The Nightmare System's inside
it, along with all the Magatsuhi that's been collected. In other words,
we've found Nihilo's current headquarters...The system is probably being
operated by that woman they call the Maiden. I have no idea how it works,
but we know it's dangerous.
HIJIRI:
If I could, I'd go in there myself, but I'm just not strong enough. However,
if no one does anything, Hikawa will take over the world for sure. I'm
afraid I have to ask for your help again, Hero. You must stop the Nightmare
System inside the Obelisk, and return the flow of Magatsuhi in the Vortex
World back to normal. Use [the secondary entrance to Nihilo's old
headquarters] to reach the Obelisk. That entrance is locked right now, but
I can take care of it. With this terminal, it'll be a piece of cake. The
Obelisk looks pretty tall, and who knows that kind of demons are gonna be
there. We don't know what kind of power this so-called Maiden has, either.
It's not gonna be easy, that's for sure... But, I know you can do it.
[You transfer to Ginza, then head for the secondary entrance of the Assembly
of Nihilo. You arrive at the Obelisk.]
===============================================================================
15. The Obelisk
SOUL:
This is the Obelisk.
This is the closest you'll ever get to Kagutsuchi, in all of Tokyo.
SOUL:
The Maiden is at the top floor. She is collecting Magatsuhi with her
powers...
[Three women appear.
COLD-SOUNDING WOMAN:
Hahahahaha... Just as Lord Hikawa predicted...
It seems a rat has wandered in!
ARROGANT-SOUNDING WOMAN:
Ohohoho... I assume you are here for that woman, but we three sisters are
guarding the Obelisk... We are not like that useless Ose.
CRUEL-SOUNDING WOMAN:
Ahaha... If you want her back, you must defeat us. Well, if you can get to
us in the first place.
COLD-SOUNDING WOMAN:
Kagutsuchi repeats the process of birth and death. It will not wait for you.
Now... Come!
WOMEN:
Ahaha...
Hahahahahaha...
Ohohoho...
[You make your way through the Obelisk, and will eventually complete a
puzzle during which you must fight three boss battles in a row.]
COLD-LOOKING WOMAN:
Hahahahaha... So, have you figured out how the puzzle works? I am Clotho,
the youngest of the Moirae Sisters. I shall wind the thread of your life!
ARROGANT-LOOKING WOMAN:
Ohohoho.. I will not allow you past here. I am Lachesis, the second of the
Moirae Sisters. I measure the length of life.
Your thread is reaching its end!
CRUEL-LOOKING WOMAN:
Ahaha... Were you able to keep up with Kagutsuchi? I am Atropos, the eldest
of the Moirae Sisters. How unlucky of you to meet me. I cut the threads of
fate... In other words... Your fate is already sealed!
[You travel a bit further, and eventually you must fight all of them once
more.]
CLOTHO:
Hahahahaha...! We aren't letting you pass that easily!
LACHESIS:
Do not underestimate us!
ATROPOS:
We three Moirae Sisters will...
CLOTHO:
Spin!
LACHESIS:
Measure!
ATROPOS:
And snip your fate!!
.]
[You choose to ascend, and in the center of room you see Ms. Takao hovering
upside-down, Magatsuhi flowing through her body into a black pyramid. You
reach out your hand and it all stops. The screen cuts to Ms. Takao on the
floor, with you crouched in front of her.]
YUKO:
...Thank you, Hero. I don't know why, but I had a feeling that you'd come
and save me. It's funny... I told you that I'd be your strength, and you
ended up helping me instead. I have no power whatsoever. How can I control
the world, when I can't even take control of my own life...? As the Maiden,
I just do Hikawa's bidding. 'I would like you to become the pillar of the
new world.' That's what he told me. In the end, I was nothing but a tool for
collecting Magatsuhi... It's true that the Conception did take place, and I
assisted in making it happen. The world is about to be reborn, but as it
stands now, the new world is going to be a far cry from what I had hoped for.
I dreamed of an ideal world where people were grateful to be alive...
...I didn't like how the world was before. People said they wanted peace,
but they continued to act selfishly, accepting no personal responsibility
for the world's problems. Nobody realized it, but they were not really happy.
They were simply lazy. No one had the desire to compete or become strong.
And there was no need to, either. That's why I thought...that we'd eventually
lose our power and fade away. No wonder I was used by Hikawa...But, it's
not over yet.
YUKO:
The world is still being recreated... Its shape is not yet fixed. It was
here that I discovered my god, a god that even Hikawa is unaware of...
She was drawn here by the power of Magatsuhi. She will surely teach me the
Reason for creation...
[Yuko closes her eyes. When she next turns around to face you, her face is
covered with a splatter of purple. She sways to and fro, occasionally
convulsing. She is obviously possessed.]
UNKNOWN GOD:
Fool who bears the name Freedom... Under the light of liberty, your wrongs
shall be forgiven. I am . I have come from the far reaches of Amala.
ARADIA:
It is my duty to bestow freedom. Ask, and you shall be set free. If you deem
yourself right, light will return to the world, but so will darkness. Pursue
the way of creation! You yourself are a world too.
Do not obey others: do
what you believe is right.
ARADIA:
This woman will soon recover her lost power. She will set forth on the path
of creation, and I will guide her. Go, and see the world with your own eyes.
From there will your creation begin...
[Her body begins to levitate, and disappears in a black cloud. Suddently, the
old woman and blond child appear.]
OLD WOMAN:
Oh dear, Aradia has entered this world. This can only mean trouble,
my little master.
OLD WOMAN:
Be very thankful. My little master has given me permission to enlighten you.
Listen closely to what I am about to tell you. The time of creation for this
Vortex World is near. War will erupt amongst those who spread their Reason
in hopes of shaping the new world. As a demon, you are forbidden to conceive
your own Reason... Which Reason will you side with? Which will you oppose?
Will the Reason you choose persevere, or fail? Your suffering is my little
master's delight. Struggle as hard as you can; You are free to follow
whichever Reason you like. My only wish is that you do not disappoint my
little master with a dull ending...
HIJIRI:
Hero! You did it! I could tell from here that the flow of Magatsuhi had
returned to normal. Well, with this blow to Nihilo, Hikawa won't be able to
make his move for a while. I think we can take a little breather. But, how
did you stop the Nightmare System? Wasn't that Maiden operating it?
	   CHOICES
	  1)   I saved her.
	       So, Hikawa was using her, huh? Who knows what she'll
	       do now, but at least the Nightmare System is dead.
	  2)   I took care of her.
	       I see... She might have been one of the few surviving
	       humans, but I guess you had no choice...
	  3)   I don't want to talk about it.
	       Oh, you're not gonna tell me? ...Does it bother you
	       that much? If so, then I'll stop asking. I'm satisfied
	       knowing that the Nightmare System is out of commission.
HIJIRI:
Oh yeah, it might seem like I'm making you do all the work, but...
...I'm doing what I can. Let me share with you what I've found out so far,
okay?
	 CHOICES
	  1)   Sure.
	       Alright, listen up.
	  2)   No thanks.
	       Come on, man. Journalism is pointless without an
	       audience. I don't care if you're interested or not,
	       just listen.
HIJIRI:
To create a new world, you must have a strong idea of what kind of world you
want to create. This idea is commonly referred to as a Reason. Now, to
acquire a Reason, you must receive divine protection from a god, and this
is where the Magatsuhi comes into play. You need a large quantity of
Magatsuhi in order to summon a god. That's why Hikawa, a human, was
collecting Magatsuhi. Oh, I almost forgot. I met a human inside the Amala
Network just a minute ago. It was a guy who was held captive by the Mantra.
His name's Isamu. Do you know him?
	    CHOICES
	  1)   Yes, I know him.
	       Yeah, that's what I thought.
	  2)   No, I don't.
Really? There was a rumor that you were trying to help
	       him, but... Oh well.
HIJIRI:
Anyways, about Isamu... He actually seemed to be doing okay in Amala. If
you're unlucky, you can get swept away somewhere, or even worse, you can
end up being absorbed by the Network. Well, in a world like this... one life
doesn't amount to much, and you're better off not getting involved. But if
you want, I can send you to where I met Isamu.
HIJIRI:
Do you want me to transfer you to where Isamu is?
	   CHOICES
	  1)   Yeah, can you?
	       Here we go. By the way, tell Isamu not to spend too
	       much time in there.
	       --He transfers you to Amala Network.--
	  2)   Not right now.
	       Just let me know when you're ready.
	  3)   Tell me again how creation works.
	       It was a little confusing, wasn't it? No big deal.
	       --He repeats the explanation from above.--
	       ...Well, there you go.
