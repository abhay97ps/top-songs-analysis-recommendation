Really gon' make me
Expose you for exactly what you are, you are
And I'm feeling a little wavy
So right now I don't mind pulling your card
And as hard as you try
To hide reality, why
We know the truth
But what would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
So what you blowing up just a little
They knowing you a little
Don't give a finger in the middle
Cause little nigga you will never be without me
Where would you be without me?
So what you blowing up just a little
They knowing you a little
Don't give a finger in the middle
Cause little nigga you will never be
Oh na na, oh na
Oh na na, oh na
Oh na na, oh na
Oh na na, oh na
You tell 'em that you make big moves
But tell 'em what you really do
Do you really wanna play this game
You should tell 'em what you really like
Tell 'em you ain't 'bout that life
I've put you on, I let you shine
Now you so fly... shit blows my mind 
And as hard as you try
To hide reality, why
We know the truth
But what would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
So what you blowing up just a little
They knowing you a little
Don't give a finger in the middle
Cause little nigga you will never be without me
Where would you be without me?
So what you blowing up just a little
They knowing you a little
Don't give a finger in the middle
Cause little nigga you will never be
Boy you think I'm stupid?
What you think I'm clueless?
You keep chasing them girls
Boy you get the deuces
I'm sick of your excuses
Without me how can you do it?
Do bad all by myself
Nigga yo dick useless
Dude I don't need your sex 
I'm moving to the next 
You frontin' man, you stuntin' man
You're worser than my ex 
You think that shit funny?
We know the truth boy, keep it one hundred
And as hard as you try
To hide reality, why
We know the truth
But what would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
So what you blowing up just a little
They knowing you a little
Don't give a finger in the middle
Cause little nigga you will never be without me
Where would you be without me?
So what you blowing up just a little
They knowing you a little
Don't give a finger in the middle
Cause little nigga you will never be
Oh na na, oh na
Oh na na, oh na
Oh na na, oh na
Oh na na, oh na
