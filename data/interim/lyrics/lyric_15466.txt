Hello, my friend, it sure has been a while
I don't know where the time has gone
But I've really missed your smile
It's been too long
I've got so much to say
That I don't know where to start
Ever since we went our separate ways
There's been a big hole in my heart
 as I recall, It was you who said goodbye
Now you're asking me to give it one more try
Well only time will tell
If you're gonnastand beside me
Through both Heaven and Hell
I wanna know that you're behind me
But only time will tell
If what we have together's
Gonna' last forever more
And so my friend, I hope you understand
It's hard to put my trust in you
'Cause I'm afraid you'll leave again
I want to believe you've finally seen the light
That you've missed my love and you want to make it right
Chorus:
But only time will tell
If you're gonnastand beside me
Through both Heaven and Hell
I wanna know that you're behind me
But only time will tell
If what we have together's
Gonna' last forever more
I got no way of knowing
What the future's gonna bring
So I'll just listen to my heart
'Cause it's never lied to me
And what is meant to be
Only time will tell
If you're gonnastand beside me
Through both Heaven and Hell
I wanna know that you're behind me
But only time will tell
If what we have together's
Gonna' last forever
Time will tell
Do you believe in me?
Time will tell
If we're gonna be together
Only time will
I want a love to last forever
Time will tell
Only time will tell
