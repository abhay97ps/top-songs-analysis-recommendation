I think I'm going to Katmandu
That's really, really where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do
K-k-k-k-k-k-Katmandu
I think it's really where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
I'm going to Katmandu
I got no kick against the west coast
Warner Brothers are such good hosts
I raise my whiskey glass and give 'em a toast
I'm sure they know it's true
I got no rap against the southern states
Every time I been there it's been great
But now I'm leaving and I can't be late
And to myself be true
That's why I'm going to Katmandu
Up to the mountains where I'm going to
Hey, if I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do
Whoa, Katmandu
Really, really where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
I'm going to Kathmandu
I got no quarrel with the Midwest
The folks out there have given me their best
I've lived there all my life, I've been their guest
I sure have loved it, too
I'm tired of looking at the TV news
I'm tired of driving hard and paying dues
I figure, baby, I got nothing to lose
I'm tired of being blue
Oh, that's why I'm going to Katmandu
Up to the mountains where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do
K-k-k-k-k-k-Katmandu
Take me baby, cause I'm going with you
If I ever get out of here
I'm going to Katmandu
{Bridge}
I ain't got nothin' 'gainst the east coast
You want some people, well they got the most
And New York City's like a friendly ghost
You seem to pass right through
I know I'm gonna miss the USA
I guess I'll miss it every single day
But no one loves me here any way
I know my plane is due
The one that's going to Katmandu
Up to the mountains where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do
K-k-k-k-k-k-Katmandu
Really, really, really going  to
If I ever get out of here
If I ever get out of here
If I ever get out of here
I'm goin' to Katmandu
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Yeah
{Outro}
