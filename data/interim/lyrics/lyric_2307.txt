After school is over, we can have some fun
Bring the boys, and baby, I want you to come
All my girlfriends are gonna be there
 Let me tell you where
442 Glenwood Avenue
442 Glenwood Avenue
Come along, come on, just tap twice on the door
442 Glenwood Avenue
Goofy Eddie's gonna bring his ukulele
Groovy Freddy's going to dance all night with Sherry
I can't wait 'til I see you there
 Let me tell you again, the number's
442 Glenwood Avenue
442 Glenwood Avenue
Come along, come on, just tap twice on the door
442 Glenwood Avenue
 We'll turn the lights down lower
 We'll dance a little slower
 And when the party's over
You'll walk me home, now let me hang up the phone
But don't forget the number's
442 Glenwood Avenue
442 Glenwood Avenue
Come along, come on, just tap twice on the door
442 Glenwood Avenue
But don't forget the number's
442 Glenwood Avenue
442 Glenwood Avenue
442 Glenwood Avenue
442 Glenwood Avenue
