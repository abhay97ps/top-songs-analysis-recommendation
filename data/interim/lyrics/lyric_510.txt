They call her hardhearted Hannah
The vamp of savannah
The meanest girl in town
Leather is tough
But Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a girl who likes to see men suffer
To tease them and thrill them
To torture and kill them
Is her delight they say
I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was hannah pouring water on a drowning man
That's hardhearted hannah, the vamp of savannah g-a
Talk about your cold refrigerating mammas
Brother she's a polar bears pajamas
To tease them and thrill them
To torture and kill them
Is her delight they say
An evening spent with hannah sitting on your knees
Is like being in alaska in your b.v.d.'s
That's hard hearted hannah, the vamp of savannah g-a
