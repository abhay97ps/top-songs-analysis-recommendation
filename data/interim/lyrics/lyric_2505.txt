Givin up is hard to do
When you really love someone
Givin up is hard to do
When you still depend upon
His warm and tender touch
His kiss and his caress
That used to mean so much
And bring you happiness
 Oh, Lord, is hard to do
I try, but its just no use
 Whoa, Lord, its hard to do
I tried, but I kept recluse
The light of hope burns dim
But in my heart I pray
My love, my love, my love and faith in him
Will bring him back someday
But its just no use
No, I can't break loose
Whether he knows or not
He really needs me too
Oh, Lord,1 oh, Lord, oh, Lord, hes all Ive got
And giving up
Is so hard to do 
Oh, yes, it is 
Is so hard to do 
Oh, yes, it is 
I just can't break loose 
No, no, no 
I just can't break loose 
No, no, no, no , hey, hey, hey
