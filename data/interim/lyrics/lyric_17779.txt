Do you wanna ride
Wassup baby?
You wanna get freaky?
Oh, wanna get freaky
That's right
I'll pick you up at about 5:30
Take you to my house, we can get dirty
See I ain't got no shame in my game
Get you on the bed, make you scream my name
Girl don't you hold back
Cause my lovin' is all that
See baby, I can do it like this
Side to side, up and down
Round and round, pound for pound
Say it
Do you wanna ride
Do you wanna get freaky
Baby, let me come inside
We can both get nasty
Do you wanna ride
Do you wanna get freaky
Baby, let me come inside
We can both get nasty
Kissin' on your lips and baby kissin' on your thighs
See, I'm the nigga from Tennessee and baby that's my thing
Oh what I wanna do to you
Get next to you, wanna rub you
Do all the things your man won't do
Straight half bangin' boogie
All night long baby
Break it out till early dawn
Baby wanna hear you moan
Hurry up take it off
So I can come inside, yeah, yeah
I can tell that you wanna get with me
Do ya, do ya, do ya
Do you wanna ride
Do you wanna get freaky
Baby, let me come inside
We can both get nasty
Do you wanna ride
Do you wanna get freaky
Baby, let me come inside
We can both get nasty
We can go, oh girl
Up and down, baby
Round and round
Pound for pound
All night long
We can go
I'll take you there with me
Together baby we will see
I'll be with you
All night long
Do you wanna ride
Do you wanna get freaky
Baby, let me come inside
We can both get nasty
Do you wanna ride
Do you wanna get freaky
Baby, let me come inside
We can both get nasty
