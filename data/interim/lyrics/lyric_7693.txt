Walk on water, ain't it like her
She leads the children
Ain't it right, ain't it right, ain't it right
And ain't it wond'rous
The way she does it
Gives love and loves it
Ain't it right, ain't it right, ain't it right
Light de light, we got mornin'
Mornin' makes another day
Glory sight, got de dawnin'
Lordy, light the night away
Light de light, we got de mornin'
Mornin' makes another day
Glory sight, got de dawnin'
Lordy, light the night away
Light de light, we got mornin'
Mornin' makes another day
Glory sight, got de dawnin'
Lordy, light the night away
She walks on water
Ah, ain't it like her
She leads the children
Ain't it right, ain't it right, ain't it right
