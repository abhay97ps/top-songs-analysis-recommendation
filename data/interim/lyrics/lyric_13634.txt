You don't have to cry-cry-cry-cry...alone
‘Cause I'll be right by your side to help you be strong
Baby, dry your eyes
Please be strong
I can pull you through these times and help you hold on
I've been on standby
Waiting for your call
I'll catch any teardrop
Before one can fall
I'll never deceive you
The way others did
I've got what you need, girl
And so much to give
You don't have to cry-cry-cry-cry  alone
I'll be right by your side, you've found a new home
Baby, dry your eyes
Please, you've got to be strong
Just hold, hold on
There's someone here now
Who cares about your needs
We'll make it somehow
‘Cause I'll share your grief
I'm just here to fill you
With some good love and bad times
I'm yours when you need me
Keep me close, I'll keep you warm all the time
You don't have to cry
Ooh...I'll be right by your side to help you be strong
Baby, dry your eyes
Hold on
‘Cause I can pull you through these times and help you be strong, yeah
You don't have to cry
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
You can be strong if you just hold on
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
You can be strong if you just hold on
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
You can be strong if you just hold on
Dry your eyes, please don't cry...
You don't have to cry...alone
I'll pull you through these times and help you hold on
Baby, dry your eyes
Be strong
‘I can pull you through these times and help you hold on
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
You can be strong if you just hold on
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
You can be strong if you just hold on
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
You can be strong if you just hold on
Dry your eyes, please don't cry
