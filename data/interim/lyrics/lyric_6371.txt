Abundance and wealth
Prosperous lethargy
Faith is fragile
It stays in its infancy
Provision is expected
With no stretch of circumstances
My weapon of choice is to ignore your voice
Scorch the earth
Orphaned and desolate
Lack is consuming all
Laceration
In progression
Maimed and broken
Other lives unspoken
Contrast with my everything
When I have it all
I don't need anything
I took all in the fall
I don't need love
I don't need peace
Only the hypnosis of
I don't need love
I don't need peace
Just an affluent fleece
Abundance and wealth
And the internal strife
Abundance and wealth
And the insipid life
This bitter pill is no easy kill
I am fine, look what I possess
That is my self worth
Is it meaningless?
I exchange the truth for a lie
Every day I live
That is my self worth
Is it meaningless?
Out of sight and out of mind
Languishing in another kind
Who is to say we should pray?
The death of all humanity
Null and void with no action
The thing provides my satisfaction
A bill of goods has been sol
The American dream takes its toll
Insipid life of nothing
Humanistic tendency
Insipid life of nothing
This is my American dream
