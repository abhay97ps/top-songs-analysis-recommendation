I've got to have my piece of heaven some day soon
Or else I'm gonna die
Girl I don't tell no lie
I knew I found an angel
When I first met you
And baby that is why
I got to have my way
Cause I'm loving you baby
I'm not a fool to be played around with
I've got a heart and it's going down with loving you baby
Loving you baby
Say that you're lovin me too
My need is strong and it will get stronger
Come on and tell me can't wait much longer
I'm loving you baby
Loving you baby
Say that you're lovin me too
I've had my share of being pulled down by the wall
Oh but you care for me
I've been through it all before
So it can be so hard for you to understand why I feel so good with you
And somehow I gotta be sure
Cause I'm loving you baby
I'm not a fool to be played around with
I've got a heart and it's going down with loving you baby
Loving you baby
Say that you're lovin me too
My need is strong and it will get stronger
Come on and tell me can't wait much longer
I'm loving you baby
Loving you baby
Say that you're lovin me too
At last I'm there to get it
What I've never had
Just wanting you to assure me
That there is no one before me
I'm not a fool to be played around with
I've got a heart and it's going down with loving you baby
Loving you baby
Say that you're lovin me too
My need is strong and it will get stronger
Come on and tell me can't wait much longer
I'm loving you baby
Loving you baby
Say that you're lovin me too
