CHORUS
"Pineapple princess", he calls me pineapple princess all day
As he plays his ukulele on the hill above the bay
"Pineapple princess, I love you, you're the sweetest girl I've
Seen"
"Some day we're gonna marry and you'll be my pineapple queen"
I saw a boy on Oahu isle
Floatin' down the bay on a crocodile
He waved at me and he swam ashore
And I knew he'd be mine forevermore
CHORUS
He sings his song from banana trees
He even sings to me on his water skis
We went skin-divin' and beneath the blue
He sang and played his ukulele, too
"Pineapple princess", I love you, you're the sweetest girl I've
Seen
"Some day we're gonna marry and you'll be my pineapple queen"
We'll settle down in a bamboo hut
And he will be my own little coconut
Then we'll be beachcombin' royalty
On wicky-wicky wacky Waikiki
CHORUS
