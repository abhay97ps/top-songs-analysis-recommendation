It's getting late in the evening, it's time now for dreaming
A candle is burning and tables are burning, yeah
The shadows of darkness will fade in the pale moonlight
And when we get together as one it will be alright
Don't talk of destiny, don't tell me, whatever will be will be
'Cause you're gonna see, we'll be raising Heaven in Hell tonight
Fill the shadows with tender might
Raising Heaven in Hell tonight, in midnight's dream
We'll be raising Heaven in Hell tonight
Love, thunder and dynamite
Take my hand and hold on tight in midnight's dream
We'll see the joker, the juggler, the sailor, the refugees
We'll hear the rich man, the poor man, the beggar down on his knees
We'll see the hungry, the stranded, the poor empty handed ones
And I'll hold you in my arms forever 'til kingdom comes
Don't talk of destiny, don't tell me, whatever will be will be
'Cause you're gonna see, we'll be raising Heaven in Hell tonight
Fill the shadows with tender might
Raising Heaven in Hell tonight, in midnight's dream
We'll be raising Heaven in Hell tonight
Love, thunder and dynamite
Take my hand and hold on tight in midnight's dream
As the years roll by and the memories fly
And the sun goes down tonight
I will take your hand, we will make our stand
Tonight, tonight, tonight
We'll be raising Heaven in Hell tonight
Fill the shadows with tender might
Raising Heaven in Hell tonight, in midnight's dream
We'll be raising Heaven in Hell tonight
Love, thunder and dynamite
Take my hand and hold on tight, in midnight's dream
We'll be raising Heaven in Hell tonight
Fill the shadows with tender might
Raising Heaven in Hell tonight, in midnight's dream
We'll be raising Heaven in Hell tonight
Love, thunder and dynamite
Take my hand and hold on tight, in midnight's dream
