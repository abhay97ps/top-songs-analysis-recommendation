All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put our two hearts together again
We sat on a wall of happiness
We sat on a wall of love
We sat on a wall of security so high above
With his arms all around me
It was like a fairy tale
Two people so in love
Tell me how could it fail
The walls started shakin' her love right out
Happiness is given away, security is fallin' down
He fell, I fell, all there is left to tell
Is all the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put our two hearts together again
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put our two hearts together again
Walls started shakin', I heard love crying out
Happiness is given away, security is tumbling down
He fell, I fell
And all there is left to tell
Is all the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put our two hearts together again
Couldn't put our two hearts together again
Couldn't put our two hearts together again
Couldn't put our two hearts together again
