Sweet lover, I'm confessin' that I love you
Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you, honest I do
Every single moment
In your eyes, I read such strange things
But your lips deny they're true
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue 
I'm afraid someday you'll leave me
Saying "Can we still be friends?"
If you go you know you'll grieve me
All our love on you depends, sweet lover
Am I guessin' that you lovе me
Dreaming dreams of you in vain?
I'm confеssin' that I love you
Over again 
I'm confessin' that I love you
Dreamin' dreams of you in vain
I'm confessin' that I love you
Over again 
I'm afraid someday you'll leave me
Saying "Can we still be friends?"
If you go you know you'll grieve me
All our love on you depends, sweet lover
Am I guessin' that you love me
Dreamin' dreams of you in vain?
I'm confessin' that I love you
Over again 
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again
Mmm-sweet, sweet lover
Mmm-sweet, sweet lover
Mmm-sweet, sweet lover
Mmm-sweet, sweet lover
