Here it go
Well, I won 2 dollars on a scratch-off ticket
So I went back to the counter and I bought 2 more with it
And I won 10 bucks and that was just right
So, I bought a six pack and a, a bag of ice
You know even if our ship came in and this is all we got
It ain’t like we really need a million dollar yacht cause
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We’re laughing all the way to the river bank
Still, can you imagine if we ever struck it
I’d go shoot tequila, take a lime and suck it
And we’d tell our bosses they can do the same
We’ll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing
We’d sail around the world and go to shore in a dingy
But till that dream comes true why don’t you grab your bikini cause
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We’re laughing all the way to the river bank
However it goes 
We’ve got it made 
Cause baby we can float 
We can ride away
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
And it's a beautiful day
We’re laughing all the way, to the river bank
