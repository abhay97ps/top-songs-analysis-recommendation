Holla, holla, hollaaaaa
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa
Maybe It's me, maybe I bore you
No, no it's my fault cause I can't afford you
Maybe Baby, Puffy, or Jay Z
Would all be better for you
Cause all I could do was love you
Baby when I used to love you
There's nuttin that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa 
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa 
Maybe I should rob somebody
So we could live like
Whitney and Bobby
It's probably my fault
My bad, My loss
You are above cost
All I could do was love you
Baby when I used to love you
There's nuttin that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa 
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa 
Oh! I used to 
Love you 
Oh! But I don't - not you
