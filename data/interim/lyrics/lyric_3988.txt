Witness my rhyming patterns metamorphosize
As my third eyes sees this obligation
Whenever I'm meditating in forbidden fortresses
I see visions and signs of myself spewing evil tunes through ferocity
Plus I'm fuming from within due to meditative informations
That's conceived by insane concentration
I shall morph into an immortal existence
Till you can't withstand this rhymes resistance
Still forming lyrics out of abundance see
With such poetic redundancy
From within this self explanatory
And mostly it's from my own shadowy category
Therefore allow me to grow n glow beyond this threshold
I'm at the amidst of this century's folklore
Due to forbidden words foretold
Yet seemly unknown to adjust at some
So triumph as i'll locomote in persistent distance
Just to harness a hens carcass
And then go somethin like this
Gulp gulp gulp bloody chickens intestines
I'm spitting metaphysical raps
As I'm stepping in this abysmal mess
A catfish esophagus spilled on wax
As anything can happen in present tenses
Expressing myself in nocturne chasms
And holding a torch scorching innards of disgorged carnivorous
Sophistical speaking to broken dolls
There's a slim chance to deform in grotesque forms
I'm in my own zone i'm forming words
Establishments come from within this eerie cassettes
Fetal meat sold in local streets
Like promoting vocals n beats
Crazy rumors running across the streets
These words are the lines of my palm crease
So called rhyme schemes given life unto my roots like palm trees
They say you need work hard to accomplish something
Well I guess that's true
But believe me when I say you don't know what the fuck I've been through
It ain't east to form these rhymes
Toting lines bloody broken spines
Awkward lookin vines n minds
Syndicate signs of premise
Like books written in translated languages
Your babies being imported
And that means they're about to be aborted
Its official my rhymes self beneficial
That's keeping me in control like meditative initials
But my intentions go way more deeper then this
I'm part of several different legions sparkin from within that is
My emotions severed tryin so hard to keep it legitimate
Fore ill crush yo bones and leave yo spinal chords beyond disfigurement
Cause Out Psychos ain't to be fucked with
And i swear to hell one day imma take a hiatus revenge bitch
Terribly dismember all of you fucks so keep on laughing at me
Mark my words like me leaving your asses attached permanently
And laugh horrifically as you're suffering in such agony
Yeah karma's a bitch and its about time show it's deficiency
See me evolving through life metaphorically
And i'm forever being an entity invoking positivity till i'll reach immortality
Till i truly deserve to be leveling up in all pranas stylistically
So keep on laughing at me but i'm definitely certain
You'd be groaning agonizingly
Sooner or later like you taken it all up the ass anally
Till it's lookin so reflexive you'd think you got raped by all sorts of zoology
Cause i'm so ferocious lyrically
It's antagonistically anti humanity
Its satanically horrifying seeing me drilling baby's body parts
Just to eat a ton of em for leftovers and use some for snuff films and arts
And plus ive got two middle fingers up
Spitting immunity through emotional exhibitions
And my ammunition's to spit this
Like x rated exhibitions witnessed through an x-rays terrific vision
Beyond parallel incisions
My pledged legions of alliances
Is prestigious enough to plagiarist
Unparalleled prolific jurassic mess
Inferno scorching infernal in fermium dermal
My shits so obscure and unknown
Like some wishbone attached to fish stones
My ammunition's maniacal by definition
Gravitation of this rap shits
I'm beyond eternal exhibition
Rhymes i form in this silicosis
Definite telepathic hypnosis through evil telephonic typhoon polytechnics
And you haven't yet felt the full effect of me effectively
Fuckin wit me till you get a taste of my social deficiency once again see
But the rest is history verbally
Trying to mimic me with this gimmicky
Till you grasping for air immediately
I'm a maniac who laughs as your baby burns horrifically horribly
In such terrifying terrifications
Watch my ass flex as i'll dance to your agonizing involuntarily spasms
I'm a legion that's unknown, reigning from within
Evil rhymes i spit as i'll fuckin sin
Still digesting fetal skins
Inflicting your baby's beating heart till it's inflammation internally
Cutting off a baby's tongues like a vehement addiction
Screeching sounds of tortured screams and agony
Its complicated for me to stay dedicated
Rhymes that's nominated and sometimes mutilated
At the same time overly obligated
To form some words like nuisance
Energetic pedestals mixed with phantasmal fumings
And then just function adjust gravitation in conjunction
My introduction radiation
Blood spoiled malfunction
Radio active seduction
Strange eerie and vile abomination
Living abortions thats dormant in a cassette tapes distortion
Abnormal Auditory
