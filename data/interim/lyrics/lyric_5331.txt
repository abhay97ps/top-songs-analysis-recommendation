Let's go down by the grapevine
Drink my daddy's wine, get happy
Down by the grapevine
Drink my daddy's wine, get happy
Happy, oh, sweet blindness
A little magic
A little kindness
Oh, sweet blindness
All over me
Four leaves on a clover
I'm just a bit of a shade hungover
Come on, baby, do a slow float
You're a good looking riverboat
And ain't that sweet eyed
Blindness good to me
Let's go down by the grapevine
Drink my daddy's wine, good morning
Down by the grapevine
Drink my daddy's wine, good morning
Morning, oh, sweet blindness
A little magic
A little kindness
Oh, sweet blindness
All over me
Please don't tell my mother
I'm a saloon and a moonshine lover
Come on, baby, do a slow float
You're a good lookin' riverboat
And ain't that sweet eyed
Blindness good to me
Don't ask me cause
I ain't gonna tell you
What I've been drinking
Ain't gonna tell you
What I've been drinking
Ain't gonna tell you
What I've been drinking
Wine, of wonder
Wonder by the way
Oh, sweet blindness
A little magic
A little kindness
Oh, sweet blindness
All over me
Don't let daddy hear it
He don't believe in
The gin mill spirit
Don't let daddy hear it
He don't believe in
The gin mill spirit
Come on, baby, do a slow float
You're a good looking riverboat
And ain't that sweet eyed
Blindness good to me
Blindness, sweet eyed blindness
Now ain't that sweet eyed
Blindness good to me
