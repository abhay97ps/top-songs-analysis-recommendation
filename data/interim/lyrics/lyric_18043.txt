Better take a good look before I disappear
Because I'm just about to be your used-to-be
You might catch a glimpse of my tail lights in the dust
And if you notice somethin' missin' well it's me
'Cause I tried a new life
I cried and you stood by
Well here's a little magic thing I do...
Chorus:
Now you see me, now you don't
First you do, but then you won't
Watch me vanish right before your eyes
You might think you see me there
In a cafe on a street somewhere
Yeah that might be me, but I'll be gone
Now you see me, now you don't
You ever get the feeling that it feels like deja vu
Because some stranger feels like someone that you know
Might be the color of her lipstick or the smell of her perfume
That sends a shiver all the way down to your toes
Don't blink 'cause it ain't...
Yeah... what you think
It's just your heart playin' tricks on you
Chorus:
Now you see me, now you don't
First you do, but then you won't
Watch me vanish right before your eyes
You might think you see me there
In a cafe on a street somewhere
Yeah that might be me, but I'll be gone
Now you see me, now you don't
Yeah...
You might think you see me there
In a cafe on a street somewhere
Yeah that might be me, but I'll be gone
Now you see me, now you don't
Now you see me, now you don't...
Now you see me...
