When our country was a baby and the redcoats had their way
It was he who had a party tossing tea in Boston Bay
It was he who braved the winter in the days of Valley Forge
Fighting side by side together with a fella name of George
Johnny Freedom, Johnny Freedom
You can meet him on each page of history
He's the spirit of America
Our country's pride and joy
Hats off to Johnny Freedom
Johnny Freedom, that's our boy
When our country started growing and the wagons headed west
When our country called for pioneers, his name led all the rest
What a figure in his rawhide coat and hat made of raccoon
Wonder what there was about him made you think of Daniel Boone?
Johnny Freedom, Johnny Freedom
You can meet him on each page of history
He's the spirit of America, our country's pride and joy
Hats off to Johnny Freedom
Johnny Freedom, that's our boy
If we need a mess of thinking, he's the Lincoln of the day
If we're fixing for a tussle, it's his muscle all the way
If we need a handsome fella so the ladies' hearts can throb
There's a Yankee Doodle dandy always handy for the job
Johnny Freedom, Johnny Freedom
You can meet him on each page of history
He's the spirit of America, our country's pride and joy
Hats off to Johnny Freedom
Johnny Freedom, that's our boy
