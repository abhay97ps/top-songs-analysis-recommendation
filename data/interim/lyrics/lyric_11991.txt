Soup for one
When you're on the run
When you're by yourself
Minus someone else
Why must I be so depressed?
I feel I'm not like the rest
Cause I want love to be right
Stay with your darling all night
Soup for one
When you're on the run
When you're by yourself
Minus someone else
Soup for one
When the evening comes
When you're all alone
In your empty home
You have that look in your eye
Just wanted you to be mine, girl
To bathe you in the moonlight
And love you with all my might
Soup for one
When you're on the run
When you're by yourself
Minus someone else
Soup for one
When the evening comes
When you're all alone
In your empty home
