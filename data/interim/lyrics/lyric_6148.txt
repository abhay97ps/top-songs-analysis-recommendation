I had a girl
And I treated her tenderly
Oh yeah
She pretended that she cared
While she only laughed at me
All my life she deserted
I never knew how she flirted
Now it's me that's hurting
What a lesson I've learned
Good guys only win in the movies
Yes they do, now
They ride white horses, girl
And they're friends with everyone
Yeah!
Good guys only make it in the movies
Baby, yeah!
Because in life
They turn out sad and lonely ones
How sincere now, baby
Could your man have been?
I stuck right by ya, honey
Both through thick and thin
Girl I did?
You know you turned the table
I don't think I'll make it
But I'm gonna make it on my own
Good guys only win in the movies
Yes they do, now
They ride white horses, girl
And they're friends with everyone
Yeah!
Good guys only make it in the movies
Baby, yeah!
Because in life
They turn out sad and lonely ones
Girl, I'm tired of your lying
Tired of your alibi'ing
Now my love is dying
I'm gonna kiss your love goodbye
Good guys only win in the movies
Yes they do, now
They ride white horses, girl
And they're friends with everyone
Yeah!
Good guys only make it in the movies
Baby, yeah!
Because in life
They turn out sad and lonely ones
Sad and lonely ones...
Sad and lonely ones...
