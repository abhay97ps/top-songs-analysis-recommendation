Loving you could be so easy
Loving you could make me warm
Ever since the day I left you
I try but I just can't get you out of my mind
Thought that I could do without you
Thought I had to look around
But now that I know I need you
I promise I'll never leave you
Won't you please let me in, let me in your arms again
Let me give my love to you once more
Let me love you, let me love you
Take me in, take me in your arms to stay
And I'll never go away again
'Cause I love you, 'cause I love you
I'll never be the same without you
If I have to say goodbye
I have no right to ask you
But if you can, won't you try to love me?
Won't you try to love me? Help me?
I need you so badly
And let, let me in, let me in, let me in your arms again
Let me in, let me give my love to you once more
Oh, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you
Oh, take me in, take me in your arms to stay, take me in
And I'll never go away again
Oh, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you
Oh, let me in, let me in your arms again
Let me give my love to you once more
Oh, let me love you, let me love you
Oh, take me in, take me in your arms to stay
And I'll never go away
