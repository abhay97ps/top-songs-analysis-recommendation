(One very exciting area of folk idiom and folk music to us
Has always been the hatchet murders in Massachusetts
And I think that this quaint bit of suburban living can best be
Explained through the use of our poet laureate, Joe Frazier)
Elizabeth Borden took an axe
And gave her mother forty whacks
And when the job was nicely done
She gave her father forty-one
Yesterday in old Fall River, Mr. Andrew Borden died
And he got his daughter Lizzie on a charge of homicide
Some folks say she didn't do it, and others say of course she did
But they all agree Miss Lizzie B. was a problem kind of kid
'Cause you can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts
Not even if it's planned as a surprise 
No, you can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts
You know how neighbors love to criticize
She got him on the sofa where he'd gone to take a snooze
And I hope he went to Heaven 'cause he wasn't wearin' shoes
Lizzie kind of rearranged him with a hatchet so they say
And she got her mother in that same old fashioned way
But you can't can't chop your momma up in Massachusetts
Not even if you're tired of her cuisine 
No, you can't chop your momma up in Massachusetts
You know it's almost sure to cause a scene
Well, they really kept her hoppin' on that busy afternoon
With both down and upstairs choppin' while she hummed a ragtime tune
They really made her hustle, and when all was said and done
She'd removed her mother's bustle when she wasn't wearin' one
Oh, you can't chop your momma up in Massachusetts
And then blame all the damage on the mice 
No, you can't chop your momma up in Massachusetts
That kind of thing just isn't very nice
Now, it wasn't done for pleasure, and it wasn't done for spite
And it wasn't done because the lady wasn't very bright
She'd always done the slightest thing that mom and pop had bid
They said, "Lizzie, cut it out!" so that's exactly what she did
But you can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts
And then get dressed and go out for a walk 
No, you can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts
Massachusetts is a far cry from New York
No you can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts
(Shut the door and lock and latch it
Here comes Lizzie with a brand new hatchet)
You can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts
(Such a snob I heard it said
She met her pa and cut him dead)
You can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts
(Jump like a fish, jump like a porpoise
All join hands in habeas corpus)
No, you can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts
Massachusetts is a far cry from New York
