In my triple cup, that's two times two
Man, this shit darker than a wonton soup, ayy
Yeah, my eyes red, but I'm no Damu
If you don't run it up, that's all on you
You know I'm ballin', usual like Kobe 
Ooh, worried 'bout a hater that don't know me
He say that he tough, then that boy gotta show me
Pull up Bentley truck, extra poles, and we four deep 
Say my name three times like I'm Tony 
Diamond VVS, I put baguettes all on my Rollie
I ain't never believe nothing that you told me
These niggas keep sneak dissing, they turned me to my old me
Before I had these mils, I was oh-so lonely
Runnin' 'round in Philadelphia only with my 40
I ain't never been a phony 
You be gettin' bands? Hardly, yeah
I just fucked your bitch, sorry, oh 
Man, I put that on my shawty, ooh
Fight me, we're not scared, sorry 
No, I'm not here for no games, Atari 
Diamonds, they hittin' like water, ooh, starbeam, yeah
Rockstar life be callin' 
Don't want that girl, she stallin', she stallin' 
Big ol' foreign whip, ooh, I can't park it 
I'm from outer space, ooh, in a starship 
Thick ol' foreign bitch, ooh, that's my target 
Ten bands, what you say? Ooh 
Ten bands for my Chanel carpet 
Rockstar life like watch this 
Young nigga slick like margarine 
Lost your bitch in Starlet's

The bitch staring at me
Got real big titties 
What's in my jeans?

Flight after flight 
Hittin' real big cities
From the sandbox, yeah, my brothers is with me 
If they give me a bond, I'm comin' to get me 
And in the club 
We snuck the semi 
Cup, dawg, it ain't RÃ©my
I can feel the envy
In my triple cup, that's two times two
Man, this shit darker than a wonton soup, ayy
Yeah, my eyes red, but I'm no Damu
If you don't run it up, that's all on you
Disrespect the gang, and we stall on you, hey

Bring my belt, better have that coat on you, ayy 
Marry that guap, you know I do
