The time for talking's over now
I guess it's time to let you go
But I don't, no, I don't mind at all
It's getting so you never know
When things are better left alone
But I don't, no, I don't mind at all
It's important to me
That I don't see you laughing at me
But I'm smart enough to know
That I have to let you go
But I don't mind at all
Sentimental tears will get you
Far as you might think they will
But I don't, no, I don't mind at all
Misery loves company
But she will never fit the bill
But I don't, no, I don't mind at all
It's important to me
But I don't see you laughing at me
But I'm smart enough to know
That I have to let you go
But I don't mind at all
Seven years ago
I said goodbye to my own sanity
But I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't mind at all
