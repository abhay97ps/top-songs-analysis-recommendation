I don't know where I’m going 
But I know what I'm showing 
Feelings, that's what I’m pouring 
What the fuck is your motive? 
Man, I wish you would call me 
By your name 'cause I'm sorry 
This is not apology 
You are such a distraction 
That's what T on, aw 
Fuckin' up my ambiance, pause 
You drive me cuckoo and not car 
'Cause I want you like Leon Ware 
Okay, say again it 
Okay, wait a minute 
I dread that shit, I am Anwar 
Curiosity killed the feline, gone 
I think I've fallen in love 
This time I think it's for real 
I think I’ve fallen in love 
This time I think it’s for real 
How can I tell you?  How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you?  How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you?  How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you?  How can I tell you? 
I notice that you're there, but I’m always in your hair
And you're always under my microscope 
Waste of bread, I need your attention 
I'm off balance, I need some fixin' 
I’m your puppet, you are Jim Henson 
Fallen in love now 
I think I've fallen in love 
Fell in love now 
This time I think it's for real 
I think I'm in love now 
I think I've fallen in love 
I think I'm in love now 
This time I think it's for real 
How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you?
Take 'em to the bridge
Four, four, four, four 
I think I've fallen in love 
Fell in love now 
This time I think it's for real 
I think I'm in love now 
I think I've fallen in love 
This time I think it's for real
