O-O-O-O-Okay
It's the rula', nightmare Krueger
Keep me a Ruger pop me a poo-putt
The East where I grew up, so it's what I threw up
Sicker than a mothafucka, might throw my food up 
Who's cooler? No one, losers
You had good brains, I ain't even had to school her
Need me a tutor, I just want to do her
Pass it through the InC. and let my bro screw her
I'm Killa and I'll be that way
I got a large appetite for some pussy and weed
I said my money is green, and my thun thun blue
And If I pop that bitch, she gon' pop one too
Okay she poppin' two, now she's geeked like me
I said we're jerkin' and we stumpin' but can't catch the beat
We can't catch the beat, but I'm feelin' my dance
I had one pill left, and it fell out my hand, damn!
Don't, drop that thun thun-nun

Alright, oh my goodness I'm turned up
I got a bottle, you got a cup
You hit the Dougie, I two-step
You're not with this- I am InC. Rep
Ha, You can make a chick about usâ€”
She know my whole crew
She know the song too
Ratchet boys in this shit like what it do
Finattic Gang ho, now who the fuck are you?
I'm easy, I'm never turnt down
Thizz face on, girl this ain't no frown
Sippin' on lean, somebodys' girl goin' down
Like 3, 2, 1, where your girl at now?
Three pills down, that's on me
And it wouldn't be a song if I didn't say "yee!"
So don't drop the thun thun
Girl turn the fuck shit up
And we gon' keep it goin' when the hook come back along
Don't, drop that thun thun-nun
Don't drop that thun thun-nun
Don't, drop that thun thun-nun
Don't drop that thun thun-nun
Don't drop that thun thun-nun
Don't drop that thun thun-nun

Say if you drop it 
Just pick it up 
And grab a bad bitch and head to the cut 
Say if you drop it 
Just pick it up 
And grab a bad bitch and head to the cut 
Say you a freak 
You're not a freak like me 
Cause I'm a F-R-E-A-K, yeah that's me!
