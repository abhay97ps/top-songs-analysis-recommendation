I just can't live anymore like this
My heart just opened up the door again
Just watch me fly as I spread my wings
Don't ask me why 'cause there are too many things
And now we're standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
Oh, lil' ma-mama, I can feel your fire
You're poisonous, lady, let me take you higher
And I don't care if it's a bad time
Just label me the bad guy tonight
And now we're standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend
I came to party hoping that you would fall in love
I don't mean to put no pressure on you
Everybody loves a molly and the DJ, he's getting drunk
Trying to get next to you
And now we're standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend
I woke up, I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
I'ma take that faster
I'ma take that faster
I'ma take that faster
Now we're standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend
I'ma take that faster
I'ma take that faster
I-I-I'ma take that faster
