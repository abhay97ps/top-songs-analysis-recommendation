All of my friends finally convinced me to get out of the house
To help me forget, to help me move on
Then I heard you're back in town
In a crowd of strangers and lovers
Someone told me that you were comin'
So I should probably go to bed 
I should probably turn off my phone
I should quit while I'm ahead 
I should probably leave you alone
'Cause I know in the mornin' 
I'll be callin' 
Sayin' "sorry" for the things I said
So I, yeah, I should probably go to bed
So I don't undo the got-over-you
That I took so long to find
'Cause all it would take is seein' your face and I'd forget
So I should probably go to bed 
I should probably turn off my phone
I should quit while I'm ahead 
I should probably leave you alone
'Cause I know in the mornin' 
I'll be callin' 
Sayin' "sorry" for the things I said
So I, yeah, I should probably go to bed
Before I question my decision
Is it love? I know it isn't
Now I'm all up in my head again
'Cause I know I don't have the self-control
To walk away if you walk in
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know
I should probably go to bed
Ooh, I'm all up in my head 
Ooh, I, I should go to bed 
Ooh, I'm  all up in my head 
Ooh, I, I should go to bed
In a crowd of strangers and lovers
Someone told me that you were comin'
So I should probably go to bed
