Oh
Maybe tonight
We could close the door and lock ourselves inside
Take time to feel
I don't want to miss the chance to be so real
The days all fly away and I forget the truth
Everything that matters, is, in this room
When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it
Life is so sweet
When you lie next to me
My heart is yours
And every part of me still wants to give you more
More time to love
'Cos you never know when life will leave us
I want to take in all the beauty here
Oh, let the world around us just disappear
When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it
Life is so sweet
When you lie next to me
Oh lie next to me
When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it
Life is so sweet
When you lie next to me
When you lie next to me
