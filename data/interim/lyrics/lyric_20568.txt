She's going out to forget they were together
All that time he was taking her for granted
She wants to see, if there's more
Than he gave, she's looking for
He calls her up, he's tripping on the phone now
He doesn't want her out there and alone now
He knows she's moving it, knows she's using it
Now he's losing it, she don't care
Everybody, put up your hands
Say, "I don't want to be in love, I don't want to be in love"
Feel the beat now, if you've got nothing left
Say, "I don't want to be in love, I don't want to be in love"
Back it up now, you've got a reason to live
Say, "I don't want to be in love, I don't want to be in love"
Feeling good now, don't be afraid to get down
Say, "I don't want to be in love, I don't want to be in love"
He was always giving her attention
Working hard to find the things she mentioned
He was dedicated, by most suckers hated
That girl was fine, but she didn't appreciate him
She calls him up; she's tripping on the phone now
He had to get out and he ain't coming home now
He's trying to forget her; that's how he got with her
When he first met her, when they first got together
Everybody, put up your hands
Say, "I don't want to be in love, I don't want to be in love"
Feel the beat now, if you've got nothing left
Say, "I don't want to be in love, I don't want to be in love"
Back it up now, you've got a reason to live
Say, "I don't want to be in love, I don't want to be in love"
Feeling good now, don't be afraid to get down
Say, "I don't want to be in love, I don't want to be in love"
To the beat
To the beat
To the beat
You got nothing to lose
Don't be afraid to get down
We break up, it's something that we do now
Everyone has got to do it sometime
It's okay, let it go
Get out there and find someone
It's too late to be tripping on the phone here
Get off the wire you know everything is good here
Stop what you're doing, you don't want to ruin
The chance that you got to find a new one
Everybody, put up your hands
Say, "I don't want to be in love, I don't want to be in love"
Feel the beat now, if you've got nothing left
Say, "I don't want to be in love, I don't want to be in love"
Back it up now, you've got a reason to live
Say, "I don't want to be in love, I don't want to be in love"
Feeling good now, don't be afraid to get down
Say, "I don't want to be in love, I don't want to be in love"
Love
Love
Now you know what to do
So come on, feeling good
