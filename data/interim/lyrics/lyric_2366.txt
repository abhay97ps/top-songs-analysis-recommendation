Ooh, ooh...
High on a hill
Where troubles were few
High on a hill
By our old rendezvous
Here am I, I can't go on
Since you're gone 
Since you're gone 
You're gone and I'm alone
We made a vow
We never would part
You held your hand
So close to my heart
How could I know
How could I believe
You would leave me this way
All my dreams
All my schemes
Have lost their glow
Since you're away
What can I do
Is there still a chance
To have you 
To hold you 
To love you forevermore
High on a hill
I'm begging to you
You were my life
I need you, I do
Till you come back to me
Here I will be
High on a hill
High on a hill
Ooh, ooh...
