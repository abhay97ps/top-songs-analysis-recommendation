Won't you let me catch your fall?
Won't you let me lend a hand?
Those lonely eyes have seen it all
But love's too blind to understand
Cause you don't know what you have
Til your everything is gone
You need someone to show you
How to live again
I wanna be there when you're feeling high
I wanna be there when you wanna die
I'm gonna light your fire, I'm gonna feel your flame
I wanna be there when you go insane
I wanna be there when you're feeling down
And I'll be there when your head is spinnin 'round
Gonna be your lover, gonna be your friend
I wanna be there til the end
You wouldn't know that I was there
Cause I have been there all the time
And if I had my way I'd hold you in my arms
And leave this madness all behind
Cause you got so much to give
But you throw it all away
And all you've got to show for
Who you are is pain
And I've got so much to give
If you'd only let me in
I'm gonna take the time
To show you I'm a friend
You'll believe in love again
I wanna be there in the pouring rain
I wanna be there when you call my name
Gonna light your fire, I'm gonna feel your flame
I wanna be there when you go insane
I wanna be there when I'm outta town
And when your whole damn world is crashing down
I'm gonna be your lover, gonna be your friend
I'm wanna be there til the end
Cause you don't know what you have
Til your everything is gone
You need someone to show you
How to live again
And I've got so much to give
If you'd only let me in
I'm gonna take the time
To show you I'm a friend
You'll believe again
I wanna be there when your baby cries
I wanna be there when they tell you lies
I'm gonna light your fire, gonna feel your flame
I wanna be there when you go insane
I wanna be there when your nights are long
And when you're feeling like you don't belong
Gonna be your lover, gonna be your friend
Gonna be there til the end
I'm gonna be there in the morning
I'm gonna be there in the night
I'm gonna be your lover, gonna be your friend
I'm gonna be there til the end, yeah
