When I'm lost in a strange place
Scared and alone
When I'm wishing for home
That's when I think of you
When the load gets too heavy
Too much to bear
When I'm going nowhere, there's no one there
And I'm feeling like a fool
That's when I think of you
It's all that I can do
I'd go mad
If it wasn't for you
When I'm caught in the crossfire
Of wrongs making right
When I wake in the night
That's when I think of you
When I'm halfway to heaven
With three parts of hell
And its all just as well that I can't even tell
I'm lost without a clue
If not for the thought of you
The promise of dreams come true
I'd go mad
If it wasn't for you
When I'm lonely for lovin'
So far from home
When it feels like I'm in the Twilight Zone
And I just can't make it through
If not for the thought of you
The promise of dreams come true
I'd go mad
If it wasn't for you
I'm always thinking of you
It's all that I can do
I'd go mad
Not being with you
If not for the thought of you
Promise of dreams come true
I'd go mad
Not being with you
I'd go mad
Not being with you...
