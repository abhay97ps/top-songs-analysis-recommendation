Lollipops and roses and lollipops and roses
And lollipops and roses and lollipops and roses
And lollipops
Tell her you care 
Each time you speak 
Make it her birthday 
Each day of the week 
Bring her nice things
Sugar and spice things
Roses  and lollipops 
And lollipops  and roses
One day she'll smile 
Next day she'll cry 
Minute to minute 
You'll never know why 
Coax her, pet her
Better yet, get her
Roses  and lollipops 
And lollipops  and roses
We try acting grown up 
But as a rule 
We're all little children 
Fresh from school 
So carry her books 
That's how it starts 
Fourteen or forty 
They're kids in their hearts 
Keep them handy
Flowers and candy
Roses  and lollipops 
And lollipops  and roses
Lollipops and roses and lollipops and roses
And lollipops and roses and lollipops and roses
And lollipops and roses and lollipops and roses
