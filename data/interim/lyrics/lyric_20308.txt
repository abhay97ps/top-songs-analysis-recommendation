I used to think about immature things. You know, like, "Do you love me? Do you want me? Are you gon' call me like you said you would? Is this really your real phone number?"
Gangstas in this house
Zone 4
Get money
New money
Hey!
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight, no slack, just bought a Cadillac
Just bought a Cadillac
Just bought a Cadillac 
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight, no slack, just bought a Cadillac
Just bought a Cadillac 
Just bought a Cadillac 
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight, no slack, just bought a Cadillac
Took it to the chop shop, got the damn top dropped
Two colored flip flopped, candy-red lollipop
 But I still got my Glock cocked
New money, motherfucker, don't you see the big knot?
Don't you see the big chain? Don't you see the big rims?
Wonder who they hatin' on lately? Baby, this him
Candy paint, gator-skin seats, call me "Dundee"
Pope in your hood, I'm the one that you wanna be
Haters wish they could feel the wood in my '83
Riding with no tint so them motherfuckers know it's me
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight, no slack, just bought a Cadillac
Just bought a Cadillac
Just bought a Cadillac 
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight, no slack, just bought a Cadillac
Just bought a Cadillac 
Just bought a Cadillac 
I never slip, I never fall
A lot of hoes give me they numbers, but I never call
A real O.G., look at V.I.P. and see a nigga ball
Then, after we hit the club, baby, I'ma hit them drawers
Yeah, I'm gonna break you off... 
Every freak should have a picture of my dick... 
Polow be the shit, Zone 4 be the clique
Yeah, this for my dogs, yeah, gangsters, hustlers
Wankstas, busters—
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight, no slack, just bought a Cadillac
Just bought a Cadillac
Just bought a Cadillac 
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight, no slack, just bought a Cadillac
Just bought a Cadillac 
Just bought a Cadillac 
Hit the block on some new ten thousand-dollar wheels
Can't explain how I feel, touching gator on my wheel
Got peanut butter ice cream Peter Pan seats
Just got a fresh cut, now we looking for them freaks
Take a bad yellow bitch, make her drop them drawers
I'ma show you how to ball, middle finger to the law
So fuck them niggas, what they wanna do?
Hating on a player 'cause my 'Lac skate in 22s
When I pull up, I'ma park right at the front
Pour lean in my cup, got purp in my blunt
I'm a real pimp, bitch, I ain't playin' like a trick
Just bought a new 'Lac and put them thangs on that bitch
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight, no slack, just bought a Cadillac
Just bought a Cadillac
Just bought a Cadillac 
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight, no slack, just bought a Cadillac
Just bought a Cadillac 
Just bought a Cadillac
