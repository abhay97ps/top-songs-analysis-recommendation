Now I don't mean to sound rude, baby, or hurt you nothin'
I want an independent woman if she workin' with somethin'
I want a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her
She ain't got a lot of ass, but I can work with her
Want a big fine woman with some pop in her
She ain't got a lot of ass, but titties pop with her
Now I came here to get it buck
Represent for No Limit, if you ain't with it, catch a dump
We kneel it up in the trucks, you know what's up
We just signed with Universal and we got the clubs up
So put your head between your legs and touch your toes
Bounce your booty up and down, ooh, girl, there you go
Won't you walk like a model?
If you a independent woman maybe I'ma holla
You got your hair fixed nice with your clothes tight
You wanna shake it like a dog and do it all night, all night
Now assume the position and get it right
Put your hands in the air won't you make those titties fight?
I'm Choppa-Chop, you know what I'm about, I wanna see you
Turn around and stick your booty out, your booty out 
Choppa style, Chop-Chop-Choppa style

And all my independent women, ya heard me?
We gonna do it like this here 
This a chant, come along kinda like this here 
If you a independent woman, holla 
If you got your own house, holla 
If you drive your own car, holla 
If you hate your baby daddy, holla 
If you an independent player, holla 
If you hate your baby mama, holla 
If you drive your own car, holla 
If you take care of your kids, holla 
Now won't you walk with it? Walkity-walk with it

Indonesia don't tease ya
I'm in the Benz with a bow-legged beaver
I likes to flip my pancakes up
And sex, I likes to give it to 'em rough
Big paper, all flavors
Send the word to the hood, I'm Jim Bakker
Love don't cost a thing, now who said that?
Big pimpin' and ballin', who made it?
I'm in that new Hummer with spinnin' wheels
And, aw man, check out the grill
Money, Gucci sandals, strip leather
I'm lookin' for the ghetto Cinderella
Choppa called me up, it's off the heezy
Now we tag teamin' for sheezy
I asked her, "Boo, call me a donkey"
'Less they crush balls, I like 'em chunky

Toot-toot that ass up, she like it like that
Where my fellas go at when they hit it from the back?
Smack-smack that ass up, she like it like that
