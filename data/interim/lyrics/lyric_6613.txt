When I was a little girl, I had a rag doll
Only doll I've ever owned
Well, I love you just the way I loved that rag doll
Only now my love has grown
And it gets stronger  in every way
And it gets deeper.    Let me say
That it gets higher  day by day.  Oh
Do I love you, my oh my, oooh, baby
River deep, mountain high.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If i lost you, would I cry.  Oh, oh
Oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby
When you were a young girl
Did you have a puppy that always followed you around
Well, I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No, I'll never let you down
'Cause it goes on and on  like the river flows
And it gets deeper, baby,  heaven knows
And it gets sweeter, baby,  as it goes
Do I love you, my oh my
River deep, mountain high
I said so high
If I lost you, would I cry
Oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby
I love you, baby, like a flower loves the spring
And I love you, baby, like a robin loves to sing
Oooh, oooh, and I love you, baby, like a schoolgirl likes her pie, yeah
And I love you, baby, river deep, mountain high
I love you, baby
A mountain so high, a river deep.  Oooh
Oh, oh, baby, baby
I love you, baby.  I bet you do
Oooh, I love you, baby.  Tell me you love me
Yes I do.  Oh
Do I love you, my oh my
Tell me, tell me, tell me
River deep, mountain high.  Oh, oh, oh
 If I lost you, would I cry, baby
Oh, how I love you, baby, baby,  baby
Tell me do you love me, baby
I love you, yeah
 River so deep, mountain so high
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
 Oh, ho, ho, yeah
 River deep, mountain high
 River so deep, mountain so, so, so, so high
 That's why I love you, baby
 High, high, high, high, high, high, high, yeah
 I love you, baby, yes, yes I do
 Tell me, tell me, tell me one more time
