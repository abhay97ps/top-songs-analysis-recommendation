'Cause we rock
We rock, we rock on
We rock, we rock on
Come as you are, you're a superstar
World in your pocket and you know it
You can feel that beat running through your feet
Heart's racing fast, you're rock and rollin'
All that you need is the music to take you
To some other place
Where you know you belong
Raise your hands up in the air and scream
We're finding our voice, following our dreams
'Cause we rock 
We rock, we rock on
Nobody in the world's gonna bring us down
The louder we go, well, the better we sound
'Cause we rock 
We rock, we rock on
We're finally letting go, losin' all control
Won't stop ourselves, 'cause we love it
We're not afraid to be everything you see
No more hiding out, we're gonna own it
All that you need is the music to take you
To some other place
Where you know you belong
Raise your hands up in the air and scream
We're finding our voice, following our dreams
'Cause we rock 
We rock, we rock on
Nobody in the world's gonna bring us down
The louder we go, well, the better we sound
'Cause we rock 
We rock, we rock on
We got the music in our souls 
And it's the thing we want the most 
It picks us up when we fall down
It turns our world around
'Cause we rock 
We rock, we rock on
Every day and every night
'Cause we rock 
We rock, we rock on
It's all we wanna do in life, yeah
Raise your hands up in the air and scream
We're finding our voice, following our dreams
'Cause we rock 
We rock, we rock on
Nobody in the world's gonna bring us down
The louder we go, well, the better we sound
'Cause we rock 
We rock, we rock on
Raise your hands up in the air and scream
We're finding our voice, following our dreams
'Cause we rock 
We rock, we rock on
Nobody in the world's gonna bring us down
The louder we go, well, the better we sound
'Cause we rock 
We rock, we rock on
We rock, we rock, we rock on 
We rock, we rock
