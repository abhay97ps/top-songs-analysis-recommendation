I can hear the rivers flowing
And I can see the winds are blowing
Since the endless marching of the time
And if you don't know what I'm feeling
Take a look 'cause I'm revealing
Everything that's now running through my mind
I'm telling you the time is coming
You're gonna have to start your poor legs running
Out of this old world you refuse to call your own
Hard it's coming and it may be tomorrow
You're gonna have to beg and to borrow
Sanity from a man you've never known
And if you don't know what I'm feeling
Take a look 'cause I'm revealing
Everything that's now running through my mind
And I can see the rivers flowing
I can hear the winds are blowing
Since the endless marching of the time
Mirrors come from every angle
I'm telling you you're gonna have to dangle
Your mind from a living while you're gonna think so small
I swear the day is coming, coming soon
The truth is gonna bust a lot of balloons
There's gonna be a lot of people learning to crawl
And if you don't know what I'm feeling
Take a look 'cause I'm revealing
Everything that's now running through my mind
And I can see the rivers flowing
I can hear the winds are blowing
Since the endless marching of the time
