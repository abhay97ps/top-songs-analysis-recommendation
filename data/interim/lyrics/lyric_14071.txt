Heartache
Huh Huh Huh Huh Huh
Life is so hard needlessly
No fairytales
Tell me am I history
A broken heart if you say goodbye
I never knew you could leave this way
Forget about what I've been through
If you should go what am I to do?
Remember we met and the room was crowded
And I can't forget the way that it started
Giving it all
Ready to fall in love!
And now you're giving me a
Heartache
Huh Huh Huh Huh Huh
Who's game
It's a shame shame
It's a heartache
And I feel the pain
You'll find it hard leaving me
No turning back
Once you walk on out the door
The perfect girl is what you left behind
Guess loving you was a waste of time
Never mind what I've been through
If you should go what am I to do?
Remember we met and the Foom was crowded
And I can't forget the way that I found it
Giving it all
Ready to fall in love!
And now you're giving me a
Heartache
Huh Huh Huh Huh Huh
It's a fools game
It's a shame shame
I can feel the heartache
Its a fool game
Its a fool game
Shame shame
Ooh it's a heartache
And I feel the pain
Huh Huh Huh Huh Huh
Heartache
Its a heartache
Fools game fools game
Shame shame
I can't take it
I can feel feel feel the heartache
It's a fools game
Shame shame
