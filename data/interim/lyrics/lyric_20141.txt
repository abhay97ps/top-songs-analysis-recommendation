It's five o'clock, just got paid
I'll be off the next two days
No more working like dogs
No more leash, no more boss
I got a weekend of nothing to do at all
Yee haw!
I know a place down the road
The girls are hot, the beer is cold
It's two-for-one, yeah, that's right
Not just drinks, it's girls to guys
I hear the twins are back in town from Saginaw
Yee haw!
You take your all-right
You take your can't-wait
A lot of of bring-it-on and some damn straight
And mix it all up with some down home southern drawl, y'all
You got your yee haw!
The place is packed, the line is long
The band knows every Haggard song
I'm getting loose, I've had a few
She wants to dance, I do too
But her boyfriend's mad
I, I think he wants to brawl
All right
Yee haw!
You take your all-right
You take your can't-wait
A lot of of bring-it-on and some damn straight
And mix it all up with some down home southern drawl, y'all
You got your yee haw!
I'm talking big time
I mean saddle up and hold on tight
And if you know what I'm talking' about, y'all, yeah
How about a yee haw! Ha, ha
Yep, bow bow, Y E E H A W, yee haw!
