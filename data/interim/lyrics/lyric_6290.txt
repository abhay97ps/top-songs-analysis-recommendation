You've got me dangling on a string
Please don't let me drop
My life will surely stop
Cause I'm wrapped in a
Dream of needing you so
My heart's in a noose
And I can't break loose
I'm not half the man that
I used to be and I'll admit it
Your love has become a habit to me
And I can; t quit it
Won't you take this half a man
And make this man whole again
You've got me dangling on a string
Please don't let me drop
Cause you're everything I've got
And I'm wrapped in a dream
Needing you so
Feeling is strong and I can't let go
Every time I phone, your number's
Changed or disconnected
You have made my life a book of games
I feel so rejected
Girl, you've got the best of me
Now come and take the rest of me
You've got me dangling on a string
Please don't let me drop
You're everything I've got
Cause I'm wrapped in a
Dream of needing you so
My hearts in a noose
And I can't break loose
Girl, my nights are so lonely
Ooh, I'm needing you only
Pretty, pretty, pretty lover
I only drink enough from your
Loving cup to keep me thirsty
Girl, my need for you is, oh
So strong until it hurts me
You've got me dangling on a string
Please don't let me drop
You're everything I've got
Yes, I'm wrapped in a
Dream of needing you so
The feeling is strong
And I can't let go
You've got me dangling on a string
Please don't let me drop
My life would surely stop...
