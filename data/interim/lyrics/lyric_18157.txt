The snow is falling the city is white
Ur eyes are shining like diamonds tonight
And were all alone theres no one home
Your finally in my arms again
The night is silent, the moment is here
I couldn't ask for more than having you near
Cause i love you girl i always will
And now i know the moment is right
Cause i've been waiting to give this gift tonight
Im down on my knees theres no better time
Its something to last for as long as you live
Tonight im gonna give you, all my heart can give
I thought i'd give you something shiny and new
I tried to find something worthy of you
But i realized when i looked inside
Theres somethings that money can't buy
I feel the magic whenever your near
I feel it even more this time of the year
Cause i love you girl, i always will
And now i know the moment is right, the moment is right
Cause i've been waiting to give this gift tonight
Im down on my knees theres no better time
Its something to last for as long as you live
Tonight im gonna give you, all my heart can give
You know ill always be true to you
And you know im the one you can turn to
Anytime any place anywhere
You'll know that ill always be there
Oh baby
Cause i've been waiting to give this gift tonight
Im down on my knees theres no better time
Its something to last for as long as you live
Tonight im gonna give you, all my heart can give
