I was riding in my car one day 
In the express lane rolling down the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings
Then I reached down beside me
Then I looked on the floor felt, on the back seat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before I knew it
Here comes this truck now
The doctor said I don't think he's gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said unto me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
And for 10 years I've been straight
Chorus:
You saved me You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me
Now I've been sitting in the chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone would call me with a job opening
Cause its been so hard for me month to month
Struggling to eat but still there was no answer
I stopped believing in his word And got so mad at him
When somebody say Gods good I just laugh at them
And in the nick of time his blessing rained on me
By his grace the phone ring a lady says were hiring
And that's when I knew
Chorus:
You saved me You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me
Now I was 18 out on the block selling drugs
With a gun at my waist And for people had no love
See the streets was my home and family and friends were gone
Had no one to trust and deep inside I was all alone
And then a deal went bad one day and it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before I knew it I was on my knees
(Blood gushing out my body my hearts beatin fast
I don't know what I'm a do I don't think I'm gonna last)
Then I began to flash back on the thing I've done in my past
I accepted Christ that day hallelujah now I'm free
Chorus:
You saved me You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me
I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering where did it come from
and the results came back and the doctor said I'm sorry but you got cancer
I could not believe it so I called up my mama to calm my nerve
she got down on her knees she said a prayer for me
 said just keep on thanking Jesus he'll give you all you need
That was five years ago don't have that pain no mo
Doc says you can go home cause all your caners gone
Chorus:
You saved me  You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me
