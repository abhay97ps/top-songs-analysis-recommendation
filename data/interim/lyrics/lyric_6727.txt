Big brown tin can
Lying in the black sand
We used to lie there and watch the day
Now the leaves have all turned to grey
Down by the river where the river don't flow
We can't go there no more
Down by the river where the river don't flow
The birds don't sing, ain't it a sad thing
Little child upon my knee
Holds a picture of a tree
Tears in his eyes say where'd they all go
The tears in mine say I really don't know
Down by the river where the river don't flow
We can't go there no more
Down by the river where the river don't flow
The birds don't sing, ain't it a sad thing
Listen to the wind blowing over the land
Listen to the reasons that you don't understand
Reach out and take my hand and we'll run, run, run, run
Down by the river where the river don't flow
We can't go there no more
Down by the river where the river don't flow
The birds don't sing, ain't it a sad thing
Cities eating up the land
Progress eating up the planet
The writing's in the slime on the sewer wall
You better look see or we're all gonna fall
Down by the river where the river don't flow
We can't go there no more
Down by the river where the river don't flow
The birds don't sing, ain't it a sad thing
