Baby, so you think you can start again?
You got somebody new
But the same thing keeps happening
At the moment of truth
Whoever you're loving
You will be thinking of me
As long as Niagara falls
As long as Gibraltar stands
Until hell freezes over
I'll always be your man
Tell me, when you're there lying by his side
Do you make him believe all your needs have been satisfied?
Does he know that your heart is taken forever?
Girl, you will always be mine
As long as Niagara falls
As long as Gibraltar stands
Until hell freezes over
I'll always be your man
Time can't erase
What you feel in your heart
You can't replace the love
Girl, you're gonna miss my loving until the day you die
Until hell freezes over
As long as Niagara falls
Until the end of time
Until hell freezes over
You are forever mine
As long as Niagara falls
Until the end of time
Until hell freezes over
You are forever mine
As long as Niagara falls
Until the end of time
Until hell freezes over
You are forever mine
