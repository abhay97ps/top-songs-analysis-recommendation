People say i'm naive
Wearing my heart on my sleeve
And it will surely break
If love should ever leave
But i don't mind what they say
I know this love is gonna stay
'cause in the deepest part of my heart of hearts
I know that we will always be this way
I know you were made for me
Nothing can ever change, it's meant to be
Just like the moon was made for a lonely night
You are my light
Forever in this light
I thought i knew love before
With you i've found there's so much more
More than the love we make
It's the feelings we two can explore
We're just a woman and a man
We'll make mistakes like we all can
But through it all, you'll see
By your side i will be
Growing closer to you each passing day
I've heard it said that love is a crazy game
You play a little while then the partners change
Somewhere my heart knows our love has stood the test of time
You'll be mine
