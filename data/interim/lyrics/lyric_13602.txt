I hardly even knew you
You called me on the phone
You took me to a movie
Now you wanna drive me home
I won't deny I like it
But you push it just a bit too hard
Yeah, yeah
You tell me that you love me
I've heard it all before
I really like your stories
But now I'm gonna shut the door
Don't put your arms around me
Confusion is in my heart
Well, you see, I can't defend against your touch
I'm afraid I got to like you a little too much
It's my female intuition
Protects me against your charms
But it drives me into your arms
My female intuition 
The woman in me does some checkin'
On the man in you
All the girls they tell me
Tell me you're no good
Guess they're all so jealous
Other I don't think they would
But there's a voice inside me
Telling me to not let go
Yeah, yeah
It's a competition
All the girls in town
I'll use my ammunition
'Cause I wanna wear the crown
So you better believe me
Boy, I'm gonna tie you down
Well, you see, I can't defend against your touch
I'm afraid I got to like you a little too much
It's my female intuition 
Protects me against your charms but it drives me into your arms
My female intuition 
The woman in me does some checkin'
On the man in you
It's my female intuition 
Protects me against your charms but it drives me into your arms
My female intuition 
The woman in me does some checkin'
On the man in you
You
Lovers come and lovers go
It's something every woman knows
Ever since you came my way
I'm doing everything to make you stay
Ooohooo
Ooohooo
Ooohooo
Ooohooo
It's my female intuition 
Protects me against your charms but it drives me right into your arms
My female intuition 
The woman in me does some checkin'
On the man in you
It's my female intuition 
Protects me against your charms but drives me into your arms
My female intuition 
The woman in me does some checkin'
On the man in you
