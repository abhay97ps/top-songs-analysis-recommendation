Do you dream that the world will know your name?
So tell me your name
Do you care about all the little things, or anything at all?
I wanna feel all the chemicals inside, I wanna feel
I want a sunburn just to know that I'm alive
To know I'm alive
Don't tell me if I'm dying, 'cause I don't wanna know
If I can't see the sun, maybe I should go
Don't wake me 'cause I'm dreaming of angels on the moon
Where everyone you know never leaves too soon
Do you believe in the day that you were born?
Tell me, do you believe?
Do you know that every day's the first
Of the rest of your life?
Don't tell me if I'm dying, 'cause I don't wanna know
If I can't see the sun, maybe I should go
Don't wake me 'cause I'm dreaming of angels on the moon
Where everyone you know never leaves too soon
This is to one last day in the shadows
And to know a brother's love
This is to New York City angels
And the rivers of our blood
This is to all of us, to all of us
So don't tell me if I'm dying, 'cause I don't wanna know
If I can't see the sun, maybe I should go
Don't wake me 'cause I'm dreaming of angels on the moon
Where everyone you know never leaves too soon
Yeah, you can tell me all your thoughts
About the stars that fill polluted skies
And show me where you run to
When no one's left to take your side
But don't tell me where the road ends
'Cause I just don't wanna know
No, I don't wanna know
Don't tell me if I'm dying
Don't tell me if I'm dying
