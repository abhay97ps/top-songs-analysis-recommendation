Oh what a price
I had to pay
For lovin you, you
I bought her home
A diamond ring
I had to give up everything
Oh what a price
I had to pay
For lovin you, you
I try so hard
To do whats right
But you only wrecked my life
Oh what a price
I had to pay
For lovin you, you
I stopped my ramblin
I even stopped gamblin
I even stopped staying out all night
Oh what a price
I had to pay
For lovin you, you
You heard my story
I sang my song
So goodbye, baby I'm gone
Oh what a price
I had to pay
For lovin you, you
