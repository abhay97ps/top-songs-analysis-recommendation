Once those American boys get near you
Take good care of your heart
From Kentucky to New York City
California to Idaho
Let me tell you girls, plain or pretty
There's something that you gotta know
Once those American boys get near you
Take good care of your heart
Once those American boys get near you
Take good care of your heart
Some are charming and some are witty
Some can look like a movie star
Let me tell you girls, plain or pretty
Remember wherever you are
Whoa, oh, oh
You can have the time of your life
But I know every day's
Another day nearer his loving arms
If you want to be free and easy
Just remember right from the start
You can fall in love, it's so easy
So, girls, you've gotta be smart
Cause
Whoa, oh, yeah
Don't you know that
Once those American boys get near you
Take good care of your heart, yeah
Once those American boys get near you
Take good care of your heart, yeah
You know once those
American boys get near you
Take good care of your heart
