Mama told me 
Not to sell work 
Seventeen five, same color T-shirt 
Mama told me 
Not to sell work 
Seventeen five, same color T-shirt 
Young nigga poppin' with a pocket full of cottage 
Woah, kemosabe, chopper aimin' at your noggin 
Had to cop the Audi, then the top, I had to chop it 
Niggas pocket watchin', so I gotta keep the rocket 
Neck water faucet 
Mockingbirds mocking 
Act' pint stocking 
Nats keep thottin' 
Wrist on hockey 
Wrist on rocky 
Lot of niggas copy, huh
Name someone can stop me 
Bitches call me Papi 
'Sace, that's my hobby 
Scotty on the molly, pocket rocket from O'Reilly 
One off in the chamber, ain't no need for me to cock it 
Niggas get to droppin' when that Draco get to poppin' 
All I want is cottage, roll a cigar full of broccoli 
No check, want all cash, nigga, I don't do deposits 
Bitches cross the border, nigga, bitches from the tropics 
I'ma get that bag, nigga, ain't no doubt about it 
I'ma feed my family, nigga, ain't no way around it 
Ain't gon' never let up, nigga, God said show my talent 
Young nigga with the Anna, walkin' with the hammer 
Talkin' country grammar, nigga, straight out Nawf Atlanta 
Young nigga poppin' with a pocket full of cottage 
Woah, kemosabe, chopper aimin' at your noggin 
Had to cop the Audi, then the top, I had to chop it 
Niggas pocket watchin', so I gotta keep the rocket

1995 
2005 
Seen it with my eyes 
Dope still alive 
Real mob ties 
Real frog eyes 
Real whole pies 
All-time high 
Do it for the culture 
They gon' bite like vultures 
Way back when I was trappin' out Toyotas 
I'ma hit the gas 
12 can't pull me over 
Space coupe, Quavo Yoda, pourin' drank in sodas
I get high on my own, sir
Heard you gon' clone, sir
Stop all that flexin', young nigga don't wanna go there
Never been a gopher but I always been a soldier 
Young niggas in the cut, posted like a vulture 
Divin' off the stage in the crowd, it's a moshpit 
Yeah, shawty bad, but she broke 'cause she don't own shit
Mama asked me, "Son, when the trappin' gon' quit?" 
I been ridin' 'round through the city in my new bitch 
Young nigga poppin' with a pocket full of cottage 
Woah, kemosabe, chopper aimin' at your noggin 
Had to cop the Audi, then the top, I had to chop it 
Niggas pocket watchin', so I gotta keep the rocket
