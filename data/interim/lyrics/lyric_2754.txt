There's a scandal
In the neighborhood
And it's all about Julie Brown
It seems a long
Lost cousin, Jeremiah
Had lately arrived in town
Now when Julie's fella
Came to call
And saw them kissing
Lyrics courtesy Top40db
He started home at once
Now Julie said
I'm surprised at you
Don't go acting like a dunce
Why, he's a cousin of mine
A cousin of mine
You're liable for to
See him here any old time
He's a cousin of mine
A cousin of mine, go on
He's a cousin of mine
Now when Julie had
Explained her relationship
He said, honey, that may be so
But this fella don't look
Like a thirty-second cousin
That I met here a week ago
Julie smiled at him
And joined her cousin, sad
And as they slowly walked away
He heard him ask
Who was that fella
And he heard his Julie say
Why, he's a cousin of mine
A cousin of mine
You're liable for to
See him here any old time
He's just a cousin of mine
A cousin of mine, go on
A cousin of mine
Would I fool you, go on
He's a cousin of mine
