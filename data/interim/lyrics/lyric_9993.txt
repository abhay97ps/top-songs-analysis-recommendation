There is no other to compare to you
You've got me blinded, givin' all that I have to you
You showed me feelings that I'd never find
But those feelings ain't complete when you're not here all the time
Oh baby love, oh baby love
Early in the morning, early in the morning
You come creepin' in my mind
Oh baby love, oh baby love
Oh baby love, oh baby love
I wake up with a yearning
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love
Give me reasons to be a fool for you
But I don't care about foolish pride when it's concerning to you
I'll be your slave, yes I will, give me your command
You can order me to stay around you all that I can
Oh baby love, oh baby love
Early in the morning, early in the morning
You come creepin' in my mind
Oh baby love, oh baby love
Oh baby love, oh baby love
I wake up with a yearning
Burnin' for your touch, I'm burning
Burnin' for your touch, I'm burning
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love, oh
All I do is think about you, baby love
All I do is think about you, baby love
I want your love, I need your love, I want your love
Come on now, oh babe
Hey
There is no other to compare to you
You've got me blinded, blinded, blinded, giving all I have to you
Feelings, feelings I'd never find
But those feelings ain't complete when you're not here all the time
Oh baby love, baby love
Early in the morning, early in the morning
You come creepin' in my mind
Oh baby love, oh baby love
Oh baby love, oh baby love
I wake up with a yearning
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
