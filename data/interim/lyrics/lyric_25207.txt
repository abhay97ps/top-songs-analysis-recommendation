Yeah, she lookin' like a movie, yeah 
I think that I'ma choose her, yeah 
Back that ass up, no Juvie, yeah 
Throw them racks, go stupid, yeah 
Squeeze my shot like Uzis, yeah 
When I slide on her, yeah 
Heard she wet, Jacuzzi, yeah 
Make me go, make me go, make me go lose it 
Bought her Chanel, surprise on her, yeah 
She so bad, got girls and guys on her 
Make me wanna pull out the phone and go live on her, yeah 
But I snap back and close my eyes on her 
Bad bitch, she bring a team of girls 
They all came back after the club 
Every city I go, they show me love 
That's because we  real thugs 
Bet that ice make her drown in the tub 
Say she got that bag, told her put down on the drugs 
That the type of shit that make your nigga call in 
That the type of shit that make your nigga fall in love 
Pull up, I'm the life of the party
4x4 truck sittin' on Forgis
488 with a 8, that's Yachty
Lime Lamborghini sittin' pretty, that's Cardi
Blue Lamborghini Diablo, gon' Offset's
Havin' talks in the Wraith, 'bout to take off
Me and Pee in the Dawn havin' boss talks
Got the game from, bruh, that's where I walk
What am I gonna do when all these girls
In the city goin' crazy over me?
Take the tints off the car so they can see me
Slick, intimidatin', niggas wanna be me
PJ when we creepin', they won't ever see me
Ain't too into cameras, but they got to see me
Diamonds on my fingers, I'm a superstar
All in there like sneakin' with a superstar
Hit me if you want, I'm not gonna make a call
Marlo's still trappin' in them trap house
Cartier, solitaire, golf ball
Real big dog, I won't fuck with y'all
Made it to the charts, they know who I am
Shout out to my fans, really fuck with y'all
Internet beef, I won't get involved
If it's real problems, then it's gettin' solved
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, she lookin' like a movie, yeah 
I think that I'ma choose her, yeah 
Back that ass up, no Juvie, yeah 
Throw them racks, go stupid, yeah 
Squeeze my shot like Uzis, yeah 
When I slide on her, yeah 
Heard she wet, Jacuzzi, yeah 
Make me go, make me go, make me go lose it
When I say 
She gonna make a nigga lose it
I'm talkin' big money
Big money, thumb throughin' it 
Not through with it 
Not through with it 
She all on the phone with her last nigga
Say that pussy is mine, he losin' it 
She poppin' it, I'm ownin' it 
She droppin' it, it's stoppin' it , lose it 
Out of control, she movin' it 
It's movin' 
It's a movie 
She walkin' around in Nike leggings 
Just doin' it 
Don't get involved with her besties, they messy
Spent a fifty ball on her neckpiece, she flexing
I don't give no calls, I just hit her with the texting
Emoji all drippin', leakin' waterfalls, yeah
