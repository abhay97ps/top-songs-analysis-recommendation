When the chips are down back against the wall
Got no more to give 'cause we gave it all
Seems like going the distance is unrealistic
But we're too far from the start
So we take what comes and we keep on going
Leaning on each other's shoulders
Then we turn around
And see we've come so far somehow
We're halfway there, we're looking good now
Nothing's gonna get in the way
We're halfway there and looking back now
I never thought that I'd ever say
We're halfway there!
We're halfway there!
If we never flew, we would never fall
If the world was ours, we would have it all
But the life we live, isn't so simplistic
You just don't get what you want
So we take what comes and we keep on going
Leaning on each other's shoulders
Then we turn around
And see we've come so far somehow
We're halfway there, we're looking good now
Nothing's gonna get in the way
We're halfway there and looking back now
I never thought that I'd ever say
We're halfway there!
We're halfway there!
How you ever gonna reach the stars
If you never get off the ground?
And you'll always be where you are
If you let life knock you down
We're halfway there, we're looking good now
Nothing's gonna get in the way
We're halfway there and looking back now
I never thought that I'd ever say
We're halfway there! 
We're halfway there!
