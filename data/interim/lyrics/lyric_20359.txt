You can spend your whole life buildin'
Somethin' from nothin'
One storm can come and blow it all away
Build it anyway
You can chase a dream
That seems so out of reach
And you know it might not ever come your way
Dream it anyway
God is great, but sometimes life ain't good
And when I pray
It doesn't always turn out like I think it should
But I do it anyway, I do it anyway
This world's gone crazy
And it's hard to believe
That tomorrow will be better than today
Believe it anyway
You can love someone with all your heart
For all the right reasons
And in a moment they can choose to walk away
Love 'em anyway
God is great
But sometimes life ain't good
And when I pray
It doesn't always turn out like I think it should
But I do it anyway
Yeah, I do it anyway
You can pour your soul out singin'
A song you believe in
That tomorrow theyâ€™ll forget you ever sang
Sing it anyway
Yeah, sing it anyway, yeah yeah
I sing, I dream, I love anyway, yeah
