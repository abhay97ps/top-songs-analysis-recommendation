Something's hanging on your mind
I feel it in my heart
You've been leaving notes unsigned
Leaving out sweetheart
We used to have one breakfast table
Time to sit and talk to you
Now I face the morning paper
Won't you look at me
Tell me baby what's new
I can't leave in a house of strangers, baby
Can't we talk to each other
I can't leave in a house of strangers, darling
As one friend to another
Don't come home
Just fall asleep and
Turn down bed 
I can't live in a house of strangers, baby
Where's the famous loving smile
Where's my funny clown
I had you with me for a while
Thought you'd stick around
You were always good conversations
Now it seems there's nothing to say
What's the latest news in the nation
And where's my woman
Why did she go away
I can't leave in a house of strangers, baby
Can't we talk to each other
I can't leave in a house of strangers, darling
As one friend to another
Don't come home
Just fall asleep and
Turn down bed 
I can't live in a house of strangers, baby
And where's my woman
Why does she go away
I can't leave in a house of strangers, baby
Can't we talk to each other
I can't leave in a house of strangers, darling
As one friend to another
Don't come home
Just fall asleep and
Turn down bed 
I can't live in a house of strangers, baby
Can't we talk to each other
I can't leave in a house of strangers, darling
As one friend to another
