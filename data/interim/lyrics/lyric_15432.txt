Times are changing
And I'm changing too
A new direction and this nasty groove
Gets me over
In a funky way
This time make it funky
Make it funky this time
This time make it funky
Drop the bass and make it funky
I'm steady moving
I want this world to know
Just what I'm doing
I've got to take control
Made my mind
To come back hard this time
Yo, Tracie?
What?
Tell 'em what's on your mind
