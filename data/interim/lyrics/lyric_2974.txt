If she walks out on you
Don't come running back to me
Don't come running back to me
When you're alone and blue
Don't come running back to me
Don't come running back to me
If she's the one you want
Good luck and goodbye
I won't stand in your way
I won't even try
Someday you'll miss my kiss
You'll come knocking on my door
You'll come knocking on my door
But just remember this
I won't want you anymore
I won't want you anymore
When you wake up and find
I'm in your heart and on your mind
Don't come running back to me
Don't come running back to me
Don't come running back to me
When you wake up and find
I'm in your heart and on your mind
Don't come running back to me
Don't come running back to me
Don't come running back to me
