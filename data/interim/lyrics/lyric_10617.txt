Well, the sirens were singing that night in the city
When I first laid eyes on you
You appeared like a vision apart from the rhythm
That lives on the avenue
Oh, my heart was a fire, alive with desire
I felt it burn under my skin
And right then I wondered if this was the thunder
Of romance about to begin
Lightning struck, but I felt no pain
I stood there laughing in the pouring rain
And even the wind seems to whisper your name
Elena, my love
You bring out the stars up above
Come closer, Elena
And take all my love
Yeah, in the cool of an evening
I found out the meaning of love in your arms
You held me so tight as we lay in the midnight
I fell in the spell of your charms
But the night birds were callin'
As if they were warnin' Elena was only a dream
As night hits the city, the sirens start singin'
And that's when she comes back to me
Lightning strikes and I feel no pain
I stand here laughin' in the pourin' rain
And even the wind seems to whisper your name
Elena, my love
You bring out the stars up above
Come closer, Elena
And take all my love
I wasn't lookin' for a lover
But you were apart from the others
Won't you lay down and stay by my side?
Ah, yeah
Elena, my love
You bring out the stars up above
Come closer, Elena
And take all my love
Elena, my love
You bring out the stars up above
Come closer, Elena
And take all my love
Elena, my love
You bring out the stars up above
Come closer, Elena
And take all my love
Elena, my love
You bring out the stars up above
