Don't know what I'm gonna make of this
Feeling contemplative today
I'm used to finding solace
In what I bought or what I thought but
That's not going to be satisfactory today
CHORUS
Used to run and try to hide
Today I'll stay and pick a side
And if I die well least I tried
Yer standin' in my way...
Looked around this place to see where I belong
Feel misunderstood again today
It's such a strange sensation
Being my kind here in this time yeah
But that's not cause for much But aggravation today
CHORUS
Where was I - when Jimi kissed the sky?
And a Beatle said it's not too late to "Give peace a chance."
I survived The Brady Bunch, And the age of "let's do lunch"
Time is time - yeah time is time, Time and time again
CHORUS - CHORUS
