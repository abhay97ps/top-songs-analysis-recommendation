I've been driving for an hour
Just talking to the rain
You say I've been driving you crazy
And it's keeping you away
So just give me one good reason
Tell me why I should stay
'Cause I don't wanna waste another moment
Saying things we never meant to say
And I, take it just a little bit
I, hold my breath and count to ten
I've, been waiting for a chance to let you in
If I just breathe
Let it fill the space between
I'll know, everything is alright
Breathe
Every little piece of me, you'll see
Everything is alright
If I just breathe
Well, it's all so overrated
In not saying how you feel
So you end up watching chances fade
And wondering what's real
And I, give you just a little time
I, wonder if you realize
I've, been waiting 'til I see it in your eyes
If I just breathe
Let it fill the space between
I'll know, everything is alright
Breathe
Every little piece of me, you'll see
Everything is alright
If I just breathe
Breathe
So I whisper in the dark
Hoping you'll hear me
Do you hear me?
If I just breathe
Let it fill the space between
I'll know, everything is alright
Breathe
Every little piece of me, you'll see
Everything is alright
Yeah, yeah
Everything is alright, if I just breathe, breathe
I've been driving for an hour
Just talking to the rain
