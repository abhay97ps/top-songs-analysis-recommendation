So you're standing on a ledge
It looks like you might fall
So far down, or maybe you were thinking about jumping
Now you could have it all
If you learned a little patience
For though I cannot fly
I'm not content to crawl
So give me a little credit
Have in me a little faith
I want to be with you forever
If tomorrow's not too late
But it's always too late when you got nothing
So you say
And you should never let the sun set on tomorrow
Before the sun rises today
If I am another waste of everything you dreamed of
I will let you down
If I am only here to watch you as you suffer
I will let you down
So you're walking on the edge
And you wait your turn to fall
But you're so far gone
That you don't see the hands upheld to catch you
And you could find the fault
In the heart that you've been handed
For though you cannot fly
You're not content to crawl
And it's always too late when you got nothing
So you say
But you should never let the sun set on tomorrow
Before the sun rises
If I am another waste of everything you hoped for
I will let you down
If I am only here to watch you as you suffer
I will let you down
So you're standing on the ledge
It looks like you might fall
If I am another waste of everything you dreamed of
I will let you down 
If I am only here to watch you as you suffer
I will let you down 
The answers we find
Are never what we had in mind
So we make it up as we go along 
You don't talk of dreams
I won't mention tomorrow
We won't make those promises that we can't keep
I will never leave you
I will not let you down
I will never leave you
I will not let you down
