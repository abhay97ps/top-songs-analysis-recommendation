Oh, this old heart of mine
Been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away
I feel you're gon' to stay
Lonely nights that come
Memories that flow
Bringing you back again
Hurting me more and more and more
Maybe, maybe it's my mistake
To show this love, this love I feel inside
'Cause each day, each day that passes by
You got me never never knowing
If I'm coming or I'm going, but I
 Yes I do 
This old heart darling 
Weeps for you 
I try to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always makes me cry
The way you treat me leaves me incomplete
You're in for the day, gone for the week, now
But if you leave me a hundred times
Don't you know that a hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours, I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it
Tell the world about it, cause I
 Yes I do 
This old heart darling 
Weeps for you
