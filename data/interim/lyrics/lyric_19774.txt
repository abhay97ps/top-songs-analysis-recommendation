We had a dog named Bocephus living in the front yard
He liked sleeping out on the top of the car
He drank beer out of the mason jar
And he'd climb up on everyone in bed
A white frame house, a college town
A bunch of people always hanging around
No real problems we needed to drown but we tried our best anyway
We went to class just to pass the time, back in eighty nine
We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet
This old guitar taught me how to score, right there on the Lambda Chi porch
Mary Ann taught me a little more about wanting what you can't have
Sweatshirts and flag football, spring breaks down in Panama
For a while we had it all, we never dreamed it wouldn't last
We went to class just to pass the time back in eighty nine
We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet
We all kind of went our separate ways, but I swear it seems like yesterday
We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet
