Who's that girl?
The language of love slips from my lover's tongue
Cooler than ice cream and warmer than the sun
Dumb hearts get broken just like china cups
The language of love has left me broken on the rocks
But there's just one thing.  
Just one thing.  
But there's just one thing 
And I really wanna know
Who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me who's that girl?
The language of love has left me stony grey
Tongue tied and twisted at the price I had to pay
Your careless notions have silenced these emotions
Look at all the foolishness your lover's talk has done
Who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl?
But there's just one thing.  
Just one thing.  
But there's just one thing, 
Who?
Tell me
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
