Some time ago I told you that I needed you
It hurt me so when you said I don't mess with you
I love you long, you done me wrong
This is what you said to me
You've got to move two mountains drain a river dry
Turn the deep blue ocean for the stars in the sky
And if you do all this to prove your love is true
Maybe then I'll fall in love with you
I tried so hard cause all my love was true for you
It broke my heart, my best was not enough for you
Whenever I asked you for a kiss
You always told me this
You've got to move two mountains drain a river dry
Turn the deep blue ocean for the stars in the sky
And if you do all this to prove your love is true
Maybe then I'll fall in love with you
Table turned and here you are a beggin me
To take you back, you got me feelin sad and blue
I feel so bad I want to cry
I ain't gonna tell you no lie
You've got to move two mountains drain a river dry
Swim the deepest ocean pull the stars in the sky
And if you do all this to prove your love is true
Maybe then I'll fall in love with you
You've gotta move
You gotta swim
And if you want to do
Then I'll fall in love with you
You've gotta move
You gotta swim
And if you want to do
Maybe then I'll fall in love with you
