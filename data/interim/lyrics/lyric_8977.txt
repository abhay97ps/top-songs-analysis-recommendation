Don't go to bed with no price on your head, no
Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time, uh uh
Keep your eye on the sparrow when the going gets narrow
Don't roll the dice, if you can't pay the price, no, don't do it
Don't you run your feet down no dead-end street
Keep your eye on the sparrow when the going gets narrow
Keep your eye on the sparrow when the going gets narrow
Don't do me dirty or you're gonna get hurt, yeah 
Don't run away till you hear what I say
Keep your eye on the sparrow
When the going gets a little rough and narrow
Yeah, baby, keep your eye
Keep your eye on the sparrow
Honey, when the going
When the going gets narrow
