Yeah
The sun is shining everyday
The clouds never get in the way for you and me
I've known you just a week or two
But baby I'm so into you
Can hardly breathe
And I'm in so totally wrapped up
Emotionally attracted
So physically acting
So recklessly I need you
So desperately sure as the sky is blue
Baby, I love you
I love you
I never knew that I could feel like this
Can hardly wait till our next kiss
You're so cool
If I'm dreaming, please don't wake me up
Because baby I can't get enough
Of what you do
And I'm in so electrically charged up
Kinetically acting
Erratically need you
Fanatically you get to me
Magically sure as the sky is blue
Baby, I love you
I, I can't believe that this is real
The way I feel
Baby, I'm gone head over heels
And I'm in so totally wrapped up
Emotionally attracted
So physically acting
So recklessly I need you
So desperately sure as the sky is blue
Yeah
And I'm in so electrically charged up
Kinetically acting
Erratically need you
Fanatically you get to me
Magically sure as the sky is blue
Baby, I love you
Baby, I love you
Do you love me too
Baby, I love you
