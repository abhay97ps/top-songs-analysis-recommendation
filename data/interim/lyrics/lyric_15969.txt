Would you be with me if I had nothing
If I couldn't buy you something
Now you've got your share
And look who's paying
I got your thing together
Now you're not staying
I've worked hard
To get the things I have, ooh
Oh, I've worked hard
To get the things you need
And I wanna know
Why you wanna play on me
Why you wanna play
Why you wanna play on me
Why you wanna play
Oh
Shoo-doo
Shoo-doo
Is this just a game
That you're used to playing
Or am I just a fool that's chasing
Girl, I've tried my best to keep you happy
Instead you turned around
And tried to try me
I've worked hard
To get the things I have, hoo
Oh, I've worked hard
To get the things you need
And I wanna know
Why you wanna play on me
Why you wanna play
Said why you wanna play on me
Why you want to play
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Shoo-doo 
Baby, baby, baby 
Why you, why-why-why-why-why you
Why-why-why-why-why you
Why-why-why-why play your games on me
Why-why-why-why-why you
Why-why-why-why-why you
Play your game, play your game
Why-why-why-why-why you
Why you wanna play
Those silly games, oh
Why you wanna play, hoo
Those silly games, baby girl
Tryna rock my world
Shoo-doo 
Shoo-doo 
Say why you wanna play
Why you wanna play, baby girl

Why you want to play
Why you wanna play, hoo
Why you wanna play, hoo
Why you wanna play, hoo
Why you wanna play, ooh, hoo
Oh, oh, why you wanna play, baby girl

Why you wanna trip, baby, on me
