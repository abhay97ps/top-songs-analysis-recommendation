Ring, ring, telephone ring
Somebody says, "Baby whatcha doin'?"
I been wonderin' where you been
Now and then, I think about you and me
No use fightin' 'bout things we can't recall
It don't matter now at all
Just come on home, baby we'll laugh and sing
We'll make love and let the telephone ring
Ring, ring, doorbell ring
Baby come on in, got James Taylor on the stereo
I'm glad you come around, I've been feelin' down
Just talkin' to Tony and Mario
You know they make good conversation
Still it ain't no consolation
'Cause I got love, baby I'll give you some
If somebody comes, we'll let the doorbell ring
I said ring, ring, golden ring
Around the sun, around your pretty finger
Ring, ring, voices ring
With a happy tune, anybody can be a singer
The sun come up across the city
I swear you never looked so doggone pretty
Hand in hand we'll stand upon the sand
With the preacher man, let the wedding bells ring
Oh, hand in hand we'll stand upon the sand
With the preacher man, let the wedding bells ring
