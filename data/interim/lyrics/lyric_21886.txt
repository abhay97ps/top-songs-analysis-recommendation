One love, one heart
Let's get together and feel alright
Hear the children cryin' 
Hear the children cryin' 
Sayin' give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright
Sayin' let's get together and feel alright
Wo wo-wo wo-wo
Let them all pass all their dirty remarks
There is one question I'd really love to ask
One heart
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own?
Believe me
One love 
One heart 
Let's get together and feel alright
As it was in the beginnin' 
So shall it be in the end, alright 
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright
Let's get together and feel alright
One more thing
Let's get together to fight this Holy Armageddon 
So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom 
Have pity on those whose chances grows thinner
There ain't no hiding place from the Father of Creation
Sayin'...
One love 
One heart 
Let's get together and feel all right
I'm pleadin' to mankind 
What about the one heart? 
 Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright
 Let's get together and feel alright
