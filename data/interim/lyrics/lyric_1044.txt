I Wanna Thank You
Bobby Rydell
Written by Mann / Lowe /Appel
Hah hah hah
Hah hah hah
Scooby dooby doo
I wanna thank you
You left me made me blue
Sat around and cried for you
And then I dried my eyes
Found a girl that's paradise
She's my lady, the greatest in town
You know I wanna thank you, for puttin' me down
This girl is sweet and true
She treats me better than you
You gave me my big chance
And I found my dream romance
Goodbye, farewell, so long
You know you done me wrong
Its all turned out right
That girl has dynamite
