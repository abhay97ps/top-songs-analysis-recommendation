Fortunata woman
You know I wanted to fly
Make it by myself alone
But now I'm lookin' for a man
With a silver dollar shoeshine
I gotta get a way back home
Listen to me, woman
Can't you hear me callin'
I've got a lot of love to do
Don't you know I'm gonna cry some
I know I'm gonna die some
I gotta get back to you, child
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get, gotta get back to you, child
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get, gotta get back to you
Fortunata woman
The monkey man's dead
And the junkie didn't get too far
But I'm singin' my song
'Cause I got my head
And my bed and my red guitar
I'm a-rollin' down the highway
Now don't you get in my way
Mister, I'm a comin' through
Well, I know I'm gonna cry some
I know I'm gonna die some
I gotta get back to you, child
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get, gotta get back to you, child
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get, gotta get back to you, ah well
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get, gotta get back to you, ah babe
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get, gotta get back to you, well here I come
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get, gotta get back to you
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get, gotta get back to you, ah yeah
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get, gotta get back to you, babe
You know I gotta get back, gotta get back
You know I gotta get, gotta get back to you
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get, gotta get back to you
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get, gotta get back to you
