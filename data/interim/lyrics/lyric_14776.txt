I don't run for the money honey
It don't mean a thing
And the power and the glory
Never ever made a man a king
And I don't need to ride
In a long black limousine
I don't even need to see my picture
On the cover of a magazine
I just need a little satisfaction
And it hits me like a chain reaction
Talkin' bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it all
Talkin' bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it all
I don't need to read my name
All over the front page news
Better save your ink'.mister
'cause I ain't got no use
Maybe you could say that I'm
That I'm just another prisoner of love
It's the only thing I know for sure
To help me rise above
I just need a little satisfaction
And it hits me like a chain reaction
Talkin' bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it all
Talkin' bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it all
And it burns like a fire
And I feel it take me higher
It gets down under my skin
Makes me wanna give that wheel a spin
I just need a little satisfaction
And it hits me like a chain reaction
Talkin' bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it all
Talkin' bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it all
Talkin' bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it all
Talkin' bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it all
