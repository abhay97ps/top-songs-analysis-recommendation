She went to Paris feeling tragically hip
Wide open Visa with her daddy's consent
And a body that talks, so much love to be spent
He stole her heart on the Champs-Élysées
Left her empty Fendi on a silk pillowcase
A bad French mistake and she's never going back there again
This crazy world is rarely black and white
Sometimes right seems wrong but wrong feels right
Follow your heart but don't you get burned
You cross that line, you may never return, oh no
Weekend in Juarez with his tag along mate
Met two senoritas on a double blind date
A sweet tequila one night binge, too much to intake, yeah
One loaded suitcase got left in the van
Stopped at the border with some hot contraband
So long Uncle Sam 'cause you're never going back there again, oh no
This crazy world is rarely black and white
Sometimes right seems wrong but wrong feels right
Follow your heart but don't you get burned
You cross that line, you may never return
Facebook found my love on the line
World wide queen, man she was so fine
Got caught in a web, controlling my mind
Picture perfect with her Hollywood face
Was irreplaceable 'til I got replaced
Forget cyberspace, I'm never going back there again
I'm never going back, I'm never going back
I'm never going back there again
You can't make me go back, can't make me go back
I'm never going back there again
Never going back there again
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Never going back there again, no
Just let me get out, let me get out
