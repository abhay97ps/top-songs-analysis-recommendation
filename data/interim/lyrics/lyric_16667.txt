I’ve been going thru a lot
Still I’m handy, no cap
Because even when I’m sad
My productions at a max
I’m getting cash
You a mother fucking tax
I’m in my bag
Yours’ smelling like trash, yeah
I’m tryna get with some women
Of course I’m asking first
She just tryna talk about life
I’m down, we matchin’ first?
Rocket into space and backstroke along the comets
Yeah this girl got a celestial body, but she from planet earth
I’m in my notes, writing songs and she heard it
Now I got her singing and her pitch fuckin’ perfect
See I’m no, Max Scherzer, but I’m, not in the rafters
You get curved like batters, I guess I’m a catcher
Pros would draft ‘em, but exposures a bitch
Wishing’ for riches when I’m lonely, ’til I’m lonely and rich
An impossible niche that I’m pillow talking to Kim
’Til she stop the convo short and ask me, what’s the sitch
Like, whatcha mean? Whatcha want, a fuckin’ label?
Perspective interchangeable, imma let it sit
She just want the boy, I just want the Benjamins
President callin’, but I send him to messages
I’m the Don how I’m mobbin’, got heads bobbin like pendulums, my
Producer on the toms, I catch a beat like Edelman, they
Say that they’re better than Dom, but scores will settle it
In a fight for the life, styled after the Revenant
But she can come along, if she’s got morals
’Til my style blooms and shirts looking floral
’Til the day we smoking reef, in the whip colored coral
She talks about death, then ghosts in, paranormal
Got me feelin’ immortal, and her ex wanna quarrel
She 18, and this ain’t the Cold War, it’s winter formal
My allies got him dancing, now he’s seeing star shapes
We don’t pack guns, little bitch, we let the arms race
Showed that part to grand pop, he say thats hot
He’s thankful I’m his heir, not the rabbit or a bad mop
But while we’re talking hair, I might as well compare my shit bangs like I’m Demi Lovato, way back in Camp Rock
Playboy bunnies coming quicker than a slapshot
Hockey sippin’ women, so my brothers get no backwash
Though you so preppy, I’m biased when saying “chad, stop”
My ego big, my dough nuts: I’m a fat cop
Yeah, and now the college girls wanna
Bring me solace, cuz they study
Quantum physics, so they think they know my
Problems, give me brain and I’ll be better by
Mañana screaming Hakuna Ma-fuckin’-tata
I’ve been going thru a lot
Still I’m handy, no cap
Even when I’m sad
My productions at a max
A million in cash, you a mufuckin’ tax
I’m in my bag, yours’ smellin’ like trash
Kinda sorta like you got your team inside a jansport
Sure, I got a baddie with her feet up on the dashboard
She ain’t the greatest, I’ll know that I made it
The day sex changes, I’m not talking ‘bout the trans form
Yeah, I gotcha mad like a pissed parent, who
Had to keep the fucking child in a split marriage
Now they gotta bring the fuckin’ child while they run errands, whose
Running round and acting up, it’s gotcha so embarrassed
I got bars, little bitch, that’s for damn sure
But if she’s taking xans, it’s a no, if she cams, worse
But if she wanna treat me right
Then I’m baby no pampers
Honeys yelling bout me like they’re on the Maury Povich
I’m not a father but monitor sounds, got me awoken
Still lonely how I coast
Smoking stogies, thinking bout the wide open while doors
Closing
