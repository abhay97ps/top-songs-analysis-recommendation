Git git git! High!
Git git git! High!
Grrrraaah! Git git git git!
Sonny rollin' grams of wax
You got a bag and I got a bag
But they know the difference 
If you talking cash and I'm talking cash
But they know the difference 
They know the difference 
They know the difference 
You got a Wraith and I got a Wraith
But they know the difference 
Bought the machine in 2016
So they know the difference 
The diamonds is shinin', the rollie is clean
So they know the difference  
They know the difference 
They know the difference 
Your bitches is bad, and my bitches bad
But we know the difference  
In the trenches, gettin' back at it
With the haters and the backstabbers
Head huntin' for a wack rapper
Head huntin' for a wack rapper
I ain't really with the back and forthin', nigga
I'mma send a hundred stacks at ya
Nigga probably send the rats atya
Ninja turtle with a rat master
All this money won't stop, nigga
30 round that Glock, nigga
Feds lurkin', we hot, nigga
Swing through in that drop, nigga
Moon walkin' in that dealer, like it's Thriller with the skrilla
I'm a cop, nigga
I'm a killer, you a cop, nigga
Kick the door like we SWAT, nigga
They know the difference 
I really get it 
I'm with the scammers
I'm buying bags for all of my bitches 
Only the family
Keep all them niggas from out of my business 
'Cause I really did shit
I rapped about it, you know that I lived it
You got a bag and I got a bag
But they know the difference 
If you talking cash and I'm talking cash
But they know the difference 
They know the difference 
They know the difference 
You got a Wraith and I got a Wraith
But they know the difference 
Bought the machine in 2016
So they know the difference 
The diamonds is shinin', the rollie is clean
So they know the difference  
They know the difference 
They know the difference  
Your bitches is bad, and my bitches bad
But we know the difference 
Quavo!
Get to the bags , run up the racks 
My bitches are bad , your diamonds finessed 
Came in on a jet, 50 my neck 
30 my clip, I pour a eight and just sip 
I put the brick on the trip, I put the dick on her lip 
Money before the deal , I had to go bury a mill 
She wanna pop the whole perc 
I told her we splittin' that pill 
My niggas been in the field 
We know you put something in that seal 
Used to pull up in that Audi, I make the work do pilates
Screw the lil tip on the uzi, young nigga shootin' in silence
Huncho, I'm havin' the stars and stripes
Lil nigga you is a private 
Too much money that will change your life
Power moves on a island
You got a bag and I got a bag
But they know the difference 
If you talking cash and I'm talking cash
But they know the difference 
They know the difference 
They know the difference 
You got a Wraith and I got a Wraith
But they know the difference 
Bought the machine in 2016
So they know the difference 
The diamonds is shinin', the rollie is clean
So they know the difference  
They know the difference 
They know the difference 
Your bitches is bad, and my bitches bad
But we know the difference
