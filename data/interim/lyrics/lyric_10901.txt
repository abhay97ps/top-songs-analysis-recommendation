He's triggered by the rise of their suburban eyes
He likes to stroke the curls of pretty baby girls
And he will never make it on the hit parade, oh no
Behind the counter selling health and beauty aids
In the name of pretty girls
So pretty girls look good on you
Those pretty girls, So pretty girls
Look good on you
Reserves the luxury of feline company
Femme fatale is all he needs to measure his heroic deeds
Another trying day behind the canopy of lust
He's nurtured by a planned, well tanned philosophy
For the love of pretty girls
Those pretty girls look good on you
Pretty girls, Those pretty girls
Look good on you
I told you that he'd get you right between the eyes
For the love of pretty girls
Those pretty girls look good on you
Those pretty girls, So pretty girls
Look good on you
Ah, Pretty girls, Those pretty girls
Look good on you, Look good on you
Pretty girls, Those pretty girls
Look good on you, Hey, Mister
Ah, Pretty girls, Those pretty girls
Look good on you, Look good on you
Pretty girls, So pretty girls
Look good on you, Yeah good on you, Yeah
