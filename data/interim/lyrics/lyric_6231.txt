Drinking wine from a brown paper bag
I began to feel it
Blaring music I don't want to come back
From this spinning dreaming
No one knows but everybody sees
My bottle of drag
In a brown paper bag
Brown paper bag
On the street where the night life goes
Brown paper bag
Honky tonk bars with the doors flug out
All the people talking
No one knows but everybody sees
My bottle of drag
In a brown paper bag
Brown paper bag
Screw the cap and take your time
Brown paper bag
Pass it over my way
Brown paper bag
Throw the bag as it goes down
Brown paper bag
And soon it's gone away
No one knows but everybody sees
My bottle of drag
In a brown paper bag
