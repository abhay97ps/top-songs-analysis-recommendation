Fly with my dogs, ridin' high when we pull up 
Fly with my dogs, ridin' high when we pull up 
When we ride, when we pull up

Coupe with the top down, no ceilings
Rocks on the watch now, armageddon
Roof on fire, fire, we ride wild
Pull up in a tank, 'bout it, 'bout it 
Yeah, on Ciroc, in the drop, full of beans
Yeah, we the squad, 100 cars full of tings
Yeah, I pull up with fire, boy, the chinchilla
Yeah, it's Frenchy Montana, Thrilla in Manila
Roof on fire, we be higher like a wheelie
Shawty bad, talkin' MJ "Thriller"

I can't feel my body 'cause I pop a lot of molly 
Welcome to the party, bitch, I'm 'bout to catch a body 
Punch him in his shit, we don't give a fuck about it 
Bitch, I start a riot, bitch, I'm 'bout to start a riot 
Welcome to the trap , got my grandma selling crack 
I make what you make in one year sitting down just movin' packs 
Make a bitch do jumpin' jacks , like she was a acrobat 
Got these bitches lookin' at me crazy 'cause I got face tats 
Ooh, drip, drip, drip, I cannot go wife a bitch 
Drop five million on my crib, now Lil Pump is rich as shit, ooh
And I'm still on my probation, pop a pill, I feel amazing 
You just broke and you just hatin', all these diamonds on me skatin'
Man, I do this every day, spend three thousand on some shades
I got bitches in L.A., your boyfriend broke, his diamonds fake
