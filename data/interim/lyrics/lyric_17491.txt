Drove downtown in the rain
Nine-thirty on a Tuesday night
Just to check out the late-night record shop
Call it impulsive
Call it compulsive
Call it insane
But when I'm surrounded
I just can't stop
It's a matter of instinct
It's a matter of conditioning
A matter of fact
You can call me Pavlov's dog
Ring a bell and I'll salivate
How'd you like that?
Dr. Landy tell me
You're not just a pedagogue
Because right now I'm
Lying in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did
Well I am
Lying in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did
So I'm lying here
Just staring at the ceiling tiles
And I'm thinking about
Oh, what to think about
Just listening and re-listening
To Smiley Smile
And wondering if this is some kind of creative drought
Because I'm
Lying in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did
Well I am
Lying in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did
And if you want to find me
I'll be out in the sandbox
Wondering where the hell all the
Love has gone
I'm playing my guitar and
Building castles in the sun 
And singing "Fun, Fun, Fun"
Lying in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did
Well I am
Lying in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did
I had a dream
That I was three hundred pounds
And though I was very heavy
I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground
I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground 
Somebody help me
I couldn't see the ground
Somebody help me
I couldn't see the ground
Somebody help me
Because I'm
Lying in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did
Well I am
Lying in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did
Drove downtown in the rain
Nine-thirty on a Tuesday night
Just to check out the late-night record shop
Call it impulsive
Call it compulsive
Call it insane
But when I'm surrounded
I just can't stop
