Knock the apple off any bum with a hollow heat seaker
Red Cross bitch niggas, fuck the pint, she take blood by the liter
I'll never leave her, my vicious vixen
On liquor, send that ass to God quicker
No matter yo religion, you Muslim, Hebrew or a Christian
She indiscriminate with punishment, she send 'em missin'

No, I ain't bad, just don't kiss no ass or take shit
And I'm a grown man, find you somebody to play with
If you don't like me when you see me, better not say shit
I'll choke yo ass out like Dre did that bitch
You better tell these pussies they ain't fucking with no rookie
I'm a Bankhead nigga, I'll take yo cookies!
So don't make it a me or you situation
I'll have ya partner down at I.C.U. visitation
Like, hope for the best, but I don't think he gon' make it
Not the way he was shiverin and shakin on the pavement
I'll tell you what, if you make it, call him Grace cause he amazing
Find out these verses wasn't the only thang blazing
And just when you thought that I was done, I was saving
The best for last, nigga kiss my ass
Like Della Reese, they my folks, it's best you just let 'em be
Cause I do this shit, pretend, confessions you'll never see, nigga!
So I'm outside of the club and he think I'm a puuuuuuuunk
So I go to my loaded TEC-9 that's off in the truuuuuuuunk
