If you were mine
I'd be your everything
And you'd be the only thing
That I would ever need
If you were mine
I would tell everyone
That you are the only one
That I could ever want
Ohhh yeaaa
Everything I dreamed about
Everything that I talked about
One thing I can't live without
I wanna get closer to you
Can't stand being far away
Knowing that you don't
Feel the same way
Watching him bring
Tears to your eyes
Ohhh yeaaa
All words I sing about
All the letters I write about
Only thing I wanna hear about
Is when I get closer to you
I know that there is someone else
But he's only thinking of himself
Doesn't make any sense for
You to be lonely
Ohhh yeaaa
Let me be the one you share
Your hopes and dreams with
You'll never be alone again
'Cuz I will hold you endlessly
Please don't be afraid
To let your broken heart guide you
Into these open arms that
Long to surround you, baby
