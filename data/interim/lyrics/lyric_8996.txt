We gon' get this motherfucker right man
If we don't get anything else, if this is the last jam this is IT
We gon' get this motherfucker right now
Aww yeah, so funky
Four o'clock, in the motherfuckin' morning
And it goes on and on and on and onn
I'm Omniscence and I'm about to swing it like this y'all
Check it out
Trust me like the Guru
The shit you be kickin' is doodoo
When it comes to crew I got more troopers than Isuzu
Put your rhymes in the dryer
Then call me your sire
If you played hockey in Philly you couldn't be no Flier than Omniscence
I been kickin' shit like this since I was 16
So a battle make no difference
So pump up the Ron G and pass the ganjy
I'm jumpin' motherfuckers like my name was Bungee
And you can't say nothin' 'bout the money I be earnin'
I'm lynchin' more niggas than the Mississippi Burnin' so I
One, two, give me my propers
I got more soul than the Mammas and the Pappas
Call the Crimestoppers
Because my shit is on the run black
Gotta say peace to that nigga named Contac
Because yes y'all, we goin' straight to the top
So shut the fuck up because I gotta have props
Nipsy Russell is down with us yes
David Roughin is down with us
Bobby Womack is down with us
And kickin' shit like this is a definite must
Now peace to the dreads and the skunk heads
Niggas sleepin' on my skills like bunk beds
Rippin' microphones yo, that's my passtime
And ain't jack shit changed since the last time
Yo it's class time
I'm schoolin' niggas like Yale
Bitches on my woody cause the rhymes that I sell
So don't ya ever in your life try to run a mental
Cause I fly more heads than fuckin' Continental
Comin' straight from the motherfuckin' gutter
Don't call me Parkay, because my shit is straight butter
I pack bongs with weed
I got what the hoes need
I keep emcees runnin' kinda like a nosebleed
Ducks accumulate kinda like fan mail
And yo I bust that ass like my name was Dan Quail
Cool in the Game, they down with us
Yes indeed, Sam Cook is down with us
B.B. King is down with us
And kickin' shit like this is a definite must
No jokin', no shuckin' or jivin'
On a scale to 10 you better give me a 5 and another 5
Cause I'm fat like that
You got a .38 snub? I got a Gat like that
I stay strapped like the movie, got my brothers and the doobie
Shootin' down crews like my name was Jack Moody
So the year is '93 and I'm the Funky One Liner
Lyrics be tighter than a nun's vagina
Niggas try to bluff but they can't do me 'nuff see
I don't give a fuck how many blunts you puff, you ain't tuff
Bitin' my shit like McGruff
So ring Bobby Brown and you still won't be good enough
You dirty rats, you got a trick up your sleeve again
But like Tony Braxton your ass will never breathe again
I got a motherfuckin' blast for that ass
So check it out y'all cause I'm built to last and I'm
Kool Moe Dee is down with us, yes indeed
Todd Bridges is down with us
Peabo Bryson is down with us
And kickin' shit like this is a definite must
Cause we rude

And that's how we doin' it for the motherfuckin' nine four
