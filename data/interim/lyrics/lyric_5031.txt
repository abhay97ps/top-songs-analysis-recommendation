I remember 
When I used to play shoot 'em up
I remember
When I chased the girls and beat 'em up
But I was young and didn't understand
But now I'm a grownup man
I know girls are made for kissing
Never knew what I was missing
Now my life is not the same
My whole world has been rearranged
I went from 
Oh, yes, I did 
I remember 
When I used to see you jumping rope
And I remember
When you got your first baby coach
But you were young and didn't understand
Now you're a woman and I'm a man
And it's me that you're kissing
Ain't it fun reminiscing?
And our lives are not the same
Our whole world has been rearranged
You went from 
Oh, yes, you did 
And I went from 
Oh, yes, I did
Now it's me that you're kissing
Ain't it fun reminiscing?
And our life is not the same
This whole world has been rearranged
I went from 
Oh, yes, I did 
And you went from 
Oh, yes, you did 
Oh, yes 
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout
