Do do do, wah
Shooby dooby
Do do do, wah
Shooby dooby
Now how can you tell me
How much you've missed me
When the last time I saw you
You wouldn't even kiss me
Now that rich guy you've been seein'
He must have put you down
So welcome back, baby
Back to the poor side of town
To him you were nothing
But a little plaything
Girl, you were not much more
Than just another overnight fling
To me, you were the greatest thing
This boy had ever found
And, girl, it's so hard to find nice things
Here on the poor side of town
I don't blame you for trying
I'm trying to make it too
But I've got one little hangup, baby
You know I just can't make it without you
So tell me
Are you gonna stay now?
I wanna know, will you stand by me, girl
All the way now
Oh, with you by my side
I know they can't keep us down
'Cause together, we're gonna make it, baby
Right here on the poor side of town
Do do do, wah
Shooby dooby
Do do do, wah
Shooby dooby
