Every night
I sit here by my window 
Staring at the lonely avenue 
Watching lovers holding hands and laughing 
And thinking bout the things we used to do
Like a walk in the park 
Like a kiss in the dark (Things
Like a sailboat ride 
What about the night we cried
Things like a lovers vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinking bout the things we used to do
Memories are all I have to cling to 
And heartaches are the friends I'm talking to 
When I'm not thinking of just how much I loved you
Well I'm thinking about the things we used to do
Like a walk in the park 
Like a kiss in the dark 
Like a sailboat ride 
What about the night we cried
Things like a lovers vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinking bout the things we used to do
I still can hear the jukebox softly playing 
And the face I see each day belongs to you 
Though there's not a single sound
And theres nobody else around
Well it's just me thinking of the things we used to do
Like a walk in the park 
Like a kiss in the dark 
Like a sailboat ride 
What about the night we cried
Things like a lovers vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinking bout the things we used to do
And the heartaches are the friends I'm talking to
You got me thinking bout the things we used to do
