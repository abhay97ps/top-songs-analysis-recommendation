And hold me in the light
Your lips are so close to mine but the time is running out

My window shade, oh God I pray
Don't wake me up, Michael
Don't wake me up in the morning, Michael
Unless you love me enough to stay
I want you here in the morning, Michael
Please don't go away
 Don't wake me up
 Don't wake me up
 Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up in the morning, Michael
