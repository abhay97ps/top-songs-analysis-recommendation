Hoo! Oooooh!
Shadows on the mountain, and the night begins to fall
Gather up the children, 'fore the darkness takes us all
Tribe has come together, standin' naked against the night
Twenty feet from the fire, the evil waits with zombie eyes
Eye-eye-eye eye of the Zombie!
Eye-eye-eye eye of the Zombie!
Oh! Sneakin' through the long grass on leopard feet silently
A beast already dead comes to join the dance on the zombie
Ooh! Time has come again - again the moment of truth
The terror is at hand, and there's nothin' you can do
Eye-eye-eye eye of the Zombie!
Eye-eye-eye eye of the Zombie!
Oh! Hoo! Aaa-aah! Hoo! Aaa-aaa-aaaah!
From out of nowhere he's there, flashing hideous teeth
Panic in the crowd, helter-skelter, we're brought to our knees
Back to the darkness, back on the mountain he stands
You can't fight a shadow, you can't kill a dead man
Eye-eye-eye eye of the Zombie!
Eye-eye-eye eye of the Zombie!
Eye-eye-eye eye of the Zombie!
Eye-eye-eye eye of the Zombie!
Eye-eye-eye eye of the Zombie!
Eye-eye-eye eye of the Zombie!
Eye-eye-eye eye of the Zombie!
Eye-eye-eye eye of the Zombie!
