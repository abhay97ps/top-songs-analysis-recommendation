It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time
But say a prayer
Pray for the other one
Oh, at Christmas time it's hard
But when you're having fun
 world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas bells that ring
Are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight thank God it's them 
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time 
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life 
Where nothing ever grows 
No rain or rivers flow 
Do they know it's {Christmas time at all?}
Here's to you 
Here's to them 
Do they know it's Christmas time at all? 
Da-da-da-da-da
Da, da-daah
Da-da-da-da-da
