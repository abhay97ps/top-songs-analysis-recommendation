It's the middle of the day
And we both have thrown a fit
The tv is on
But neither one of us is watching it
Now your problem is
Everytime my pager go off
I don't pay it no mind
And my problem is
Everytime the phone rings
You go get it and you run and hide
Now if Theres two people between us that don't exist
And we're both gonna go on lying
Ain't nothin' good about that baby
We're both guilty of The John Doe crime
Who was that guy who paged you?
Who was that guy that waved at you?
Who was that guy who called you?
Who was that guy I saw you with?
How did you get some extra money?
When I needed some you told me
Is this love affair over?
Tell me His name
Yeah I know this thing started out all good
Remember when you didn't have a dime
I did what I could
Took a chance, and put you on my account
Now your flossin' to some female, showin' the amount
That's why I trip on shit like your pager
All in my face, blowin' up, and you get it later
And the reason I run in the room with the phone all the time
Because you are guilty of the John Doe crime
Who was that girl that paged you?
Who was the girl that called  you?
Who was the girl that waved at you?
Who Was The Girl I Saw You With
