Been a while since I have sang to you
And it?s been hard for quite some time
So many things I should?ve said to you
I guess ill say a few of them tonight
Tonight i?m gonna think of you
Tomorrow you?ll be on my mind
See that pretty girl right over there
I thank the lord that I can call her mine
Baby tell me you?re alright
So I can fall asleep tonight
Baby show me one more smile
To take my focus off your eyes
And baby tell me that you here to stay
If it?s a year or just for one more day
I wouldn?t have it any other way
I know that now I can say
?I love you babe.?
People tell me that i?m losing it
Life?s to fast to take it slow
I guess they've never felt like this before
When i?m feeling, how I?m feeling
And I?m feeling like I?m lucky that I found someone
Who just makes waking up worth while
People say too bad we started so young
But, you taught me how
You taught me how to love someone
Baby tell me you?re alright
So I can fall asleep tonight
Baby show me one more smile
To take my focus off your eyes
And baby tell me that you here to stay
If it?s a year or just for one more day
I wouldn?t have it any other way
I know that now I can say
?I love you babe.?
Baby, girl you know you drive me so crazy
When I sleep you?re all I dream of lately
I'm just tryin? say ?I love you babe.?
Baby, my baby, baby
