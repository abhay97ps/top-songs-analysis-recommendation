I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
I don't have happiness, and I guess
I never will ever again
When you walked out on me, in walked ol' misery
And he's been here since then
I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you...you...you...youâ€¦
