Through the night, through the dawn
Behind you another runner is born
Don't look back
You've been there
See the mist as your breath hits the air
And it's underneath the moonlight, passing some
Still your heart beats in the moonlight, like a drum
Through the night, through the dawn
Behind you another runner is born
Don't look back
You've been there
Feel the mist as your breath hits the air
And it's underneath the moonlight, passing some
Still your heart beats in the moonlight, like a drum
And you will run your time
A shooting star across the sky
And you will surely cross the line
To pass on the flame
Sun come up, sun go down
Hear the feet, see the sweat on the ground
Watch your step
Keep your cool
Though you can't see what's in front of you
And it's underneath the moonlight, passing some
Still your heart beats in the moonlight, like a drum
And you will run your time
A shooting star across the sky
And you will surely cross the line
Just to pass on the flame
Pass on the flame
Through the night, through the dawn
Behind you, another runner is born
Don't look back
You've been there
See the mist as your breath hits the air
And it's underneath the
Moonlight passing some
Still your heart beats in the moonlight like a drum
And you will run your time
A shooting star across the sky
And you will surely cross the line
And it's underneath the moonlight, passing some
Still your heart beats in the moonlight, like a drum
And you will run your time
A shooting star across the sky
And you will surely cross the line
And it's underneath the moonlight, passing some
Still your heart beats in the moonlight, like a drum
And you will run your time
A shooting star across the sky
And you will surely cross the line
