I don't wanna take it anymore
I'll just stay here locked behind the door
Just no time to stop and get away
'Cause I work so hard to make it every day
Whoo-ooh
Whoo-ooh
There's no money falling from the sky
'Cause a man took my heart and robbed me blind
Someone stole my brand new Chevrolet
And the rent is due, I got no place to stay
Whoo-ooh
Whoo-ooh
And it's hard to say
Just how some things never change
And it's hard to find
Any strength to draw the line
Oh, I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance
I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance
Industry don't pay a price that's fair
All the common people breathing filthy air 
Roof caved in on all the simple dreams
And to get ahead your heart starts pumping schemes
And it's hard to say
Just how some things never change
And it's hard to find
Any strength to draw the line
Oh, I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance 
I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance
Whoo-ooh
I'm on fire, yeah
I'm on fire, yeah
And it's hard to say
Just how some things never change
And it's hard to find
Any strength to draw the line
Oh, I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance 
I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance
I know there's a pot of gold for me
All I got to do is just believe
Oh, I'm so happy doin' the neutron dance
And I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance
I'm so happy doin' the neutron dance 
I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance 
Whoo-ooh
Whoo-ooh
I'm so happy doin' the neutron dance
I'm so happy doin' the neutron dance
Whoo-ooh
Whoo-ooh
I'm so happy, I'm just burnin'
I'm so happy, I'm just burnin'
I'm so happy, I'm just burnin'
I'm so happy, I'm just burnin'
I'm so happy, I'm just burnin'
I'm so happy, I'm just burnin'
