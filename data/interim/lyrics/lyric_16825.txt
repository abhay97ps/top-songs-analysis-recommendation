So you're scared to show your feelings
Baby I do understand
I don't make a promise I can't keep
I vow to be a real good friend
In those big green eyes I see a glow of love
I just hope that I'm the one you're dreaming of
Let me be the one to love you
Let me be the one to care
Let me be the one to light your flame
Oh baby, Oh baby
Let me be the one
We spend all our time together
We can't stand to sleep alone
When you say you have to leave for now
I miss you before you're gone
All along we thought this was absurd 
Every moment that we spend goes by too fast
Darling Darling take this chance with me
As I have eyes only for you
Oh baby
Let me be the one to love you
Let me be the one to care
Let me be the one to light your flame
Oh baby, come on
Let me be the one
Let me be the one to love you
Let me be the one to care
Let me be the one to light your flame
Oh baby, come on
Let me be the one
For you
Don't be scared to show your feelings
Cause baby I do understand
I don't make no promises I can't keep
I vow to be a real good man
All along we thought that this was absurd 
Every moment that we spend goes by too fast
Darling Darling take this chance with me
Cause I have eyes only for you
Let me be the one to love you
Let me be the one to care
Let me be the one to light your flame tonight
Oh baby baby baby baby
Let me be the one to love you
Let me be the one to care
Let me be the one to light your flame tonight
