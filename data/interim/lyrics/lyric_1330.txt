Project mode, I'm ready to drop
Always been on fire but I've never been on
Inspired by Ready To Die, but I ain't ready to stop
Why you think I put in work instead of getting a job
Instead of getting courvoised
I made a drink 
Still under the influence of what they think
I got niggas on their square and their not masons
Just illuminated chains
Ever seen slaves whip
Ever seen a snakes hip
With a Major Lazer on it
You can really make hits
You just gotta pain for it
They call it dirty money cause you've got a stain for it
Only way to wash it off is when the profit ain't laundered
Always had a vision it was never on sight
When there's people counting on you don't forget to count twice
Even with these fiftys on me
I know Jah rules
When I had a shanty on me
I was always on time
All that B tryna make Beyonce queen
Excuse me miss I'm just a young Jay Z
Looking back we didn't ever really make P
Ballin wasn't ballin till we got on FIFA 18
Ronaldo edition
A pictures worth a thousand words
Now we take thousands of pictures
Trends come and go, I never style for the minute
They'll teef from you when they should be crowning your wisdom
No grills, still drop gems when I speak
I don't do a lot of vids, I render the scene
They where really tryna pimp a butterfly
Damn, good kid, mad city I was Kendrick and tee
Then I went Uni, my mum needed me at home
Now if I go Uni I don't need a student loan
It was hard being me, I'm not an easy yout to clone
So if you bite off me, you need to chew the bone
Cause this is way deeper than what you see in the flesh
They write about me in the press, I need to impress
They want to see the end of me in the ends
I'm just minding my own business, so I need to invest
Looking at the stock market with a golden eye
Just so I can buy bonds and then hang in Shanghai
Ever seen the skyfall, every damn night
With Pierce Brosnan, that selling man white
What we gotta do to get Idris on the next one
What they gonna do when their affection don't affect us
So much food for thought I'm in a restaurant
That does humble pie, so you can get some
You don't get a lot of capital from 1Xtra
When they first buy my record, it had my head spun
Now the royalty checks are fit for a king
I see the queen's face so much I call her step-mum
My real mum told me never let her down
It was sink or swim, I never let her drown
I had my head above the water, now I think about the flow
I don't think about growin', I think about growth
I'm coming of age; twenty four years old
Might spend twenty four on 24k gold
I'm with twenty four niggas, that's twenty four carat magic
I'm Bruno Mars with the flow
Got Versace on the floor and medusa's head on me
No carb diet because I'm used to bread on me
They slept on me, lucky I got used to Zs on me
I got fed up of having the feds on me
Now I'm my own man but I know my ends got me
Give the man the props so he could be himself properly
Joke ting how they want to jockey me
I'm in a polo with some creed on, smelling like Rocky
Balboa, show me the money and I'll show up
Pull up in a boat full of bitches, I'm Noah
Even on a Tuesday, watch the club go up
But there's a party next door that's selling drinks to no-one
I might not rap for a year and do melody
I'm just tryna turn all this gas into chemistry
Intimate shows where I can't perform Energy
Didn't know I'd be world class in assembly
Guess the best moments are the ones you can't picture
And the best stories are the ones you can't insta
I had to raise the bar with the bars
Now niggas buying out the bar at the Bar Mitzvah
I was too shallow to ever get the shalom
Now I'm drinking like a boss in French; that's patron
Growing up, we never had googles, we never had chromes
Tell me why the fuck is my little cousin googling chromes
To the new kids playin' out, played out
Never play yourself, that's nothing to play down
My background's turning into death's playground
A part of me died when it took my mates out
But I'm finally living, I'm loving this new life
Running the game instead of running from blue lights
I could've done time a few times
But my new project's out now, I'm no longer the new guy
