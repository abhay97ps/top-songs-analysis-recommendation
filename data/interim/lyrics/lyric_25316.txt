Said she tired of little money, need a big boy
Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil’ Troy
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy
Shawty mixing up the vodka with the LaCroix, yeah
G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen
All the housewives pullin’ up 
I got a lot of toys, 720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy
You was talkin' shit in the beginning 
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin' 
I know it piss you off to see me winnin' 
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin’ , yeah
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" 
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me 
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me 
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" 
Everywhere I go 
Catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo 
750 Lambo in the Utah snow 
Trunk in the front like that shit Dumbo, yeah
Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck
Pull up to the house with some big butts
Turn the kitchen counter to a strip-club 
Me and Dre came for the...
When I got guap, all of y'all just appeared 
Before I dropped Stoney, none of y'all really cared 
Now they always say, "Congratulations," to the kid 
And this is not a 40, but I'm pourin' out this shit 
Used to have a lot, but I got more now 
Made another hit 'cause I got bored now 
Always goin' for it, never punt fourth down
Last call, Hail Mary, Prescott touchdown, ayy
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me 
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army 
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" 
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me 
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me 
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow"
Got 'em sayin', "Wow"
Ayy, ayy, wow
Sayin', "Wow"
Wow
