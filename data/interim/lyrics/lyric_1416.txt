Whoa, oh, it started all over again
Whoa, oh, I love you all over again
I thought that I could ignore you
But last night I looked up and saw you
And whoa, oh, it started all over again
You smiled and put me right back in a trance
You smiled and I didn't have half a chance
I said it's over and done with
And I found someone new to have my fun with
But whoa, oh, it started all over again
You took my hand and I felt
It melt my heart again
You took my hand and I loved you
Too much to be swapped again
Whoa, oh, it started all over again
Oo, whoa, oh, I love you all over again
I thought that I could ignore you
But last night I looked up and saw you
And, whoa, oh, it started all over again
Let me tell you now
Whoa, oh, it started all over again
Whoa, oh, I love you all over again
I said it's over and done with
And I found someone to have my fun with
But whoa, oh it started all over again
