Hey, get up, get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now
Hey, get up, get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now
It's the same old, same grind
But we don't feel we're wasting time
Not so bored that we can't find a better way
My friends, my kind
No one's gettin' left behind
If they did, it'd be a crime, that's why we say
Let the music start a revolution 
No time to play it safe
Hey, get up, get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now
Hey, get up, get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now
They can't, we can
Parents might not understand
Havin' fun without a plan, but that's what we do
We're all here 
Gonna make this party grow
Together we can make it blow 
The music's gonna start a revolution 
Too late to play it safe
Hey, get up, get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now
Hey, get up, get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now
We don't have to paint by numbers
Let our voice come out from under
Hear it rise, feel the thunder
It's time to lose control
Hey, get up, get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now
Hey, get up, get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now
Pumpin' up the party now, party now, party now
Hey, get up, get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now
Hey, get up, get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now
Hey, get up, get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now
Hey, get up, get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now
