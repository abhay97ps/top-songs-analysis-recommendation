Well the south side of Chicago
It's the baddest part of town
And if you go down there, you better just beware
Of a man named Leroy Brown
Now Leroy more than trouble
He stood about six feet four
All the downtown ladies call him: "treetop lover"
The studs they call him: "Sir"
He's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog
Now Leroy he's a gambler
And he likes his fancy clothes
He likes to wave his diamond rings
In front of everybody's nose
He's got a custom Continental
He's got an Eldorado too
He's got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe
Yeah he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And he's meaner than a junkyard dog
Well Friday - 'bout a week ago
Leroy shootin' dice
And at the edge of the bar, sat a lady named Dorris
And man, she sure looked nice
Well he layed his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
And Leroy Brown he learned a lesson 'bout messin'
With the wife of a jealous man
Yeah he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog
He's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
A badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog
Yeah, he's bad old King Kong
Badder than a junkyard dog
