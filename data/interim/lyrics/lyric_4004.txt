Me for you, you for me, me for you, you for me
Me  for you, you for me, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Me  for you, you for me, me for you, you for me
Me for you, you for me 
Baby
The  toys hanging from my neck 
Surrounded  by flowers and bills 
We are worldwide to the fullest 
And  look "bang-bang" if you mess with us , heh
You don't want me to pull the trigger 
I don't care if your love compromises me 
With you I bet everything on number seven 
If  I fall, you hold me 
You for me and me for you, they can put me the handcuffs 
We are two singers like the ones back then
Respect in tickets and diamonds
My heart stops just by looking at you
Because I sing to you so that you sing to me
We are two singers like the ones back then
Respect in tickets and diamonds
My heart stops just by looking at you
Because I sing to you so that you sing to me
Me for you, you for me, me for you, you for me
Me for you, you for me, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Me for you, you for me, me for you, you for me
Me for you, you for me 
Me for you, you for me, me for you, you for me
Me for you, you for me, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Me for you, you for me, me for you, you for me
Me for you, you for me 
And me for you, you for me, who would say it? 
You're unique, mamacita Rosalía
You have the power that diverts my mind 
I would do anything for you
You have what the others didn't have 
So different from what they told me about you 
I bumped into your chemistry, lucky me
I would spend what I have because your eyes would shine
And who would say it?
That this song would sound everywhere
I bumped into your chemistry, lucky me
I would spend what I have because your eyes would shine, yeah
We are two singers like the ones back then
Respect in tickets and diamonds
My heart stops just by looking at you
Because I sing to you so that you sing to me
We are two singers like the ones back then
Respect in tickets and diamonds
My heart stops just by looking at you
Because I sing to you so that you sing to me
Me for you, you for me, me for you, you for me
Me for you, you for me, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Me for you, you for me, me for you, you for me
Me for you, you for me 
Me for you, you for me, me for you, you for me
Me for you, you for me, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Me for you, you for me, me for you, you for me
Me for you, you for me 
Me for you, you for me, me for you, you for me
Me for you, you for me, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Me for you, you for me, me for you, you for me
Me for you, you for me
