Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culâ€”
I'ma put these racks in your face
In your face, show you that you lame
I'ma stash these Ms at my place
In my place, but no I'm not the bank
I'ma pull that coupe out to race
Who wanna race? We livin' that fast pace
I'ma pull these hoes, I don't chase
Hit these hoes, get 'em right out my face
I'ma pull the strap close case
Hit a nigga hard, send him dat way
I'ma put the gang on your plate 
You can't eat on my plate 
Mount it up like the horse on Raris 
Beat that pot like Ortiz, yeah 
Two feet runnin' from the feds 
All these niggas lookin' like they scared 
Lock a fuck nigga like these dreads 
Pick a nigga off for that bread 
We can go there if you want to 
I'll come down if you want to 
Load up the rounds if you want to 
Hop out, see what you gon' do 
We can go there if you want to 
I'll come down if you want to 
Load up on the rounds if you want to 
Hop out, gotta see what you gon' do 
We don't play with dem lil' boys out here, naw, naw, naw 
Big boy bosses all in my seminar 
Big boy Wraith had them bitches seein' stars stars 
Stock me out, I don't need no rims on cars 
It's okay 
Icing, Icing glaze 
I don't take breaks
Shit, I'm 'bout to go blaze? 
What's yo' page? 
Slide in the DM like snakes 
The coupe got blaze 
The coupe got wings with blaze

The higher you go , went through the most 
We get to fly, you float 
No Malone, but I post 
Migos, you know we the goats 
Bag of bread, call it loaf 
I shoot at that boy, then reload
Walk in the trap in the soul 
Come to my jeweler, get froze 
Snatch your soul
Come to the north, then we snatch your gold 
I had to set up the plug the other day
What he was taxin' for? 
I do it for culture
Bigger than Oprah, Mayweather 50-0, culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture 
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture 
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture 
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture

150 a choker 
Flooded my wrist, it's soakin' 
Split up the waters like Moses 
I done put furs on the loafers 
Rolls Royce nightmare, I'm a ghost 
Let's have a codeine toast
Niggas ain't gettin' no stain on me
No drip, don't trip, my gang with me 
Come to the bando, stop playin' with me 
Got bricks on bricks, it's rainin' kis 
Niggas can't hang with me
Lay 'em in the dirt, they restrain from me 
Bust down the plain Philippe 
She bought me a Wraith, unique 
You thots want to fuck, they in heat 
A million, I bring home a week 
She a lil' beast 
Fuck around lookin' for the keys 
Got the trap disease 
Please keep the cap from me 
Count up the rack, proceed 
First, seed when I got in the league 
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture 
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture 
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture 
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture 
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture 
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture 
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
