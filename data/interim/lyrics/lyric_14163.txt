They say that time is the only cure
To heal the hurt of a broken heart
I say you never can be sure
No no no
If I do, don't try to make a brand new start
In my mind love was just a dream
Like a fairytale
But you gave me the reason to believe that I should give it one more chance
There's no doubt about it
I can't do without it
This is the real thing
Ain't no way around it
Love has finally found me
This is the real thing
You take me higher than I've ever gone
Yes you do
And in the way that makes me feel secure
Your love just warms me to the bone
Yes you do
And every day you give a little more
When I think about the love gone by
And what I've been through
I'm convinced that this one is right
Now girl there's nothing left to prove
There's no doubt about it
I can't do without it
This is the real thing
Ain't no way around it
Love has finally found me
This is the real thing
Every minute, every hour
I can feel the power
This is the real thing
Love is not a fiction
Love is not a trick
This is the real thing
Oh, it's so easy now
Looking in your eyes yeah
When love comes so naturally
It's meant to be
Now I finally realise
Oh, do do do, do do do
I never knew, oh no, oh no
Oh oh oh no, oh oh oh oh no
Oh oh oh no, oh oh oh oh no
Oh oh oh no, oh oh oh oh no
Oh oh oh no, oh oh oh oh no
Oh oh oh no, oh oh oh oh no
Oh oh oh no, oh oh oh oh no
Do do do
I just don't, don't feel the same
I just don't, don't feel the same
I just don't, don't feel the same
Ooh, woah, woah woah woah
When I think about the love gone by
And what I've been through
I'm convinced that this one is right
Now girl there's nothing left to prove
There's no doubt about it
I can't do without it
This is the real thing 
Ain't no way around it
Love has finally found me
This is the real thing 
There's no doubt about it
I can't do without it
This is the real thing 
Ain't no way around it
Love has finally found me
This is the real thing 
This is the real thing baby
Real thing
It's the real thing, real thing, oh
This is the real thing baby
Real thing 
This is the real thing baby, real thing 
This is the real thing baby, real thing 
This is the real thing baby
