McNULTY: Freezing my balls off.
CLAUDE: Ah, it ain't so bad. Loosen up. Couple more months it's gonna be spring.
McNULTY: Spring, huh?
CLAUDE: Listen, you got to realize the bosses did you a favor sending you down here.
 Citywide to Marine unit.
CLAUDE: This is 7672, go 'head.
 Distress call from a private craft. 60-foot white vessel with engines dead.
CLAUDE: What's the location, citywide?
 In the channel, near the bridge. About 2,000 yards off the Armistead Pier.
CLAUDE: Ten-four, we're responding.
McNULTY: My father used to work there.
CLAUDE: Beth Steel?
McNULTY: In the shipyards there, yeah.
CLAUDE: I had an uncle who was a supervisor there. Got laid off in '78, though.
McNULTY: '73 for my dad. party boat?
CLAUDE: Pretty one, yeah.
McNULTY: More than one engine on her, right?
CLAUDE: Probably an electrical problem.
CIGAR-SMOKING MAN: Is that a police boat?
POLITICIAN: How are you tonight? Good to see you. Henry, how are you?
PARTY GIRL: Drink?
McNULTY: No thanks. You the captain?
CAPTAIN: Yeah. Harbormaster?
McNULTY: No, city police. So, you're dead in the water, huh?
CAPTAIN: Think it's the starter. You're not a mechanic, are you?
McNULTY: Me, no. I can't tell the aft from the stern. Best I can offer you is a two line. Hey, Claude, looks like they're gonna need a pull.
CLAUDE : Ten-four, we'll tow to Henderson's.
McNULTY: That'll work.
POLITICIAN: Any chance you can hold off on bringing us in? Lot of partying going on now, and I wouldn't want to cut it short for a little engine trouble.
McNULTY: Well, you're in the shipping channel.
POLITICIAN: You tow us somewhere out of t and the band plays on a while longer.
PREZ: Because, you see what I'm saying, right? I mean, three years in auto theft and I didn't learn anything. I didn't care. I'm tellin' you, I didn't even want to be a police anymore. Didn't. I think that was why I shot up my car like I did. But this thing we did on Barksdale, the wiretap and all. That felt like something. That felt like something I wanna do. So, I was thinking, you know, narcotics, maybe.
UNIFORMED COP: Major. You want this stuff where?
VALCHEK: Just in here, in here. Up against the wall over there.
PREZ: If there aren't any openings in the regular narcotics shift maybe assets forfeiture or something like that.
VALCHEK: Hey, hey, hey, easy, easy, everything breaks.
PREZ: I mean, with this Barksdale thing, Lester Freamon had us deep into the money, real deep. We could've seized real estate, cash, vehicles, all kinda stuff if the bosses, I mean, if command had let that case go forward. We were on it.
VALCHEK: Look at that, huh? It's the dove.
PREZ: Oh, right.
VALCHEK: Look at that.
PREZ: So, what do you think?
VALCHEK: What do I think? I think... You're gonna take the sergeant's exam next month. And because I have Andy Krawczyk here, and because he has city hall's ear, you're gonna make sergeant, then you're gonna come out here to thesoutheast, where, because I'm you father-in-law, you're gonna be assigned a daytime shift in a quiet sector. Then you're gonna take the lieutenant's exam, where you'll also score high.
PREZ: I don't want to make rank. I want to work cases. Good cases.
VALCHEK: Roland... Listen to me. You did good with the drug thing. You buckled down, you did the work and except for that thing with the grand jury, you helped take some of the stick off yourself. Now, if you'll just shut up and listen to me, you might actually have a career in this department.
BODIE: Hey, yo, this radio ain't workin' that well.
TANK: We losin' it.
BODIE: Huh?
TANK: We losing the station, man.
BODIE: Whatcha mean?

BODIE: No man, I ain't never left Baltimore. Except that boys village shit, one day, and I wasn't tryin' to hear no radio up in that bitch.  C'mon, man, you're killin' me, you're killin' me, stop.
 It's been perfect tomato weather out there. Id days and then rain at night.
BODIE: This a Philly station?
TANK: Man, how the fuck I know?
BODIE: Why would anybody wanna leave Baltimore. That's what I'm askin'.
TANK: Yo, that'd be the exit.
BODIE: Take that shit.
TANK: So far, they on it.
COUNTRY: Mmm-hmm.
BUNK: Ahoy, matey. The girls always tellin' me about the little man in the boat. Now, I know who they talkin' 'bout.
McNULTY: C'mon, aboard man, c'mon, I wanna show you.
BUNK: Uh-uh, fuck no.
McNULTY: What's the matter?
BUNK: The bunk can't swim. I ain't too good at floatin' neithers.
McNULTY: So, what brings you to the water's edge?
BUNK: Ilene Nathan called. Gant case is coming up, four weeks. She wants to start doing preliminaries on our witnesses. So, that means the old lady from the projects, which is no problem, and your man Omar, who's in the wind.
McNULTY: Uh-huh.
OMAR: You got a line on Omar, Jimmy?
McNULTY: Well, he's not on the starboard.
BUNK: That's port, fool.
McNULTY: How the fuck would you know?
BUNK: C'mon, let me buy you lunch and we can think on this shit together.
McNULTY: If I leave, I gotta tell my sergeant.
BUNK: Oh, that reminds me, Landsman wants his 10 dollars.
McNULTY: What for?
BUNK: For bettin' that you'd ride the boat.
McNULTY: You tell that motherfucker he's not gonna see that money, especially since it was probably him told Rawls where I didn't want to go.
BUNK: Aw, Jimmy. Ain't the same up there without your ass.
McNULTY: Oh, no?
BUNK: Better, actually. Hey, c'mon now!
SOBOTKA: The canal gets dredged, it means we all work. Your people, my people. The canal's the key, Nat, you know this.
NAT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you know how much money you gonna spend to even get them talking about that shit?
SOBOTKA: We don't take a shot, we might as well roll over and die right now.
NAT: No, you get 'em to rebuild the grainery pier, you got a hunnert ships right there.
SOBOTKA: That's break-bulk, Nat. Best you gonna do is one or two extra gangs a week on them blowers. And that's six or seven man gangs, at best.
NAT: Yeah, but you you might actually come away with something. You go down Annapolis asking for the goddamn canal, you gonna come back with nothin' but your little shriveled-ass dick in your hand. What's more, if the grainery pier don't get fixed up soon, some asshole's gonna fuck us by building condominiums all over it.
SOBOTKA: Nat, if the canal were two feet deeper...
NAT: Hey, fuck the canal. I'm gonna go to the district council, huh. I'm tell them to push for the grain pier. You feel me?
SOBOTKA: Nat, calm the fuck down
NAT: Goddamn checkers local always acting like you're the king of everything and shit.
SOBOTKA: Nat. Nat, listen to me, if we--
NAT: Y'all need to crawl back down in them holds, remind yourself of who you is and where you come from.
HORSEFACE: Damn, Frank.
OTT: We just sat here and watched Nat Coxson take a shit all over you.
HORSEFACE: And shrivel-dicked motherfucker that you are, you take it.
SOBOTKA: For your information, I wake up every morning with an angry, blue-veined diamond-cutter. I was gonna enlighten the president of local 47 on this particular point and he chose to depart.  Blue steel, gentlemen.
OTT: For chrissake.
SOBOTKA: Three-and-a-half inches of hard, blue steel.
SOBOTKA: Nicky boy. You workin' today?
NICK: As a lasher for big roy's crew.
SOBOTKA: Atta-boy. Make the family proud.

NICK: Today?
SOBOTKA: Tomorrow. The Atlantic Light over in north point.
NICK: Alright.
SHAVED HEAD DOCKER: Yo, Frank.
SOBOTKA: What's up?
SHAVED HEAD DOCKER: You gotta get with Ziggy, man. He's all over the place.
TRUCK DRIVER: I'm here since eight. You know I been here since eight.
ZIGGY: Hold your horses.
TRUCK DRIVER: You fuckin' goof.
ZIGGY: I'm gonna find it for you, just shut the fuck up a minute.
SOBOTKA: How we doin'?
ZIGGY: Ain't a problem, chief.
TRUCK DRIVER: Fuckin' A. I'm down here since eight for crane-to-chassis, and Tweety-bird here lost the can.
ZIGGY: It ain't lost!
SOBOTKA: It's right here on the manifest as a hot box. Where is it, Zig?
ZIGGY: It's either in base 7...Base 7 is up there man.
ZIGGY: Or it ain't. In that case, it's definitely somewhere in the stacks.
TRUCK DRIVER: Jesus fucking Christ.
SOBOTKA: You're killing me here, Ziggy, you're fuckin' killin' me. Give me the number for your shipping agent. I'll call and try to square it. And you. When you clock out today, leave your box and don't ever come the fuck back. You hear me, Zig,you're fired.
TRUCK DRIVER: Later for you, goofus.
ZIGGY: Fuckin' guy, he loses his job and he couldn't care less.
SHAVED HEAD DOCKER: He ain't fired, man.
TRUCK DRIVER: No?
SHAVED HEAD DOCKER: That's his father.
BURNS: How fast you need this?
BUNK: It goes to trial in a month. Got to start prepping it this week.
DANIELS: Officer Burns. Detective.
BUNK: I... I heard they posted you down here but, I mean, you know, damn. These motherfuckers don't play, do they?
DANIELS: So, what brings you downstairs?
BUNK: Was pullin' evidence on the Gant case, you know, trial date for Bird is next month, we outta be ready.
DANIELS: You give him my love.
BUNK: Who?
DANIELS: Bird.
BURNS: No evidence.
DANIELS: What do you mean, no evidence?
BURNS: Submission slip says row double-B, section fourteen, shelf three, four-right rear. It says that.
BUNK: So?
BURNS: No such thing. Double-B has 12 sections, this says 14, you see what I'm sayin'? No evidence.
 Winters kill off the weaker varieties of caterpillars.
BODIE: Fuck me. Fuck.
 Protection they eat right through it. But it is a sort of a warning system.
FORD EXPLORER DRIVER: They here.
FATHER LEW: Francis. You made it.
SOBOTKA: Hey Father. Got you covered here.
FATHER LEW: Come on Francis. You wanna see your window? Only Francis Sobotka would send all the way to Esslingen for stained glass. The Germans are hard-headed, but you can't beat them for craft.
SOBOTKA: I was glad to do it, Father, for the church, you know? The truth is I need to ask you something in return.
FATHER LEW: Anything I can do.
SOBOTKA: I need some face time with the Senator.
FATHER LEW: Barbara? She comes to the early mass on Sunday, the one in Polish.
SOBOTKA: We got nothing but problems, Father. We need to see something happen with the C&D canal. And the grainery pier's been down for a year now.
FATHER LEW: I got tough guys coming in to confess things that I never heard before. I don't need you to tell me how bad things are on the docks.
SOBOTKA: Set something up with Mikulski, soon?
FATHER LEW: You didn't need a German window to ask me for that, Francis. And what's more, you've made offerings way above what it would take to get that window up there. How long since your last confession?
SOBOTKA : I'll see ya, Father.
TANK: This shit might be somewhere else, man.
PONYTAIL HOMEBOY: Yo, the shit always up in the door, man. Motherfucker, you been standin' right there watching us. You see any shit come up outta there? Yo, you seen we ain't take shit up off this car.
BODIE: Yeah, yeah, man.
PONYTAIL HOMEBOY: You seen it.
BODIE: Well, who gonna believe us, huh? This shit is missing! And fuck what you're saying. That's all he gonna hear, is that this shit is fuckin' missing.
TANK: Yo, check it again.
PONYTAIL HOMEBOY: Yo, the shit ain't there, man. Call your man and say so.
TANK: Nigga, what you say? I said check it again, Goddamnit!
BODIE: Yo man, cut that shit the fuck out. Fuck, what the fuck is going on today?
COUNTRY: Takin' their time, ain't they?
BODIE: What the hell is goin' on?! Damn!
BURNS: Ain't anywhere in this section either.
DANIELS: Start on the next row.
BURNS: Lieutenant, those two bags be anywhere in this damn basement.
DANIELS: You're right.
BURNS: We could be here all night.
DANIELS: Right again.
BURNS: So that's overtime. Right?
GREGGS: Fuck me. I still cannot type.
HERC: Fuckin' white boys, I love 'em. I fuckin' love 'em.
GREGGS: Yeah?
HERC: Dumb as a box of rocks.
GREGGS: Who?
HERC: White boys. Talkin' about the braindeads in my Kane Street case. I call him up, I tell him I wanna buy some drugs. You know what he says?Says, "Okay, I'll sell you drugs. How much drugs do you want?" I swear to God, Kima, they don't code it, they don't ask for a meet, nothing. And then when you make the deal, there's no run and no bullshit. It's the guy himself walking up to you in the parking lot saying, "I brought the drugs. Did you bring the money?" No, I'm not kidding. I have much respect for black people after working with these idiots for two weeks. Seriously, if white boys want to sell drugs in Baltimore, they have to make different laws for it, like even it out for 'em.
GREGGS: Affirmative action.
HERC: Leave no white man behind.
GREGGS: Herc, what the fuck do you want?
HERC: I need you to do the seizures.
GREGGS: You got titles, deeds, registrations? What do you have for me?
HERC: I thought you did all that. You're the forfeiture unit, aren't ya?
GREGGS: I write all the affidavits and the filing for the city sollicitor. But you've gotta give me the information on what we're taking.
HERC: Well, that's a fucking hassle.
GREGGS: You want the property, you gotta step up, Herc. You don't have me or Carver to lean on here.
HERC: No? How 'bout you come on the raids tomorrow? With me for old time sake.
GREGGS: You takin' doors?
HERC: Yeah, two houses and a bar on Kane Street. C'mon, Kima, mount up with us. I know you miss it.
GREGGS: I'm done rollin' around the gutter. I am inside now.
HERC: Well, you're a housecat now, huh?
GREGGS: I made a promise.
HERC: I gotta say, Kima. If you were a guy, and actually in some ways you're better than most of the guys I know. If you were a guy, your friends would buy you a beer and let you know.
GREGGS: Lemme know what?
HERC: You're fuckin' whipped.
GREGGS: Whipped.
HERC: Pussy-whipped. I kid you not.
BUNK: So. So? So, where we findin' Omar?
McNULTY: Who?
BODIE: He say anything else?
TANK: No. Just to come back. All of us.
BODIE: How he say it?
TANK: You know, he just... said it.
BODIE: Fuck.
TANK: Yeah.
STRINGER: They holdin' to it?
ROCK: So far.
STRINGER: Alright. They got the times right? How about the mileage? Alright. So, I'ma ask you one more time, you never saw him out the car?
TANK: Naw.
STRINGER: You stayed with him the whole time?
TANK: Every minute.
STRINGER: How long before he came out the parking garage? I mean, how long was he on his own?
TANK: Not enough time to do shit, String. I mean, he was in and out in like three minutes.
STRINGER: Chill, chill. This shit is fucked up.
BODIE: Look, I know--
STRINGER: You follow the directions?
BODIE: I did just like you told me.
STRINGER: You wrote down the mileage?
BODIE: Yeah, yeah.
STRINGER: Let me see.
BODIE: See, right there.
STRINGER: No, you're three-tenths long, dawg.
BODIE: Yo.
STRINGER: And if you followed directions, you wouldn't be.
BODIE: Yo, String, I did everything like I should, man. Yo, I swear.
STRINGER: You got answers? You didn't have to take a detour in Camden when they shut down a couple of blocks on the boulevard?
BODIE: Yeah.
STRINGER: You hurt your foot?
BODIE: My foot?
STRINGER: You know the way you kicked that tire jack the way you did.
BODIE: You was on us the whole time?
STRINGER: Who me?
BODIE: Y'all had people following us. So... Where it at?
ZIGGY: Hey, you know, you should take me with you. I should meet these guys. If I meet these guys, you know maybe we can figure out ways to do a little business. You know what I'm sayin'?
NICK: Zig, these guys are real.
ZIGGY: Wow, I ain't real?
SINGER: Check. Check one, two.
HORSEFACE: Six degrees. Everybody's going home to sauerkraut and Sanny Claus and here comes a gang of us walkin' the other way, half-in-the-bag and Lil' Big Roy with his wooden leg.
DOCKER#1: Christ, them wooden shovels.
LITTLE BIG ROY: Yeah, you children don't know 'bout shovels, do you?
DOCKER#2: Can't have no sparks when you workin' grain.
DOCKER#3: Ka-boom.
HORSEFACE: It's more like ka-put. You ain't never gonna see another grain ship here in Bawlmer, my friends.
NICK: Can you believe these fuckin' dinosaurs? Sit around all the damn day talkin' shit about how they used to off-load with shovels, carry fuckin' railroad cars on their backs.
DOCKER#4: And drink whiskey through a firehose.
SPAMANATO: And go home and fuck their wives silly 'til breakfast. They was some fuckin' heroes back then, wasn't they?
NICK: Shit is thick in here tonight, gentlemen.
HORSEFACE: What can you do? This generation, they just don't know.
LITTLE BIG ROY: Ain't never gonna be what it was. No indeed.
SPAMANATO: Every night, with these old fucks, it's like 1952 and shit.
ZIGGY: Hey, hey, you know when I was your age, boys, I unloaded 10 ships in a Goddamn day. You know, I'd do it with one arm after a 300-pound bag of Polish dildos fell on me.
SHAVED HEAD DOCKER: What the fuck is a Polish dildo?
ZIGGY: Actually, at my house, it's a ring of kielbasa.
NICK: Christ, here we go again.
SPAMANATO: Break it out pretty boy!
ZIGGY: But you know what? Where you boys have problems I'm sure any old breakfast link'll do.
DOCKER#5: You know he's gonna pull out his dick, right?
LITTLE BIG ROY: That boy ain't right.
ZIGGY: It was just me... Me and my old wooden leg, and my glass eye, and my Polish pencil!
LITTLE BIG ROY: Like anyone in the checkers local ever used anything but a real pencil.
DOCKER#3: Push one of them no more.
DOCKER#5: Now they're talkin' trash about 1514.
ZIGGY: Well, Jesus H. Christ, you know what? All hands starboard. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. The old tub is listing, can you feel her? You wanna know why? 'Cause them old fucks done unloaded so much bullshit that this whole motherfucker's gonna capsize. Brace yourselves, we're sinking.
DOLORES: Goddamnit, you're not taking your dick out in here again.
ZIGGY: Let me show you old gents some bulk cargo that none-a-you's could ever handle. Who says they don't make 'em like they used to? Pretty boy is on the town tonight.
SPAMANATO: Ziggy, man.
McNULTY: Bring her in the boat?
CLAUDE: Hell no. She'll fall apart if we try to bring her in.
McNULTY: What's the plan then?
CLAUDE: Well, hook her real good, we'll tow her slowly over to the pier. What's she look like?
McNULTY: What do you mean?
CLAUDE: Well how long you think she's been in?
McNULTY: She's fresh. Legs are broke, though.
CLAUDE: Probably a jumper from the bridge.
[Banging)
NICK: Alright, ma, shit. Yo, Zig. Ziggy.
NICK'S MOTHER: Kitchen's closed. There's no service for drunks who can't get up in time to catch a ship.
NICK: What ship?
NICK'S MOTHER: Your father says the Talco line is in today. That makes two ships at northpoint.
NICK: It's the Atlantic Light, ain't due until this afternoon.
NICK'S MOTHER: That's still is no excuse. I...
NICK: Good 
NICK'S MOTHER: Couple of goddamn drunks, I got. And don't leave without taking your cousin with you. I gotta clean in there, and I ain't gonna do it around his carcass.
FATHER LEW: Ach, you keep us guessing, don't you, Stan? At Sunday mass, you can't be found. But early on a Tuesday, you arrive with an army.
VALCHEK: 2,500 from myself and every other Polack in three districts and four firehouses.
FATHER LEW: And to what do we owe such generosity?
VALCHEK: A surprise. We ordered up a window for where you renovated the nave. A memorial.
FATHER LEW: Let me see that.
VALCHEK: To Polish police and firefighters. Found this craftsman down in Glen Burnie that you would not believe.
FATHER LEW: For the nave?
VALCHEK: Yeah, for the nave.
FATHER LEW: We could use another window on the second-floor of the rectory.
VALCHEK: The rectory.
FATHER LEW: The upstairs hallway.
VALCHEK: How much did them dock boys offer for this spot? I can match it.
FATHER LEW: Offerings are confidential, Stan. And as you can see--
VALCHEK: I can go as high as 4,000. Just tell me if they went higher than four. More than four? From the docks? How the hell... I'm sorry, father. Who came to you with the offer?
FATHER LEW: Francis Sobotka.
VALCHEK: Frank Sobotka has that kinda money?
FATHER LEW: It was from his local.
VALCHEK: The checkers? They don't have 100 guys left paying dues.
FATHER LEW: It's a parish of givers, Stan. Maybe you talk to Frank, work it out somehow.
VALCHEK: Oh, yeah. We'll talk.
UNIFORMED COP: Uh, Major?
COLE: Well, well, well... If it isn't...
McNULTY: Hey, Ray, how you been?
COLE: I got nothing but red ink under my name this year. Landsman's become an asshole with teeth. Fished your wish, huh?
CLAUDE: Jumper, probably. This close to the bridge.
COLE: Probably, yeah. Pretty though.
McNULTY: She is, yeah.
COLE: I go in the men's room this morning, guess who's in the stall next to me, puking his guts out.
McNULTY: Bunk Moreland.
COLE: How'd you know?
McNULTY: Useless fuck can't hold his liquor.
AVON: What's happening, man?
STRINGER: What's up?
AVON: Alright. So, what's up? You ain't heard from Roberto yet?
STRINGER: Not a goddamn word, man.
AVON: Really? Still got our money though, right? So, you need to get down to New York, man. Fuck kind of game this nigga playin'? You sure of our people?
STRINGER: I broke down all their stories and they came back clean. Besides, I had some good people watchin' 'em.
AVON: Oh, yeah? Who?
STRINGER: Tank. Country.
AVON: How long that motherfucker been home?
STRINGER: A month, he still on parole. He should of fought that, straight back in the mix.
AVON: A-ight. So good, it ain't on us, it's on Roberto. Set it straight, you know what I mean? So, when you go Harlem take it light, but be firm. They got our money and we ain't got the product. So, you feel me? The shit ain't right.
STRINGER: How you fixed in here otherwise, B?
AVON: This ain't no thing, man. You know what I mean? You come in here, man, and get your mind right. You get in here and you do two days. It's the day you come in this motherfucker.
STRINGER: And the day you get out this motherfucker.
AVON: That's right. Exactly.
NICK: Was' up.
SPAMANATO: How you doing?
NICK: You comin' from
SPAMANATO: Yeah, I'm working the Atlantic late today.
NICK: How's it lookin' for local 47?
SPAMANATO: Like you're shit out of luck. ro-ro isn't going to anybody lower than a G-series. Best you can get, maybe have a day doing break-bulk on an aluminum load at Locust Point.
NICK: Half-a-day, huh?
SPAMANATO: Seniority sucks.
NICK:Yeah, if you ain't senior, it does.
SPAMANATO: Yeah, you got that right. I'm outta here.

SPIROS: How are you? Good? Who's your friend?
NICK: This is Zig, my uncle's kid.
SPIROS: Your uncle? Frankie?
NICK: Yeah. Ziggy's his oldest. My car broke down, you know, he drove.
ZIGGY: So huh... You must be the Greek.
SPIROS: Well, I'm Greek anyway.
ZIGGY: Hey, Boris. I know you from round the way, right?
SERGE: Why am I Boris? I don't understand this. Everywhere I am Boris.
ZIGGY: Shit you're Russian, right?
SERGE: No, Ukraine, Kiev is Ukraine.
ZIGGY: It's the same difference though.
SERGE: No, you're wrong.
NICK: What's the matter? You don't like being called Boris?
SERGE: Serge.
ZIGGY: No way, man! Boris is way better. It's like the guy from the cartoon. Boris and Natasha? Bullwinkle, man, Rocky and Bullwinkle.
SPIROS: You want some coffee, pie?
NICK: Naw, I'm good.
ZIGGY: Actually, what kinda pie you got?
NICK: Hey, Zig. Shut the fuck up, huh?
SERGE: Malaka.
NICK: Naw, it's cool, he's cool.
SPIROS: That's Frank's kid, huh?
NICK: Yeah. He's in the union, but he's like an l-series, so, he ain't gettin' any hours.
SPIROS: Same deal, same rate.
NICK: Alright, who's drivin'? Again? You gotta mix it up a little more, make it so customs doesn't put no names to faces.
SPIROS: You trust a man, you stay with him.
NICK: Okay.
SPIROS: Alright?
NICK: Boris it is.
SERGE: Serge.
NICK: Yeah, whatever. C'mon, fucknuts, let's go.
ZIGGY: Hey, how's the open-faced turkey?

HORSEFACE: Nick? I don't think he got any hours.
RUSSELL: Hey, Frank.
SOBOTKA: Hey, darlin'.
RUSSELL: Just so I can finish my paperwork early, what exactly are your people gonna be stealin' today?
SOBOTKA: I don't know. Couple luxury sedans, some color TVs, widescreen, maybe a couple cans of vodka. Maybe a whole container ship.
RUSSELL: Okey-dokie. Y'all have a good one.
HORSEFACE: You let her fuck with you like that?
SOBOTKA: She's alright. I like her.
NICK: I checked the computer. It's bay nine, cell 11, it's right on bottom. You working the Light, ain't ya?
HORSEFACE: I'm on it, yeah.
SOBOTKA: They say anything else?
NICK: No, just that it's the same money to us. Let's go.
ZIGGY: Alright, uncle Frank.
McNULTY: Winona.
WINONA: Jimmy, where you been?
McNULTY: Jay?
LANDSMAN : Look who it is. Sailor boy. You owe me ten.
McNULTY: Fuck you. You're the guy told Rawls where I didn't want to go. You made it happen, Jay.
LANDSMAN: I told him where you didn't want to go. Exactly.
McNULTY: Yeah, and they sent me there.
LANDSMAN: I knew Rawls was pissed, I didn't know how pissed. What can I tell you?
McNULTY: Where's Bunk?
LANDSMAN: Out on a call with Crutchfield.
McNULTY: What's up with our girl? She come off the bridge or what?
COLE: Doc Frazier posted her today, came up with blunt-force trauma to the head and chest. He's sayin' she's dead before she hits the water.
McNULTY: What about the defense wounds? Bruising on three fingers. We saw that as soon as we picked her up.
LANDSMAN: You missed the defense wounds?
COLE: I wasn't looking. Thought she went off the bridge, so.
McNULTY: Also, she's in the drink without no coat or shoes on. Now, maybe that stuff comes off in the water, but maybe not. And I don't see her making her way out to the Key Bridge in winter dressed like she wad. But then that's just me. Tell Bunk I was here, will ya? Have fun.
LANDSMAN: Oh we already had our fun. Dumping her on Baltimore County.
McNULTY: On the county?
LANDSMAN: East of the bridge, right? That's Baltimore County, she's their stat.
McNULTY: You sold them on that?
LANDSMAN: Rawls did. He called up the colonel, said "You got one hell of a murder on your hands". It's all about self-preservation, Jimmy. Something you never learned.
MALE: Hey Norris, state police line two.
DOCKER: A little to the right! Good, good, bring her down.
HORSEFACE: It's there whenever they want it.
BELL'S ATTORNEY: Now, that you are my client, Mr. Bell, we are protected by the attorney-client privilege.
STRINGER: I thought Roberto would be here.
BELL'S ATTORNEY: Not likely. This, I'm afraid, was in Monday's papers.
STRINGER: Aww.
BELL'S ATTORNEY: It seems Roberto Castellano y Silva has been targeted by the D.E.A.
STRINGER: That's why we didn't do the business, huh?
BELL'S ATTORNEY: Right now, Roberto and his people aren't going to be getting involved in anything that could further complicate the situation.
STRINGER: Well you know, usually, when you take a fall, you get right back in there 'cause you know nobody's watching, right?
BELL'S ATTORNEY: Sometimes. And sometimes you wonder how it is you got caught in the first place, and you decide to change the pattern.
STRINGER: He took our money.
BELL'S ATTORNEY: Your advance payment arrived as our problem did, and I'm told the money is on the way back to Baltimore.
STRINGER: You know, I get the feeling that you're blaming us for Roberto's... predicament.
BELL'S ATTORNEY: Perhaps your problems in Baltimore and my client's problems here are coincidental. But right now...
BELL'S ATTORNEY: Listen to me. He was the first to know that we took a hit. He knows no one came close to rolling over us and all the documents from the case.
BELL'S ATTORNEY: Nonetheless, we have a legitimate concern. Considering the scope of Mr. Barksdale's operation, his sentence was, to say the least, mild. But if the possibility exists, however unlikely, that the leniency he received was the result of cooperation, well, you understand our position, I'm sure.
HORSEFACE: Frank, it's sittin' out there waiting and this Russian fuck won't take it off the pier.
SOBOTKA: I ain't blind.
HORSEFACE: I don't like it sittin' out in the open that long. The customs seal is broke, somebody's gonna see it. Our asses are hanging out here.
NICK : Yeah?
SOBOTKA: Nicky. What the fuck? It's still sitting here.
NICK : Shit.
SOBOTKA: Yeah.
NICK : Where's Serge?
SOBOTKA: He's parked at the end of the lot.
NICK : What's he waiting for?3EEE17CA.JPG
SOBOTKA: I got no fucking idea, but the ship's almost empty. They need to shit or get off the pot.
NICK : I'll look into it.
SOBOTKA: Yeah.
SERGE: Okay, understand.
SOBOTKA: Hey! Fuck it, get it on a fifth wheel and lose it in the stack. We're at risk.
GREGGS: Hey.
CHERYL: Hey.
GREGGS: I ain't lying when I say this paperwork is kicking my ass.
CHERYL: Maybe so, but end of the day, you come through the door in one piece.
GREGGS: You like to think so. But all these paper cuts are starting to take a toll.
CHERYL: Aww, you big, nasty detective. Come here. Let me give your little boo-boo a kiss.
GREGGS: Whoa, all this.
CHERYL: I'm just getting started.
GREGGS: A thousand dollars for the doctor.
CHERYL: A thousand dollars each time, girlfriend. Every month 'til i'm pregnant.
GREGGS: There's gotta be better way.
CHERYL: That would be on you, sweetheart. Come up with a suitable donor and we pay a lot less.
GREGGS: Not with your pussy would I fuck anyone of these guys.
CHERYL: What did you jus' say? No, you didn't just say that.
RAWLS: Sergeant! Your floater's county boys are putting her on our side of the bridge.
LANDSMAN: No fucking way.
RAWLS: Yeah. Some useless fuck in our marine unit faxed them a report on the early morning tides and wind currents. Shows the body went in the water west of the bridge and drifted out.
LANDSMAN: McNulty.
RAWLS : Fucking Jimmy. Fucking with us for the fun of it. I gotta give the sonofabitch some credit for wit on this one. Cocksucker.
LANDSMAN: Motherfucker.
BODIE: The count is right. What's on the shelf?
DEALER#1: Mace carryin' 10 down here. So, Moe Man holdin' about 38 up top.
DEALER#2: I checked the stash yo, and we way low. Moe Man takin' our shit.
BODIE: What he holdin'?
DEALER#2: Yo, he say he holdin' about 30 somethin', but I know that ain't right. I'ma fuck him up, yo.
BODIE: First thing you always think to do is fuck a nigger up, man. When your brick brain gonna realize there's more to this here than just thumpin' on niggas? What Moe supposed to be holdin'?
DEALER#1: 38, 'bout.
BODIE: Ain't you the damn fool.
DEALER#2: But then we low.
BODIE: Look, nigger. If we low, it 'cause Stringer want us that way, alright? When he wants us up, we be up. String is on top the shit. He on top. Go back to your spot, man.
COLE: Fucking McNulty.
LANDSMAN: The prince of tides. 
SOBOTKA: Hey, brother, you feeling strong today?
DOCKER: Yeah.
SOBOTKA: See if you can get his ass out of that chair. He said it was fine if you wanted to hit him too. Hey, hey, hey. What's the first thing a guy from local 47 does after he gets laid?
DOCKER: What?
SOBOTKA: Wipes the pepper spray from his eyes.
SPAMANATO: Hey, Frank. Frank. Something's going on.
SHAVED HEAD DOCKER: It's fuckin' girls, man, young ones.
NICK: There's like a dozen of them.
SOBOTKA: Dead? They're dead?
