I opened my eyes this morning, looked through my window outside
Suddenly something took me away by surprise
Veil on the skyline, written in broad daylight
My own name was there, how it gave me a terrible fright
Yeah, yeah, phantom writer
My name's in the sky
Yeah, yeah, phantom writer
Why? Why, oh, why?
Phantom writer
Tell me you're real or are you alive?
Like a sunrise, eat my home bread sign
And all too soon, I can get to fade the lines
Coming hopes, as I felt my mood fading away
Now I'm somewhere, screaming out in the day
Yeah, yeah, phantom writer
My name's in the sky
Yeah, yeah, phantom writer
Why? Why, oh, why?
Phantom writer
Know that you're in, there's love in your eyes
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, phantom writer
My name's in the sky
Yeah, yeah, phantom writer
Why? Why, oh, why?
