Words and music by Jerry Edmonton
I was feelin' so bad 'bout my best friend
I could swear the sky was fallin'
He had them put-down blues from wond'rin
Who his old lady was callin'
I said, "Keep your life and drown your sorrow
And survive the fire that burns you
If you just slow down and cool your temper
You might get off on what I'll tell ya."
I got me a straight shootin' woman
She's right on al the time
But all my friends they got shot down
Women shot them from behind
Now those Hollywood women
They pack a pistol 'tween their toes
And when you've got your back turned 'round
They go and shoot the man next door
So I believe, I believe
I believe I'll keep my lovin' at home
I believe, I believe
I believe I'll keep my lovin' at home
Now, if you want 
To keep 
You better leave 
Your travelin' gun alone
Yeah, if you want 
To keep 
You better leave 
You travelin' gun alone
Wo, got me a Straight Shootin Woman
She's right on all the time
Got me a Straight Shootin' woman
She's right on all the time
She keeps her bed turned down
With clean sheets on
And I can jump in it any ol' time
She keeps her cylinder greased and loaded
Just to ease my troubled mind
She's all mine
She's on my mind
Take her down
