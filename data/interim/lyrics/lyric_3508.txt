I never had any reason
For ambition or drive
In fact I never anybody
That cared if I'm alive
But then one day she came my way
And I heard a voice within me say
"Don't let her get away whatever you do"
But I never thought that this could be
That she would ever look at me
Seriously
And that's why
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord
I've got to be somebody
I'm down on my knees
Begging please, please, please, please
I got to win her love for me
I grew upon the sidewalks
Got along the best I could
Mama worked all day long
And Papa was no good
I never asked for much before
But here I am at Heaven's door
So help me please, don't let her pass me by
'Cause I would rather die than see
Her love turn into sympathy
For me
And that's why
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord
I've got to be somebody
I'm down on my knees
Begging please, please, please, please
I got to win her love for me
Mmm, mm-mm
Got to be somebody
Got to be a somebody
So tired of being a nobody
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord
I've got to be somebody
I'm down on my knees
Begging please, please, please, please
I got to win her love for me
