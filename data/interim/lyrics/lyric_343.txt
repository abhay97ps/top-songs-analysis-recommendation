Say I look like Michael Cera, but bro Michael Cera rich
You can say whatever the fuck you want, but you can't say I’m average
I've been drinking too much Hi-Tech, now I'm damaged
Now lil’ Leesta blowing up, all my haters like, "Damn it", yeah
I ran it up off a tweet
New whip ain't got no keys
Your bitch is on her knees, Number ine on me, boy I'm fleek
Smoking on Juul, don't smoke no weed
They call me Michael Cera 'cause my bitch be Superbad
Just bought a new McLaren, I got more bands than your dad
Eating Tiramisu in a brand new coupe
Got a banana clip like I'm in a zoo
Talk down on me, I'ma call my troops
Sippin' on lean like DJ Screw
Sippin’ on lean, this not Greygoose
Hop up in a new penthouse with a view
If I say the word, then my killers gon’ shoot
They said I'm from Juneau
Off lean, I’m up on Pluto
Big strap, I don't do Judo
I'm a big dog like I'm Cujo
All I wear is Alyx Studios
All I wear is Alex McQueen
Got a brand new Glock with a beam
Got a bank account inside my jeans
Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Jesse Eisenberg
Guarantee there ain’t no diss that I haven't heard
Off this Tech, that's the reason why my vision blurred
That's why my vision blurred, yeah
Say I look like Michael Cera, but bro Michael Cera rich
You can say whatever the fuck you want, but you can't say I'm average
