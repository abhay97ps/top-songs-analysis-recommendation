As long as I've got shoes
To put on my feet
Food for my children to eat
Everything is gonna
Be alright, be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
I don`t have no money
I don`t have 
Sometimes my friends forsake me
Causes me to weep and moan
Wait a minute, sometimes
In the lake in your eyes
You were all  with tears
Thinking bout the way I suffered
Coming up through the years
As long as I've got shoes
To put on my feet
Food for my children to eat
Everything is gonna
Be alright, be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
As long as I've got shoes
To put on my feet
Food for my children to eat
Everything is gonna
Be alright, be alright
Be alright, be alright
Everything
Everything
Every little bitty thing
Everything is gonna be alright
Be alright
Be alright
Be alright
Be alright
Everything
Everything
Every doggone thing
Everything is gonna be alright
