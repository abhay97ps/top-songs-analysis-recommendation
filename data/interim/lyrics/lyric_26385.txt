Woo!
My friend named Jack, he's got my back
He always seems to know right where I'm at
My friend Jose, he likes to play
He's always up for anything I say 
Little bit of Red 
A lotta bit of Crown 
Don't matter what it is, I'm gonna drink it down, down, down
The wine, the beer, the whiskey
Are the only things that fix me
I'm not sayin' it's a problem, I can stop it if I wanna
But the wine, the beer, the whiskey
They always get me
My friend named Gin, she's got some friends
I'm talkin' Brandy, Sherry, and their brother Jim
My friend the captain, we call him Morgan
He likes to anchor down and hang over 'til mornin'
Little bit of Red 
A lotta bit of White 
Don't matter what it is, it's gonna make it all alright
The wine, the beer, the whiskey
Are the only things that fix me
I'm not sayin' it's a problem, I can stop it if I wanna
But the wine, the beer, the whiskey
They always get me
My friend named Tito, he's my amigo
I'm gonna follow him around wherever he go 
The wine, the beer, the whiskey
Yeah, I got all my friends here with me
I'm not sayin' it's a problem, I can stop it if I wanna
But who would wanna?
When the wine, the beer, the whiskey
They always get me
They always get me 
They always get me
Yeah, they always get me, they get me
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
