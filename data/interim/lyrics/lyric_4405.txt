Once I had fame
Oh, I was full of pride
There were a lot of friends
Always by my side
But my fame, oh, it died
And now my friends begin to hide
Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone
Everywhere I turned
There was a hello and smile
I never thought, uh
They'd be gone after a while
But my bankroll went down
Oh, and the smiles turned to frowns
Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone
Once I had a love
Oh, but I wouldn't be true
To get back that love, huh
Ain't nothing I wouldn't do
But I've loved
And I've lost
Oh, and now I paid the cost
Everybody loves a winner 
Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone
