All right!
You're feeling down
You're feeling blue
You do know that you care
But you don't know what to do
If your mama don't feel good
Or your daddy don't feel good
Take a dose of rock'n'roll
And wash it down with cool, clear soul, aha
You better get your ripple soles out, 
Ease out all your mean controls 
Take a dose of rock'n'roll
And wash it down with cool, clear soul, aha
Turn on your radio
Start dancing to the moon
That old heart radio
It's going to get you,  get you,  get you in the mood
If your mama don't feel good, 
Or your daddy don't feel so good, 
Take a dose of rock'n'roll
And wash it down with cool, clear soul, aha
Take a dose of rock'n'roll 
Wash it down with cool, clear soul, aha
Hey, hey, baby, 
Why don't you take some rock'n'roll? 
Just take some rock'n'roll, 
Oh, oh, take some! 
Oh, i'm gonna take it! 
Take some rock'n'roll!
