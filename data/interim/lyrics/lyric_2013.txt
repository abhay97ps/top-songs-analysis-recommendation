There's a place right across town, whenever you're ready
Where people gather 'round, whenever they're ready
And then the music begins to play
You feel a groove comin' on its way
Are you ready 
Well, you get yours, cause-a I got mine
For the Monkey Time 
Now the dance that the people do, I don't know how it started
All I know is that when the beat brings a feel
It's so hard to get parted
And then the music begins to play
Automatically you're on your way
Are you ready 
Well, you get yours, cause-a I got mine
For the Monkey Time 
Do the Monkey, yeah 
Do the Monkey, yeah 
Ah-twist them hips 
Let your backbone slip 
Now move your feet 
Get on the beat 
Are you ready 
Well, you get yours, cause-a I got mine
For the Monkey Time 
Now the dance that the people do, I don't know how it started
All I know is that when the beat brings a feel
It's so hard to get parted
And then the music begins to play
Automatically you're on your way
Are you ready 
Well, you get yours, cause-a I got mine
For the Monkey Time 
Ah, do the Monkey, yeah
Give me a big strong line
You're lookin' real fine
