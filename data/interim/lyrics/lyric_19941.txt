My old friend, I recall
The times we had hanging on my wall
I would not trade them for gold
Because they laugh and they cry me
Somehow sanctify me
They are woven in the stories I have told
And tell again
My old friend, I apologize
For the years that have passed
Since the last time you and I
Dusted off those memories
But the running and the races
The people and the places
There is always somewhere else I had to be
Time gets slim, my old friend
Do not know why, do not know why
Do not know why, do not know why
My old friend, this song is for you
Because a few simple verses
Was the least that I could do
To tell the world that you were here
Because the love and the laughter
Will live on long after
All of the sadness and the tears
We will meet again, my old friend
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My old friend, my old friend
Goodbye, goodbye
