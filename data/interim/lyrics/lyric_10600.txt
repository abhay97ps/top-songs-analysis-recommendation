I'm a monster, you not nigga let's get it cracking/Kraken
Big Foot kick his back in, I want your spot nigga
He could barely lock Ness/Loch Ness
Yet he/Yeti trying to stop Chilla? Tahaha
You better boogie man or I'm dragging  you
To grove that God's iller/Godzilla, them bars filler, try again
I stole his bitch so
I'm the reason why his pussy on pause/paws like a lion, damn
But she gon' down these juniors  like Iron Man
Cause she know my Capital/capitol doubling  like Ireland
You in Charlie's entire plan? Double teaming
So I'm a try this new style called double scheming
Now look, in 2012 I had niggas running back to they team, let's get the sketch drawn
I'm the real McCoy with them Eagles, so let him step wrong
My Forte is beef can't Bear/bare to keep my breath calm
Mean if I see you with Green then put them Jets on
It's best you stop lying/Lion or protect moms
Cause I'll spill her/Spiller blood for the Bills if she ain't got her vest on
We don't Foster that behavior, shoot Tec's until  ya set gone
Clap ya men then haul 
That steel will get it's flex on
Don't say your cash stretch long from all that dope game money, we'll laugh
And you dudes dressed as a joke ain't funny
If a bill is the cost b , this cat will change the score to goal
Rich prior/Rich Prior to 30
So what you hating for just play that card low 
If my men see it  they'll spray the door
Then your Chevy Chase with heavy eights
When we load 'em all in  it be weighing  more
I don't play with war, I send bad  when it's drama see
What comes around goes around but that's Karma D 
Going bar for bar with me you don't match it with the king
I ain't scared of you nigga, I ain't gon' back up in the ring
I'll make you lay on your stomach, get you clapped up with the thing
So now you dying face down with your back up in the ring
It's like every fucking month this nigga back up in a ring
I really wanted Clips and Charlie threw his backup in the ring
Pardon my back up in the ring, why give E.R. eyes/I. see/C
Having Flair ain't in his Nature y'all think E, Ric?
Well I'ma put E.R.I.C. in the first ER I see if the jewels on E are Icy
I'm 'bout to do you greasy B
Well Eric Wright ain't sick that's why you should've been easy E 
Please believe he getting surrounded 'til Eric trapped in
He singing, pull strings for the cops, Eric Clapton
So if he ride through with that tool and Eric clap ten
Then that's the same ride they gon' find Eric clapped in
So you blacking? Not buying it, you know what you in for
Every killer's a different fashion, let me show you what's in store
Think it's Gucci, 'til them G's all on you, then I send more
If you a Prada G  then I get your men tore 
But let me get on my Coach shit, when the steel clap, run
You trying to red our back  til we conceal that gun
My shooters in the van gun D/Vangundy) and peel back one
So now from the neck down you won't feel  jack son/Jackson
I'm back the last Smack I had you putting shit together
Well I'ma save y'all the trouble I just need you to remember
So the first one, "right away" that's the term now
Just hold on to it 'til I get to the third round
They hear your words clown, but they'll never respect it
And see, mines  make 'em move like it's telekinetic
You got an Asians DNA and it's hella pathetic
How you rely on freestyles, but I guess it's genetics 
I'm glad you think you Jin, Eric, cause we think you generic too
Difference is he was a freestyle genius compared to you
I'm talking shit cause I studied your game tapes so
I guess we both learned from watching Clips
I rep Boston bitch, the boy Jones something to see
It's 2013 but death still coming in 3's
That's word to the homie Poison
He used to be yo' friend
In my opinion since you open shop you owe Pen
Now it's closing as I close in, get close in
Knowing he know when and why he ain't getting no win
They jonesing, Jones send hay makers when Jones in
Supposing he posing though but let the po's in
He call his bro, kin, my bro can get him broken
And call some mo' kids so some mo' kids can leave him smoking
The last battle I was choking I can't believe how I left you
Wow I froze, couldn't get out a line
Sorry to disappoint and let you down
Get out of line, then this will point and let you down
Think that was hot? Wait til you hear these next two rounds
Boss town!
I said niggas said since I got my tooth
My battles been shaky like I came to play on Smack
So I showed up today without it to let 'em know that the old DNA is back
Now Smack said it's the innovators over the imitators
And I agree cause in this battle they put a clone versus an originator
Nigga I been the only DNA in battle rap for years and that's still known
But let's be serious
We can look through your arsenal and see you not the real Jones
Serius, Arsonal, Darell Jones
Guess I gotta show up to Chilla with some real chrome
When you hear it click, no that's not a dial tone
So when I raise the stock who you gon' dial Jones? 
By me taking this battle this is a milestone
You should be awfully glad
When you see me wave an arm I'm not trying to call a cab
How many bullets should I use when that 40 blast?
I figured four so I bought sharpshooters for this Boston Crab
A couple tips will make him strip that's Magic City
You got your top taken off by Magic/Ciddy
You lose to Verb, Hitman, everybody in Magic City
So just imagine what I'ma do when Chilla start rapping with me
I mean reality shows you can't handle a loss
So Mr. Boston never stood a real chance in New York
That's why tonight I swear I'm sending that man home
It's not Wimbledon when you see this back hand thrown
You spit schemes and filler when you went against Gatman Jones
So when I come at him  he better punch like Pacman Jones
Adam, Pacman Jones, that wordplay always mean
Picture me lose to a nigga that forces schemes
His Patriot will leave with Red Sox that's the Boston teams
Think your dough nuts til I take everyone in Boston's cream/Kreme
When I load up it's AK's and they firing well
So when this K see  Jones he really gon' fight with them shells
Show you what a duck could get a shot Jerome
Think it's all Love & Hip Hop until you lose your mama Jones
Me? I got the chrome it's like Genesis how I'm letting off a cartridge
Plus I got a Bigg K like I got lost at Target
Smack ain't gon' wanna book him once I scorch this artist
Cause once I kill 'em for chicken they gon' take him off the Boston Market
And y'all niggas said
That this supposed to be top tier versus the Proving Grounds
Nigga I proved my point
You got a point to prove but first improve your style
You young niggas can't match with us vets
What you think you a movement now?
So let's take everyone in the Proving Grounds
And see if they can prove it now
For instance I mean that nigga JC's wordplay is ill
No, I said that nigga JC's wordplay is Ill
With all them punches I'm starting to think B Magic conceited
No, with all them punches I"m starting to think B Magic is Conceited
We already had a Hollow so John John's Da Don
No, if we already had a Hollow then John John's Da Don
Bill Collector had the burner, he had the burner
He had some of the best rhymes
What y'all forgot is that burner he had was a Tech 9/Tec-9
Which shows that all of y'all niggas is some of the biggest clones
And no homo you can see Clips/DNA all through Chilla Jones
So stop saying that they murdering stuff
Cause I ain't start liking new niggas
Y'all just feel in love with another version of us
It's round 1 it's getting hot in here
Night Of Main Events y'all know my slogan
No! Get your schemes the fuck outta here
Get the Patriots, get the Celtics, get the Red Sox
Every Boston team the fuck outta here!
Get that Boston fitted and get them jeans the fuck outta here
So what you hate I'm in my prime or  something?
That's why I had to slay you
Saying Clips is who I shadow 
He's the foundation that made you
My dues in that mask air a  clip
Conceal a  mac to blaze you
For them stories you make up
Gon' cause medics  to have to save you
My debut had you loving hip hop
I shouldn't brag but I'm meaner
Y'all know that Erica bitch that Rich Dolarz had looking bad?
Well y'all know that Eric a bitch that Rich Dolarz had looking bad
My team no fair/fare, tax E  like he took a cab
Hook and jab if your men try us cause Boston rookie OD he said a Len Bias
Reversing the name the only way Jones will Chill
This overkill you ain't hype to spray shots, you like Michael J. Fox
Too shaky to try holding still 
You got no appeal and you fucking sloppy
I'm adored  so it's tough to knock me
And he's a rookie with the cult 
Y'all gon need more than Luck to stop me
He getting tore so  bad my kill count going up a body 
But you could say I had a head start
Your brother dead if he owe and  try to stunt, you Bret Hart
So if I ever battle 'Tez he better step sharp
Cause that'll only get Cor' wrecked  that's how I check marks
Your set spark?
Well I don't see men  throw up blood/Blood
Can it jack?
The position you're in  is not  safe when that cannon clap
Gun store, what I buy you'll  spit and tear through your man and back
Then the gun I buy would leave  fluid where you standing at
A planned attack to leave you all black with dirt by ya
Your man's a rat and we turn snitches to hearse riders
Pass the  flame, my G's is  aiming to burst fire
My guys pull  if it's him  singing like church choirs
You the worst fighter, damn D, last time you brawled with sets
They called you Rex cause you ran, D 
Now they hear 'em my last name Moore, I'm the man, D 
Claiming you Air Heads but you sweet with that can, D 
And me? Why not give 'em the facts
On my Mickey flow, bars I got Plenty mo'
So E better haul or catch shots from the AR to every cent he owe
You copy that? Hall, A-R-senio
That blicky blow and he'll be lifted like a tippy toe
You dig me bro? I load 'em and spray
Send yours for heaters, I'ma bury those men with one dose of the K
Now we all can understand and distinguish a language
But think about it now was I speaking English or Spanish?
I said you dig me bro? I load 'em and spray
Senior fajitas I'm a burritos man with one dos of the que
Okay, so remember this, "disappear", be the term now
Just hold on to it til I get to the third round
As far as Verb, wow he on my bad side
So anyone with Chaz ties getting chastised
Clip flipped the ship so cap sized when it cap size
So the cap size leave him holy and wet, baptized
Stat wise, C's a  beast when highlights
This a blow out true stuff
He dread the fade if this rat tell 
Get 'em bruised up it waves then it bangs that Cal  lick
This dude fucked, why mull it  over?
I brought mo' Hawks to get his crew cut
This hairstyle too much, a punch make a boxer bruise
Funny I got a buzz, but in the D you got a lot of boo's 
I'm alone with that K homes  I don't rock with crews 
That kid on his toes with the strap like toddler shoes
I'm hard body with metal in the hood like Dr. Doom
Y'all think he made  Of Honor? Do not assume
I'm the Best Man, give a G room 'fore I cock and boom
Wait, G-Room, B-ride, it's clear if you listen
He banned  if this pro-pose like he airing and clicking
When shells engage to wet him  as they tear him and rip 'em
He'll leave this ring in a box like he scared of commitment
You hear the difference in the raps I spit it's alimony
Cause live you'll probably only get half my shit and that's legit
My raps are slick plus eveil, I click squeeze if clips freeze it's just Tivo
Two Blazer shirts, ties and two caskets cut neato
Cause Clips gon' follow suit, but after I tux E doe 
If it's war I'll take ya past a fist  I'm talking arms D
If this pro test/protest my piece/peace so leave you gone D 
Third round K-Shine put them hands on you
You used a beat, shit was weak, plus you dissed a transformer, why?
O sicker, more potent, you gotta spruce them schemes up
Red would  kill you so
They will owe/willow putting cream up
I may pull  if I see the nigga he B'd up, you squeeze what?
I ax his family tree and they seem stump
Please chump, even red knows/nose you on that clown shit
Before E could give me the beats he hear that Sound Click
Ironic that's only one way to Hell
Cause the part your  playing as a rival 
Gon' get you a-round, trip
[Round 2: DNA}​​​​​​​​
This dick head said I rhymed on beat against K-Shine
Yeahl right it didn't work
But I took that shit like a man holmes
But how 'bout I put the beats on you and make you Scram Jones
Schemes, schemes, schemes, forced wordplay
But the nigga don't ever name flip
Chilla Jones got the potential to do everything in battle rap
But for some reason don't ever change shit
You get out three words every second, to me that's a shame bitch
But these fans know I'm versatile so here's where the game switch
If you was a hustler you could move zero sales
See us ? We'll teach you how to make the snow
City  forecast I wouldn't win  Chill so I got the .38 below
You dealing with a nigga that punches and he free's 
So he'll  fall from the sky til he drops
Now I see that last scheme was cold
Whether/weather you like it or not
Oh this ya fight to the top?
See you came up in your division I know these viewers could add
Did your homework verse JC but yet you couldn't pass
You got ate/8 by JC your style wasn't for/4 Magic
Guess I gotta bring a two to the class
8, 4, 2 those are all halves, I'm just doing math
I figured to school him I had to bring the tool to your class
Maybe I"m moving too fast, cause I'm a nigga that punches
I ain't saying they all mean but at least I
{​​​​​​​Security throws a fan out for videotaping}​​​​​​​
Don't worry about it
I was just on my grill getting ready for the last cooking
I ain't made cause a nigga got kicked out for recording this ass whooping
Now like I was saying
Maybe I"m moving too fast, cause I'm a nigga that punches
I ain't saying they all mean but at least I switch my shit up
His rounds is all based on themes
Now he getting put behind bars like Bernie
And can't make y'all cream, cause his career's like the Ponzi
It's made off schemes
Nigga I let that 8 off mean and start grabbing the chrome
You and your Fatal Attraction both
Will be sharing some stones 
You know, Fatal Attraction, Sharon Stone, even his wifey outta his home
To sit in other niggas laps before marrying Jones
She gave me head shots like Kennedy, I was smashing her out
I told her on like Washington, tried to get the ass and be out
After the Bush Chilla kicked me out
Cause he was mad at his spouse
But like Obama, she let a nigga back in the house
I show up to his door with that Roscoe start backing it out
And take that Roscoe and put a small cap on his scalp
I'll grab, drag and fly  Jones back on the couch
And make him curl hair/here when Jerome get these gold caps in his mouth
Nigga what's the spazzing about?
Cause I'll be in your Queen Bee like Big Poppa
Cause the shit you say is lukewarm and what I spit's hotter?
How many niggas though Jones was gon' win? Nada
The only person to say Chill is Rich Dolarz, chill, chill, chill
Chill...and speaking of Dolarz, you wanted to battle him
I thought that would be some sick shit
But you tried to do it right after your Magic battle, I'm like "This kid's slick."
You wanted to redeem yourself for when you had that big slip
I guess he thought with all those schemes he could get Rich quick
Let's stop fronting like Magic ain't make you disappear, viola
And if you say Magic ain't make you disappear, why lie?
I created the path for you niggas you don't even know that I did
I'm like your teacher Chilla, guess I gotta show him the biz
Even though you older for our success in battle rap, you don't know what it is
So it's like the Knicks next season, you getting coached by a Kidd/kid
I got that .38 on me nigga, no DE
It'll get the banging on the side of Chilla like a broke TV
Y'all should've never bet on this nigga this ain't OTB
And you ain't Russell Jones so you know I was gon' OD-B
I get the sweeper I start trashing him that's a custodian
Need a nicotine patch the way the cig' keep smoking him
And round 1 I swear to God y'all all had hope for him
But I came to stop that shit I'm Imodium
I guess it's time to get cocky on 'em
It's Cree, if not Apollo then who/ Y"all know
Cause in the ring he only good for rushing  punches like Drago
When I draw, go or that heat spitting, simple and plain
I mean bullets will take flight and have your T ripping plane
Take flight, T rippping, that means tripping
You better jet if you don't run-away fast then you'll be missing
Found by your G's fishing, moral of the story my team clipping
So you could be laked/Blaked if a G riffing/Griffin
Listen I don't care if your friends vexed, I chop 'em here to here
Leave nothing but ten necks, now y'all like
"Button X? That's not a punchline just your term for round 3."
Don't worry you'll soon get it
Listen for all them terms in the next 2 minutes
This round got your tomb in it
I write away, right away
Every punch heavy
No telling what this right will weigh, but you my JR
I"ll make sets dip the Writer way then ride away
So stay in your lane I got the right of way
What I'm trying to say, that Einstein theory is weird to me
Cause E don't equal MC squared, he just a square MC
You depending on charm well start fearing me
Watch a head shot will leave you neckless  if I'm airing  these
It's clear to see, I diss a pair it make them wanna disappear
Truth, I know a fruit when I see one and this a pear
Two guns, drew one, he shook when he seen this a pair
Well this appear I'm 'bout to empty both clips and this up here
All they gotta say is grip up, I lift this up, air
He'll drop and be surrounded by docks like this a pier
Now this is where I put the "ill" in Chilla, okay stick with me
I'm common cold cause being sickle cell  lyrically
If you AIDS them small pox with the beef then I'm on ya
With that car sir  I assist  with a fif' to squeeze
Remember that shit with T?
Dissing Terry and his main team
How bullets flew from Mad Cows over Dan Green
E cold I  know but I got the best style
Everything this author write is  crazy
So they know me out west now 
Factor told me get wild so I'ma push his button X
Your girl don't want to hear E  like Budden ex
Her butt in next she unzipped and undo the button next
Then give butt and neck while she wasted off the bud and X
But now you nothing but an ex, my lap she put her butt in next
I pistol whipped your man, then it's you I'm gun butting next
For trying to interrupt I'ma cut whoever but in next
With a buck 50, hope your doc know how to button necks
Where's your set? You alone so A L is what I'm owing  E
Pussy, you get none I learned that from knowing
I'm 'bout to hone my skills and show hoe in E
Then you'll be gone, it's no telling where you going E
Last year was Jones' B, I beasted with them bars
Shining bright the time was right, I was gleaming from afar
See the deed is just a spar
But Smack and URL chose your ass to risk  just to see if I'm a star
I got bars so having visions you can 3 and 0 me
That's Inception cause even in your dreams you still sleeping on me
Get a Clue, why Risk your Life? My flow flames
Guess who's in Trouble, Sorry I play no games
You gutter in that alley, I don't care if you bowl lame
Cause I'ma strike and put an X through your whole frame
But this why you so lame, they call me champ
Cause with the punches I"m rarely a performer
In queens they call you champ cause you barely on the corner
They should've warned you, Run D, MC's lacking Common Sense
My Mobb Deep, rob me for 50 Cent and pay the Consequence
My Nature, cool/Kool G, but I still send a team at you
I just tap the cap the Q-Tip's from the beam clappers
You ain't seeing any bars from the scheme master
They just think your core mega  tough
Cause Eric be/B a Queen's rapper
The beams at you, Smack tell 'em vote for the sick spitter
Bet I be heavy on the polls  like a thick stripper
Every line parted  his body like a stick figure
Give his eye mack's  help him see the big picture
Bobby Fischer, I'm the best peep
Tonight don't bitch up  them goons will pawn you
Let's beef, see the rook putting Queens in check when that Tec speak
Meaning if I beam your vest it'll move your chest piece
Test me, I'm quick to flip and you'll get a cross first
I freeze frames like photo finishes
You eating off son shine/sunshine, photosynthesis
You better run son on some JoJo Simmons shit
I know you thought you was winning before but you losing now
Against Mr. Jump To Top Tier from the Proving Ground
Boss Town!
Yo I apologize to y'all I took a few seconds for them to mic me up
But now I'ma treat him like Adrian Broner's jacket and light him up
Now that Queens scheme you spit, I'ma keep it 100, that was hot son
I would rhyme 'bout some Boston rappers
But y'all all know they don't got none
So I'm really not gon' stress out or be worried what the god is spitting
And you mentioned Budden nine times
Like you ain't see what happened with them Consequences
And by that last scheme I guess you wanted to be Budden
Like it wasn't X-Box in your last battle when you got pushed by B button
I killed him too and beat Budden
So that all can go off the same scheme from B button
Now I said it's Night Of Main Events 3 and we here
Basically you owe me Chilla
The only reason why Smack put you on NOME is cause they know me Chilla
NOME, N.O. me, chilla, yes I gotta OD Chilla
This the round where I break it down
And explain how you cloned me Chilla
See it takes a lot more than schemes for a nigga to take defeating me
A nigga can't be one dimensional and think that he can beat me
If you mastered the art of freestyling at anything
You should know it's not easy, but Chilla's associated with a cube
And last time we checked a cube was 3D
So how y'all gon' say you like a staircase and you fell down 'em
How can Chilla be associated with a cube if he's not well rounded?
So now you think you ill and you be spitting them flows
But if you one dimension of a cube then how you really that cold?
See there's a difference between an MC and a rapper
The audio started fucking me up, that's y'all word nigga?
Y'all gon really make me take a boo in New York like I'm a Verb nigga?
Don't do that, don't do that, don't do that
Y'all better stay nice
For the clip will make this nigga strip naked like Daylyt
Now like I was spitting about delivery, don't make me pop that chrome
It's not an NBA player when you see me Popeye Jones
Now let me do performance I gotta get that done this evening
Let me explain something to y'all, I want y'all all to see this
I want y'all to compare if you in a fight, if it's DNA or Chilla Jones
Who y'all niggas got when y'all beefing?
I mean I want y'all vividly to get a picture
I want y'all really to see it, like if I'm fight I'm throwing punches
Them shits landing a nigga weaving
The whole time that shit's going on, this nigga's scheming
He walking around the body like
"I don't know how much her butt is worth 
But am I her sir? Yep "
Nigga I can't believe it
A nigga rhyming about pancakes while another nigga bleeding
Now to me that ain't real shit, you only mastered the art of schemes
That's why you can't kill shit
Y'all know I got the art of freestyling down pat right?
Y'all wanna hear some ill shit?
So let me bring back that second round when I did it with that Yung Ill shit
Y'all all know my spitters absurd, it's Night Of Main Events 3
1,200 people, all y'all gotta do is give me a word
Give me a word..
I don't wanna talk about A, I thought you said gay so I could let a clip off
And put this nigga in the center of Heat like he Chris Bosh
Garbage? Aw man y'all don't even wanna start shit man
When I trash him he'll be Glad like the garbage can
Clip? He don't even wanna spark some shit
He dealing with DNA so you already know he can't fuck with the  of clip
Oh damn, I think I almost fucked that up, when he off'd the shit
I meant to say B Magic already lost to Clips
Fuck it Kevin Durant, it's gon' look like OKC when that DE spitting
Cause you gon' be like Kevin Durant in the playoffs
Y'all gon' see a PG missing
Now all y'all out here know I'm cooking on the set
I just showed y'all the difference between a rookie and a vet
So all y'all niggas gotta feel my G
That's a nigga that schemes, y'all just saw a real MC
It's round 3 it's getting hot in here, y'all know my slogan
No! Get some real rappers the fuck in here
You got no swag, get your character the fuck in here
You only got bars, yeah you lyrically the fuck in here
But aggression and get some delivery the fuck in here
