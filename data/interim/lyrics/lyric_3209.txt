Another day is just about gone now
Lord and still I wait
You'll never know how much I try to keep my faith and good humour
She won’t write or phone, no
Seems as if she's never coming home
But in all my faith in love has gone, you'll hear me cryin’
Temptation's 'bout to get me
Temptation's 'bout to get me
Temptation's 'bout to get me
All my strength will come tumblin' down
All my friends they seem to understand
You know why they feel the same as I do
She’s your love you know, her very life is you
The days go by, I get weaker
People my heart is strong, she made me weak oh
I know, somehow I know if my little heart gets any weaker
Temptation’s 'bout to get me
Temptation’s 'bout to get me
Temptation's 'bout to get me
All my strength will come tumblin’ down
Temptation's 'bout to get me
Temptation's 'bout to get me
Temptation's 'bout to get me
All my strength will come tumblin' down
Temptation's 'bout to get me
Temptation's 'bout to get me
Temptation's 'bout to get me
Temptation's 'bout to get me
