Make me your slave
Tie me down, make me behave
Let me belong to you
Make me be true
Tell me what I can do
Let me belong to you
I don't wanna be free
Like a wave on the sea
No place special to go
But toss to and fro
Oh make me your own
Never never leave me alone
Make all my dreams come true
Let me belong to you
Make me your slave
Tie me down, make me behave
Let me belong to you
I don't wanna be free
Like a wave on the sea
No place special to go
But toss to and fro
Oh make me your own
Never never leave me alone
Make all my dreams come true
Let me belong to you
