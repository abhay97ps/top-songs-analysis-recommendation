Tired and relieved because he alone?
We haven't got Artist of the Year , Rhyme of the Year 
Grammy nominations , 'cause we're fat or blind or nutting, baby 
Aight? All night 
Playing this out my way 
All night long, all night 
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo 
You priceless
You like diamonds, I'll ice your wrist 
He got chedda, I'm twice as rich 
Make you bite your lips
Jenny, dju know that dju likin' this 
I used to think you ever leave me, I'd slice my wrist
Treat you like a bitch, never that 
You got beef, where my niggas at? 
And the street's where I'm living at
Clitter clack, that's the sound of the Mini Mack
Where we at? Uptown where it's really at
Give me that, I want the mansion and yacht 
Advance on the spot, we can dance 'til we drop
Am I handsome or not? 
Jenny, you the bomb
Any man disrespect, good as gone
When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me that everything is going my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibility has the whole world opened for me
That's why...
I'm feeling so good 
I knew that I would 
Been taking care of myself like I should 
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down 
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around
Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine, oh, no
Like the stars above, I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight, I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
'Cause I'm loving life, and tonight's for feeling
I'm feeling so good 
I knew that I would 
Been taking care of myself like I should 
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down 
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around
I'm feeling so good 
I knew that I would 
Been taking care of myself like I should 
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down 
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around 
Boricua, that's you mamacita
Puerto Rican diva from La Isla Bonita
Let me freak ya on the dance floor
Lead your mans off, he just tryna get your pants off
That's the last straw, Pun, I ain't got a glass jaw
Better run when you see me coming through the back door
Crack's raw, I give it all for my brother
Two things I don't share, that's my money and my lover
I know money's just for caring, that's for real
Take's cash to live 
You love her? Better scrap, for real
Shut up your grill
You know we never fight
It's your world, girl, set it off right
I'm feeling so good 
I knew that I would 
Been taking care of myself like I should 
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down 
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around 
I'm feeling so good 
I knew that I would 
Been taking care of myself like I should 
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down 
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around
I'm feeling so...
Party on tonight 
Everything is feeling right 
DJ 
Party on tonight 
Everything is feeling right 
DJ 
World's gon' to turn me around
I'm feeling so good 
I knew that I would 
Been taking care of myself like I should 
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down 
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around
I'm feeling so good 
I knew that I would 
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down 
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around
I'm feeling so good 
I knew that I would 
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down 
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around
I'm feeling so good 
I knew that I would 
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down
