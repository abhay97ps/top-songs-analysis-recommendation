Cheer the light
Still the fires
Raise your voice for
God, love, and rock and roll
We that fear
The way is clear
The day has come for
God, love, and rock and roll
Sing your song
We all belong
Now`s the time for
God, love, and rock and roll
Alright, sing we believe
Come on
Lemme hear you now
Everybody sing
Alright
In God, love, and rock and roll
Ah, yes, indeed
That`s right, one more time
Alright, everybody
Amen
Give a peace a chance, come on
God, love, and rock and roll
God, love, and rock and roll
Everybody, get down
God, love, and rock and roll
God, love, and rock and roll..
