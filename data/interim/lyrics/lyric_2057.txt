I remember when I first saw him
Something told me that I couldn't ignore him
And I've been dreamin' of him every night
Ever since we met
'Cause he's the kind of boy you can't forget
I remember when I first kissed him
He touched my hand and then I couldn't resist him
And though he kissed me 'bout a week ago
I ain't got over it yet
'Cause he's the kind of boy you can't forget
Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo
I could be so happy knowing he was mine
, all the time
And I could make him happy
I would treat him good, yes I would, wo, wo
Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo
Hey!
Gotta tell him that I adore him
There is nothin' that I wouldn't do for him
I won't be happy till I make him mine
And a wedding day is set
'Cause he's the kind of boy you can't forget
