The claim we hold is as good as gold, bonanza
Hand in hand we built this land, the Ponderosa Ranch
Our birthright is this Cartwright bonanza
We here belong, and standing strong, wrong doesn't have a chance
Day by day, work or play, ready side by side
Hello friend, come on in, the gate is open wide
Bound to be a fighting free bonanza
Singing pines of boundary lines for the Ponderosa Ranch
Every tree and flower is part of our bonanza
The stars at night, the morning light, water in the branch
We ride along four men strong together
Every plain and ridge is our heritage, Ponderosa Ranch
