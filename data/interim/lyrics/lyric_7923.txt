Music everywhere
Music fills the air
Feeling it running down your spine
Feel it taking over your mind
Celebrate with a bottle of wine
And some music everywhere
Music fills the air
You gotta move it, groove it
You gotta soothe it, and use it
You gotta know what it means to be
What it means to be
You gotta know
What it means
Music everywhere
Music fills the air
Feel it so you'll never let it go
Take in some good old fashioned rock and roll
Get up and dance away the blues you know
And some music everywhere
Music fills the air
You gotta move it, groove it
You gotta soothe it, and use it
You gotta know what it means to be
What it means to be
You gotta know
What it means
Music everywhere
Music fills the air
Feel it running down your spine 
Celebrate with a bottle of wine 
Feel it so you'll never let it go 
Take in some good old fashioned rock and roll 
Get up and dance away the blues you know 
Get up, get up and move
Get up, get up move
