Lie beside me on the sand
Put some lotion in your hand
Come on and make me feel nice
N' kiss me once or twice
Say you love me again
Then rub it in, rub it in
Rub it in, rub it in
I feel the tingle begin
You're gettin' under my skin
Rub it in, rub it in
Feels good
Put a little bit on my left shoulder
Yeah
Put a little bit right here
Yeah
Turn your radio on
And find a slow grooving song
Baby, whisper in my ear
Say the things I wanna hear
Make me know your love is strong
And rub it in, rub it in
Rub it in, rub it in
I feel the tingle begin
You're gettin' under my skin
Rub it in, rub it in
Put a little on my nose
Put a little on my toe
Put it on my back and my sacroiliac
And a dab on my chinny-chin-chin
Rub it in, rub it in
Rub it in, rub it in
I feel the tingle begin
You're gettin' under my skin
Rub it in, rub it in
Rub it in, rub it in
Rub it in, rub it in
I feel the tingle begin
You gettin' under my skin
Rub it in, rub it in
