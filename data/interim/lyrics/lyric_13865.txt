Girl, the first time we met
You took me by surprise
Ooh, girl you walked into my life
With those street corner blues
You were livin' in the fast lane
Much to my surprise baby
But I fell for you, anyway
I'm addicted to your love girl, hey
Stone love 
I'm in love with you baby, stone love
Girl, our love is so unique
It's one of a kind
And girl, whenever we kiss
It's like a natural high
But we're livin' in the fast lane
Red lights flashing baby
Will we ever change the way we are
Stone love girl, oh
Stone love
Stone Love
The life we live is a challenge, mmm
Always standing on the edge
May not be the best way but that's all we know
'Cause I don't wanna live my life alone, no
Oh, stone love baby, cause I've got you
Yes I've got you got you under my skin
Hey, stone love 
That's the way we are, baby
Hey, stone love 
May not be the best way but that's all we know
'Cause I don't wanna live my life alone, no
La, la, la, la stone love, stone love
You are everything I've ever wanted, baby
