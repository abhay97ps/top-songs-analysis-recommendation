Well, I've seen so many things
I've been all over the world
Well, I've had ups and downs
I've been over for a while
I thought I knew everything
Between the bad and the good
Guess I was wrong because
I misunderstood about
Girls, girls
Well, when I was young
My daddy sat down with me
He said a good life is hard
If you don't know what you need
Well, I guess he was right
Because the way that's it been
There's still one thing
I just can't understand and that's
Girls
They want you to tell
Them you love them
Girls
They're soft and
They're warm when you hug them
Girls
They'll tease and hurt you
When you need them
Girls
They cry when you say
That you'll leave them
Tell her what I told you
Tell me what she tells you
Tell her what you want to
Well, I've been so many places
I just shouldn't be
But then it felt so good
That it was torture to leave
They say you can't live without them
But can you live with?
I'm just one man but
I'm shaking a fist at those
Girls
They want you to tell
Them you love them
Girls
They're soft and
They're warm when you hug them
Girls
They'll tease and hurt you
When you need them
Girls
They cry when you say
That you'll leave them
Tell her that I love her
Tell her I don't love her
Tell her what you want to
Girls
They want you to tell
Them you love them
Girls
They're soft and
They're warm when you hug them
Girls
They'll tease and hurt you
When you need them
Girls
They cry when you say
That you'll leave them
Girls
They want you to tell
Them you love them
Girls
They're soft and
They're warm when you hug them
Girls
They'll tease and hurt you
When you need them
Girls
They cry when you say
That you'll leave them
Girls, girls
Girls, girls
Girls, girls
