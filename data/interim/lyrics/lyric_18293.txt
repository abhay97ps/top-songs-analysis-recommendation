There's a lot of things I understand
And there's a lot of things that I don't want to know
But you're the only face I recognize
It's so sweet of you to look me in the eyes
It's alright, I'm ok
I think God can explain
I believe I'm the same
I get carried away
It's alright, I'm ok
I think God can explain
I'm relieved, I'm relaxed
I'll get over it, yeah
The scent of vaseline in the summertime
The feel of an ice cube melting over time
The world seems bigger than both of us
Yet it seems so small when I begin to cry
It's alright, I'm ok
I think God can explain
I believe I'm the same
I get carried away
It's alright, I'm ok
I think God can explain
I'm relieved, I'm relaxed
I'll get over it, yeah
I'm so much better than you guessed
I'm so much bigger than you guessed
I'm so much brighter than you guessed
It's alright, I'm ok
I think God can explain
I believe I'm the same
I get carried away
It's alright, I'm ok
I think God can explain
I'm relieved, I'm relaxed
I'll get off of your back
I think God can explain, I think God can explain
I think God can explain
