Tell me, do you want my love
Tell me what you're thinking of
I've been waiting round so long
You don't try too hard
You don't try too hard
I hope you're not trying to make a fool of me
Cause if you are I know there's going to be
Some tears falling, and they won't be mine
You don't try too hard
You don't try too hard
Some people may want many loves, my friend
But we both know what happens to them in the end
So please listen to these words of mine
And let me know that I'm not wasting my time
I'm sure that we could get on very fine
You don't try too hard
You don't try too hard
You don't try too hard
You don't try too hard
You don't try too hard
You don't try too hard
