Downtown, stoplight, red car rolls by
What else can I do, but wonder if it's you
Scanning the stations, every song they're playin'
Is like a soundtrack, to the love we had
I should be over you by now, but every time I turn around...
It's always somethin' every day remindin' me
Everywhere I go, there's a memory
Ready and awaitin' to catch me off guard
There's no way to prepare my heart
What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do
If only I could just stop missin' you
I'd let go of our love, like it was never nothing
But it's always something
Lunch time, a new place
Waitress says her name
Why does it have to be, Emily
Corner store, stop in
Someone ask, "How ya been?"
I say I wouldn't know
I really gotta go
Wish I could forget you, but I don't know how
Cause every time I turn around...
It's always somethin' every day remindin' me
Everywhere I go, there's a memory
Ready and awaitin' to catch me off guard
There's no way to prepare my heart
What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do
If only I could just stop missin' you
I'd let go of our love, like it was never nothing
But it's always something
