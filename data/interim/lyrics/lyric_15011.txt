I bring you flowers
In a tiny bottle of rain
I bring out demons
That you cannot explain
I bring you thunder
That will wake up the sky
Shakin' like a go-go
And I don't know why
I bring you wisdom
What do fools think of me?
I am your prison
When you long to be free
I bring you laughter
From a serious guy
Still nervous like a school boy
And I don't know why...
A little love will make it alright
A little love will make your heart
Go bang-bang
A little love sky-rocket the night
A little love, a little love, a little love
A little bit 'o love
Sha la la la
You bring me oceans
When the river runs dry
Magic potion for my ethereal side
Cary gibraltar like
A pebble from the beach
Sister is your secrect simply out of reach?
A little love will make it alright
A little love will make your heart
Go bang-bang
A little love sky-rocket the night
A little love, a little love, a little love
A little bit 'o love
