Oh, yeah
C'mon
You get the limo out front 
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color
Yeah, when you're famous, it can be kinda fun
It's really you but no one ever discovers
In some ways, you're just like all your friends
But on stage, you're a star
You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that it's the best of both worlds
The best of both worlds 
You go to movie premieres 
Hear your songs on the radio
Livin' two lives is a little weird 
But school's cool, 'cause nobody knows
Yeah, you get to be a small town girl
But big time when you play your guitar
You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that it's the best of both—
You know the best of both worlds
Pictures and autographs
You get your face in all the magazines
The best part is that
You get to be whoever you wanna be
 Yeah, the best of both—
 You got the best of both—
 C'mon, the best of both—
Who would've thought that a girl like me
Would double as a superstar? 
You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that it's the best—
You get the best of both worlds
Without the shades and the hair
You can go anywhere
You get the best of both girls
Mix it all together, oh yeah
It's so much better
'Cause you know you got the best of both worlds
