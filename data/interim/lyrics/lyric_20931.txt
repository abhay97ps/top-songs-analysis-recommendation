Oh!
Oh!
Say my name and his in the same breath
I dare you to say they taste the same
Let the leaves fall off in the summer
And let December glow in flames , oh!
Erase myself and let go
Start it over again in Mexico
These friends, they don't love you
They just love the hotel suites now!
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness
In misery
I said-a I  don't  care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness
In misery
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, take a chance, let your body get a tolerance
I'm not a chance, but a heat wave in your pants
Pull a breath like another cigarette
Pawn shop heart, trading up, said no... 
I'm the oracle in my chest
Let the guitar scream like a fascist
Sweat it out, shut your mouth, free love on the streets, but
In the alley, it ain't that cheap now
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness
In misery
I said-a I  don't  care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness
In misery
Oh! Oh!
Mmm, said-a, I don't care just a-what you think
As long as it's about me, you said-a
I don't care just a-what you think
As long as it's about me, I said-a
I don't care 
You said, I don't care 
Said I  don't  care , oh!
I  don't  care , oh!
I don't care! 
I said-a, I  don't  care... 
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness
In misery...
I said-a I  don't  care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness
In misery...
Oh!
