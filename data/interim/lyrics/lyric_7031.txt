Down at the railroad station there's people gettin' on
Some are a goin' north some are a goin' south I'm just goin' to be gone
Some people are born to be takers others just wanna give
Some people live just to love but I just love to live
For I was just born to be exactly what you see
Nothing more or less I'm not the worst or the best
I just try to be exactly what you see today and every day I'm just me
When people say their life is rough I wonder compared to what
Some are wantin' more and more's gettin' less I just want what I've got
Some wanna live on a hill others down by the sea
Some wanna live inside high walls I just wanna live free
For I was just born...
Oh I was just born to be exactly what you see today and every day I'm just me
