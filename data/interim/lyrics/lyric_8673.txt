Get up - everybody!
Happy people are we
Happy people are we
Throw away your life long pain and follow, yeah
I'll take you to a land of peace and a new tomorrow, hey
Brothers, sisters, come and take my hand
I will take you to a better land
Sunshine people love is all you bring
Dawn of a new day and here's the song we sing
Happy people are we

Don't believe in this troubled world
We can get higher 
Come on along and I'll take you there
Hey, listen to me now

Life is for livin', now let's don't mess around
Dance to the music, throw your cares away
It's a song of hope and better days
