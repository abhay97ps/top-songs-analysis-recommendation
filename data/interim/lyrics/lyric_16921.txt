Yo, I seen this  one young lady walking down the street
Everything was done from her hair to her feet
With some Coach kicks, tight Guess jeans, LV bag, shirt was from
Armani
So, I ran up and I said, “W’sup?”
Introduced myself proper but she didn’t give a- what?
So confused, what did I do wrong?
Now where have all the cool girls gone?
Don’t care about your Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Prada
Them things like that don’t make me want ya
I’m just looking for other things
Like a dope conversation with another being
Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Prada
Them things like that don’t make me want ya
I’m just looking for other things
Like a dope conversation with another being
Beautiful girls, in a confused world
In the flashy necklace and your long curls
Now let me take this opportunity to tell you that your
Louis, Vougue, True Religion jeans are kinda skeptical
You can have less, no need to impress
Mo money, mo problems, leading to stress
Compulsively sliding cards sticking in debt
Unimportant things quickly become the asset
See I’m the kinda dude who likes a simple chick
Who’d rather skip a party for a night just to catch a flick
‘Cause nothing else matters to me, you see
I'm ust a little bit antsy, fancy
With a tad bit of taste and some easy beauty
And a laid back, cool, chill, personality
So pretty please don’t get offended ‘cause I’m a normal guy
But I just like women that don’t have to try
 x2
 x2
Cool girls all around the world now throw your hands up
In the air
If you got the simple things keep em’ up like you really don’t care
