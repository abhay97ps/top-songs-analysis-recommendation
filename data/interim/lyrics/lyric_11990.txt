Street life
Rough necks
Bad guys
On any street
Any street corner
On any street 
Any street corner 
They try to pick me up and take me for a ride
I tell 'em, "No, the girl is satisfied"
They say, "I've got the stuff that really turns you on"
I tell 'em, "No, this little girl's grown"
They say, "Fee, fee" and I say, "No, no, not me
I'm not the kind of girl you're gonna see"
On any street 
Any street corner 
On any street 
Any street corner 
They say, "I've got a dime, I've got a nickel bag
Oh, it's the best stuff you've, you ever had
I've got your pleasure right here in my hand
It'll make you feel just, just like a real big man"
But when I stop to think about the cost
I know that I just might get lost
On any street 
Any street corner 
On any street 
Any street corner 
Oh 
On any street 
Any street corner 
On any street 
Any street corner 
You want it 
That's why 
'Cause they're lookin', lookin', lookin' all around 
Oh, that's why, that's why
I've got to leave you, girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
But you won't find my love
You won't find it
On any street, any street
Any corner of the world
