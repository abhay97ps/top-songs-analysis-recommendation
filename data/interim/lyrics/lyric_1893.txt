Mother, please
I'd rather do it myself
Mama, mama, why must it be
You're picking my brain for me
Well, you tell me who
You tell me how
Don't you know
I'm a big girl now
Mother, please
I'd rather do it myself
Mama, mama, when I go out
You lecture me what love's about
Well, I have to learn from you like this
But look at all the fun I've missed
Mother, please
I'd rather do it myself
You know I've got to
Make love and live a little
And what will be, will be
I'm sure you feel
Tense and irritable
But don't take it out on me
Mama, mama, you know the score
You know you been
Through the mill before
Well, you say to stay at home in bed
But did you obey what your mama said
Mother, please
I'd rather do it myself
You know I'm gonna go out
And do it my way
And find out you were right
Keep your bike out of the driveway
I'm coming home late tonight
Mama, mama, you told me this
There's danger in every kiss
Well, you say I'll learn
A heart can break
Well, that's the chance I gotta take
Mother, please
I'd rather do it myself
Mother, please
I'd rather do it myself
