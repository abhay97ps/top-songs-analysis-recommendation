When I go to all the places we used to go
When I see all the people we used to know
They ask me why I look so sad, I have to say
I got what I wanted but I lost what I had
Without your love I'm such a lonely man, that's what I am
And there's no one but myself to take the blame
Because I once had your love and I treated you so bad
I got what I wanted but I lost what I had
Since you've gone, the bright lights are dim
The people don't seem the same
They're so used to seeing us together
Oh, but my, how things have changed
I went searching, not knowing what I'd find
I looked for something and I had it all the time
Now to think I've treated you so bad, makes me sad
I got what I wanted but I lost  I had
I got what I wanted but I lost what I had
