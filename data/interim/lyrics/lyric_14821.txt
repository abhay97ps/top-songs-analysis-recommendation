Oh baby
When I see your face
Mellow as the month of May
Oh, darling
I can't stand it
When you look at me that way
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you're around
Oh, darling
When I'm near you
And you tenderly call my name
I know that
My emotions are something I just can't explain
I've just got to have you, baby
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you're around
