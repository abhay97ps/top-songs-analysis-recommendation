Whitney Houston & Deborah Cox
Miscellaneous
Same Script, Different Cast
Oh, hey, Deb
Thank you for being woman enough to come
I know he's leaving me for you
That is true
What is he telling you?
Could it be the same things that he told me?
I heard that
Uh-huh
Because I played the scene before
This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now cause it won't last
Same script, different cast
What you're saying could be true
But how can I take advice from you?
Don't say no more, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm not listening, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now cause it won't last
Same script, different cast
It's your fault you didn't love him enough
Oh no, he's changed and I'll prove you wrong
So go away leave us the hell alone
See, he loves me
He'll stay with me
For sure, for sure, oh
This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
Now, now, now, now, now, no, no
Now the roles have changed
Have changed, and I'm the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now, because it won't last
No, same script, different cast
This is a retake of my life
You were his star for many nights
But now the roles have changed
I'm the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now, cause this will last
I'm the future, you're his past
This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
But now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now
Enjoy this now
It won't last
I know it will last
Same script, different cast, oh
