Yeah, yeah, I'm just-a-lookin'
Uh-huh, I'm just-a-lookin'
Yeah, yeah, I'm just-a-lookin'
I'm just lookin' for love
I've got fortune, I've got fame
Everybody in the world knows my name
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, I'm just looking for love
I got diamonds, I've got pearls
I'm the envy of the teenage girls
Yea, yeah, uh-huh, but I'm still looking for love
I drive around in convertible cars
Go to wild parties with the movie stars
I get to wear fabulous furs
But I don't have towels marked "His" and "Hers"
I'll be as lucky as a girl can be
When that certain man comes a-lookin' for me
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, I'm just looking for love
Yeah, yeah, I'm just-a-lookin'
Uh-huh, I'm just-a-lookin'
Yeah, yeah, I'm just-a-lookin'
I'm just lookin' for love
I drive around in convertible cars
Go to wild parties with movie stars
I get to wear fabulous furs
But I don't have towels marked "His" and "Hers"
Who needs all of this wealth untold
When all I need's a little band of gold
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, I'm just lookin' for love
Yeah, yeah, I'm just-a-lookin'
Uh-huh, I'm just-a-lookin'
Yeah, yeah, I'm just-a-lookin'
I'm just lookin' for love
