Are you ready? Woo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dah dah
The best things in life are free, yeah
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dah dah
Free, baby
Boy, when you look at me
Do you judge me by my cover?
Got to be kiddin' me
To think that I'm that kind of lover
I don't mean to disagree
Sorry, you can't buy my kisses
Open your eyes and see
True love comes for free
I'm keepin' my heart open
Hopin' you won't stab me in it
'Cause I've been in love before
And when I had to pay I didn't
I'd lose my sanity
Tryin' to measure your intentions
What do you want from me?
How much will it be?
No more than you're willin' to give 
'Cause you won't pay nothin' for this good lovin' 
It's for free
And I won't make you promises
I'll just do all I can
To be your lover 'cause I understand
The best things in life are free 
Now that I've discovered what you mean to me
The best things  in life are free
Now that we've got each other, the best things in life are free
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey 
Uh-huh-huh, hey, yeah, yeah
Alright 
I like that 
Now, Janet 
I know you are my baby
My one and only baby
You said it twice, I'll say it thrice
My baby, baby, baby
I've got so much love for you 
And it's easy to give it
When I know you feel the same way too 
That's all I expect from you
Just do all that you can
To be my lover 'cause I understand
I do , I do 
They say...
The best things  in life are free 
Now that I've discovered what you mean to me 
The best things in life are free
Now that we've got each other, the best things in life are free
The best things in life are free
Now that I've discovered what you mean to me
The best things in life are free
Now that we've got each other, the best things in life are free
Sister sister kickin' all that jazz 
You funny, honey, want what you never had
A lot of bone structure, I can make it last
A minute to win it, I deep fill the past
Yeah, material, imperial, so get the info
You know, I know, it's not about the dough
So maybe baby, if you want to be my lady
I'll forget the riches and the other itches
Mo' money, mo' money, Jam & Lewis here we go
Mo' money, mo' money, Luther, Janet here we go
Mo' money, mo' money, Biv, DeVoe, here we go, Ralph T
The best things in life are for free
 Free, baby 
No more than you're willin' to give 
'Cause you won't pay me nothin' for this good lovin'
It's for free
And I won't make you promises
You see, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be, we're gonna be, I'm gonna do
The very best I can
To be your lover 'cause I understand
The best things in life are free
Now that I've discovered what you mean to me
Now, hold it, hold it, wait a minute
I still don't think they've got it
Let's tell 'em one more time, check it out
Everybody needs to know that
The best things in life are free
Now that I've discovered what you mean to me
The best things in life are free
