Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Sweet sugar
Pumping through my veins
Every nerve is on a wire
Sweet sugar
You say it's just a game
Soon to be your one desire
When the devil holds your hand
Then you know he's
In command of temptation
Like the beauty of a rose
Or a summer that will go
Where's salvation
Say a little prayer
Say a little prayer for me
Say a little prayer
Say a little prayer for me
Sweet sugar
Your world just tumbles down
How you hunger for illusion
Sweet sugar will
Take more than you own
All you have is your confusion
You'll be standing in the rain
You'll be crying out in shame
For mercy, yeah
So you turn to every man
Say you need a helping hand
Don't desert me, no, no
Say a little prayer
Say a little prayer for me
Say a little prayer
Say a little prayer for me
Say a little prayer
Say a little prayer for me
I don't know what
I've done with my life
I don't want to think
Of all this wasted time
I was in search of paradise
Yet this seems a
Heavy price to pay, yeah
Say a little prayer
Say a little prayer for me
Say a little prayer
Say a little prayer for me
