Im sick of niggas in they fucking feelings behind these bitches
Man go get you some fucking money
I was sent to this Earth from birth, as a curse
With a purpose to purge a permanent perp
On purp anybody wanna body this
I put you down like a rabid bitch
I put you in the pit of Lazarus
Just to feel the thrill to kill your stupid as again
Then make my money front flip like im Harvey Dent
Just to spend it on the dope like David
To travel to the future like Cable
Mix a carbonated with the maple
Till im leaning on your lady
You fake as fable, she gone wanna make a baby
We not related but she call me daddy though
Her mouth a court, imma ball like the Final Four
This water sport, piss them off like a toilet bowl
Im one suburb away from an Oreo
I- never been one for the chit chat
I aim for your head like a tic tac
Im minty fresh when I step on the scene
Im so fresh, im so clean, Im an Outkast
I let my hair down on hoes
You let them snakes in your head like Medusa
You letting that evil seduce you
So you can get powers like Peter when bit by the spider
Pass blunts like the hour floating like pollen
Play in her garden and pick every flower
It ain't bout money then I dont talk bout it
If it ain't bout pussy then I dont talk bout it
I be bilingual when speaking to foreign singles
Imma Stevie Wonder I got jungle fever
These black women hurting decent niggas
Over money figures and a status image
I dont play bout these thangs, I got purple no rain
In my system my veins, I see dimes like Hussein
She got dick in her fangs, suck me dry till I came
Wipe that up it might stain, she like Krang with that brain
I would lay but can't stay, I need the first place
In this race to taste the cake on this plate
Can't eat without grace
Imma waste my time crafting CDs
While these bitches walking in the lab like Dee Dee
I gotta design a demon death till its 3-D
So I can see the evils coming at me
Fuck your mama and your daddy
Rosa Parks I could never take a backseat
To these wack Emcees, trying to make it in this industry
Cold shit life be I-C-E-E
IRAI Ouree, cooler than Mr.Freeze
I dont save a hoe, save a roach for the bowl like Princess Peach
High as I can be like Saturn rings
Life a bitch, time a Samsung Galaxy
Making my hotline bling
With an opportunity hoping I dont need a DVD
Just to switch scenes from the scenery that I seen
Ever since I was 3 times 2 Wicked 6 is me
Prolly would have been slinging dope on the street
If not for the bars I sing so if you ever step to me
You better be the fucking death of me
Or get jumped like a checker piece
Have your body bouncing like a fucking trampoline
All that blood make a nigga look Kaioken
I know that I got sometime to go
Before my energy passing on
Im gonna get where I wanna go
You- want it so bad that you give what you have
To transform like Goku
