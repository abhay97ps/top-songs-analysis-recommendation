Don't forget, to remember me
Don't forget, to remember me 
I'll be back, so remember me 
Please keep me in your heart, if we ever have to part
Don't forget, -get, to remember me
Ay, the King, modern-day Martin Luther, Malcolm X, I'm
Officially the freshest, don't dare forget, I'm
Gone, momentarily, don't bury me yet
Like Ali got, I got the title back, prepare me to that
When the world needed Tip, ask where he was at
But when he need somethin back, nigga fade to black
Talk shit behind his back, you a hater for that
I don't expect nothin less, in the game of chess
You think five moves ahead and not behind
Niggas jumped up, cheered when I got my time
Like, "Yeah! One whole year I got the grind"
But get me losin off your mind shawty, may I remind you that
There ain't another nigga who done been through what I been through
Time after time again, you better get some in you
When you, said it was over for him and you thought
He couldn't continue to floss, here's to your memory loss, suckas!
Don't forget, to remember me
I'll be back, so remember me 
Please keep me in your heart, if we ever have to part
Don't forget, -get, to remeeeeeember me 
They say, outta sight's out of mind
And nine times, out of ten, men out of pocket out of line
You do it big, errybody that you out-shined
Then your ol' lady fate talk 'bout how she got fine
She say she was tryin to get away, he say, "About time"
Right now we all thinkin "Damn, hopin not mine"
But when it's lights out for ya and you locked down
Ain't no tellin whether or not your lady went and got down
Wit the nigga cross town, cause he hot now
Rippin up your love letters, liftin up her night gown
Right now, somebody baby momma gettin piped down
Kids in the next room listenin, "Momma pipe down!"
The thought hurt, don't it? But maybe she's strong enough
Or, ain't get that lonely, cause you wasn't gone long enough
But trust, it's just a temporarily setback
It's on when I get back, please don't forget dat!
Don't forget, to remember me 
I'll be back, so remember me 
Please keep me in your heart, if we ever have to part
Don't forget, -get, to remember me 
I don't mean to feel like this
Don't mean to think like this
My heart just has to be sure
That the love that I give to you
That's the love that I get from you
I need to be safe and secure, oooh-oooh
Don't forget, to remember me
I'll be back, so remember me 
Please keep me in your heart, if we ever have to part
Don't forget to remember me
No, no, no- no, no, nooooooo
Just a friendly message for everybody, man
Who thought I was gone forever
Partna, it's a year and a day and countin, ya understand that?
By the time you hear this, I'll prolly be halfway home
Now remember dat, suckas!
