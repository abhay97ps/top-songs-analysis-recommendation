Girl
Since you've been gone
Just let me say
Listen
Last night I said some things I didn't mean to say
Somehow I let my pride get in the way
And I'm so sorry 
I know I was wrong, but if you just give me one chance
I'll make it up to you, do anything you ask me to
'Cause I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life
I'll make any sacrifice for you
Do anything you ask me to
No I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life
I'll make any sacrifice for you
Do anything you ask me to 
Last night I laid awake
I couldn't stop thinking of you 
I must have called you a thousand times
But I couldn't get through, ooh
So much is going through my mind
I just want you to come back home
Since you been gone, I haven't been the same
I would do anything
'Cause I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life
I would do anything for you
Do anything you ask me to
No I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life
I'll make any sacrifice for you
Do anything you ask me to 
I realized how much I really need you 
'Cause without you here
My life is incomplete
Lady, you are my destiny
'Cause I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life
I'll make any sacrifice for you, oh yeah
Do anything you ask me to 
No I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life
I'll make any sacrifice for you
Do anything you ask me to 
'Cause I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life 
Do anything you ask me to 
No I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life 
Do anything you ask me to
'Cause I don't wanna go on
Without you in my life
Do anything you ask me to
