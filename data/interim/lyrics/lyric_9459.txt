Light up the world with sunshine
Turn  on a brand new day
Give a little love to someone
Take a little hate away
Hold on to one another
Put out your helping hand
Light up the world with sunshine
Shine it on a new born day
Walking close together
Feeling like I do
If only everybody
Could love each other too
We should all be neighbors
Joining hand in hand
Peace with one another
Tryin to build up a better land
We could Light up the world with sunshine
Turn it on a brand new day
Give a little love to someone
Take a little hate away
Hold on to one another
Put out your helping hand
Light up the world with sunshine
Shine it on a new born day
If we could see tomorrow
Through a crystal ball
Use a little magic
Try to change it all
All the nation's children
Sitting by the sun
We're learning it together
So come on everyone
And we can Light up the world with sunshine
Turn it on a brand new day
Give a little love to someone
Take a little hate away
Hold on to one another
Put out your helping hand
Light up the world with sunshine
Shine it on a new born day
Light up the world with sunshine
Turn it on a brand new day
Give a little love to someone
Take a little hate away
