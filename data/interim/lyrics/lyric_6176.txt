Too many people talking in too many different ways
Looks like the politician's got it sewn up today
But a hundred years from now where are they gonna be?
So whatever's making you sad today won't matter when you leave
Take a look around you, don't let the world bring you down
Take a look at yourself, let a smile replace a frown
Trouble is something we got too much of tryin' to find something new
Rivers and rainbows, God's creations, out there waiting for you
Get up on your feet, get 'em to move, take a holiday from the blues
Swim in the river, fly over the rainbow, what have you got to lose?
Take a look around you, don't let the world bring you down
Take a look at yourself, let a smile replace a frown
Take a look at the good that could make you glad you're livin'
Take a look at you and me, there's more love we could be givin'
If it's love that's making you sad, then it's not the love you need
Love is supposed to make you happy, go out and find the love you need
Get up on your feet, get 'em to movin', move, move on down the line
Let your love go for everybody, don't you think it's about time?
Take a look around you, don't let the world bring you down
Take a look around you, let a smile replace a frown
Take a look around you, don't let the world bring you down
Take a look around you, let a smile replace a frown
Take a look around you, don't let the world bring you down
Take a look around you, let a smile replace a frown
Take a look around you, don't let the world bring you down
Take a look around you, let a smile replace a frown
Take a look around you, don't let the world bring you down
Take a look around you, let a smile replace a frown
Take a look around you, don't let the world bring you down
