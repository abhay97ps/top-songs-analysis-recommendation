Imagine she came here to get away

Wouldn’t that be weird? Aw yeah 
She was up tonight to get down
But she don’t wanna be a part of the crowd
Wouldn't that be weird? Aw yeah
I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you
Said it ain't what you do, it's what you do tonight
And there ain’t no shortcut, to doing something right
If you knew what I knew, she’ll be yours tonight
Just look around the club cause, you're here to have a good time
So many benefits to to being quiet, just be cool enjoy the ride
‘Cause all you really wanna do is, wouldn’t that be weird? Yeah

Said it ain't what you do, it's what you do tonight
And there ain’t no shortcut, to doing something right

Just look around the club cause, you're here to have a good time
I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

When your girl come through, Nicki gone crush her
And tell your man, play the back, like a spine

I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you
Said it ain't what you do, it's what you do tonight
And there ain’t no shortcut, to doing something right
