Don't you come over tonight
'Cause Mommy and Daddy don't approve
Of you and me getting too tight
"Why doesn't he get a haircut?"
"Why doesn't he shave?"
"You know he used to be such a nice looking fellow before he grew that awful beard"
That's what my Mama and Daddy keep saying to me
And every time they down you boy
I'll try to make them see
That, though your hair is long
And your mustache's in the sky
For me, you're the right guy

Baby please stay away
'Cause I don't know
What Mommy and Daddy might say
It's gonna be hard for us to keep on lovin' this way
But I got to keep seeing you boy
No matter what they say
No matter how they down you boy
And say you're not my kind
I'm gonna love you honey
'Til the end of time
"I guess we'll have to meet down at the corner from now on"
"That look in your eyes"
"Where you going?"
"Can I go with you?"
"Hey take me with you"
"Don't go away mad!"
"Darlin' just come back"
"Don't you see that, I just don't care what they say'"
"Take me with you"
"Honey"  "I need you" 
 "Hey there's a car" 
"Watch out for the car!"
 "Oh no!"
"Don't leave me"

I'll never see you again
