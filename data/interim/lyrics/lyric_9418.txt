Oh, where you gonna go
Say where you gonna hide
You go on leaving out your heart
And all it's saying deep inside
From here, I can feel your heart beat
Oh, you got me all wrong
You don't have to worry
You just been lonely too long
I know what it means to hide your heart
From a long time ago, oh darling
It keeps you running, oh it keeps you running
It keeps you running, oh it keeps you running
Oh, I know how you feel
Hey, you know I been there
But what you've been keeping to yourself
Well you know it just ain't fair
Are you gonna worry
For the rest of your life
Why are you in such a hurry
To be lonely one more night
I know what it means to hide your heart
From a long time ago
It keeps you running, oh it keeps you running
It keeps you running, oh it keeps you running
