I, I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations 
I'm pickin' up good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations 
I'm pickin' up good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations 
I'm pickin' up good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations 
Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations 
I'm pickin' up good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations 
I'm pickin' up good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations 
I'm pickin' up good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations 
I don't know where but she sends me there
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Good, good, good, good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations 
Good, good, good, good vibrations
Ba da da da da, ba da da
Ba da da da da, da da da 
Ba da da da da, da da da 
Ba da da da da, ba da da
