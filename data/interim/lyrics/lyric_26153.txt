Yeah
This ain't no motherfuckin' gimmick 
Win or lose, this ain't no scrimmage 
Balmain my shoes and my fitted 
Damn you fuckboys and you critics 
Got the trap jumpin' like crickets 
Lambo' truck look like it's kitted 
Load it up, hit the block, spin it 
Loyal to my dawgs, we committed 
Yeah 
I told you none of my shit rented 
They use the lingo I invented 
In this G6, boosted my adrenaline 
High fashion, feel like fly shit I'm chillin' in 
My dawg down the road might have to kill again 
Swear the finest hoes come out for Benjamins 
We some dinosaurs, who think you bigger than? 
This chain cost a quarter milli' 
Condo sixty floors up, you can see the city 
When the bitch let me fuck, she hate to admit it 
Her shit wet when she bust, my shit sticky, sticky 
Yeah, I dig it, dig it 
Wanna bring your friend too, yeah, I'm with it, with it 
Nut inside, look like glue in your pretty kitty 
My next signed deal, I'm spendin' a ticket, ticket 
This ain't no motherfuckin' gimmick 
Win or lose, this ain't no scrimmage 
Balmain my shoes and my fitted 
Damn you fuckboys and you critics 
Got the trap jumpin' like crickets 
Lambo' truck look like it's kitted 
Load it up, hit the block, spin it 
Loyal to my dawgs, we committed 
Love for 'em all
Bossed up and gave a few bones to my dawgs 
Fuck the jail system, man, fuck the four walls
I feel like 2Pac, above all the law 
I pour a quick Dew up and let it dissolve
1017 Guwop, Backwoods look like logs
Pull out that trench blazer, the end and the fall
The world full of haters and internet blogs 
I'm way out in Greece, ain't receivin' no calls
He disrespect, chop off his head with a saw 
You look out 'cause you think a blessing involved
Ain't none of these cheap, Chrome cross on my drawers
She kissed on my cheek, I dug in her jaws
Don't get on your knees, you ain't toppin' it off
You niggas police and be tellin' it all
This ain't no motherfuckin' gimmick 
Win or lose, this ain't no scrimmage 
Balmain my shoes and my fitted 
Damn you fuckboys and you critics 
Got the trap jumpin' like crickets 
Lambo' truck look like it's kitted 
Load it up, hit the block, spin it 
Loyal to my dawgs, we committed
