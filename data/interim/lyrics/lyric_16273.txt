Don't it hurt so bad... (Time...
And it hurt so bad... Chance...)
Tryin' to find the faith before the fall
Good man's down, while a bad man's standin tall
Strongest one don't always win them all
Going crazy, going crazy
Time and Chance
The way they do my life is going round
Never straight up, sideways, upside down
Brothers livin' six feet underground
Oh got me crazy, I'm so crazy
Ohh... Time and Chance
So bad... so, so bad
A poor man lives in happiness
A millionaire evil as he wanna be
A good man going hungry...
'Cause of Time and Chance
I'm tryin to find the faith before the fall
A good man's down, while a bad man's standing tall
A strong man don't always, win 'em all
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, baby!
Don't it hurt so bad? 
And it hurt so bad, 
Don't it hurt so bad 
And it hurt so bad 
Time and Chance... Don't it hurt so bad
So bad, so bad
Don't hurt so bad
And it hurt so bad...
