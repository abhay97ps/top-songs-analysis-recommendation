Oh shit, you live in the canyon
How big is your mansion? Yeah
Fresh out of school
Now you working and focus on fashion
Pretty girl, and you let go
Got time, but you got goals
Hey baby, waste your time with me in California
Hey baby, waste your time with me in California
La la la la la

La la la la la
Now we at the same house party
La la la la la
If you wanna waste time
Baby, waste your time with me in California
Hey baby, waste your time with me in California 
Oh shit, you born in the Hamptons
I heard that's expensive
Damn, and you famous on Insta
Your pics is a blessing
I think you could be a centerfold
No need for the money, though

I'm a California N-I-G-G-A
Fuck wit' me, girl, I look like bae
My grass is greener, girl, without no snakes
Them other niggas full of games, girl, this not no prank
Just broke up wit' yo' man, it’s the right time 
We throwin’ money at a stripper, that’s the right vibe 
I come alive at night time 
She said all she really wanna do is fuck, I said, "Likewise" 
I like you on top like cilantro 
You like it in your mouth like blanco 
I run the city, come fuck wit' a Pablo 
I want you, not the code to your iPhone 
Straight player 
Your friends said don’t fuck wit' me, straight hatin’ 
Wasting time in Cali, ain't really wastin' time
'Cause you meet a ball player, that’s a come up, right?
La la la la la

If you wanna waste time
