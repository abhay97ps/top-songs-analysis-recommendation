You know what? It's taken me a long time, baby
To realize how much you mean to me
I don't wanna lose you
Times are hard, my spirits are weak, oh yeah
Everything seems to be going wrong, outlook's bleak
You know I fooled around playing the field
That's when I found that your love was real
No, I haven't treated you so right
But I won't lose your love without a fight
I'm going to hold on to the love we have together
Hold on, don't you say goodbye
Won't you tell me now before we lose forever
Girl, I don't want to lose you
Girl, I've got to have your sweet loving
'Cause without it, girl, I'll just lose my mind
The way you hold me comforts me and shows me
That a love like yours is hard to find
I need your loving every day and night
Your kind of loving makes me feel alright
I'm going to hold on to the love we have together
Hold on, don't you say goodbye
I want you to tell me now before we lose forever
Girl, I don't want to lose you now
I don't wanna lose you
See, no, I don't wanna lose you now
Baby, don't go, baby don't go, not now, no no baby
Baby, don't go, I need you by my side girl, yeah
Baby, don't go, I love you so
And I don't want to lose you
You know it took me a long time to finally realize
That a good thing is hard to find
That's why I'm standing right here with you today, girl
I want to keep you forever, I've come to my senses, girl, you know
I don't want to go anywhere, I'm coming home
I'm going to hold on to what we got, baby, yeah
Hold on, just can't say goodbye, no no, not now
Tell me now before we lose forever
Girl, I don't want to lose you
Don't want to lose you
I'm going to hold on, yeah, got to hold on
Hold on, don't say goodbye, don't say goodbye, not now
Tell me now, got to live our lives together
Girl, I don't want to lose you now
I don't wanna lose you, baby
Don't wanna lose you now, I need you
