Little GTO, you're really lookin' fine
Three deuces and a four-speed and a 389
Listen to her tachin' up now, listen to her why-ee-eye-ine
C'mon and turn it on, wind it up, blow it out GTO
Wa-wa,  wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
Wa-wa,  wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
Wa-wa  wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
You oughta see her on a road course or a quarter mile
This little modified Pon-Pon has got plenty of style
She beats the gassers and the rail jobs, really drives 'em why-ee-eye-ild
C'mon and turn it on, wind it up, blow it out GTO
Wa-wa,  wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
Wa-wa,  wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
Wa-wa  wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
Gonna save all my money  and buy a GTO
Get a helmet and a roll bar  and I'll be ready to go
Take it out to Pomona  and let 'em know , yeah, yeah
That I'm the goodest thing around
Little buddy, gonna shut you down
When I turn it on, wind it up, blow it out, GTO
Wa-wa,  wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
Wa-wa,  wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
Wa-wa  wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
