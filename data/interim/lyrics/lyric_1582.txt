Hey, Leah Leah
Hey, Leah Leah
Here I go
From the hut to the boat to the sea for Leah
Uh huh! I gotta go diving in the bay
Gotta get a lot of oysters
Find some pearls today
To make a pretty necklace for Leah
Leah
I gotta go deep and find the ones just right
I'll bet my Leah will be surprised tonight
I'll place the pearls around the only girl for me
Leah
But something's wrong
I cannot move around
My leg is caught
It's pulling me down
But I'll keep my hands shut tight for if they find me
They'll find the pearl for Leah
And now it's over
I'm awake at last
Oh, heartaches and memories from the past
It was just another dream about my lost love
About Leah
Hey, Leah Leah
Hey, Leah Leah
Here I go
Back to sleep and in my dreams
I'll be with Leah
Leah
Leah
