She calls me Goliath and I wear the David mask
I guess the stones are comin' too fast for her now
You know I'd like to believe this nervousness will pass
All the stones that are thrown are building up a wall
I have become cumbersome
To this world
I have become cumbersome
To my girl
I'd like to believe we could reconcile the past
Resurrect those bridges with an ancient glance
But my old stone face can't seem to break her down
She remembers bridges, burns 'em to the ground
I have become cumbersome
To this world
I have become cumbersome
To my girl
Too heavy, too light, too black or too white, too wrong or too right
Today or tonight, cumbersome
Too rich or too poor, she's wanting me less and I'm wanting her more
The bitter taste is cumbersome
No, yeah, no, no, no
No no, no, yeah
There is a balance between two worlds
One with an arrow and a cross
Regardless of the balance life has become
Cumbersome
Too heavy, too light, too black or too white, too wrong or too right
Today or tonight, cumbersome
Too rich or too poor, she's wanting me less and I'm wanting her more
The bitter taste is cumbersome
No, yeah, no, no, no
No no, no, yeah
No no, no, no, yeah
Your life has become cumbersome
