Sorry
Ooh, yeah 
Sor-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ry
Woo, ooh, yeah, yeah
Oh, girl, I know that you're attracted to me
And I should feel the same about you
But there's something wrong
I don't know what it is
That keeps us from becoming a two
It's not your looks 
It's not your style 
It's not the way that you carry yourself
Oh, girl, I'm 
You're not my 
‘Cause you're the kind of girl that a man's dreams are made of
Oh, girl, I'm 
You're not my 
‘Cause you're the kind of girl that a man would be proud to call his own
Girl, you're so pretty
I wouldn't change a thing about you
But I've been in love before
So I know how it feels
The chemistry just isn't there
It's not your looks 
It's not your style 
It's not the way that you carry yourself
Oh, girl, I'm 
You're not my 
‘Cause you're the kind of girl that a man's dreams are made of
Oh, girl, I'm 
You're not my 
‘Cause you're the kind of girl that a man would be proud to call his own
 You're not my 
‘Cause you're the kind of girl that a man's dreams are made of
Oh, girl, I'm 
You're not my 
‘Cause you're the kind of girl that a man would be proud to call his own
Man, I don’t know what’s wrong with that brother
You know what I’m saying, Mike?
On the serious tip, I think the girl is pretty fly
You too, Ron?
Yeah
I think he’s just buggin’, man
Yo, if I had it, I know what I’d do with it?
But if you had it, what would you do?
I’m not tryna put you down 
But you’re just not that girl
And even though you’re not my kind 
You’re still so fine
Oh, girl, I’m sorry
I’m sorry
You’re not my...
Kind of girl; you’re so pretty
Oh, girl, I’m 
I wish you were my…
My kind of girl
You’re the kind of girl that a man would be proud…
 …to call his own
Sorry, woo!
You’re not my...
You’re not my…you’re not my, you’re not my, you’re not my kind
Oh, no 
You’re not my…you’re not my, you’re not my, you’re not, you’re not my kind
 I’m sorry, baby
