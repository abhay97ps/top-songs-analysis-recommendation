Don't you know that I'm lost without your love
And I just keep dreamin'
Of the way that it used to be
So satisfied
Yeah, honey, but ever since you've been gone
Well, I just can't along
Oh, I can't get along without you, baby
Hoh, right by my side
You know you took, took my heart
Yeah, you took it and you tore it apart
Well, I just couldn't keep ya
Even though I tried, don't you know I tried
And I really really love you so
How much you'll never never know
And I can't get along without you, baby
Hoh, right by my side
You know that in your arms is where I long to be
Ahh, yes sir
And I hope someday I'm gonna find me a way
To bring you back home to me
And when you left me all alone
Oh, I sat right down and I cried
'Cause I can't get along without you, baby
Hoh, right by my side
Just gotta be right by my side, oh, yeah
Well, in your arms is where I long to be
Ah, yes sir
And I hope someday I'm gonna find me a way
To bring you back home to me
Now when you left me all alone
Oh I sat right down and I cried
'Cause I can't get along without you, baby
Hoh, right by my side
Just gotta be right by my side
In the mornin', right by my side
In the evenin', right my side
In the between time, right my side
After breakfast, right my side
