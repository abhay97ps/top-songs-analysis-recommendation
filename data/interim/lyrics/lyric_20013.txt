Je suis désolé
Lo siento
Ik ben droevig
Sono spiacente
Perdóname
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before and I
Can take care of myself
I don't want to hear, I don't want to know
Please don't say "Forgive me"
I've seen it all before and I
Can't take it anymore
You're not half the man you think you are
Save your words because you've gone too far
I've listened to your lies and all your stories
You're not half the man you'd like to be
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before and I
Can take care of myself
I don't want to hear, I don't want to know
Please don't say "Forgive me"
I've seen it all before and I
Can't take it anymore
Don't explain yourself 'cause talk is cheap
There's more important things than hearing you speak
You stayed because I made it so convenient 
Don't explain yourself, you'll never see
Gomenasai
Mujhe maaf kardo
Przepraszam
Sli'kha
Forgive me
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before and I
Can take care of myself
I don't want to hear, I don't want to know
Please don't say "Forgive me"
I've seen it all before and I
Can't take it anymore
Don't explain yourself 'cause talk is cheap
There's more important things than hearing you speak
I don't want to hear, I don't want to know
Please don't say "Forgive me"
