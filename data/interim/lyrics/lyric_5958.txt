“Up on Prospect” - Sample from The Notorious B.I.G. - “Warning” 
Yo, I’m
Out for dead presidents.  Brooklyn is the residence
That make a nigga want to come here kind of hesitant
To the fact that he could get his dome split from the
Top of his arm to his armpit.  You better
Beware.  Watch when the rhyme hit ‘cause I’m like
A snake terrorist: I’ll bomb shit.  My revo-
-lutions disperse with confusion.  9 Glock
Tongue—which clip am I using to shatter
Reality?  Straight from the source, I’ll make it up
‘Til Friday, when I nail you to the cross.  Better yet
Easter, when I release the Mandingo
Feature to a straight-up señorita
She could get it just like the next.  Drunk off
The gin, got her chasing with the Beck’s.  Or better
Yet, get something that make me sweat.  And after fifth
Of bitch, I got to chase it with the sex.  And then I’m
Aight.  Now I can relax, unclip
The MAC, eat some snacks, hit the sack.  And that’s my dai-
-ly operation.  My occupation
Has no relation to emcee reincarnation

Yo
How many emcees in the world want to battle?
I’ll bet your bottom dollar I could shake you like a rattle
You ride my rhymes like saddles on black stallions.  I’ll drink the
Alc’ right from the bottle like a water fountain.  I’m counting
C-notes from the floor to the ceiling
Better believe these Brownsville niggas is stealing
Hillfiguz forever on your mind when you sleeping
Hillfiguz forever on your mind when we’re creeping
I’m getting deep and mad “Deep” like Funkadelic
My words, they catch herbs like Magnum, P.I., but Tom
Selleck.  Now tell it to your man if he’s listening
This is for my peoples on the Hill, and we ain’t kidding

There’s no
Surprising.  Better yet, no disguising
I got the shit that keeps Andre Rison
Despising all of those that tried to
Oppose.  I’ll smack the snot right out your nose
Stand clear ‘cause ’97 is the year
Like Tampa Bay, have no fear ‘cause I be Buccaneer/bucking near
The real thing.  You know?  Trips to Tahiti
Smoking.  Bitches on the wall wet like graffiti
Sweet like molasses, turn emcees to Clay like
Cassius.  Rhyme style puts Earth off its axis
I’ll smash this.  Better yet, I’ll blast this
Type of style that turn Catholic into Baptist
