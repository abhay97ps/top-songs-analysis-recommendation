Would you walk to the edge of the ocean
Just to fill my jar with sand?
Just in case I get the notion
To let it run through my hand
Let it run through my hand
Well, I don't want the whole world
The sun, the moon, and all their light
I just want to be the only girl
You love all your life
You love all your life
Would you catch a couple thousand fireflies
Yeah, and put them in a lamp to light my world?
All dressed up in a tux and bow tie
Hand delivered to a lonely girl
To a lonely, lonely girl
Well, I don't want the whole world
The sun, the moon, and all their light
I just want to be the only girl
You love all your life
You love all your life
Lately I've been writing desperate love songs
I mostly sing them to the wall
You could be the center piece of my obsession
If you would notice me at all, yeah
Well, I don't want the whole world
The sun, the moon, and all their light
I just want to be the only girl
You love all your life
You love all your life
You love all your life
Life
Yeah
