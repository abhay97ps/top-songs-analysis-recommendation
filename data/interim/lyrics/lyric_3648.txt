She doesn't really want things
That you can never get
Still every now and then
Maybe she'll complain a bit
Because she feels upset
She only wants you
To tell her that you love her
So if she wants you
To turn winter into Spring
Promise her anything
She's dreaming of
Promise her anything
She will be happy
If she only gets your love
She has a lot of dreams
And you can make them all come true
Cause all she really wants
Is to know you care for her
The way she cares for you
So why not promise her rubies even diamonds
She'd trade them all for a plain golden wedding ring
Promise her anything
She's dreaming of
Promise her anything
She will be happy
If she only gets your love
Oh you can promise her the moon
When the sun is bright
Promise her the sun
When you're out at night
Promise her the world
And promise her ever
Wish is your command
And you'll discover soon
She doesn't want the moon
Just love will do
Promise her anything
But don't you ever
Let her get away from you
