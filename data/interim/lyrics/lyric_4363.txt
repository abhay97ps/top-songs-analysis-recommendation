When your baby leaves you all alone
And nobody calls you on the phone
Don't you feel like crying
Don't you feel like crying
Well come on, baby
Cry to me
When you're all alone
In your lonely room
And there's nothing
But the smell of perfume
Don't you feel like crying
Don't you feel like crying
Now come on, cry to me
Nothing can be sadder
Than one glass of wine alone
They tell me that loneliness
Loneliness is such a waste of time
And I know
I know you don't ever have to walk alone
You see, you can come on and take my hand, baby
And walk with me, yeah, listen
When you're waiting
For a voice to come
Late in the midnight hour
And there is no one
Don't you feel like crying
Don't you feel like crying
Come on, baby 
Baby, baby, come on and cry to me
Woah, come on, baby
Come on, come on and cry with me
You don't have to be a slave, little girl
You can come on and cry to me
Woah, you don't have to wait for no appointment, darling
You can come on home and cry to me
