Hey, little girl, you don't have to hide nothin' no more
You didn't do nothin' that hadn't been done before
Little girl thought she wouldn't get caught, you see
She thought she'd get away with goin' out on me, yeah
Other girls did it, you didn't think of nothin' new
You went out on me, so other girls did it too
You can leave, little girl, I don't want you 'round no more
If you come knockin', you won't get past my door... yeah!
You got nothin' to hide and everybody knows it's true
Too bad, little girl, it's all over for you... ha-ha-ha-ha
