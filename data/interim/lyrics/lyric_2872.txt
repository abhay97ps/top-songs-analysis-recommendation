DON'T FORGET I STILL LOVE YOU
Bobbi Martin
Don't forget I still love you
Everyday we're apart
Someone else will be kissing you
But you'll still be in my heart
Don't forget I still love you
When his arms hold me tight
Just remember that I still care
Tho' I'm losing you tonight
When I told you I loved you
I promised I'd be true
And I'll keep that promise
My whole life thru
I could never forget you
And how our love was so true
Goodbye my darling and don't forget
That I'm still in love with you
