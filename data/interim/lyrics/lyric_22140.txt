And you said, "Rise above"
Open your eyes up
And you said, "Rise above"
But I can't
I can't
How long will it take
Before these feelings go away?
How much longer must I wait?
And are there any real answers, anyway?
Yeah
Your silence in a crowded room
Louder than the loudest tune
I hang on every word
And you said, "Rise above"
Open your eyes up
And you said, "Rise above"
But I can't
I can't
I miss you in everything
I was too fast travelling
To take you in
I know that silence is no crime
Just wish I could hear you fill it up
One more time
Yeah, I know what you'd say to me
Exactly what you'd say to me
I still hang on every word
And you said, "Rise above"
Open your eyes up
And you said, "Rise above
Yourself"
In a time of treason
Is there time for trust?
Where there's no them
Only us
Is there time for reason?
Has your heart had enough?
Is it time to let go
And rise above?
And you said, "Rise above"
Open your eyes to love
And you said, "Rise above
Yourself"
