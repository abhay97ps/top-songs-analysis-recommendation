Baby, come on over tonight
We can make it all right
Take a piece of my heart
And go from the start
You say that you want me
Again and again
You say that you need me
To be more than just your friend
So I thought about it
And maybe you're right
I've been checking your records
And they seem all right
Baby, come on over tonight
We can make it all right
Take a piece of my heart 
And go from the start
Baby, come on over tonight 
We can make it all right 
Boy, there's no one like you 
Do you feel it too? 
Baby, come over, come on

So when we get together
If just for a while
Let's make it happen
Don't waste any time
And now I need to find out
What you're about
So come over tonight
Let's sort this out
Baby, come on over tonight 
We can make it all right 
Take a piece of my heart 
And go from the start
