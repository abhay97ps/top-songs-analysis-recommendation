I just let lil' mama suck me up, girl
Is you tryna cry in a Rolls Royce or the bus‚ girl?
I jumped off the porch and went straight up‚ girl 
You can leave your town and head to another world
What the move?
I'm tired of eyein' you
I'm tired of spyin' on you
'Til the pain mines too
I made it rain on you
When it was hard to maintain too
I was playin' games with you
Like you could never play games too, woah 
You just gotta tell me what you want 
Louis Vuitton, diamonds‚ keep calm 
All you do is point at what you want 
Crystal cut pointers in the charm, c'mon 
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' 
Nigga tryna buy the cash cost 
Percy Miller, brazy with the woes
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' 
You make it twerk for me
You get a purse from me
Eighty thousand dollars for her Birkin
You get a verse for free
I make her worship me
Copy it in bursts for me
Turn to a P-I-M-P‚ I make her work for me
You don't want the bag, oh no, no, no
I make her drop it and pop it and work it on my nose
I make her shut up then suck it, she fuckin' at my shows, mmh
I make her shut up, she fuckin', she suckin' at my shows, ayy
Drip, drip, no shoestring my sneaker, won't trip
My jeans is so tight they don't fit
Still walk around with a stick on my hip
VVS diamonds right behind my lip
Don't walk with less than fifty on my wrist
Diamonds so cold on my neck, it got me sick
Raf Simons, mix it up with the Rick
Flexin' on these haters who sent me 'my bad'
Made it from the soil, made it from the Rex
Richer than your first, richer than your last
LUV, know I got swag
Pop a rubber band, pop another Xan'
I groove around, party pack my hand
I'm seeing double lookin' through my lens
Tell me what you want, I just want your friend
You just gotta tell me what you want 
Louis Vuitton, diamonds, keep calm 
All you do is point at what you want 
Crystal cut pointers in the charm, c'mon 
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' 
Nigga tryna buy the cash cost 
Percy Miller, brazy with the woes
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' 
You make it twerk for me
You get a purse from me
Eighty thousand dollars for her Birkin
You get a verse for free
I make her worship me
Copy it in bursts for me
Turn to a P-I-M-P, I make her work for me
You don't want the bag, oh no, no, no
I make her drop it and pop it and work it on my nose
I make her shut up then suck it, she fuckin' at my shows, mmh
I make her shut up, she fuckin', she suckin' at my shows, ayy
Diamonds, they drip down my wrist
Let's get it, fuck all the skits, woo
Left wrist sittin' on a brick 
Bitch have it locked like a pick 
Fittz Park, came for the shit
Grab a AK for the wrist
Gorilla, rockin' Bape on a bitch
Potential court case on a bitch 
We livin' state to state on a bitch 
We never ever play with the bitch 
Do everything the same on a bitch 
We known to pick the brains of a bitch 
I throw the big B's on a bitch
I got a few C's on a bitch 
I'm in another league on a bitch
My diamond 'bout to ski on a bitch 
What's the move?
I'm tired of eyein' you 
I was tired of spyin' on you
'Til the pain mines too 
Make it rain on you 
It was hard to maintain too, ooh 
I was playin' games with you
Like you couldn't play games too, hey, okay
You just gotta tell me what you want 
Louis Vuitton, diamonds, keep calm 
All you do is point at what you want 
Crystal cut pointers in the charm, c'mon 
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' 
Nigga tryna buy the cash cost 
Percy Miller, brazy with the woes
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' 
You make it twerk for me
You get a purse from me
Eighty thousand dollars for her Birkin
You get a verse for free
I make her worship me
Copy it in bursts for me
Turn to a P-I-M-P, I make her work for me
You don't want the bag, oh no, no, no
I make her drop it and pop it and work it on my nose
I make her shut up then suck it, she fuckin' at my shows, mmh
I make her shut up, she fuckin', she suckin' at my shows, ayy
