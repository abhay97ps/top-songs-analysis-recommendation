If it's the last thing I do
I'll make you mine
But baby, the first thing is you
In my design
Oh, and just like the stars guard the moon
Way up above me...
Hey baby, that's just how I'll guard our love
So love me, come on, please love me
Well, if it's the last thing I do
I'm gonna take your hand
And though I won't say one word
I know you'll understand, yeah yeah
And I'll build a dream just for two
And then I'll make it come true
Baby, if it's the very, very last thing that I do
I'm gonna get you, yeah yeah
Well, well, well, well, well
I'll build a dream just for two
And then I'll make sure it comes true
Baby, if it's the very, very last thing that I might do
While I'm down here on this Earth
I can teach the world, how to smile
Baby, if I just had you, yeah yeah
I could be so happy
And I know I could make you happy too
So I'm gonna take your hand
And baby, I'm sure you'll understand, yeah yeah
If it's the last thing I do
I'm gonna get you
I'm gonna make you mine
Hey, if it's the very last thing I do...
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah...
