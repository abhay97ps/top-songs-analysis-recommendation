Can't be no secrets
If we're going to last
Can't keep anything from me
Future, present or past
Unanswered questions
And shades of gray
Lead to suspicion
That ain't the way
Secrets
There should never be
Secrets
Between you and me
Hidden truth or fantasy
Got nothing to hide
Come on and open up for me
Let me come inside
What I don't haunts me
What you don't say burns
There's nothing you can show me that'll shock me
Nothing I don't want to learn
Secrets
There should never be
Secrets
Between you and me
Oh
Secrets
There should never be
Secrets
Between you and me
Oh
Between you and me
There should never be 
Secrets 
Never be secrets
