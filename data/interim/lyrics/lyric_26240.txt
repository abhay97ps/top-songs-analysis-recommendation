Wrist on glitter , waist on thinner 
I'ma show you how to bag a eight-figure nigga 
Face on zaddy , pockets on Jigga 
You better get the card and make it swipe like Tinder 
Private villa and the fur chinchilla 
When he post me, all the hoes get sicker 
Fuckboy killer, I don't need fillers 
Never been a lame so the real bitches feel it 
Daddy on the FaceTime, you could never take mine
End up on the Dateline, uh, uh, uh 
Rich with no day job, bitch, hit your wop, wop
Always on the court side, uh-huh, huh
B-B-Billionaire niggas wanna eat me out 
Bitch, I'm from the West Coast, they wanna go down South
All these lame ass niggas tryna fuck for clout
Hm, I won't let him hit but he can put it in his mouth

You got a itty-bitty waist , pretty in the face 
Never let a broke nigga take you on a date 
Nah, haters can't relate, bitch, I've never been fake 
I got a real nigga puttin' icing on my cake 
Icy from my lips to my fingers to my toenails
Drippin' in Shanaenae, this ain't goin' on sale
All these hoes busy, baby, I do not do friends well
Lotta niggas pussy, but I promised that I won't tell
Hmm, now, what's my favorite word? 
Bitch gon' smile, but I know she don't like me
Two hundred for a verse, bitch, I'm way too pricey
Fuck around and bring back hyphy
