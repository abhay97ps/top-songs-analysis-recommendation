The years in our lives go by
Looking back, I still wonder how you are
Will you still remember me
Are you the same, have you changed
Since we`ve been apart
I miss the way that you used to look at me
A child-like look in your eyes
It is too much to ask to
Think of me sometime
Have you still got that same old look in your eyes
Not everybody changes
There`s something that the years cannot disguise
Have you still got that same old look in your eyes
Not everybody changes
I close my eyes and I see
Through the miles to lose time
A search through my distant past
The face holds a shadow of a child
That used to be a best friend of mine
Have you still got that same old look in your eyes
Not everybody changes
There`s something that the years cannot disguise
Have you still got that same old look in your eyes
Not everybody changes
What became of simple dreams we shared
We grew past the love that showed we cared
We found life in reflections of the last days of a child
Have you still got that same old look in your eyes
Not everybody changes
There`s something that the years cannot disguise
Have you still got that same old look in your eyes
Not everybody changes
Have you still got that same old look in your eyes
Not everybody changes
There`s something that the years cannot disguise
Have you still got that same old look in your eyes
Not everybody changes
