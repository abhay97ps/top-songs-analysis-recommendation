Don't know what to say
Cause it's been so long since
I've seen you look at me this way
Don't know how to feel
Your eyes tell me
You want me back
But I can't believe it's real
Forgive me for dreaming
But I thought I saw you look at me
With your loving eyes
Like when you did way back when
Forgive me for dreaming
But it's so good
To see those loving eyes again
Living alone
I knew I lost the best that I ever known
So long to wait
But if seeing is believing
I know
It's not too late
Forgive me for dreaming
But I thought I saw you look at me
With your loving eyes
Like when you did way back when
Forgive me for dreaming
But it's so good
To see those loving eyes again
We were the best
I never thought we'd fall apart
Like all the rest
Oh, no, no
So much too fast
It's time I take it slow
To watch it grow and make it last
Forgive me for dreaming
But I thought I saw you look at me
With your loving eyes
Like when you did way back when
Forgive me for dreaming
But it's so good
To see those loving eyes again
Forgive me for dreaming
But I thought I saw you look at me
With your loving eyes
Like when you did way back when
Forgive me for dreaming
But it's so good
To see those loving eyes again
Forgive me for dreaming
But I thought I saw you look at me
With your loving eyes
Like when you did way back when
Forgive me for dreaming
But it's so good
To see those loving eyes again
