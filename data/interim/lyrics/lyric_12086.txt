Love come down
All the way down
No sleep last night
Been dreaming of you
Please hold me tight
'Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
Deep in the night
You took my heart
Now danger's in sight
'Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
Do, do, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, do, do, do
Baby, you make my love come down
You make my love come down
Make it come all the way down
Oh you make my love come down
Baby, you make my love come down
You make my love come down
Can't do without your tender love
There's no way out
And I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
Your love has a force
Got me under your spell
So take me,  I'm yours
And I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
Shoo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, oh
Baby, you make my love come down
You make my love come down
Make it come all the way down
You make my love come down
Inside out when you're around
Ooh, you make my love come down 
Love come down
Ooh, you make my love come down
Make it come all the way down
You make my love come down
Inside out when you're around
Ooh, you make my love come down 
I can't help the way that I feel without you, baby
I can't help the way I feel
You make my, you make my love come down
When you're around, baby, yeah
Baby, you make my love come down, come down
Come down
