If you ever need you some lovin' now
Send for me 
I said if you ever, ever need you
Some lovin' now, just send for me
Don't you worry how you fare
Because, baby, I'll take care
So if you ever, ever need you
Some lovin' now, send for me
If you ever, ever need you some huggin' now
Send for me 
If you ever need a little bit
Of huggin' now, just send for me
And though we all works with troubling mind
Just send for me, I'll be on time
So if you ever, ever need you
Some huggin' now, send for me
In the winter, when it gets too cold
Send for me 
In the summer, when it's a little too warm
Just send for me 
Don't you worry how you fare
Because, baby, I'll take care
Please believe me, if you need me
Send for me 
Send for me
Send for me
