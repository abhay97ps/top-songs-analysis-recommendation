I've been a brother to sorrow
I've been surrounded by gloom
'Cause this hotel's got hot and cold runnin'
Heartache in every room
Checkin' out of here in the mornin'
Even that will be too much time
I'm gonna get up on a big white bird
Waitin' after you with a line
Oh, the runway is the one way to get back to you
Oh, the runway is the one way to get back to you
If I have to beg, steal or borrow
I'll be seein' you, girl, tomorrow
Oh, the runway is the one way to get back to you
TV's gonna get to me
Haven't heard a bit of good news 
Who needs that when I'm sittin' here chewin'
 smothered in blues
Operator, wake me at seven 
Don't you wait a minute too long
I'm gonna leave with a one-way ticket
Goin' back to where I belong
Oh, the runway is the one way to get back to you
Oh, the runway is the one way to get back to you
If I have to beg, steal or borrow
I'll be seein' you, girl, tomorrow
Oh, the runway is the one way to get back to you
Oh, the runway is the one way to get back to you
Oh, the runway is the one way to get back to you
Yeah, the runway is the one way
