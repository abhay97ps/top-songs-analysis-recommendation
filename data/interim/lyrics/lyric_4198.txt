Callin' out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancin' in the streets
They're dancin' in Chicago
Down in New Orleans
Up in New York City
All we need is music 
Sweet music 
There'll be music everywhere 
There'll be swingin', swayin', and records playin'
And dancin' in the street
Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere around the world
There'll be dancin'
They're dancin' in the street
This is an invitation across the nation
A chance for the folks to meet
There'll be laughin' 
And music swingin'
And dancin' in the street
Philadelphia, PA 
Baltimore and D.C., now 
Yeah, don't forget the Motor City 
All we need is music 
Sweet music 
There'll be music everywhere

Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grasp a girl
Everywhere around the world
There'll be dancin'

Not to mention Halifax, Nova Scotia
