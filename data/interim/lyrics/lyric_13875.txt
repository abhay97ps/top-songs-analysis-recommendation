Steam was rising in the Asian quarter
When she stepped out in the street
Voices dropped and every eye was on her
As she braved the midnight heat
Dominique, she was a cool oasis
She could soothe the burning heart
Dreams of passion written on their faces
One by one they fall apart
Soldiers of fortune surrender like children
And follow wherever she leads
And they all fall down
It's one more night of 
Every heart is falling
But something else is calling her into the night
Can't you hear me? 
I'm coming back to find you
Don't let the shadows blind you from love when it's mine
To eyes that stared she never shared emotion
It's a secret that she keeps
And no one sees the tears that I see falling
Urgent whispers calling me
Conquering heroes have soon fallen prey
To that far away look in her eyes
And they all fall down
It's one more night of 
Every heart is falling
But something else is calling her into the night
Can't you hear me? 
I'm coming back to find you
Don't let the shadows blind you from love when it's mine
And they all fall down
And they all fall down
Can't you hear me? 
Every heart is falling
But something else is calling her into the night
Can't you hear me? 
I'm coming back to find you
Don't let the shadows blind you from love when it's mine
Every heart is falling
But something else is calling her into the night
Can't you hear me? 
I'm coming back to find you
Don't let the shadows blind you from love when it's mine
When it's mine
