I never did it, no, I won't admit it
Why should I lie for you anymore?
You never loved me, you pushed and shoved me
I see the woman I never saw
I saw you laugh when the knife was twisted
It still hurts, but the pain has shifted
I'm lookin' back at the time that drifted by
But I won't cry for the wasted years
'Cause you ain't worth the salt in my tears
Feeling neglected, used and rejected
You need a shoulder to lean upon
Maybe you've picked him, found your next victim
Don't worry, someone will come along
I broke the spell that you kept me under
I had enough of the rain and thunder
I lost track of the time and I wonder why
But I won't cry for the wasted years
'Cause you ain't worth the salt in my tears
I sit around and drink a few more beers
Until the memory just disappears
'Cause you ain't worth the salt in my tears
I saw you laugh when the knife was twisted
It still hurts but the pain has shifted
I'm lookin' back at the time that drifted by
But I won't cry for the wasted years
'Cause you ain't worth the salt in my tears
'Cause you ain't worth the salt in my tears
'Cause you ain't worth the salt in my tears
