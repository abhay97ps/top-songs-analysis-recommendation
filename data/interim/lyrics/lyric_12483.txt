Woo woo
Dear mommy, dear daddy
You had plans for me, oh yeah
I was your only son
And long before this baby boy
Could count to three
You knew just what he would become
Run along to school
No child of mine grows up a fool
Run along to school
When you tried to tell me what to do
I just shut my mouth and smiled at you
One thing that I know for sure
Bad boys, stick together
Never, sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo, woo woo
Good guys, they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Dear mommy, dear daddy
Now I’m 19, as you see
I'm handsome, tall and strong
So what the hell gives you the right
To look at me as if to say “Hell, what went wrong?”
Where were you last night?
You look as if you had a fight
Where were you last night?
Well I think that you may just be right
But don’t try to keep me in tonight
Because I’m big enough to break down the door
Bad boys, stick together
Never, sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo, woo woo
Good guys, they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Boys like you are bad through and through
Still, girls like me
Always seem to be with you
We can’t help but worry
Mixing with the wrong boys
Easy girls 
Cigarettes 
Why do you have to be so cruel?
You’re such a fool
Bad boys, stick together
Never, sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo, woo woo
Good guys, they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Bad boys, stick together
Never, sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo, woo woo
Good guys, they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
