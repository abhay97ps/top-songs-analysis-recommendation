Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
Suddenly I feel all right
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun 
Smiling, having fun 
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue 
Like I always do 
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely?
Part of a success that never ends
Still, I'm thinking about you only
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
But it's gonna be all right
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun 
Smiling, having fun 
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue 
Like I always do 
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun 
Smiling, having fun 
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue 
Like I always do 
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
 Lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun 
Smiling, having fun 
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
But I won't feel blue 
Like I always doâ€¦
