You don't have to be a star
Baby, come as you are
With just your heart
And I'll take you in
You're rejected and hurt
To me you're worth
What you have within
Now, I don't need no superstar
'Cause I'll accept you as you are
You won't be denied
'Cause I'm satisfied
With the love you inspire
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show
Somebody nobody knows
Could steal the tune
That you want to hear
So stop your running around
'Cause now you've found
What was cloudy is clear
Oh honey
There'll be no cheering from the crowd
Just two hearts beating out loud
There'll be no parade
No TV or stage
Only me till your dying day
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my
My, my, my, my, my show
Don't think your star has to shine
For me to find out
Where you're coming from
What is a beauty queen
If it don't mean
I'm your number one?
Oh honey
And I don't need no superstar
'Cause I'll accept you as you are
You won't be denied
'Cause I'm satisfied
With the love you inspire
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my
My, my, my, my, my show
