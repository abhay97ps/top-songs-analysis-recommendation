Ah, the bells are ringin'
For me and my gal
Ah, the birds are singin'
For me and my gal
Everybody is knowin'
Ah, to a weddin' they're goin'
And for weeks they've been sewin'
Every Susie and Sal
Ah, they're congregatin'
For me and my gal
The parson's waitin'
For me and my gal
And someday
I'm gonna build a little home for two
For three or four or more
Ah, in Loveland for me and my gal
Yeah, whoa
Ah, they're congregatin'
For me and my gal
Ah, the parson's waitin'
Ah, for me and my gal
Yes, someday
I'm gonna build a little home for two
For three or four or more
Ah, in Loveland for me and my gal
Woooh, whoa
Come on, pretty baby, whoa
