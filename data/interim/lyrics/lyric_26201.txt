Got a call from a friend about a friend
With some news no one ever wants to hear
It hit me like a punch, it took my breath
He was just gettin' into his best years
Yeah, somethin' like that'll shake you up
Wake you up
So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
And I called mama
It rang a couple times, and she picked up
I can always hear her smile when I call
I just called to tell you that I loved you
I was missing you and dad and home, that's all
I got to really thinking this morning
About what's important
So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
And I called mama
And from now on
I ain't gonna wait so long
To stop off at a Texaco, buy a Slim Jim and a coke
Park out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grab my guitar from the back seat, write a song just for me
Sing it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I think of home, grab my phone from my pocket
Instead of sayin' tomorrow, I'm gonna
And I called mama
And I called mama
