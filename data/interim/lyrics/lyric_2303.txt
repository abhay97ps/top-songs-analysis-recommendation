INT. MICHELLE'S ROOM
JESSE: All right
JOEY: And the diaper is...ON
JESSE: Beautiful! 17 minutes. We beat our old record by 37 minutes.
JOEY, JESSE: Baby wipe.
JOEY: Hold it. I'm about to make a quantum leap in diaper theory.
JESSE: Go with it, go with it.
JOEY: If we triple the diaper, we get three times the protection, but we change her one third as often.
JESSE: Loving it, loving it. We get two diapers and Michelle Tanner, come on down.
JOEY: The other way to go is to tie a hefty bag around her waist. That way we'd only have to change her on trash day.
JESSE:  Jr. Jammy time. Ha!
JOEY:  It's you!
JESSE: All right. We go. We put the leg in...like....so...simply...uh...we tie...like this...very nice.
JOEY: Wow! Snagging a plan. I suggest something else. We go with the lovely two piece ensemble from baby Almani.
JESSE: Using your head, using your head. All right. here you go.
JOEY: Oh yuppie, baby.
JESSE: Oh, this is great.
Danny walks in
DANNY: Ok I got the girls...
JOEY, JESSE: TADA!!!
DANNY: Gentleman, Tarzan, who was raised in the jungle by apes, went to bed in better shape than that baby.
JESSE: Big deal. You're about a guy who wore diapers his entire life.
DANNY: I really appreciate the effort, but I'll take it from here.
JESSE: Oh yeah! Now that all the work is done. Good night, Michelle.
JOEY:  Good night, Uncle Jesse. Next time you see me, I'll have a big surprise for you. I don't care how many diapers I have on. Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha.
DANNY:  Give me my kid!  Oh! You really are a good sport.
In Jesse's Room, Stephanie walks in.
STEPHANIE: Hi, Uncle Jesse
JESSE: How are you doing, kid?
STEPHANIE:  What's happened to my room?
JESSE: It's pretty cool, huh? Look at this!  I hung Elvis up here.
STEPHANIE: Over my bunnies?
JESSE: Stephanie, you're bunnies are very...pink.
STEPHANIE: My mom made these bunnies just for me. Don't you like them?
JESSE: These bunnies. I love these bunnies. I'm sure Elvis had bunnies hanging all over Graceland.
Danny walks in
DANNY: Okay riddle time. What had blond hair, purple P.J.'s, and is way past their bedtime?
STEPHANIE: Um... Elvis?
Joey walks in
JOEY: Steph, the sandman express is coming. All aboard.
Stephanie goes on Joey's back
STEPHANIE: HO HO
JESSE:  You see that? Any of your ape friends do that for Tarzan?
INT. DJ AND STEPHANIE'S ROOM
Joey and Stephanie go through the door while DJ is already in bed. Joey and Steph to her bed.
JOEY: Next stop...Stephanie's bed.
Stephanie goes in to bed under the covers
STEPHANIE: Thank you, sandman express.
JOEY: And the sandman express runs every night.
DJ: If I get on now, you'll drop me off at the nearest hotel?
Danny and Jesse walk in
DANNY: Ok, let's say goodnight.
JESSE: Alright, goodnight JR babes.
STEPHANIE: Uncle Jesse, tell us a bedtime story.
JESSE: Uncle Jesse doesn't not know any bedtime stories.
STEPHANIE: Yes he does.
JESSE: No he doesn't.
STEPHANIE: Yes he does.
JESSE:  No he doesn't.
STEPHANIE:  Yes he does.
JESSE: I'll make one up!
STEPHANIE: Yeah!
Stephanie runs to DJ's bed and lies to the right of her
JESSE: Alright fellows, help me out here.
JOEY: We'll make it to a game. Steph, you start the story and you girls point to us when you want someone else to take over.
STEPHANIE: Okay. Once upon a time there was a pretty girl named Cinderella.  Daddy.
DANNY: And uh..Cinderella wanted to go to this big fancy ball. And on the way she wandered into this cabin, and she fell asleep in papa bear's bed.
STEPHANIE: I don't think so.
DANNY: No wait honey, it gets better. She is on the bed, out like a light. When all of a sudden....
STEPHANIE: Joey...
JOEY: Um..when Cinderella woke up, she was real thirsty. So she went to a Seven-Eleven and got a Slurpee where...she ran into Bullwinkle. Bullwinkle said  "Hello Cinderella. Would you like to come to the ball with me? Not only am I a great dancer but you can hang your coat on my antlers."  Kids love this stuff.  So...
DJ: Uncle Jesse!
JESSE: So Cinderella and Bullwincle, they get married right. They go on the Newly Wed Game. And they win a grand prize selected especially for them. The End. Good night.
STEPHANIE: Daddy.
DANNY: Until the big bad wolf came on them. And he said "Open up, or I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house down. And I can do it to because as we all know wolves have an amazing lung capacity.
STEPHANIE: Joey!
JOEY: Hhhhhhuuu!!
DJ: Uncle Jesse!
JESSE: So the wolf, the moose, and the babe, they all fell in love right. They move to Sweden where the people are a lot more cool about sort of things. And that's the end of the story. Good night and good bye.
DJ: No monsters, no witches, but that story was very scary.
DANNY: Ok sweetheart.  It's time to go to bed.
STEPHANIE: Can I ask one more favor?
DANNY: Sure honey. What is it?
Stephanie goes to her bookshelf and takes out a pile of books. Then gives them to Danny then goes to bed under the covers
STEPHANIE: Study these story books. We'll talk about them in the morning.
DANNY: :Ok. Who wants Puddle Duck and the Quack-Quack Gang?
JESSIE, JOEY: Read it!
INT. LIVING ROOM
Joey and Danny are leaving. Jesse comes down the stairs to the door with his band stuff
JESSE: Oh, Joey, Danny. How are you guys doing. Good night. 
DANNY: Wow, wow. Hold it guys. Red light.Guys,the only way that three adults can leave the house at the same time is if three children are with them. Two adults can leave, one adult can leave,three,two or one child can leave with one to three adults. The three adults can never leave with three or less chrildren. Got it?
JESSE: Look that's all fascinating stuff. But I have have to get to band rehearsal.
JOEY: Yeah. I have a ten thirty slot at the laugh machine.
DANNY: I have to do the sports at ten o clock. I'm sorry Jesse.
JESSE: What do you mean "I'm sorry. Jesse" Why not I'm sorry Joey or I'm sorry Danny?
DANNY: Because I have an actual job that pays money.
JOEY: And I bring the gift of laughter into the world at ten thirty.
JESSE: Yes, well I make music, songs that touch people's hearts, that penetrate their very souls. Now how can you compare that to telling jokes?
JOEY: Are you seriously trying to tell me that music is more important than comedy?
JESSE: You got it, pal.
JOEY: Two words. Oozy Osborne.
JESSE: Two more words. Rip Taylor.
JOEY: The Partridge Family.
JESSE: Anyone on Hee-Haw.
JOEY: Charo.
JESSE: Bozo
JOEY: Hey. Bozo did some brilliant work.
JESSE: Oh yeah, right, right. The early Bozo was real good. I'm sorry.
JOEY: Ok. We'll settle this with the only way truly fair way. Ready go.  Once again comedy kicks music's butt.
DANNY: I'm sorry man. All three girls are sleeping like angels. I know I could trust you Jesse. If there's even the slightest problem.
JESSE: Yeah, yeah go live your life. Hey. Babe it's fine. I'll just give up my dreams to be a success in the music business. I'll sit home and read Honey Bunny and the Wee Little Glen.
DANNY: I couldn't put it down.
JESSE: Get out of here.
Danny and Joey leave.
INT. KITCHEN
Jesse goes in the kitchen where DJ and Stephanie are taking ice cream out of the freezer. They see Jess.
DJ and STEPHANIE: Hi Uncle Jesse.
JESSE: Hi, girls. Girls, you're supposed to be in bed girls. Wow, wow...girls, girls...you're supposed to be in bed girls dreaming about Tweety Bird or Big Bird or Larry Bird or something.
DJ: Uncle Jesse, if we get hungry, dad always makes sure we have a late night snack.
STEPHANIE: We're going to have ice cream sundaes and chocolate milk.
DJ: And cookies. 
JESSE: Freeze chick. Alright, I know I'm pretty hip here. You guys think I'm a..I'm a idiot or something? Let me tell you something. I know what's going on here. Your dad's gone and it's let's take advantage of the baby sitter time. I've got news for you girls. Your Uncle Jesse is a little too sharp to be taken on that kind of ride. Now you guys can have ice cream and chocolate milk, no cookies.
STEPHANIE: Yeah!
DJ: Ok
INT. STEPHANIE AND DJs' ROOM
Stephanie is jump-roping while DJ is holding one side. Bed side holding the other. Food on the floor under a table next to the bed
STEPHANIE:  Hey my name is Zippy and my hus' name's is Zorro. We come from San Francisco with the coddled up zebras. Hey my name is Alice...
DJ: That's enough from jump rope. Let's do the hand jive. 
STEPHANIE: Ok. But I can't stop jumping. I may never sleep again. Thanks.
D.J: :Two balls of ice cream triggers you a lot of pep huh?
STEPHANIE: Does pep mean you can't blink?
DJ: No pep is PARTY TIME!
INT. LIVING ROOM
Jesse and the band are getting ready.
JESSE: I've got three little girls upstairs sound asleep. Sticks. Licorice. All right. here we go. Jumping Jack Flash in B. Ready. One, two, three, four. I was born in a cross fire hurricanes. What's the matter? Someone out of tune? 
STEPHANIE: Do you guys do any Bangles stuff?
JESSE: Wow, wow girls. You're supposed to be in bed. What would your dad say about this?
DJ: He wouldn't mind. He'd say we're really lucky we have a chance to listen to the greatest rock band in the world.
JESSE: Oh well, yeah. If you put it that way, yeah, Ok.
DJ:  Great hair. Could you show me how to do that?
Raven: Sure. It's really easy. It just sprays right on.
DJ:  Oh, thats for me.
JESSE: Wow
DJ: Oh, I bet my dad forgot to tell you about our 11 o clock pizza. Hi, how much?
Pizza Man: Eleven fifty.
DJ: Did the cheese slid off or stick to the box? 
STEPHANIE: No.
DJ: Keep it.
Pizza Man: Hey do you mind if I check out the band?
DJ: Come on in. Open party!
JESSE: All right, girls listen here now. It's almost midnight. You guys listen to two, three songs max, eat your pie, then straight to bed. No nonsense.
STEPHANIE: Boy are you straight.
JESSE: Ready. Here we go.
JOEY: Conga. Boy are you gonna get it.
DANNY: Attention solid gold farm team. It's twelve fifteen and your hair is purple. Get down. And I don't mean funky. Boy, boys, boys. Walk with me, talk with me.How could you possibly let this happen?!!
JOEY: Hold it. On behalf of Joey. I would just like to say that Joey is innocent. Oh, it's true I was doing a Conga when you walked in but I Conga alot. Hi my name is Joey and I'm a Conga-holic.
DJ: Well, it's way past our bedtime. Come on Steph. Good night everybody.
DANNY: Girls get back over here. You're in just as much trouble as they are.
DJ: Dad, I know we were supposed to...
JESSE: DJ hang on a second. It's not the girls fault. It's mine. I invited the band over, I woke the girls up, I ordered pizza was throwing a party and I needed chicks.
JOEY: Baby alert. Beep. Beep. Baby alert!
DANNY: You girls get right into bed. You guys follow me and if that babies hair is purple...
INT. UPSTAIRS HALL
DANNY: You're irresponsible and your unreliable. I'll get back to you.
MICHELLE'S ROOM
DANNY: Oh Michelle, oh honey, it's ok. Daddy is here. I see what this is. Michelle is getting a new tooth. Oh that really hurts.
JESSE: I had nothing to do with it.
DANNY: Poor baby, imagine, a sharp pointy, calcified projectile, ripping and knifing its way through you soft, tender, inflamed gum tissues.
JOEY: I say we buy her a pony.
DANNY: Sometimes a teething ring helps.  Here Michelle. Here you go. Here honey. She loves it.
JOEY: Is this anything like catching the bouquet? Am I the next one to get married?
JESSE: All right fellows. Let the pro in. I'll show you how it's done. All right little Munchkin. Where does it hurt? Oh yeah. Give me my finger back. Kid.
DANNY: Well your brains not working tonight, but your finger is doing great. Joey do me a favor. I put one of Michelle's teething rings in the freezer. I would like a word alone with the alleged babysitter.
JOEY: Jesse, I guess it's a bad time to ask for that girl singer's phone number.
JESSE: Get out of here.
DANNY: Well, well.
JESSE: What, what.
DANNY: Shame, shame.
JESSE: I feel like I'm being chewed out in the Grand Canyon.
DANNY: I suppose I should be happy the house is still standing. I must've been crazy to think that you were adult enough to take care of my kids. You really let me down.
JESSE: Wait a minute, where are you going?
DANNY: Oh, I thought I'd call the Beastie Boys and ask them if they wanna take the girls to the park tomorrow.
JESSE: You love this, don't you?
INT. STEPHANIE AND DJs' ROOM
Stephanie and DJ are talking in the middle of the room.
STEPHANIE: Uncle Jesse's is the best baby sitter we've ever had.
DJ: Yeah, but I'm thinking he's in big trouble.  Get in the bed.  No your bed! 
DANNY: Girls are you awake?
DJ: : Dad, is that you?
STEPHANIE:  Is it morning?
DANNY: DJ, Stephanie, come over here right now.  Girls, we have a problem with Uncle Jesse.
DJ: Oh, no, dad. We didn't have any problems with Uncle Jesse at all.
DANNY: I'm sorry. He was just so irresponsible. What is this?  Uh-oh?? Empty bowls and empty cartons. Oh, now I see what happened. Uncle Jesse forced ice cream Sundays and chocolate milk down your throats. And then he hid the evidence under your table. Oh, the sick fiend. He probably ignored you when you told him no sweets after bedtime, huh?
DJ: Probably.
DANNY: No probably about it. Because otherwise you'd be lying. And you know better than that, don't you?
STEPHANIE: Probably...
DANNY: Well that does it. I guess asking Uncle Jesse to move in here was a big mistake. In fact, this may be a matter for the police. Now sweet dreams my perfect little angels.
DJ and STEPHANIE: Daddy, we were bad.
DJ: We did everything. We even ordered the pizza. We should go and apologize to Uncle Jesse.
DANNY: You're right. You go first.
DJ: Are you gonna punish us?
STEPHANIE: Before you answer that, we saved you a slice of pizza.
In Michelle's room. He still has his finger in Michelle's mouth
JESSE: Good point, Michelle. The thing I wonder is what is life all about anyway. I mean 24 hours ago I was a relatively cool guy. Today, I'm a six foot teething ring. All right bed time. We're going to my bed. Come with me, come on. Let's go.  Ok hang on. I put it back. There you go. Come with me.
DJ: Uncle Jesse.
JESSE: Whatever it is the answer is no.
DJ: We just wanted to say thanks for trying to keep us out of trouble. The only reason we took advantage of you is because you had no idea what you were doing.
STEPHANIE: From now on we will be good and do whatever you say.
DJ: Steph, don't get crazy.We'll try to do better.
STEPHANIE: You can cover up my bunnies if you want.
JESSE: That's all right. Your bunnies are starting to grow on me.
STEPHANIE: We really love you.
JESSE: I love you girls too.But next time you pull that stuff on me..I'm still gonna love you.
Michelle: Daah...
DANNY: Now you girls go to bed for real, or I'm taking everything out of your room and turning it into a 24 hour mini-mart.
DJ: Good night, everybody.
STEPHANIE: Good night daddy. Good night Michelle. Good night Uncle Jesse.
DANNY: Good night honey.
INT. MICHELLE'S ROOM
Danny is holding a piece of pizza
DANNY: Hi
JESSE: Hi
DANNY: Want a piece of pizza?
JESSE: No. me and the little leech are gonna try to get some sleep.
JOEY: I couldn't find Michelle's teething ring so I got the next best thing. An ice cold carrot. Well I could've bought the fish sticks but you guys would've thought I was an idiot.
DANNY: Look Jesse. I want you to know that was really nice of you to take the rap for DJ and Stephanie. And I'm real sorry, I got so crazy before walking around you saying well...well...well.
JESSE: It's cool...cool...cool.
DANNY: The girls just mean so much to me. Especially now, you know, since Pam's gone.
JESSE: I know what your saying, man, I worry about them to. There my neices. Ha..but I don't know nothing about this kid stuff.
DANNY: Yeah, I know, but both of you guys, you gotta remember, don't be afraid to say no. Kids need limits.
JESSE: What am I supposed to know? I've been here twelve hours. You're expecting me to be Robert Young.
JOEY: Now wait I'm confused. Is it Robert Young from "Father Knows Best", or Robert Young "Dr. Welby?"
DANNY: This is gonna take some time. But we can make this work if we want it to work. Jesse, you do want this to work, don't you?
JESSE: Oh, at first I wasn't sure. But, I don't know, when I saw that kid, tell me I could cover her bunnies up, and I was looking at that little baby in my arms, counting on me to stop her from being in pain. I don't know man. I got all warm and tingling...somebody...stop me.
JOEY: You know, I'm just happy to be here. I was an only child. All I had was imaginary brothers and sisters. It feels great to be in a real house with real people. Right Leon?
DANNY: Give me my kid.  Ok Michelle, time to go to bed. Yeah. Lullaby and good night ,and there's more words I'm not sure of....
JESSE: Conga.
JOEY: Come on Leon.
