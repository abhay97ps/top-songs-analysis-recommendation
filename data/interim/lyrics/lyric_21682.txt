Those school girl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind
I know they will still live on and on
But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
Oh, it isn't easy, but I’ll try
Across the sky in 
That would soar a thousand feet high 
To sir, with 
The time has come
For closing books
And long last looks must end
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong
That’s a lot to learn
What can I gift you in return? 
If you wanted the moon, I would try 
 rather you let me give my heart
To sir, with love
