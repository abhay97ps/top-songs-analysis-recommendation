Oh, oh, oh-oh
Seen the way you talkin' up my phone last night, on God
Mally Mall
It was way more than a two dollar holla
Stole your heart like Ali Baba 
Seen the way you talkin' up my phone last night, on God 
Do it on my jet, let's keep this private
She wants me too, she ain't even in denial 
Wanna make love, she ain't even in denial 
We can get away-ay, maybe to Guatemala 
Got me goin' deep, got me all in freshwater 
Baby, when you laughin', is it 'cause you feel an excellent vibe? 
That was just a fraction of the good love I provide 
See some niggas talkin' on the side, can you keep that silent? 
Maybe sayin' somethin' but you didn't mean nothin' by it
Took her to the room, in other words, kept that private 
She was my heartbreak, I told her keep those violets 
Seen the way you talkin' up my phone last night, on God 
Do it on my jet, let's keep this private
She wants me too, she ain't even in denial 
Wanna make love, she ain't even in denial 
We can get away-ay, maybe to Guatemala 
Got me goin' deep, got me all in freshwater 
Flew in on a jet, what's that? Stylish
Take another sip, then get superpowers 
If she got the hots for me, then dammit, I'm buyin' 
I've got more pull than him and him combined 
Pourin' out dreams, 'cause we're really this high 
I just had my hand on her hip, she had her eyes on the prize 
Seen the way you talkin' up my phone last night, on God 
Do it on my jet, let's keep this private
She wants me too, she ain't even in denial 
Wanna make love, she ain't even in denial 
We can get away-ay, maybe to Guatemala 
Got me goin' deep, got me all in freshwater 
Seatbelt, she roller coaster ridin'
Put you on a plane, been thinkin' 'bout it
Sippin' on Fiji, yeah, you taste like water 
Chasin' me, tryna make me your partner 
Maybe we can lock in later on 
I can't guarantee I'll fall 
Baby, we should lock in later on 
I can't guarantee my heart 
Baby, don't take too, too long 
I ain't ever miss my mark 
Yeah, my ex-girl had to move on 
There's no pictures on the wall 
Seen the way you talkin' up my phone last night, on God 
Do it at my house, let's keep this private 
She wants me too, she ain't even in denial 
Wanna make love, she ain't even in denial 
We can get away-ay, maybe to Guatemala 
Got me goin' deep, got me all in freshwater
