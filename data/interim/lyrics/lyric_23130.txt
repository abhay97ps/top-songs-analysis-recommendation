Oh my god, I love this song
This is my jam
Where is my peanut butter?
2 PM, getting out of my bed
Trying to get Friday out of my head
It's all so hazy
Got a little too crazy
You know I'd do it all again
Call everyone you know
Turn up the radio
'Cause this is our song
We can do no wrong
Are you ready, are you ready to go?
This Saturday, we're gonna party all night
One we will remember the rest of our lives
This Saturday, we're gonna do it bigger than
We ever have before
I don't want this Saturday to end
I don't want this Saturday to end
I don't want this Saturday to end
Hey, come over
(Alright, alright, I'll be right over
I just gotta find my pants.)
Rolling up, I'm on the scene
Want you here right next to me
Yeah, 'cause this is our night
Ain't got no deadlines
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Call everyone you know
Turn up the radio
'Cause this is our song
We can do no wrong
Are you ready, are you ready to go?
This Saturday, we're gonna party all night
One we will remember the rest of our lives
This Saturday, we're gonna do it bigger than
We ever have before
I don't want this Saturday to end
I don't want this Saturday to end
I don't want this Saturday to end
I don't want this Saturday to end
I don't want this Saturday to...
Yesterday was Friday
Today is Saturday
We're gonna live like there's no tomorrow
Wouldn't have it any other way
Yesterday was Friday 
Today is Saturday 
We're gonna live like there's no tomorrow
Wouldn't have it any other way
This Saturday, we're gonna party all night
One we will remember the rest of our lives
This Saturday, we're gonna do it bigger than
We ever have before
I don't want this Saturday to end
I don't want this Saturday to end
I don't want this Saturday to end
This Saturday, we're gonna party all night
All night, all night
I don't want this Saturday to end
This Saturday, we're gonna party all night
All night, all night
I don't want this Saturday to end
