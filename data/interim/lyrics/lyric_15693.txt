All bound for Mu Mu Land
All bound for Mu Mu Land
All bound for Mu Mu Land 
All bound for Mu Mu Land
They're Justified, and they're Ancient
And they like to roam the land
They're Justified, and they're Ancient
I hope you understand
They called me up in Tennessee
They said "Tammy, stand by The JAMs"
But if you don't like what they're going to do
You better not stop them 'cause they're coming through
All bound for Mu Mu Land 
All bound for Mu Mu Land 
Mu Mu Land
Mu Mu Land
All bound for Mu Mu Land
They're Justified, and they're Ancient
And they drive an ice cream van
They're Justified and they're Ancient
With still no master plan
The last train left an hour ago
They were singing "All aboard"
All bound for Mu Mu Land
Then someone starting screaming "Turn up the Strobe"
All bound for Mu Mu Land 
All bound for Mu Mu Land 
Justified and Ancient, Ancient and a-justified
Rocking to the rhythm in their ice cream van
With the plan and the key to
Enter into Mu Mu
Vibes from the tribes of the Jams
I know where the beat is at
'Cause I know what time it is
Three on the dot
Make mine a "99"
New style, meanwhile, always on a mission while
Fishing in the rivers of life
Fishing in the rivers of life 
Fishing in the rivers of life 
Fishing in the rivers
Fishing in the rivers
Fishing in the rivers of life 
Voo-va-voolie
Za-shi-va-zom
Voo-va-voolie
