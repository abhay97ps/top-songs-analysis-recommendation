Wind and storm
Gone's the sun
From the stars
My dark has come
You've gone from me, whoa, whoa
Tragedy
Oh, come back 
Have me here 
Hold me love 
Be sincere
You've gone from me, whoa, whoa
Tragedy
Like smoke 
From a fire 
Of love , whoa
Our dreams 
Have all gone 
Above , whoa
Blown by wind 
Kissed by the snow
All that's left is the dark
Below 
You've gone from me, whoa, whoa
Tragedy
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Tragedy
