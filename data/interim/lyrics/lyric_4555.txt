Well, I woke up this mornin'
You were on my mind
I said you were on my mind
Oh, I got troubles, whoa, whoa
I got worries, whoa, whoa
I got wounds to bind
So I went to the corner
Just to ease my pain
I said just to ease my pain
Oh, I got troubles, whoa, whoa
I got worries, whoa, whoa
I came home again
But I woke up this mornin'
You were on my mind
You were on my mind
Oh, I got troubles, whoa, whoa
I got worries, whoa, whoa
I got wounds to bind
But I've got a feelin'
Yeah, down in my shoes
I said way down in my shoes
Well, I gotta ramble, whoa, whoa
I gotta move on, whoa, whoa
I gotta walk away my blues
When I woke up this mornin'
You were on my mind
I said you were on my mind
Well, I got troubles, whoa, whoa
I got worries, whoa, whoa
I got wounds to bind, yeah
