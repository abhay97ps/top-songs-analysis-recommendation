I was a fool
And like a fool, I cannot hide my sorrow
I was a fool
I thought that you would share all my tomorrows
Though I was wrong
Believing you'd belong to me forever
Now that you’re gone
I hope I learn to live again in time
In time, I may forget your smile
And in a while, I may forget I love you
In time, I may forget my tears
And through the years, I may forget I need you
In time, maybe there'll be a new love to love me
I can't go on belonging to the past
But I pray that one day in time
You’ll come back and be mine
I love you
I need you
In time, maybe there'll be a new love to love me
I can't go on belonging to the past
But I pray that one day in time
You'll come back and be mine
In time, maybe there'll be a new love to love me
I can't go on belonging to the past
But I pray that one day in time
You'll come back and be mine
