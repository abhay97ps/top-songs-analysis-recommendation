Well I was feelin' so bad
So I asked my family doctor 'bout what I had
I said now doc 
Mister MD 
Oh can you tell me 
What's ailing in me 
Chorus
He said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All you need
All you really need
Is good lovin'
Gotta have lovin'
Good lovin'
Everybody gotta have lovin'
Good lovin'
Gimme, gimme some lovin'
Good lovin'
So come on baby, well squeeze me tight
Don't you want your daddy to feel alright
Well I said now baby 
Well it's for sure 
I got the fever 
And you got the cure
