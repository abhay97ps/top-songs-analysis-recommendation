When I think of home, I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I was home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowing
Wind that makes the tall grass bend into leaning
Suddenly the raindrops that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the scene
Makes it all clean
Maybe there's a chance for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It sure would be nice to be back home
Where there's love and affection
Then just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Givin' me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend 
Let me start again
Suddenly, my world has gone and changed its face
But I still know where I'm going 
I have had my mind spun around in space
Yet I've watched it glowing
Oh, if you're listening, God, please don't make it hard
To know if we should believe in the things that we see
Tell us should we try and stay or should we run away 
Or would it be better just to let things be
Living here in this brand new realm 
Might be a fantasy, ohh 
But it taught me to love
So it's real, real, real to me
And I've learned we must look
Look inside our hearts to find
Yeah, a world full of love 
Like yours, like mine 
Like home!
Home!
