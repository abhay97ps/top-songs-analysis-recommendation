I will never stop, never stop
Keep goin', keep goin'
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I make Yeezy Boost moves in my Reeboks
It ain't gon' never stop
Tryna run a billion up until my ankle pop, yeah
You'll get rich and have problems that you never thought
It bring tears knowin' we came up out the sandbox
Made it out the trenches, it got harder for my niggas
I just wanna see my dawgs ball, seven figures
I done got rich and it cursed me
Ever since I got successful, they envy
Tryna shake the devil, on promethazine
Tryna show you love but you don't feel me
Gave up on me so you turned your back
I can see the demons 'cause a nigga been blessed
I can tell you worried, but a nigga been in debt
I can't get caught up inside the matter
I should've did better, but it's chatter
I ran up my money off the gravel
Love is just a word, it don't matter to me
I got so rich, nothing matters to me
I'm livin' my second life, it's so amazin'
I done been hit with a bullet, and one grazed me
I done been considered a failure, it don't faze me
I done came up out the ghetto, my crib gated
Same niggas played with the devil, these niggas hatin'
All these bitches fuck with no rubbers, this shit brazy
Icy-ed out the Hublot, these niggas lookin' fugazi 
Money stack tall past the ceilin', I can't be jaded
I done came from sleepin' on floors, you can't persuade me 
I been takin' other niggas' hoes, it's gettin' outrageous 
Rich nigga gettin' caught with a bitch worth minimum wages 
Fuckin' with my ego, but I never lost a lady 
Fucked a pop star after I got my dreads braided
Never dropped her name but her head game contagious 
Twenty percent of my dames, I shipped 'em right out to Vegas 
You can feel the pain when I'm rappin' 'cause I'm ragin' 
You can see my past and where I was on they faces 
I done flipped the truck over and crashed, ducked the agents 
I been with these blue hundreds like a nigga racist 
I been gettin' richer each year, feel like I'm racin' 
Tried to tell you the formula but you wouldn't take it
Hard work and perseverance, they ain't related 
Poppin' up on Forbes is fuckin' up my relations 
Ten milli' plus on a crib and it's vacant 
I can see it vividly at the crib, Rico basement  
Watch him get the mula, I was sittin' back bein' patient 
I was sittin' back, programmin' my brain, I was in trainin' 
I be in my coupe, Maybach, and I ain't have to trade it 
Thinkin' 'bout when I was posted up when they raided 
Now I Double R and Ghost it up, I feel spacious 
I don't feel the safest, but I feel gracious 
I thank God every day, I don't feel basic
Probably lose my sanity if I ain't have my babies 
Probably be gamblin' with my life if I ain't made it
Home invasions, and you ain't have to persuade me 
Cut it with a razor and serve it 'til your day
Came from whippin' out the bowl, Tom Ford suit and tie 
Get my grandma to serve my dope, that ain't a lie 
You can tell I've been broke when you look into my eyes 
Nobody done noticed 'til the jet was in the sky
Bringin' tears to my eyes 
Nobody done noticed 'til the jet was in the sky
Bringin' tears to my eyes 
Gotta tell The WIZRD, it's a story like a book
Tears in my eyes
I can't forget where I came from
I lost a lover, it's alright
It can't be worse when I lost my main homie to the streets
You should've never give up on me without hearin' my side of the story
I can't forget where I came from

Bringin' tears to my eyes
