Do do do ...
Hey, little girl
Won't you meet me
At the schoolyard gate
I got back stage passes
To the biggest show in town
So, honey, don't you make me late
If we leave really early and we hurry
We can get in with the band
'Cause little Tim Smitty's
Got his old man`s van
So let's get to getting
While the getting is right
And roll with the rhythm tonight
God knows that I love my music
Ain't no one gonna change my tune
Don't you know that I love my music
Ain't never gonna change my tune
Hey, little girl, want to
Dance with you all night long
The music got me buzzing
And I feel pretty loose
I feel the rhythm and it's
Comin' on strong, baby, baby
Lay the rhythm on me, baby
There's power in the sound
With everybody jumping
We can bring the house down
So let's get to getting
While the getting is right
And roll with the rhythm tonight
God knows that I love my music
Ain't no one gonna change my tune
Don't you know that I love my music
Ain't never gonna change my tune
God knows that I love my music
Ain't no one gonna change my tune
Don't you know that I love my music
Ain't never gonna change my
Do do do.....
Love my music
Ain't no one gonna change my tune
Don't you know that I love my music
Ain't never gonna change my tune
