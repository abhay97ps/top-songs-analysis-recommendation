Hey, have you ever tried
Really reaching out for the other side
I may be climbing on rainbows, but baby, here goes
Dreams are for those who sleep, life is for us to keep
And if you're wond'ring what this song is leading to
I want to make it with you
I said I want to make it with you you, baby
I want to make it, I got to make it
Hey, I want to make it with you, baby
Because we belong together 
Oh, we can make it, girl
No, you don't know me well
Every little thing, only time will tell
If you believe the things that I do then we'll see it through
Life can be short or long, love can be right or wrong
If I choose the one I'd like to see me through
I want to make it with you
Said I want to make it with you, baby
I want to make it with you, baby
I want to make it with you, girl
I want to make it, wanna make it with you, baby
Said we belong together 
We are going to be so happy, baby 
I know we can, I know we can
Dreams they're for those who sleep, life is for us to keep
If you believe the things that I do
We're gonna see it through
Life can be short or long, love can be right or wrong
If I chose the one I'd like to see me through
I want to make it with you
I really want to make it with you, girl
Oh, can I have your love
I said I need, I need your love
I'm gonna lock you into my love
Hey, I'm gonna lock you into my love
Because we belong together
