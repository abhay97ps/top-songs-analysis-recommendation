I set my mind to it said I wasn't going to do it
No how, no sir, no way
I wouldn't give my heart up
Going to keep my guard up and save it for another
Then you walked in with that crazy grin and everything I swore before
Got lost in your eyes and flew right out the door
Suddenly I heard love songs playing real soft on the jukebox
Somebody ordered up moonlight and painted stars all across the sky
Is it gravity or destiny? Either way there's nothing I can do
Looks like I picked the wrong night not to fall in love with you
I briefly resisted but my heart insisted it was going to be giving in
Hard as I was trying there was no denying which one of us would win
You came up beside me and asked if I'd be wanting to have a dance
Right then I knew this thing was out of my hands
Looks like a wrong night not to fall in love with you
