I'll take care of your cares for you
And i'll be there with you when you're blue
Let me be your one ray of sunshine
And maybe you'll remember somewhere, sometime
I won't scold you for your mistakes
And i'll just hold you when your heart aches
So keep me in your thoughts, your dreams, and your prayers
And i'll take care of your cares
Mmm, just let me be your one ray of sweet old sunshine
'cause maybe you'll remember somewhere, sometime
'n' i won't scold you for your mistakes
'n' i'll just hold you when your heart aches
So please keep me in your thoughts, your dreams, and your prayers
And i'll take care of your cares
Yes, i'll take good care of your cares
