Fuck bein' good, I'm a bad bitch 
I'm sick of motherfuckers tryna tell me how to live 
Wack hoes hate under my pictures on the 'Gram 
Bitch, you better hope I never run across your man, uh
In the mall with him, I'ma have a ball with him 
Somebody call Rihanna, I'ma buy some drawers with him
He fuckin' with Thee Stallion 'cause he into wild women 
Put them legs on his head, now he love tall women 
You'll never catch me callin' these niggas daddy 
I ain't lyin' 'bout my nut just to make a nigga happy 
Lifestyle when a nigga can't fit a Magnum
It never happened if the dick wasn't snappin' 
I'm a hot girl, I do hot shit 
Spend his income on my outfit 
I don't text quick 'cause I ain't thirsty 
These bitches mad, mad, they wanna hurt me

Any rumor 'bout me, let me dead it 
I'm a open book and your man probably read it 
Looked at my AP and these hoes still pathetic 
Real bitches back when I check my Patek, yeah 
Yeah, he call me Patty Cake 'cause the way that ass shake 
I'ma make him eat me out while I'm watchin' anime 
Pussy like a Wild Fox, lookin' for a Sasuke 
One night with him make him lose it like a prom date 
Two watches, yeah, call me two-timin' 
Skin like gold and my teeth like diamonds 
Hot Girl chain, Elliot got me shinin' 
They tried to knock me off, but a bitch still grindin'
I'm a hot girl, I do hot shit 
Spend his income on my outfit 
I don't text quick 'cause I ain't thirsty 
These bitches mad, mad, they wanna hurt me

These bitches mad, mad, they wanna hurt me 
I'm a rich nigga magnet , pretty with a fatty 
Thirty-inch weave with the long eyelashes 
Yes, I got a man if I don't like who askin' 
I don't stand outside 'cause I'm too outstandin' 
'Cause the girls in the hood are always hard
Ever since sixteen, I been havin' a job
Knowin' nothin' in life, but I gotta get rich
