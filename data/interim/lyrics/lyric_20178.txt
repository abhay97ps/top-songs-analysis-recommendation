Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
All I can say is
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
Let's go!
I don't need nobody else around see
Love the way you compliment my style
Though you may end up bein' my only girl
Cause when you're with me you're my whole world
Like when it's just me and you
Vibe is crazy between us two
Your my homie, my lover indeed and my friend
Now I said this before I'm a say it again
Now here is the situation
I like what we've got happening
And I don't want nothing coming in between both me and you
I'll let you be lieutenant if you let me be captain
Tell me if that's cool
Baby I want you to be my entourage
You could be my personal superstar
Baby I want you to be my entourage
If you want then we could take this very far
You're a star in your own right
At times you steal the whole spotlight
I don't mind girl you're fine put a smile on my face
Besides who want a chick that no dude would chase
Sometimes I know you're unsure
Wonder if this will endure
Don't make me make a promise that I can't keep
Cause it's cool how it is let's not complicate things girl
Here is the situation
I like what we've got happening and I don't want nothing coming in between both me and you
I'll let you be lieutenant if u let me be captain
Tell me if that's cool
Baby I want you to be my entourage
You could be my personal superstar
Baby I want you to be my entourage
If you want then we could take this very far
You're a star 
That you are 
Be my girl 
Share my world 
Come on girl 
Super fly chick 
Baby I want you to be my entourage
You could be my personal superstar
Baby I want you to be my entourage
If you want then we could take this very far
