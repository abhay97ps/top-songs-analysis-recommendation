I'm a man of constant sorrow
Hard luck and bad news are always at my door
I'm headed back to the Pacific shore
Place where I was born
And the place where I did hardly grow
I'm a rambler and rambling is my fate
And rambling is the only life I know
Through the rain the sleet and the snow
I'm bound to be out on that interstate
Headed on to the next toll-man's gate
'Cause rambling is the rambler's state
Your friends say that I'm strange
But now I'm never gonna see your face
But I'll see you in the other place
I promise that I will
See you on the other range
I'm a rambler, oh darling can't you tell?
And that is why that I keep moving on
Don't bother crying when you see I'm gone
I'll breathe the air that my lungs once held
But I am hoping you'll do very well
And now my love I'm saying;
Fare thee well
Your ma says that I'm strange
And now you're never gonna see my face
But you'll see me in the other place
Please promise that you will
See me on the other range
Your ma says that I'm strange
And now you're never gonna see my hide
But you'll see me on the other side
Please promise that you will
See me on the other range
I'm a man of constant sorrow
Hard luck and bad news are always at my door
I'm heading back to the Pacific shore
Place that I was born
And the place that where did hardly grow
Place where I did hardly grow
