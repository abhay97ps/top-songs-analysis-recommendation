I was taught to never tell a lie
To look you in the eye and tell it like it is
Always thought that you would be the same
It's such a shame that's not the way it is
I was fooled by your innocence
And my love for you was so intense
With our connection only physical
If it got me through the night
Well that's a lie
 I believed in you
 I believed in you
 I believed in you oh
A simple question makes you look away
Your hesitation gives it all away
There's self-protection in the way you move
If there's sadness in my eyes
It's coming from your lies
 I believed in you
 I believed in you
 I believed in you
I believed in you
You want to sleep with me but payback's tough
Why don't you call me when you're all grown up
If there's a change in you I'll know it's true
Hey little liar, I believed in you
 I believed in you
 I believed in you
 I believed in you
 I believed in you
 I believed in you
 I believed in you
 I believed in you
 I believed in you
