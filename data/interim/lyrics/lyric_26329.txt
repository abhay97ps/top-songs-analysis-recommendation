Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been blind for a while now
I just got the key, they let me in, no ID
Doors openin' up for me and now I see
I've been blind for a while now
I've been blind for a while now 
Every single goddamn day, a nigga think he next to leak it 
Tomatoes, mustard, mayonnaise
Nigga better catch up, catch up, catch up, catch up 
Thankful that my head too hard for me to learn my lesson 
'Cause the way I did it worked out fine, ooh, God you blessed me 
Probably ain't believe me
Know a nigga went through hell and back, now he finally on the TV 
Now a nigga don't even give a fuck no more, probably think it's easy
Let you know it ain't easy
I fuck her like a Bathing Ape, she run from the dick like a cheetah 
Two-tone AP watch on, never see me use it for a clock 
They see the way he fuckin' up the charts 
I wonder is he ever gon' stop?
And he charge a hundred-fifty for the verses now
Pay it or he never ever drop
They noticed that a nigga music versatile
Wonder if he ever goin' pop? 
I just got the key, they let me in, no ID
Doors openin' up for me and now I see
I've been blind for a while now 
I've been blind for a while now 
Let's go
I just got the key, they let me in, no ID
Doors openin' up for me and now I see
I've been blind for a while now
I've been blind for a while now
Yeah
I've been quarantined, livin' with my kiddies
Tryna teach me how to cha-cha, woah
Fucked around, left the door open
Now they know that they can't stop me
Don't place me in no cop car
Yeah, I'm off probation, so it's gas I blow
I found love in my bitch, so I don't ask no more
I can really sit back, ain't gotta pass no dough
All of my brothers get loot, I don't got ride with pistols 
They found him dead, he dissed you 
PTDS, don't you tell me you lost me 
Fuck all the rest, none them bitches are a nominee
Go to the head whenever dogs with me die
Got me riding 'til the sun come, blood on my white 1's
I just got the key, they let me in, no ID
Doors openin' up for me and now I see
I've been blind for a while now 
Yeah, I've been blind for a while now, yeah 
I just got the key, they let me in, no ID
Doors openin' up for me and now I see
I've been blind for a while now
I've been blind for a while now
