Hey, hey, baby, i want to know
If you'll be my girl
Hey, hey, baby, i want to know
If you'll be my girl
When i saw you walking down the street
I said, that's the kind of girl i just like to meet
She's so pretty, lord, she's so fine
I'm going to make her mine, mine
I said, hey, hey, baby, i want to know
If you'll be my girl
When you turned and walked away
That's when i want to say
Come on, baby, give me a whirl
I want to  know if you'll be my girl
I said, "hey, hey, baby, - hey, baby!
I wanna know if you'll be my girl
All right, be my girl
Let me hear it one time, boys!
Hey,  hey baby, i wanna know
If you'll be my girl
Hey,  hey baby, i wanna know
If you'll be my girl
Hey,  all right, oh!
