Oh, mamy, mamy 
Oh, mamy 
I may be your forgotten son 
Who wandered off at twenty-one 
It’s sad to find myself at home 
And you  you’re not around
If I could only hold your hand 
And say “I’m sorry, yes I am” 
I’m sure you really understand 
Oh ma,  where are you now?
 Oh, mamy
 Oh mamy, mamy, mamy
 Oh, mamy
 I need you, mamy, mamy
 Oh, mamy
Her house we shared upon the hill 
Seems lifeless but is standing still 
And mem'ries of my childhood fill 
My mind , oh, mamy, mamy, mamy
I’ve been through all the walks of life 
Seen tired days and lonely nights 
And now without you by my side 
I’m lost , how will I survive?
Oh, mamy
Oh, mamy, mamy blue
Oh, mamy blue 
Oh, mamy 
Oh, mamy, mamy blue
Oh, mamy blue 
 Oh, mamy
 Oh, mamy, mamy, mamy
 Oh, mamy
 I need you, mamy, mamy
 Oh, mamy
 You never miss the water
 ‘Til your well run dry
 Oh, mamy
 I feel so I’ll always be
 Your grown up child
 Oh, mamy
 I need your shoulder
 To pray if I have tried
 Oh, mamy
 I need your warm embrace
 And your comforting smile
 Oh, mamy
 Before you can see
 Or hear my voice cry
 Oh, mamy
