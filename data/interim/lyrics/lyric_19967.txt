I watched the proverbial sunrise
Coming up over the Pacific and
You might think I'm losing my mind
But I will shy away from the specifics
'Cause I don't want you to know where I am
'Cause then you'll see my heart
In the saddest state it's ever been
And this is no place to try and live my life
 That's exactly where I lost it
 Well, I never should have crossed it
 Well, I never should have said
That it's the very moment that I wish that I could take back
I'm sorry for
The person I became
I'm sorry that
It took so long for me to change
I'm ready to
Be sure I never become that way again
'Cause who I am hates who I've been
Who I am hates who I've been
I talk to absolutely no one
Couldn't keep to myself enough
And the things bottled inside have finally begun
To create so much pressure that I'll soon blow up
And I heard the reverberating footsteps
Syncing up to the beating of my heart
And I was positive that unless
I got myself together I would watch me fall apart
And I can't let that happen again
'Cause then you'll see my heart
In the saddest state it's ever been
This is no place to try and live my life
Stop right there, that's exactly where I lost it
See that line? I never should have crossed it
Stop right there, I never should have said
That it's the very moment that I wish that I could take back
 That's exactly where I lost it
 Well, I never should have crossed it
 Well, I never should have said
That it's the very moment that I wish that I could take back
I'm sorry for
The person I became
I'm sorry that
It took so long for me to change
I'm ready to
Be sure I never become that way again
'Cause who I am hates who I've been
Who I am hates who I've been
Who I am hates who I've been
And who I am will take the second chance You gave me
Who I am hates who I've been
'Cause who I've been only ever made me
So sorry for
The person I became
I'm sorry that
It took so long for me to change
I'm ready to
Be sure I never become that way again
'Cause who I am hates who I've been
Who I am hates who I've been
