Life is so strange
With it's up and downs
And today's hero
May be tomorrow's clown
Friends keep on telling me
That I'm a fool to be
So in love while
You're just having fun
I'll spend each lonely night
Longing to hold you tight
Morning finds me
Crying to the sun
But I'll find somebody new
And I'll get over you
Then my broken heart
Will hurt no more
Someday you'll realize
I was the one
Then you'll be crying
While I'm having fun
You know
Someday you're gonna realize
That I was the one
Then you'll be crying
While I'm having fun
