A lot of things happened this year
Yeah! Lets go! Okay! Rest in peace Mandela
I'll interpret this for real
It's the 2013 Rap Up
Still I'm paying respect to Skillz
GO!
Dwight Howard left the building
Pewdiepie hit 18 million
Did Hernandez snuff his homie
Call that trying to make a killin'
There were shootouts at the Navy
Yard
Attacks at the mall
Chemical threats
Tornados
Typhoons
Came in like a wrecking ball
And Ford Catching fire was fired for
Snorting coke
Can someone please explain
How Detroit city went broke
DAMN!
A train crashed in Spain
Then on derailed in the Bronx
50 years of Dr. Who?
And 95 since the sox won on their
Own turf
But they needed that since the
Marathon
Sharkiesha playing the knockout
Game
Somebody call up Farrakhan
They seeing blurred lines
Who these kids gon' listen to
We know Obama Care
The Pope resigned from his misson
Too
Heroes come
Heroes go
ROAR
Nations fall
Nations grow
It doesn't matter where we go (Don't
Matter)
As long as we're going harder (As
Long as we go harder)
We going harder 
We going harder 
We going harder
We going harder
It doesn't matter who you know (No
Matter who baby-YEAH!)
As long as your going harder
As long as your going harder (Hold
Up)
Just go harder
Instagram dropped Instavid and gave
Us more time
Hah!
But we can't stop doin' it for the Vine
And we'll never be Royals unless we
Were born into it
Jay did a mill before he dropped and
Knew he was gonna do it
Then B surprised us all
And one thing I know for certain
Booty shakin' went mainstream once
A white girl started twerkin'
Even the President posing he made
Selfies look cool
And we used Ratchet so much that
We forgot it was a tool
The Heat did a repeat and another
Win for Baltimore since that's the
Homet town
I'm screamin'
SUCK IT!!! to all of yall
Then Ray retired the entire Superbowl
Blacked out
Paula Deen screaming nigga figure
She don't know what black bout
A new generation of consoles were
Revealed
Kick down the doors like Charles
Ramsey
Or the new hundred dollar bill
Microsoft bought Nokia
Then Yahoo bought Tumblr
First Kevin then Kobe, then D Rose
Reinjury
Humbled us
And BatFleck catching flack
What the Duck Dynasty 
Auburns 100 yards show that there's
An "i" in team
And the world still crazy for the J's
Some kicks we camp out for days
One question remains it's wrecking
My brain
What does the fox SAY
Heroes come
Heroes go
I mean really
Nations fall
Nations grow
It doesn't matter where we go (Don't
Matter where we go)
As long as we're going harder (Yo
Look it up! Wooo!)
We going harder
We going harder (We going harder for
We going harder
We going harder 
It doesn't matter who you know (You
Still on this great planet, just go
Harder.)
As long as your going harder
As long as your going harder
Just go harder
Eminem came back as a rap god
Comets land in the Russian back yard
Yeezus compared himself to soldiers
China moon rovers
Ariana sounding grande like musical
Chords
Took home my very first YouTube
Music awards
But even King Kong can't shut a
Government down
Christopher Dorner blowing whistles
So they hunting them DOWN
And the iPhone came back for our
Wallets wtih the 5s
Paul Walkerâ€˜s death was hard for all
Us to digest
Lee Thompson
Tom Foley
George Duke
Cory Monteith
Jim Kelly
Margaret Thatcher
Bobby Blue Bland
Rest in peace
And can I get some pall bearers for
Paul Bearer
They successfully cloning human
Cells so look in the mirror
Killed off Brain viewers complained
So they brought him back like Christ
YouTube started Harlem shaking
 they can
Draw my life
Wait!
700 dead in Bangladesh that ain't
Right
And how the hell you lose 230 in a
Night club fire
Arias fate played out online
Zimmerman got a trial
Guess we all are walking dead if it's
Ok to kill a child
Kendrick took control with one verse
Some rapper got offended and
Everybody started Wildn' Out
When Breaking Bad ended
Rap up
Heroes come
Heroes go
Nations fall
Nations grow
It doesn't matter where we go (It
Don't matter where we go)
As long as we're going harder (As
Long as we go harder) 
We going harder 
We going harder
We going harder 
We going harder It doesn't matter who you know
As long as your going harder
As long as your going harder
Just go harder
We go harder
We going harder
Ait!
It doesn't matter where you go
As long as your going harder
We going harder
