Once I loved someone so deep
It hurt to leave his side
‘Cause he was the sun that shined for me
He gave me strength so I could see
Past the foolish game I could not abide
He was wonderful
Lovable
He was truly just so beautiful
I feel so blessed he came my way
Sugar sweet
My sugarhigh
The sweetest taste I’ll ever try
Your love is one I can’t deny
I love you, I love you, I love you
Sugar sweet
I’ve realized
Just one look into your eyes
Slowly gets me hypnotized
I love you, I love you, I love you
His love was far beyond wealth and gold
So much from one would I learn
He was a delicate morning rain
That fell to wash away my pain
And bring me warmth in return
He was magical
Mystical
Simply irresistible
This love I can’t convey
Oh, so wonderful, lovable
He was truly just so beautiful
I feel so blessed he came my way
Sugar sweet
My sugarhigh
The sweetest taste I’ll ever try
Your love is one I can’t deny
I love you, I love you, I love you
Sugar sweet
I’ve realized
Just one look into your eyes
Slowly gets me hypnotized
I love you, I love you, I love you
Your love feels so amazing
Never thought I would have found you, baby
To hold you
Just to be near you
I love you, I love you, I love you
Sugar sweet, my sugar high
The sweetest taste I’ll ever try
Your love is one I can’t deny
I love you, I love you, I love you
He was magical, mystical
Simply irresistible
This love I can’t convey
Oh, so wonderful
Lovable
He was truly just so beautiful
Sugar sweet
My sugarhigh
The sweetest taste I’ll ever try
Your love is one I can’t deny
I love you, I love you, I love you
Sugar sweet
I’ve realized
Just one look into your eyes
Slowly gets me hypnotized
I love you, I love you, I love you
Your love feels so amazing
Never thought I would have found you, baby
To hold you
Just to be near you
I love you, I love you, I love you
Sugar sweet
My sugarhigh
The sweetest taste I’ll ever try
Your love is one I can’t deny
I love you, I love you, I love you
Sugar sweet
I’ve realized
Just one look into your eyes
Slowly gets me hypnotized
I love you, I love you, I love you
