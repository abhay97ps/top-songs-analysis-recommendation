Let us introduce ourselves, we're originality
We're throwing down with Charly Choch and sister Shorty B
I said sister  is on the go
She's rockin' to the sounds of the stere-ere-o
I'm Shorty B and you know I'm good
I'm gonna rock shock shock-it in your neighborhood
I was born on March the 1st, 1964, you see
I take just what you got to give
'Cause a-five flights up is where I live
Little sis has got my back
She's gonna back me up 'cause she's got it like that
To the beat everybody
And everybody just a-shock the house
I said a wise men know, I invented disco
That's why I just keep on yellin'
I invented penicillin
You see, I'm listed in the yellow pages all around the world
I have 13 years experience and I'm still the number one girl
I said a knick-knack paddywhack
I said I got it like this and I got it like a-that
To the beat everybody
And everybody just a-shock the house
I said to the beat everybody
And everybody just a-shock the house
I'm not a gangsta, not a victim, I'm not a hypocrite
Just want to rock it 'til I think you're sick
And then I put you to bed and I fill your head
With some more of my rhymes until you drop dead
You see my rhymes are so viciously
That's why my name is Shorty B
Said champagne, Cadillacs, and a lot of money
I said these are things that you got to have if you want my honey
And it's on to on to on to on
Until the beat don't stop 'til the break of dawn
I said hear the rhythm of this song
I said the beat goes on and on and on
It's up your shirt, now down your spine
It's guaranteed to blow your mind
It's in your head, now in your brain
But the beat's so nice that you feel no pain
We're gonna rock you to the early night
We're gonna rock you to the broad daylight
So clap your hands everybody
And everybody-body clap your hands
Clap your hands everybody
And everybody-body clap your hands
Just see me
You clap your hands, you stomp your feet
And you rock it to the rhythm of the sure shot beat
Said one, two, one two
Hey Charly, whatchoo gonna do?
I will set your soul on fire if you let me take you higher
There will be no questions asked
I'm just here to do my task
I made the Amazon River one too clever
I put the moon in outer space
I took the mask off Batman's face
I gave King Kong his heavy skin
I made him bark like Rin-Tin-Tin
I  made  confess that I was the very best
I know you like it because I like it too
My rhymes will make your body move
I'm Charly Choch, I'm the number one
I'm all about makin' people have fun
My rhymes are neat and they're never sloppy
I never bite and I never copy
My rhymes are great and they're so divine
The people try to rock 'em all the time
You don't jerk me first, you don't jerk at all
And you won't have a ball
'Cause I'm the biggest, I'm the baddest
And you know I'm the best when you mess with me
'Cause you know I'm Charly
I'll rock your house, I'll rock it down
'Cause I'm the rocker of the hottest disco in town
I'll make you jump, I'll make you pump
I'll make you want to do the bump
For all you homegirls that's listenin' now
Put your hands together and throw down
For all you homeboys that's listenin' too
You know exactly what to do
I said Crown Street crew!
I said dip, dive, socialize
Clean out your ears and open your eyes
You go to the door, ask a donation
You hear the greatest sounds in creation
Backstroke I don't snort no coke
I don't even shoot no dope
I might smoke a J and drink some paint thin
I chew some gum so my breath won't stink
Then I chill, everybody
Everybody, rock the party
And you can pop the pills and you can snort the coke
And you can put a sucka nigga in dope fiend yoke
'Cause the things you do and the things you say
Will make a sucka-sucka nigga-nigga run away
A-like this yo, a-like that yo
A-check it out yo, to the beat y'all
I said drip, drop, whip, wop
We're on just like a soda pop
We're original as you can see
Our names fit us right to a T
We're super bad, we're out of sight
We'll make you dance all through the night
So if you're ready like this and you're ready like that
Let me hear you say oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I said a sneaker pimp sneaker pimp on the go
There is one thing you should know
I said a sneaker, sneakers are all the same
Only difference about them is their name
'Cause they all relieve athlete's foot
So when you get Adidas  think you are the 
To the beat, everybody
Everybody check me out
I'm Charly Choch and I know I'm good
Because I throws-throws down like a MC should
When I go a-walkin' down the street
They say can that little girl rock to the beat?
And then they hand me a mic and say she's alright
Now I'm rockin' at the parties every night
She's from Illinois and you're paranoid and you don't know what to do
And then the dude walks up to and say "Whatchoo wanna do?"
In your answer, you'll reply, right in front of me
You make his body nature rise, like one, two, three
I am the girl with the golden voice
I am the people's number one choice
So throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
If you're read like Charly to rock this party
Somebody say oh yeah!
Children play and women producing
Men go work and some go stealing!
Everybody's gotta make a living!
Hoodlums hang out really think they on
They mess up their lives and the next day they're gone!
You see these hoodlums little sorry song!
I don't know what I've been told
But Eskimo *oops* is mighty cold
When two old maids was a-laying in the bed
One rolled over to the other and said
Well ain't no need in going back
'Cause Jody's got a Cadillac
I said you step up, you hook up, you shuffle to the door
You jump right back and you count the floor
I said if I die on the old  road
They'll box me up and cart me home
To beat yo
Yes, yes, yo
Well you heard of Jack and Jill
Now let me put you down on the real deal
There ain't no use in Mother Goose
'Cause she throwin' down and she's gettin' loose
She goes up, she goes up
She goes up like a disco duck
She comes down, she comes down
She comes down like a disco clown
And around and around and around and around
And around and around and around, you don't stop
Check it out you
To the beat yo
And yes, yes yo
Let's rock yo
Like a lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime
I got more rhymes that'll shock your mind
From a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon
I got more rhymes than pimp got women
To the beat yo
And yes, yes yo
Like this yo
To the beat yo
I said listen to me and I'm Shorty B
Rockin' with 
 Shorty B
Well check it out you
To the beat yo
Like this yo
For those of you who don't know my name
Well I'm Shorty B, I don't play no games
 the baddest rapper in history
When I was four, I was on the floor
When I was five, I didn't take no jive
When I was six, I learned to mix
When I was seven, I was on the mic
And have  overnight
I said when I was eight 
When I was nine 
When I was ten, I do it again
When I was eleven
