“I see the horizon, the great unknown”
Ruck: I’m telling you, man, cut it out.  Yo, we embarked on this nocturnal excursion in order to exchange conversation with these mortals, not to play games
Rock: If you don’t know like I know, then act like you know like I know
Ruck: For real, behind every great Ruck, there’s a Rock
Rock: If you don’t know like I know, then act like you know like I know
Ruck: The Rockness Monsta, Dutch
Yo, it’s the
Rockness, not Rock live—then again, I’m Rock and I’m live
But I’m not fat—then again, my shit is so phat, fans let shots fly 
Swift and changeable, no style be Rock’s style.  Not foul
But play with me at your own risk, kid, I might not smile
You get whipped upon in one on’s, I don’t fight clean
Float like a butterfly, sting like a scorpion on the tip of a
Sick ding-a-ling, bring the noise with your peeps
We up in this space deep with nines like Starfleet—ah
Sheet, garbeech-ass rappers, M.P.’ll trap ya
Then, like a federal case, I’ll crack ya.  Word to my man
Don Ruler, I’ll cold beat your crew up.  If it gets thick
Then Numba Two’ll pass me the Ruger—click, click, booyah!
If you don’t

I turn this
Upside-down, clown.  Watch me and you’ll get the picture
If ya don’t understand why I be the Mr. Flipsta
I deliver a nine slug to your spine
And leave you on the floor, vibrating like a fault line
Find the Rock, he’s lurking in a dark alley
With more niggas than a motherfucking God rally
Tally up all the throats the StrangleHold
Choked and all the riots that my brother Ruckus provoked
Don’t like my style?  So?  I don’t give a what?!?
‘Cause you bring the beef, and the Rock or the Ruck’ll buck you
One time, so cover your vital organs
Machete’ll chop that beef you’re popping and feed it to my nigga Dog and
Follow the trail of broken backs and, at the end
Of it, you’ll find me standing with my Black, jack, with a Smif-N-Wessun
On my side smoking, not the gat 
 Fuck your
Street Fighter, front if you wanna get hyper
I strap on bombs and blow your face up like Stryker
Yo, Representativz, light up another resi’ spliff

Your money, your life, and war’s all I want 
Bring all beef to Bedrock, I got my gun 
Niggas is soft as burger buns .  Front, man
Shit, spit ‘pon the grave of the weak
When I speak, my tongue is nasty as a freak
I’m in a inner state of inner mind, which inter-
-twines with my inner body, now I’m energized
It’s an insane shame—you can ask Ricky Steam
Or The Big Cheese.  We’re sweating no shorties, only getting green
“Bling!”’s the sound, then I’m ghost, gone
Me and Tawl Sean.  Your shit just now paid for the traum
Need I go on?  You damn right, I’m foul as fuck, so foul
I should go to the line and shoot two 
Like James Bond, I shoot to kill.  Heltah Skeltah’s here
Try square with me, clean up man like Mr. Belvedere
Born in a place so far away, it’s prehistoric

From the age of stone to the age of chrome
From Bedrock to Bucktown, my fucking name’s known
