Back on the Forbes, shit crazy 
I make more than Dwyane Wade, baby
I'm a street nigga and I stay faded 
Never worked in a gym, but I weighed it 
First off, you get the ammo, then you cock it 
First off, we had to blast off like a rocket 
I put the Patek water on, but I got options 
PJ takin' off and I ain't stoppin', no
Louis V belts, Louis V on my walls
Fishscale, nigga, I can't fuck with no laws 
Linda Farrow's what's on my lens, I see fugazi
I should pimp this bitch and make her pay me 
Started off surfin' on a codeine wave
I don't exchange info with these niggas
They some opps, you can kill 'em, they ain't with us
Ordered a pound of gas to smoke, I need a fill up 
Got a line on good Gelato and Gorilla
Got Lil Freaky with me, know you gon' get hit up
Steppin' over dead bodies in Margielas
I touched a hundred M's and I've been gettin' better 
In a red Bugatti, gave it right to valet
Shoot his head off right, it get you new Chanaynay
Shootin' dice all night, yeah, me and Dae Dae
We had to work the one on 'em, it was a good payday
It was a teenager, they put him on the news where I'm from
He let off forty shots, he can't get no bond
Closed on when he shoppin', when he kill him, he young
They ever get caught snitchin', they gon' cut off your tongue
I can't wait 'til they set the rat up, yeah
I was catchin' juugs, now a nigga a millionaire
I get the rap check and I avoid the paps
I get NBA money and ain't been in the draft
Yeah, I'm back on the Forbes, shit crazy 
I make more than Dwyane Wade, baby 
I'm a street nigga and I stay faded
Never worked in a gym, but I weighed it
First off, you get the ammo, then you cock it 
First off, we had to blast off like a rocket

Louis V belts, Louis V on my walls
Fishscale, nigga, I can't fuck with no laws
Linda Farrow's what's on my lens, I see fugazi
I should pimp this bitch and make her pay me
Bound to cut off where it's dim and pour above the rim 
Get the backend at the door and let the dogs kill 
Point 'em out, then turn around, that's how we let 'em in
Paranoid, one conversation, then I switch the SIM 
This took like NBA business, I ain't talkin' scrimmage 
You know I'm James Bond with it, Harden with the finish
The whip's got curtain options in it, I don't need it tinted
Just need the option not to see 'em when I'm ridin' in it
Used to spend checks on my Nikes, now they pay me 
Got some Bulls cheerleaders and they wavy 
Number one off in my city like McGrady 
Yeah, I'm back on the Forbes, shit crazy
Roll so much gas, I can't let 'em breathe 
Pop me ten to three, I can't let 'em sleep 
Flyin' through the clouds in somethin' heavenly
Yeah, I'm back on the Forbes, shit crazy
I make more than Dwyane Wade, baby
I'm a street nigga and I stay faded
Never worked in a gym, but I weighed it
