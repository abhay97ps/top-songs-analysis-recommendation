Baby, if you only knew
Everything I need I get from you
I'll never let you out of sight
I need you through
The day and night, baby
Always there to see me through
Darling, don't you know
I'm hooked on you
Some habits I've had before
But never came back so much for more
I need your loving every day
I couldn't live without it
No way
And everybody knows it's true
Everybody knows I'm hooked on you
I've never been dependant
And never thought I would
Oh
But now I find that I don't mind
The change is for the good
So don't be feeling sorry
For the freedom that I lost
Cause I found out what's been missing
And I'm glad to pay the cost
Now that I've tasted you
I know nobody else would ever do
I'm glad that I can say you're mine
I love you
Cause your sugar's so fine
No one else will ever do
There's nothing like
Being hooked on you
I know you're gonna see me through
Baby
That's why I'm hooked on you
