I've got a song to say
There’s such a whole lot of trouble in the world yeah
It's just a little understanding I want to bring to the scene
And I just want you to listen to me
You got to stop and search your soul
See just where you stand
Now you got to dig down deep now
To find the good you plan
Now it's not going to be easy 
You gotta admit that you been wrong 
But let's stop and try 
Good god, before all the hope is gone 
While you've been living a lie
You see the whole world's passing you by 
You got soul
And I got soul
And all God's children got soul 
We got soul
And they got soul
All of God’s children got soul 
And you got soul
And I got soul
All of God's children got soul 
We got soul
And they got soul
All of God's children got soul 
Remember the good old days
When there was a family day
And now my whole world is changing y'all
Aw its funny what you can bring
The family is no longer valued
And there’s fighting everywhere now
Now what's the matter with people today 
Nobody wants to pray 
Oh while you've been living a lie
You see the whole world's passing you by 
You got soul
And I got soul
And all God's children got soul 
We got soul
And they got soul
All of God's children got soul 
And you got soul
And I got soul
All of God's children got soul 
We got soul
And they got soul
All of God's children got soul 
Remember the good old days
When there was a family day
And now my whole world is changing y'all
Aw its funny what you can bring
The family is no longer valued
And there's fighting everywhere now
Now what's the matter with people today 
Nobody wants to pray 
Oh while you've been living a lie
You see the whole world's passing you by 
You got soul
And I got soul
And all God's children got soul 
We got soul
And they got soul
All of God's children got soul 
And you got soul
And I got soul
All of God's children got soul 
We got soul
And they got soul
All of God's children got soul 
Soul ain't got no color y'all
You gotta feel it 
You gotta feel it 
You gotta feel it 
Feel it 
You can't tell one from another, y'all 
You got soul
And I got soul
And all God's children got soul 
We got soul
