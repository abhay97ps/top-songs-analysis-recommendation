Listen to a lonely sound
See the gray and sadness all around
See the people go their way
Care not of me and love I've lost today
Maybe tomorrow I will love again
I'll never know until I've looked into her eyes
Maybe tomorrow I will love again
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice
And so I'm living for a dream
Each lonely day spent looking for the sunshine
I'll make believe that I don't care
I'll tell my friends I love my life I'm happy
Maybe tomorrow I will love again
I'll never know until I've looked into her eyes
Maybe tomorrow I will love again
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice
Wherever, whoever you may be
Let the light of your love
Shine through the window of my heart
Then when you've colored all thoughts bright
Don't let me ever, ever think of night, no-woah, yeah
I'll never know until I've looked into her eyes
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice
Maybe tomorrow I will love
