If you were mine
I'd never let you leave me
If you were mine
I'd never let you go
Because you are
Just what I've always wanted
And I think that you oughta know
From the moment I first saw you
Girl, you went straight to my brain
In my heart I've got a feeling
That I could never explain
I'm not one to believe in love at first sight
But you changed, changed my mind last night
I fell in love, even though I didn't intend to
Hard as I tried, I couldn't keep my eyes off you
I know to you I'm just a stranger
I'm a stranger, baby
And I, probably I don't mean a thing
I don't mean nothing to you, baby, I know that
But to me you are an angel
And I want to be your man
If you were mine
You'd never know no sorrow
If you were mine
I'd marry you tomorrow, yes, I would
Believe me, girl
What the occasion
If you call me
I'll come with no persuasion
You just call
And I'll come running
Oh, yes, I will, baby
Come rainstorm, hail or snow
'Cause the way I feel about you, well now
No place is too remote to go
Oh well, baby, oh well
Now now now now now now now now now
Hey girl, oh well
Oh baby, oh well
Oh girl, well
