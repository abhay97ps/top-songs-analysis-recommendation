A little bit of soap
Will wash away your lipstick from my face
A little bit of soap
Will never, never, never, ever erase
The pain in my heart, in my eyes
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap
Will never wash away my tears
A little bit of soap
Will take away your powder from my chin
A little bit of soap
Will never  never, never, ever begin
To take away the hurt that I feel
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap
Will never wash away my tears
Have you heard when love begins to die
It leaves someone to cry night and day
Like a bird, who left the robin's nest
You're just like all the rest
You flew away
Oh, just a little bit of soap
Will take away  your perfume eventually
A little bit of soap
Will never  take away the memory
Of your name in the night
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap
Will never wash away my tears
Oh, a little bit of soap
Never, never
Soap
Just a little
Never gonna
Just a little
Just a little bit of soap
