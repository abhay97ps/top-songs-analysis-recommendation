Ooh
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh, yeah, mhm
Guess you never know a good thing
When it's right in your face
You've been abused for so long
Love gets tainted and all seems the same, mhm
I guess it's unbelievable
Someone could love you like this
Well, time ain't no object and money ain't a thing
When you have someone to ease your pain
Wanna be the smile on your face
Be your stars and your moon
I wanna be your sunny day
Can I be your favorite tune?
I wanna be your breakfast in bed, yeah
And baby, I'll be your fool
Mr. Too Damn Good To You
Yes sir, mhm
Yes sir, hmm
You've been hurt so many times
You don't know when love's for real
So you don't open up 
Or give in to love 
Or express how you feel 
But just like Sunday Morning
I'll take it easy
Girl, I'm gonna wait
'Cause lovin' just ain't right 
Without you by my side 
Baby, you're my soul mate
Baby, I'll open doors
Be there for you any time
'Cause that's what your man's supposed to do
Baby, I wanna cook for you
I will spoil you
Girl, my whole objective is to please you
I'll run your bubble bath
Make you laugh
Girl, through thick and thin, I've got your back, yeah
I ain't gon be pressin' you or stressin' you to make love
We've got so much time for that, oh
I wanna be the smile on your face
Be your stars and your moon
Can I be your sunny day?
 I'll be your favorite tune
I wanna be your breakfast in bed
And baby I'll be your fool
Mr. Too Damn Good To
I wanna be your shoulder when you need one to cry on 
I wanna be your pillow when you need one to lie on 
I wanna be the spotlight that shines on ya 
Girl, I'm gonna write "the girl is mine" on ya 
I wanna be your thought in your daydreams 
I wanna be your everything, your everything
I wanna be everything you ever thought you wanted
Ever needed, baby, yeah
Girl, I wanna shout about it
You wanna tell the world about it
And can't nobody else believe it
You'll have everything you've needed, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna be so so so good to you, baby, yeah
I'm gonna do things that you never thought I would do
