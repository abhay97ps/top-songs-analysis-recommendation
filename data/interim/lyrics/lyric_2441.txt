Damn son where did you found this hahahaha
Yeah nigga yeah
Thats alright
Baby
Forgotten
Tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Lickin' shots off from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I’m livin' major
My adversaries is gettin' worried
They paranoid of gettin’ buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
They wonder if my lifestyle changed
And am I through with all the pain
Survivin' in this game, and still the same
Honey, just meet me at the strip club, bring the thong
Look how they shake it for that cash, once again it's on
I had no sympathy for those afraid of mystery
Come get with me, I promise passion and ecstasy
I'm alone, can I come over there tonight?
Depend on me to wanna handle it and get it right
Your body is bangin', baby, I love the way you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, sugar, now tell me how you want it
Shivering, tongue delivering
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If it's all right with you, we fucking 
Déjà vu, the blunts sparked, finger fucking in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between your legs?
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to your mother’s bed
Not the Marriott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to your sister, damn I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when your ass would wiggle
Now I know you’re used to suites at the Parker Meridien
Trips to the Caribbean, but tonight, no ends
Hahahaha, that's how we do it out here
On this underground real shit nigga, it’s the heat nigga
Tell me, baby, is it cool to touch?
I'm a man that you can trust, not just a fool in lust
Comin' to get you on the bus is so ironic
Exotic, on the verge of erotic
I'm hittin’ switches on misses
Like I been fixed with hydraulics
My up and down like a roller coaster
Can I cum inside you?
I ain't stoppin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider
In and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these, nights full of Alize
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
The players living Cali days
Delores Tucker, you a fake to me
Instead of tryin' to help a brother, wanna take his G's
Mistaking me for Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot tracks
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, try and top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in my cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I ain't giving up
Very wonder taught us all to cuss
Yeah, I'ma put the drip on the plate, yeah 
Diamond ice glacier, niggas imitate 
Ayy, ayy, feed me grapes, Maybach with the drake 
Slow pace in the Wraith, got this shit from bae 
Diamonds up to par , the cookie hittin' hard 
The 'Rari sit in park , on Addy on Mars 
Shotgun shells, we gon' always hit the target 
Popcorn, big shell poppin' out the cartridge 
3400 Nawfside, Charles Barkley 
4-8-8, Ferrari 
Make her get on top of me and ride me like a Harley 
She wanna keep me company and never wan' depart me, depart me 
Yeah, fishtail in the parking lot 
I don't kick it with these niggas 'cause they talk about ya 
Yeah, and I got the fire, don't make me spark it out ya 
Yeah, keep it in my back pocket like it's a wallet 
Like the way she suck it, suck it like a Jolly 
Stack it up and put it with the whole project 
And she got that Patek on water moccasin 
I'm rich in real life, I get that profit, copy
