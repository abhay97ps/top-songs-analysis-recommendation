While you sit and seek
A crescent moon is laying at your feet
With hope that's made of sand
You don't think you can
But you've held it all in your hands
I've been tryin' hard to keep
From needing you but from the start
My heart just rolled and flowed
I've seen where it goes
Still somehow my love for you grows, Lady-O
So on my heels I'll grow wings
Gonna ride silver strings
But I'll see you in my holiest dreams, Lady-O
So on my heels I'll grow wings 
Gonna ride silver strings 
But I'll see you in my holiest dreams, Lady-O
I've been tryin' hard to keep
From needing you but from the start
My heart just rolled and flowed
I've seen where it goes
Still somehow my love for you grows, Lady-O
Ba, da, da, da, mm-mm-mm 
La, la, la-la-la, mm
