Don't think "I'm sorry" what we need to say
Don't think forgiveness is why we're here today
Guilty, we're both guilty, let's walk through that door
A second chance is what I'm talking about
Let's take the hurt and turn it inside out
Lay it on me baby until I can't take anymore
No mercy, show me no mercy
Love me all night long and don't hurry
Take it slow and easy, no mercy tonight
Hold me baby, you know I've been hurting
Love this love back to life cause it's worth it
Love me strong baby, show me no mercy tonight
Remember when we thought that being apart
Would be the best thing for both our hearts
It's a prison out there when you're living
Alone for sure
Now I know how much I really missed you
No more games, just want to be with you
Just give me all your love
Till you can't give anymore
In the silence of the early hours
I look at you and I feel the power
Don't need promises to make it right
Let's just follow what we're feeling inside
