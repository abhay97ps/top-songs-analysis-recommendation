The boy next door has really got me dreamin'
But I remember when he was a little demon
He used to pull my hair
But I didn't really care
I loved him even then
When he was twelve and I was ten
The boy next door used to take my toys away
But now he's busy keeping all of the boys away
He's jealous as can be
But that's alright with me
He told all the other guys
"Stay away if you value your life"
The boy next door wants to move across the street
He wants to get married, gonna make my life complete
So if you're looking â€˜round
For a boy in your home town
The one that you're looking for
Just might be the boy next door
Oh, the boy next door
