Think of me like I think about you
Give me a sign, show me you care
Am I so far away in your thoughts not there
Forget what you told me, it's what didn't get said
It's not much to ask, come down off your cloud
And with your feet on the ground say something out loud
Without love, I mean nothing to you
Without love, broken in two
Without love, give me some value, some worth
Without love, no life left on Earth
Blame it on work, buy me some flowers
Empty gestures wile away the hours
Promises, promises sealed with a kiss
Please acknowledge it's me that you miss
No message received, excuses believed, you hurt me so much
I'll never recover, takes time to discover a love like no other
Without love, I mean nothing to you
Without love, broken in two
Without love, give me some value, some worth
Without love, no life left on Earth
Without love, I mean nothing to you
Without love
Without love, I mean nothing to you
Without love
I mean nothing, I mean nothing, I mean nothing, nothing to you
And I'm broken, and I'm broken, broken in two
I mean nothing
Yeah
