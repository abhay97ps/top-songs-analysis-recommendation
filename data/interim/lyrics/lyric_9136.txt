Sagittarius, Virgo
Maybe Scorpio
I wouldn't care if you were Aquarius
I'm still in love with you
As sure as you were born
You could be Gemini
Or even if you were a Capricorn
I could never let you go
Chorus:
Oh I ain't going by
Those stars in the sky
I'm going by those stars in your eyes
And I love you
Oh I don't need a second look
Cause you're what's happening
In my book
And I love you
Taurus, Leo, Pisces
It makes no difference, girl
If you're in love with me
Oh that's all I need to know
I will give
All my heart
And all my love
And I don't care about the stars above
Cause my love just grows and grows
Cause I ain't going by
Those stars in the sky
Girl, I'm going by
Those stars in your eyes
And I don't give a heck
About that old Zodiac
Because it's what's in your heart
Girl that's where it's at
And I love you
I need you, I need you
I don't need a second look
Cause you're what's happening
In my book
