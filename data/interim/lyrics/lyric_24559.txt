This is all hands on deck
Calling out to lost boys and girls
I'm gettin' tired of the disrespect
We won't stop 'til we rule the world
It's our time, we up next! 
Our sail's about to be set 
They ain't seen nothing yet!
Tell 'em who's in charge so they don't forget
What's my name?
What's my name? 
Say it louder!
What's my name?
What's my name? 
Feel the power!
No one's gonna stop us
Soon the world will be ours
What's my name?
What's my name?
What's it? What's it?
Say it loud!
All eyes on me, lemme see 'em
What's it? What's it?
Say it! Say it!
I'm the queen of this town
I call the shots, you know who I am
I don't need to wear no fake crown
Stand up to me, you don't stand a chance
It's our time, we up next! 
My crew's as real as it gets 
The worst are now the best
And leaving us here will be their last regret!
What's my name?
What's my name? 
Say it louder!
What's my name?
What's my name? 
Feel the power!
No one's gonna stop us
Soon the world will be ours
What's my name?
What's my name?
What's it? What's it?
Say it! Say it!
You know what they say: Bad girls have all the fun
Never learned how to count 'cause I'm number one
Ready, here we come
We always get our way
It's a pirate's life, every single day! 
She's the captain, I'm the first mate
Enemies seasick can't see straight
Call 'em fish bait, throw 'em on a hook
Uma's so hot they get burned if they look
Hook me!
Ho! Woah!
Come on!
What's my name?
What's my name? 
Say it louder!
What's my name?
What's my name? 
Feel the power!
No one's gonna stop us
Soon the world will be ours
What's my name?
What's my name?
All eyes on me, lemme see 'em
What's it? What's it?
Say it! Say it!
Ooh, say it louder!
Ooh, say it louder!
What's it? What's it?
Say it! Say it!
Uma!
