You say you love me lady, girl, I hope you do
Only you can save me, my life equals you
Kiss me, drive me crazy, would you do that for me lady?
You say you want my babies, girl, if that's a fact
Then melt into me lady as though we were wax
Erase all my maybes, would you do that for me lady?
Ohh, your body's designed by the wisdom of time
And I couldn't live without you, I'd be losing my mind, ohh
You're the answer to the prayers and just like fresh air
You keep me alive, you cannot be spared
I love you, oh, I love you, I said I love you lady
And no power on this earth can keep us apart
You're engraved in my heart, do you hear me pretty lady
I want you to hear every word I say
Ohh, your body's designed by the wisdom of time
And I couldn't live without you, I'd be losing my mind, ohh
You're the answer to the prayers and just like fresh air
You keep me alive, you cannot be spared
Don't you ever go nowhere
You see I love you lady, really, really love you girl
And no power, no power, baby, keep us apart
You're engraved in my heart, do you hear me pretty lady
Do you hear me baby
I want you to hear every word I say, yeah, girl
That means I love you baby
And that means that I want you baby
And that means that I'm gon' get you baby
Well, well, well, well, well, well, don't you know that I love you girl
You kiss me and drive me crazy, yes, you do girl
Kiss me, love me, squeeze me, love me, do anything that you wanna do
But don't you ever, ever, ever, ever go nowhere
Please I don't want you to go nowhere baby
You see I love you girl, can't you see that I'm saying
