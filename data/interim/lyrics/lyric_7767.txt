Captain Jim
What's wrong with him?
He used to be so strong
Now he's dying
Indian scout
Dance and jump about
He used to be so brave
Now he's crying
Whatever happened to happy
Was he all a state of mind?
Whatever happened to the happy days
We left far behind?
Rainy days
The games we played
My room
The place that made me happy
Rain would fall
So I would call
My friend Joe
When he would call me happy
Whatever happened to happy
Was he all a state of mind?
Whatever happened to the happy days
We left far behind?
I won't forget them
Things that have passed me by
I can see
All the things that used to be
Still within the heart of me
Whatever happened to happy
Was he all a state of mind?
Whatever happened to the happy days
We left far behind?
Dressed in white
She looks all right
She was the girl
Who dressed up Sunday morning
