This mans a child, this man is old
Sometimes hes mild, sometimes hes bold
This man I love, sometimes in spite
I wish he would stick to his guns, or abandon the fight
But when he shines, oh when he shines
Yes when he shines, he shines so bright
Sometimes a tramp, sometimes a dude
He changes colour just like a cameleon, can't find the mood
He is a song thats not easy to write
He is a moon in the morning, and the sun out at night
But when he shines, when he shines, oh when he shines, he shines so bright
This mans a gentleman, this man is strong
This temperamental man plays me along
But when he shines, when he shines, oh when he shines, he shines so bright
Yes when he shines, when he shines, oh when he shines, he shines so bright
But when he shines, oh when he shines
Yes when he shines, he shines so bright
