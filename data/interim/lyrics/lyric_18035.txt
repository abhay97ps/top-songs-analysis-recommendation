Check, one, one, two
I came into this world as a reject
Look into these eyes, then you'll see the size of the flames 
Dwellin' on the past,  it's burnin' on my brain 
Everyone that burns has to learn from the pain
Hey, I think about the day 
My girlie ran away with my pay when fellas came to  play
Now she's stuck with my homies that she fucked 
And I'm just a sucker with a lump in my throat, hey
Like a chump
 I'm like a chump
 like a chump
 like a chump
 I'm like a chump
 like a chump
 like a chump
Should I be feelin' bad?  Should I be feelin' good? 
It's kinda sad, I'm the laughin' stock of the neighborhood
And you would think that I'd be movin' on 
But I'm a sucker like I said, fucked up in the head, not!
And maybe she just made a mistake
And I should give her a break, my heart'll ache either way
Hey, what the hell, what you want me to say?
I won't lie, that I can't deny
I did it all for the nookie 
The nookie 
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your 
Stick it up your 
Stick it up your 
Stick it up your…
I did it all for the nookie 
The nookie 
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your 
Stick it up your 
Stick it up your 
Stick it up your…
Why did it take so long?
Why, did I wait so long, huh?
To figure it out, but I did it
And I'm the only one underneath the sun who didn't get it
I can't believe that I could be deceived 
By my so-called girl, but in reality
Had a hidden agenda
She put my tender heart in a blender and still I surrendered
 Like a chump
 I'm like a chump
 like a chump
 like a chump
 I'm like a chump
 like a chump
 like a chump
I did it all for the nookie 
The nookie 
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your 
Stick it up your 
Stick it up your 
Stick it up your
I did it all for the nookie 
The nookie 
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your 
Stick it up your 
Stick it up your 
Stick it up your
I'm only human
It's so easy for your friends to give you their advice
They'll tell you, "Just let it go!"
It's easier said than done
I appreciate it, I do, but
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Just leave me alone
And nothing gonna change, you can go away
I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same
And nothing gonna change, so you can go away
And I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same
And nothing gonna change, so you can go away
And I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same
I did it all for the nookie 
The nookie 
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your 
Stick it up your 
Stick it up your 
Stick it up your
I did it all for the nookie 
The nookie 
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your 
Stick it up your 
Stick it up your
