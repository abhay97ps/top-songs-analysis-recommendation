Flowers have blooms the ocean has waves the sky has clouds people have babes
I wanna live till I get old I wanna watch all of this grow
I wanna live live and let live I want all the love this life has to give
I wanna smile and be friendly with you I wanna live and let you live some too
Rover is big Tabby is small Betty is short Jimmy is tall
They wanna live live and let live they want all the love this life has to give
They wanna smile and be friendly with you they wanna live and let you live some too
We wanna live what want you
