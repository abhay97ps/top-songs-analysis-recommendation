Ran off in the plug and he tried to shoot me
Extended clip with a Glock and a Uzi
Dodge charger with a leg and a louger
Fed out here trying to blue clue me
Dodge charger with a leg and a louger
Fed out here trying to blue clue me
Turn that shit up
Hop in Infinity burning rubber
Extended clip look like crutches
We in the street not the internet bluffing
All of my life been drug smuggling
I'm the plug with the plug numbers
20 bands in that Louis duffle
Old money like Frederick Douglass
Big dog it need to be muzzled
I turned my house to a trap house
I turned my house to a trap house
I turned my house to a trap house
I turned my house to a trap house
I turned my house to a trap house
I turned my house to a trap house
I turned my house to a drug house
I turned my house to a trap house
Ran off on the plug and he tried to shoot me
Extended clip with the Glock and the Uzi
Dodge charger wit the leg and the louger
Fed out here trying to blue clue me
We in the Bape, we gon zip em up
I'm picking up Oâ€™s in the pickup truck
Get shot now your man got to pick you up
I am not with all the Twitter stuff
Hop out I'm shooting like MTV
Heard he rap bout to shoot at his limousine
I got a XD with the lemon squeeze
We might run the plug from the Philippines
I trap I don't want to die too young
I beat up the block and was too young
They picking him up like whose son?
Margiela kicking mighty Joe Young
Big trap we ain't using no coupon
Grab the 40 he gon fall like a futon
Walk down get split like a neutron
Aim the chopper at his house now his roof gone
Stay in the lab like Jimmy Neutron
My momma had me when I was 
Where I'm off two xans
Leel got a perc and it jam
Hop in Infinity burning rubber
Extended clip look like crutches
We in the street not the internet bluffing
All of my life been drug smuggling
I'm the plug with the plug numbers
20 bands in that Louis duffle
Old money like Frederick Douglass
Big dog it need to be muzzled
I turned my house to a trap house
I turned my house to a trap house
I turned my house to a trap house
I turned my house to a trap house
I turned my house to a trap house
I turned my house to a trap house
I turned my house to a drug house
I turned my house to a trap house
