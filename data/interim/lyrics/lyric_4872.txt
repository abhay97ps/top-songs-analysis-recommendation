Don’t make faces at me, Patti
How do you know I’m making faces?
I can hear your face moving
You oughtta just tell me the real reason you wanted to see me
I mean, come on. After six months of not talking to me - six months - you and my father shut me out just ‘cause you were mad about my book?
I didn’t read it
It was just fiction
I didn’t read it
And you didn’t talk to me for six months?
We’re talking now.
I mean, it’s cool - you’re in L.A. visiting your old pal, Betsy
But don’t ask me to believe you’d cram a mother/child kiss-and-make-up-reunion into your schedule, so what’s the real reason you wanted me here?
To see you. You live in L.A., why not spend a nice day at Betsy’s pool together before I leave for the ranch?
For Thanksgiving . . .  to which I’m not invited.  Blow me
You know I don’t like that expression, Patti
How much you pay for that bathing suit?
Some designer give it to you?
I think you’re a little old for it, frankly
Me, I’m just not into fashion shit
Your kind of thing - it isn’t real
Me, I’m just not into frou-frou crap
Your kind of thing - it’s so bourgeois
The money that you blow on your silly suits and your evening gowns and your stupid hats.
The money that you throw at designer names:
It’s a sickening thing, it’s unconscionable.
Gimme an old pair of jeans instead
You can keep your Nancy Reagan red
Nah, I’m just not into tranny drag
Your kind of thing - it’s such a joke
Do you know what it’s like
To have a narcissistic mother?
Do you know how it is
Do you care?
No, you’re more concerned about your hair
And the stupid tranny clothes you wear
Me, I’m just not into you, Mommy Dearest
‘Cause you never try
To get into my head
Screw you and your Nancy Reagan red
I don’t think you heard a word I said
And you wonder why I wish that I were dead
We all have problems, Patti
What’s that supposed to mean?
You’re 32 years old
Yeah…
Not some child
Your Orange Blossom, Mrs. Reagan
 A straw, Anita. You forgot a straw
 Of course
Thank you, Anita
May I get you anything, Miss Davis?
Uh, I’ll have a Jack and Coke
It’s a little early
You’re drinking
It’s a very weak Orange Blossom
Anita, let Mrs. Bloomingdale know that I’m poolside
Yes, Mrs. Reagan
Oh, and make sure we’re all packed to take off tomorrow
We’ve got to get the ranch in order before Ronnie comes in
The staff never does anything right unless I’m there
Yes, Mrs. Reagan
Betsy runs an impeccable house, doesn’t she?
The Bloomingdale house is well stocked
Her staff is just so on top of things
Everyone is very nice
Don’t you love her new dining room?
That chandelier with the tiny, sparkly fairy light ….
… twinkly things?
Very nice
Her eye for detail . . . .
A Jack and Coke, Anita?
A straw first, Anita
Thank you
You’re here, my father’s in Washington
That’s a new one - you never let him out of your sight
Your father is under a lot of stress
 I’ll bet
We did not, I repeat did not, trade weapons for hostages or anything else
Would you want to see your father at Thanksgiving?
I’ve got plans
As I said, you’re 32 years old
You can make your own decisions
I read my horoscope
It’s lookin’ pretty good
Lots of fun things in store for me
 Money. Oh yeah, yeah
Lots o’ love and romance
And a black man
Yeah, a big, hunky black man gonna come into my life
Gonna make me his bitch
‘Fore he makes me his wife
Yeah
A big, nasty black man
Gonna turn this mother out
Gonna learn what perestroika
Is really all about
Oh, Mama
Oh, Papa
Gonna break your heart
When my black man takes me down
In an acrobatic star
Oh, Mama
Oh, Papa
Gonna freak you out
Push this
Ooh, push that
Ooh, hoo, shake your boo thang
Thang, thang, thang, thang
Your straw, Mrs. Reagan
Thank you, Anita
Oh, let Mrs. Bloomingdale know I spoke to Benita, and we’re still on for dinner tonight at the Bel Air
Of course
I wish the pool at the White House were kept as lovely as this
Very lovely
Not a single leaf or bug to be seen
It’s very clean
I wonder if Betsy’s poolman could talk to ours . . .
Did you know Paraguay is the largest manufacturer and distributor of marijuana in the whole of South America?
Thank you, Anita.
And can I have my Jack and Coke?
Gracias.
It’s weird that Anita was indicted for gun trafficking
She wasn’t involved
 A hundred thousand rounds of ammunition?
She wasn’t involved
Well, you did keep her on in spite of her arres
That took some big ass cajones
I always thought you had bigger cajones than my father
At least you knew how to slap me around as a kid and make it mean something
Now that would make a good book, wouldn’t it?
You’re expecting a call from the President at noon
Let’s just hope he remembers. My Ronnie . . .
Yes, Mrs. Reagan
He’s getting so forgetful
Yes, Mrs. Reagan
And Jim Baker hasn’t returned my call yet
Will you see about that?
Yes, Mrs. Reagan
Hey, some of us are thirsty, Anita
 My Ronnie
My Ronnie
Ronnie
Mommy
The names you call each other
Poo pants? Poop chin?
What’s that all about?
Ah, your marriage is somethin’ else
Just you two
Just you two
What’s that all about?
Just you two, no one else
Not us kids, only you and Poo Pants
Why’d you bother having kids?
Let’s play 20 questions.
Let’s enjoy this nice day
Nah, let’s play 20 questions
I wanna get into your head
I wanna delve beneath the crap
Dig beneath the Nancy Reagan red
It would be helpful for my book
Yes, I will write another book: a memoir, nonfiction
About me and you and Poo Pants
So, let’s play 20 questions
Okay, I’ll start:
Is it true that before you became the queen of Washington
You were the blow job queen of Hollywood?
Language, Patti
Just say . . . no
 Just say no
Barf-aroni
But better than your foster grandparent crap
Foster grandparents - what the hell was that about?
Adopt some old fart, like you?
 Like my father?
Why not adopt some little kid who’s starving . . .
Or beat up . . . by her parents . . . who hate her?
 Foster grandparents - how is that a First Lady cause?
Jesus
Hey, what are you gonna do when you aren’t First Lady anymore?
Say, like, your Ronnie gets impeached over this whole Iran-Contra crap?
Patti, please
I know you’re angry with me, but can’t we just  . . . sit?
Your father needs us both right now
We should be there for him - his two favorite girls
You really want me to come for Thanksgiving?
You always make him smile
I know
It breaks my heart that you and he haven’t spoken for awhile
And that’s my fault?
Can’t you just let go of the past?
If you could do that, it would do us both so much good
What makes me wanna hate you, Nancy?
Have you ever wondered?
No, you’ve never wondered
What makes me wanna hate you
Hit you where it hurts
Kick you where it counts
Make you wanna cringe
And cry and shriek
Just forget all the shit you’ve done to me?
Just let it go and, and look to a sparkly
Chandelier-y, leaf-free, bug-free future?
‘Cause it would do good?
 You really think I’m buying that?
You’re only thinking of yourself
It’s all about you
The world’s about you
Don’t you know I see
Nothing’s about me
You’re narcissistic
You’re all about you
Or should I say Poo
Poop Chin, whatever?
Nothing can dissuade
Your having to parade
Your giant head and Nancy-ness
 shriek and coiffed and by design
Nancy-ness
That steely gaze
That sober mind
Nancy-ness
Years ago I had to learn
It’s all about you
I’d hate to be you
You made the choice
To give up your life
To a B-listed actor
Who needed a wife
A second wife
Not first, but second wife
I could almost feel sorry for you
Women like you from the olden days
You didn’t have many choices
But you did have the choice to be a good mother or a crummy one
Sometimes I think about Jane Wyman
My father’s first wife
Sometimes I wonder if Jane Wyman
Would have made a good mom
She could act
Better than you - it’s a fact
Jane Wyman, would she have made a good mom?
I don’t know
But I digress
I was saying
It’s all about you
All life’s about you
And though your Nancy-ness thinks
It’s so easy to let go
Forgive and just say no
Well, it’s not
And so, I can hate you
My mother, the actress, a good one
However, Jane Wyman
Was better, but that’s it
I’ll say it: I hate you
For all you’ll never do
And you can blow me
It’s all about you
How hard it’s been for you all these years
How hard it was for you and your brother
Ronnie and I so busy, always busy
Hollywood, politics, then the White House
Children get lost, they get angry, hurt themselves, lash out
Some don’t make it
But you survived, Patti, you have
And you have talent
When a person has talent, it ought to be pursued
And you are a good writer, a really good writer
How do you know I’m a good writer if you didn’t read my book?
 Oh, Patti
I want, I want you to know that your father and I are proud of you
Of your ambition, your courage to take a stand, your wit
We’re proud of you, and we need you with us now
It’s us against the world, Patti
Us against the world
Thanksgiving?
Please
Okay
 Thanksgiving at the ranch, all of us together again like old times
Your father will be so happy
He needs a break from Washington
He needs to be with people who love him - us girls
Us girls.
And your brother, too.
Oh, he’s not dancing
this year?
This Iran-Contra crap; what’s Daddy gonna do?
He didn’t know anything
Well, he would’ve had to know something, right?
He didn’t know anything
I mean, without him giving some sort of okay
Assholes like Ollie North don’t just start screwin’ around with Nicaraguan maniacs, selling arms for hostages
He didn’t know anything
Come on. Come on, he’s the president, he knows about everything
Like he didn’t know about the October Surprise?
Surprise!
He knew those Iranians wouldn’t be releasing the hostages ‘til after the election
He knew all about that, you know he knew
Nah, he’s gotta know somethin’ about this Iran-Contra crap
He didn’t know anything, Patti.
That’s all you have to say.
All I have to say?
Like . . . if some reporter asks me?
It would be nice if you avoided saying anything about your father if someone does ask
Just ‘til we smooth things over
‘Til you find a way to cover up the crap, you mean
Like that HUD business and, and the Savings and Loans bullshit
Whip ,  gate, ABSCAM
He didn’t know anything
That’s all I have to say
That’s why I’m here - for you to tell me to keep my mouth shut?
Well, what if I don’t?
You don’t control me, I’m not one of your servants
You can’t control me, and that’s what’s always pissed you off
You didn’t want me here for some mother/child reunion or fucking Thanksgiving
You wanted me here to tell me to shut up
Well, you can’t shut me up
You have a call
Ronnie?
Mr. Baker on line two.
Oh, this will only be a minute, Patti.
Anita, my daughter would like a Jack and Coke
Ice?
Yes
Thank you
Jim, what are we doing about Don?
We both know he’s not good for the president
But we don’t want him around, Jim
No, there’s no need to talk to Ronnie about this
Jim, we need Don Regan gone. Do you understand?
Good, very good.
And where are we at with Weinberger?
He’s just gotta go, Jim. He’s handling everything all wrong
Yes
Yes, just . . . . plant the seed
Good. Oh, I like that
Oh, yes, I can’t wait for Ronnie to get here
He so needs to get away; we both need the ranch
Oh, you’re very sweet
You have a lovely Thanksgiving, too, Jim
‘Bye, Jim
I’m sorry, Patti, what were you saying?
Mommy’s gonna make things A-Okay
But you gotta do things Mommy’s way
Else she’s gonna run you outta town
Squash you like a bug and shut you down
But if you’re a good girl
Mommy’s nice, fixes you a drink with lots of ice
Do as Mommy says, don’t give her crap
And Mommy will reward you
With a slap
Why’d you use my lipstick?
Damn, don’t do that!
Slap!
Why’d you eat that cookie?
God, you’re too fat
Slap!
Slap!
Why’d you have your period without coming 
Now your sheet’s ruined, you think that linen’s free?
Your father can’t be bothered
Won’t you learn?
Slap!
Can’t you see?
Slap! Slap! Slap! Slap! Slap!
My Mommy,
Why, Mommy?
What, Mommy?
No, Mommy!
No, Mommy, no, Mommy, no, Mommy, no, Mommy, no, Mommy, no, Mommy!
No, Mommy!
No, Mommy, no, Mommy, no, Mommy, no, Mommy!
He didn’t know anything, Patti
That’s all you had to say; so simple
It worked
Yes
Should I shoot her?
That’s plan C
She’ll be out for three days, sleep it off at the ranch
Gives you time to do what you need to do
Three days?
What was in her drink this time?
Paraguay Nightshade also called, uh, Blue Potato Bush
And some Stevia for sweetness
You know I don’t do that
 It smells wonderful
Oh, Paraguay manufactures and distributes the largest supply of marijuana in the whole of South America.
Betsy’s thrown so many wonderful parties here - just fun
beatiful things
Bowls of pretty pink roses
Candlelight. Smoked salmon and avocado to start
Then stuffed chicken; boned, stuffed chicken with straw potatoes
Fresh raspberries with the most delicate, tiniest lace cookies
And dancing
Alfred and Betsy, Marian and Earl, Walter and Lee, Ronnie and me
All my friends
I like it here
I can see Ronnie and me moving back here after we’re done with Washington
Find a nice place in Bel Air close to Betsy and the whole group
Of course, you’ll come, too
It would be nice. Someday. In the future
Oh, a bug
Well, let’s try to make Thanksgiving at the ranch fun this year
I once said, “If you can save just one child, then it’s worth it.”
I believe that
But only sometimes
Is it crazy to think that?
