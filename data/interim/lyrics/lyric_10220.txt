You need to give love
Another try
One bad love affair
You never die?
I know he broke your heart
Too, girl
But hey, it's not the end
Of the world
I'm here to try
To comfort you
From all the changes
He put you through
I wanna
Make you feel love again
Let you know that you got a friend
I wanna
Make you feel love again
I'll stick by you
To the very end
You're afraid of love
'Cause you was hurt
He put your good name
Down in the dirt
There's so much love
Inside of me
I'm gonna give to you
Once your mind is free 
Girl, I know what you've been through
'Cause you see, I'm tryin' to make it up to you
But listen
You just call my name
I'll love away your hurt
And ease your pain
I can satisfy your desire
And give you love
That your body requires
I'm gonna
Make you feel love again
Let you know that you really got a friend
I wanna
Make you feel love again
I'll stick by you
'Til the very end
I wanna
Walk with ya
Talk with ya
Yeah!
I wanna, I wanna...
Now now now now...
Walk with ya, baby
Talk with ya, mama
I wanna, I wanna...
Hey!
Make you feel love again
Let ya know that you really got a friend
I wanna
Make you feel love again
I'll stick by you to the very end
I'm gonna
Make you feel love again
I'm gonna
Make you feel love again
Again and again and again, baby...
Well!...
Make you feel love again...
