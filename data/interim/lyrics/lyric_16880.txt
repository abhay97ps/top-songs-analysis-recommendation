Put out the word Blahzay has emerged –
Surged – most preferred from the verbs and words
I finesse try your best to diagnose
When I host you get roast, toast
Baked, grilled, broiled; when I rumble
You crumble, my stuff is good like mondongo
Soup; rappers getting soup fronting rugged
But I don't plug it, when my sematic hits to your nugget
And expose, you know how it goes when it be gritty
When we roll is like we got the key to the city
It won't be pretty for you to challenge; knock
You off balance better reconsider your talent
You weasel, you better off pumpin diesel
I find it feasable your days is over frontin' evil
Shouting to your people trying to bless your spot
But we don't believe that cause CBS tells a lot
On who got shot and who does all the crime
Danger! And you knew it all the time
“When the East is in the house”
“Oh my God!” “Danger!”
“When the East is in the house”
“Oh my God”
“When the East is in the house”
“Oh my God!” “Danger!”
“When the East is in the house”
“Oh my God”
And when we're in the house, ain't no time to act sheisty
Come out a spicy to your ass that is pricely
Costin', you get baked like Mr. Boston Beans
In box, you need more strength than just locks
I rocks hardcore even when I dress suited
On some business shit my street is deep rooted
What is this shit? Rappers want to blossom but they're
All a costume, thinking we buffoon, I'll tell you soon
You learn the hard way, tims and blunts going Broadway
Through this theater, hard rocks is getting weirder
Like Vera from “Alice”; the East is in your palace
On some proper shit and it will never be the opposite
“When the East is in the house”
“Oh my God!” “Danger!”
“When the East is in the house”
“Oh my God”
“When the East is in the house”
“Oh my God!” “Danger!”
“When the East is in the house”
“Oh my God”
And when we move on your circuit
You better pray to who you worship
That's recommended, ass kicks come splendid
Long-winded but I don't need my respiratory
To bless my story, you got nothing for me
Fakes been plotting behind doors, they schemin' up
For my arrival, rappers are teamin' up
Do your stuff finize is going to be limpin' MC's
When I plan my rap you be left handicapped
Sweat! gather because I break you no jalopy
Building all heads that be older than your papi
Pack the wind while PF backspin
To the essence, you get scarred to my presence
“When the East is in the house”
“Oh my God!” “Danger!”
“When the East is in the house”
“Oh my God”
“When the East is in the house”
“Oh my God!” “Danger!”
“When the East is in the house”
“Oh my God”
“Oh my God!”
“Oh my God… God… God!”
“When the East… when the East…”
“When the East is in the house”
“When the East is in the house””
“Danger!”
“When the East… when the East…”
“When the East is in the house”
