He's in town
He's back in town
Girl, I knew just what was wrong
When you weren't home
Each time when I phoned
All week long
And now I see it in your eyes
The look on your face
When you're thinking of him
Can't be disguised
I was afraid
He'd come back someday
And I'd be the one to lose
I knew when you saw him
You wouldn't ignore him
And he'd be the one you choose
No, you don't have to tell me
He's in town
He's back in town
No, you don't have to tell me
He's in town
He's back in town
He's in town
