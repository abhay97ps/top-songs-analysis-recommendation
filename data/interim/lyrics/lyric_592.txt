Slow
Now-ow, if you wanna love that woman
A-you love her with a thrill
'Cause-a if you don't
A-some other man will
You've got to love her with a feeling
You got to love her with a feeling
Love her with a feeling, man
Or don't you love at all
She shakes all over
A-when she walks
She made a blind man see
She made a, a dumb man talk
You know she love me with a feeling
A-love me with a feeling
Love me with a feeling, baby
Or don't you love at all
The cops took her in
How that woman didn't need no bail
How she wiggled one time for the judge
And the judge put the cops in jail
You know you love me with a feeling
A-love me with a feeling
Love me with a feeling, baby
Or don't you love at all
