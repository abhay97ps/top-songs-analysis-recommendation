What`s your mama`s name?
Thirty some odd years ago
A young man came to Memphis
Asking about a rose
That used to blossom in his world
People never took the time
To mind the young man`s questions
Until one day
They heard him ask a little green eyed girl
What`s your mama's name, child?
What`s your mama's name?
Does she ever talk
About a place called New Orleans?
Has she ever mentioned
A man named Buford Wilson?
What`s your mama`s name, child?
What`s your mama`s name?
Twenty some odd years ago
A drunk down in Memphis
Lost a month of life and labor to the county jail
Just because he asked
A little green eyed girl a question
And offered her a nickel`s worth of candy
If she`d tell
A year and some odd days ago
An old man died in Memphis
Just another wayward soul the county had to claim
Inside the old man`s ragged coat
They found a faded letter
It said you have a daughter
And her eyes are Wilson green
What`s your mama's name, child?
What`s your mama's name?
Does she ever talk
About a place called New Orleans?
Has she ever mentioned
A man named Buford Wilson?
What`s your mama's name, child?
What`s your mama's name?
What`s your mama's name, child?
What`s your mama's name?
