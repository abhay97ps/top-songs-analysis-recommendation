Oooh...
There I go again falling in love all over
Oooh...
The cycle never ends
You just pray you don't get burned
Oooh...
This fire inside of me, don't nobody realize
Oooh...
What you are to me, but baby you got to learn
I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
You got to know how I feel about cha
How I'll always want you near
I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
I'm counting every minute
Of every hour 'til you are here
Girl, can't you understand
I never used to go dancing
I, I was the kind of man who'd rather stay at home
Now, when I think about how much I miss you
I want to jump for joy and thank Him I'm not alone 
I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
You got to know how I feel about cha
How I always want you near
I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
I'm gonna count every minute
Of every hour 'til you are here, oooohh
Here I go again falling in love all over
Oh, the cycle never ends
You pray you don't get burned, ow
I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
(I'm, I'm making you a coat of cashmere
Baby, cashmere)
You got to know how I feel about cha 
How I always want you near
I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
I'm counting every minute of every hour
'Til you are here
When I get my arms around you, baby
There's so many things I wanna do
I'm gonna hold you
I'm gonna kiss you
Like you... like you...
I'm gonna tell you a bedtime story, baby
One you never heard before
I said, one you never heard before
About a girl, about a boy
And all the joy
All the things that you enjoy
How to stay in love, how to stay so happy
Baby girl, there's so many things
So many things I wanna do
I wanna...
I wanna...
I wanna...I wanna...I wanna...I wanna...
I wanna make you a pretty, pretty coat of cashmere
Cause you got to know how I feel about you, baby
How I feel about you, baby
I'm gonna make a little pretty coat
I'm gonna count every second, every minute
Each and every hour of every day
'Til you come on back
Come on back to your little man
