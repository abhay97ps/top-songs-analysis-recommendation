Jealous, jealous
We The Best Music
Oh, oh, oh
They don't want us together, 'gether
Another one
You need somebody, babe, you need somebody, babe
DJ Khaled
I pick you up in my ride
Make sure you waitin' outside when I pull up
I told my niggas I can't slide 
Just to be right by your side
I could've been anywhere, but I'm right here
I want you all to myself
I grab your hips and I
Tell you you're the one for me 
Tell you I got all I need
'Cause I want your body , yeah, yeah
All over my body 
And I know that they hatin', they say I'm no good
But I know that they watchin' 
Girl, I can tell you need some love in your life 
And I'm the one, don't let no one change your mind
Fuck what they say 
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous 
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous 
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether
You mad or you jealous, you sad or you settle
The brighter the rainbow, the badder the weather
The good with the bad, but the badder the better
Bring my sand to the beach, nigga, and to the desert
We fell from the heavens, we landed like feathers
The rose in the rubble, keep your nose out our petals
Your hoes know my schedule, and my hoes know I'm special
They know not to question, bitch, you know I'm not Alexa
She, she post a pic of me and her from off her iPad
You know them hoes don't like that, where the likes at?
Jealousy is a disease, you can die mad
Tunechi, Sean, CB, Khaled, hi there 
But girl, I can tell you need some love in your life (Mulah,
Let's ride)
And I'm the one, don't let no one change your mind 
Fuck what they say 
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous 
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous 
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether 
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous 
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether 
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous 
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether 
Dawg, it's these jealous ass hoes I can't relate to
The type to follow you but hardly follow through
You say I'm on your mind, I'm wondering why I'm not on you
Girl, you're fresh out the shower
Towel around your head like you're Erykah Badu
It's lookin' like a spa day
I rearrange your chakras, listenin' to Sade
Let's take a road trip and get high on the highway 
Migrate, spend time, lay back, watch the sky change, woah
And I hear the jealousy, but look, I never listen
The quickest way to let something die is lack of attention 
And you got it all, you looking good as my intentions 
We on an ascension, straight up
But girl, I can tell you need some love in your life 
And I'm the one, don't let no one change your mind 
Fuck what they say 
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous 
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous 
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether 
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous 
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether 
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous 
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether 
These boys scared I'ma take they chick 
Must be the money, 'cause a young boy rich 
You could drop a dime, but I make it make sense
Girl, you coming home with me
You the last number on my call list 
Pull up on me, girl, let's get lit 
I think I hit a lick
I think I hit a lick, yeah 
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous 
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether 
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous 
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether 
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous 
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether 
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous 
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether 
We The Best Music
They jealous
They don't want us together
They played themselves 
Baby, I got an idea
Let's be together forever 
I think I hit a lick, yeah, yeah
