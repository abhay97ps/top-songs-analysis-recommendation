I am here to tell you we can never meet again
Simple really - isnt it
A word or two and then
A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when
You think of me or speak of me
Or wonder what befell
The someone you once loved so long ago so well
Never wonder what I feel as living shuffles by
You dont have to ask me
And I do not reply
Every moment in my life from now until I die
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand
How the perfect love can be confounded out of hand
Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Is this Gods experiment
In which we have no say
In which we live in paradise
But only for the day
Nothing can be altered oh theres nothing to decide
No escape, no change of heart, nor any place to hide
You are all Ill ever want
But this I am denied
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts
I wish I never learned
What it is to be n love
And have that love returned
Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Is this Gods experiment
In which we have no say
In which we live in paradise
But only for the day
