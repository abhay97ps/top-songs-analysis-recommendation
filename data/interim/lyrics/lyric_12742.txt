I just wanna run
I just wanna hide
Ask me how I'm doing and I just tell 'em all lies
If I told the truth then they'd probably say goodbye
I ain't try'na lose, I got people down to ride
I got people that rely on me, I ain't try'na die homie
I used to not smoke, 'cause I never had the five, homie
Now I got a couple thousand people try'na follow me
Hollow inside, swallow my pride
But it tastes like liquor, take my liver
Took my skin in the middle of the winter
They watch–µd me shiver
Ain't nobody give a fuck
Ain't nobody giving up
Maybe I'ma hit 'em up
Every time I get a chance
Take it slow like a wedding dance
And if you wanna talk shit you gon' get the hands
I'ma start swinging
I'ma start singing
Then I'ma probable Let It Be like I'm John Lennon
Obviously we don't agree
On certain things, certain things
I know you got some problems
Girl I got some issues too
Let's not reflect on all the shit that you didn't do
I didn't grow up poor, but I didn't grow up rich
I didn't grow up soft, man I ain't a little bitch
I'm a motherfucking monster, gotcha
Mix me with some vodka
Deadly combination like I linked up with the roster
This the brand new Sinatra mixed with Tupak Shakur, ah
I'm just try'na hit 'em up
I'm just try'na look like Diddy getting fitted in a tux
With a rolly on my left hand
Ain't nobody getting married, but somehow I'm still the best man
Put me anywhere on God's earth, I'll make a check there
And I can't care less where
You have now entered the mind of a fearless man
I'm fearless than any one man can
Make my beat, I'm a one-man band
And you ain't fucking with me
All the things that they say they mean nothing to me
On the page, on the stage, give 'em something to see
Either way they gon' pay just to come in and see
Got confronted, now your bitch ass running from me
Just keep running if you ever think of coming for me
Obviously we don't agree
On certain things, certain things
I know you got some problems
Girl I got some issues too
Let's not reflect on all the shit that you didn't do
And this is lil' ol' me
Lil' ol' me and this fifth of Hennessy
I can see you peeking in and I'm try'na keep it lowkey
Currently at war with the nigga that you see
As much as they pull me in this is as much as I wanna leave
Swear that I'm the one with no emotions on my sleeve
They only want high fives so "Hi guys wait for my high rise"
The paranoia blindside a portion of my eyesight
Welcome to heartless
But you probably call this an office
I don't wanna shake your hand now, I'm cautious
Looking for flawless
I built you a fortress and all this
And knowing you was counting my losses
Pen is a gun now I fiddle run 'round as I run around
Take it with a smile on the front now
Who do you trust in the middle of disgust?
When you steppin' out your whip and everybody try'na rush?
When you introduce your chick and everybody wanna fuck?
'Cause when they saying it's on and you never buying enough
You burning one while you rolling, you ain't never high enough
Bruh, let me give you who you came to see
Obviously we don't agree
On certain things, certain things
I know you got some problems
Girl I got some issues too
Let's not reflect on all the shit that you didn't do
