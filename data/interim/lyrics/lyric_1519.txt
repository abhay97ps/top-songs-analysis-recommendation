Hey, little copy cat
I think you ought to know that
Copy cats just don't last long
And they'll soon have to go
Well, I said, yeah
Yeah, yeah, little copy cat
Why do you copy me
Why can't you find
A style of your own
And, baby, just let me be
I said, yeah, yeah, yeah
Little copy cat
Just who do you think you are
You copy everything I do
Right down to my jaguar
And then I said, yeah
I'm talking bout Chubby
I'm talking bout Bobby
They can copy his song now
They may kinda get his moves
But you won't last for very long
Yeah, yeah, yeah, little copy cat
I think you ought to know that
Copy cats just don't last long
And they'll soon have to go
Come on, I said, yeah

Trying to cop my style
They're trying to drive me wild now
They're trying to take my place
But don't you know, it's a disgrace
You try to get my soul, yeah
But I got control
Cause I got Daddy G
That's the man for me now
Blow, Daddy, yeah
