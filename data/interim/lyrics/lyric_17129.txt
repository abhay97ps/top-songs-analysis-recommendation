I don't do this shit for you
Do this shit for me
And I'm sick of being used
No more shit for free
Man I live inside a booth
20 years a week
?????
That's the truth
I don't miss a thing
Let it kiss the ring
Boy I been the king
And my bitch a queen
Life a Livin' dream
Bouta' catch a body on a record if you disagree
Disbelief, that's the look they give me when I rip the beat
I don't take a shot
I make it hit then hit em' with defeat
Stripes though
Stripes
Make it hit, it's somethin' light though
Light
Y'all couldn't see me with my eyes closed
Right?
You say some shit you ain't the type though
Right?
You lie low
All these pussies being passive
I don't play that shit
If you got somethin' to say
Then you should say that shit
Tryna say i'm in my feelings when I state how I'm feelin'
That's just communication
But they can't take that shit
I don't think it's dope to fuck 100 bitches and cheat
I don't idolize drugs, pussy gimmicks agree
I don't shape my thought around the worlds vision of me
I don't hate em, That just isn't for me
I'm a grown man
I'm tryna raise a family
All these little boys talk about is the shit I can be
I'm who they can't be
If Drake rapped one of my records, that shit would get a Grammy
It makes some men outta boys who think about lookin' fancy
They on the Gram
Flexin' money in they hands
Out here lookin' like a lick
Close to you is where I can't be
Here talkin' bout the shit they bout to do
And I'll be proud of you
But until you boys do it you just can't understand me
Ooh
That's a choose
I don't think that they can
I don't think that they can handle it
You get one life
That ain't somethin' you should gamble with
Winnin' I'm consistent
That ain't luck or nothin' random bitch
Make it hit, it's somethin' light though
Light
Somethin light, somethin' light though
Light
Somethin' some-somethin' somethin' light though
Light
Somethin' some-somethin' light
I'm elevatin'
Meditatin' till my mind's in order
Ignore the haters, shine the light on love from my supporters
No hesitation
Move with purpose
Ain't no kind of disorder
I'm steady
Killin' off my doubts and it's a violent slaughter
But y'all are coppin' brand names for the relevance
Liquidate a business, that's what I be callin' "Hella Drip"
Shit I know that knowledge is a weapon
And I'm well equipped
Elevatin' daily so you never see me reminisce
But everybody consumed by the television
Never makin' moves while they holdin' out for better livin'
But what you want is on the other side of repetition
Get your daily habits straight and maybe you'll be self-sufficient
Hustle till i'm on the ??? and chillin
While they still up in the club, tryna floss for women
Ain't no wonder that you barely meet your cost for livin'
But you stay middle class from your poor decisions
Look
Gotta watch and take notes on how to best maneuver
Surround yourself with more bosses homie, less consumer
Spreadin' love along with knowledge, y'all are spreadin' rumors
But still i'm laughin to the bank, I got a sense of humor
As for the people who been tryna call me white trash
Get off of Twitter, maybe brush up on your fine ass
If i'm bein honest, I don't really need advice fam
Young god, bout to make a milly from my mic stand
I'm on a roll to 7 digits at least
Till then I spread wealth, I got limitless reach
I get when money when I preach
Call them figures of speech
Know my income passed if I get rich when I sleep
Damn
You had it all, it's a shame that you lost it
Peaked back in high school, no wonder you're nostalgic
Life's still trash and complainin' won't solve it
Tellin' me I've changed
Yeah bitch, I'm evolvin'
Tell em' I want all of it and then I need it multiplied
Money kinda soundin' like I spittin rhymes in double time
You walk around chest out, you got a ton of pride
You ain't achieved shit bitch, you're confidence ain't justified
