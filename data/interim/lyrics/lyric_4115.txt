There are games that
Many foolish lovers play
Blindly chasing happy endings
Come what may
Never caring
Who gets hurt along the way
Let's not play those games
That lovers play
Sometimes lovers hurt each other
Telling lies
Acting out charades
Behind their smiling eyes
If you love me, darling
You must realize
We can't play those games
That lovers play
When I whisper
I'll be yours eternally
In my heart
I feel
Our love is meant to be
It's not just to have you share
One dream with me
I'm not playing games
That lovers play
Sometimes lovers hurt each other
Telling lies
Acting out charades
Behind their smiling eyes
If you love me
Darling, you must realize
We can't play those games
That lovers play
Let's not play those games
That lovers play
