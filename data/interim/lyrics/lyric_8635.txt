Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified
I just left my baby's house
And I got the strength I needed
Knowing that the beast of man
Is very hard to please
I`m so glad the sun is shining
To brighten up the day
'Cause behind last night
I see things in a different way
Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified
She led me to the peak of love
And no words could ever describe
Oh, when you get that kind of loving
It`s a blessing to be alive
Ooh, the sacred feeling
Just blows through my soul
Searching for sanctuary
To rest, it must explode
Yeah, I feel sanctified 
Yeah, I feel sanctified
She led me to the peak of love
And no words could ever describe
Oh, when you get that kind of loving
It`s a blessing to be alive
Ooh, the sacred feeling
Just blows through my soul
Searching for sanctuary
To rest, it must explode
Yeah, I feel sanctified 
Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified 
Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified
