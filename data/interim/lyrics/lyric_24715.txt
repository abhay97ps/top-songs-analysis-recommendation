It's another one
I got that juice
New AP
She got that juice 
She got that squeeze 
She got that whip 
I'm on them skis
I got that drip 
I'm overseas 
D-R-I-P-P-I-N-G
I got that VVS I-C-E
Ooh, frozen like a cooler
Juice, blame it on my jeweler
I got stones on my neck 
Blood on my set 
Water on my wrist 
Put glitter on my bitch 
My ex was a waitress
So I gave that hoe a tip 
My ex fucked a lame
Now she workin' double shifts 
Our money ain't the same
You a lame, and it clear 
I did ten mil in 11 months, not a year 
I gave fifty racks in the club to appear 
I blew two mil on my dog for a appeal
I got that juice

I'm overseas 
D-R-I-P-P-I-N-G
I got that VVS I-C-E
Ooh, feels like a cooler
Juice, blame it on my jeweler
Ayy
Bright banana Porsche fresh off the runway
Monkey-ass niggas, I think y'all all bapes
If I see you won't speak, I'm on my Cardi B
Shorty got that night-night, put your ass to sleep
And my label say I got the juice 
Hol' up, ayy, Yo Gotti, who as hot as you?
You'll avoid talkin' money, know there's too much juice
You may see me with security, but know I'm the one shootin'
I been a boss all my life, I made a millionaire or two
And you might see me in a coupe with the disappearing roof
I had packs, I got plaques, you get taxed for the juice
If you ask, you get facts, I'm at Saks with your boo
I got that juice
