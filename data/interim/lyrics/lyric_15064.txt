Hey, Slim. Come here, check this out
Uh-uh, wait. Let me tell you something
If you ain't got a Bronco, a BMW, a Benz or big bank
Then just 
Aw, I knew it. I knew it. I KNEW IT
Another B girl
Yo I think it's about time
We gonna tell Slim about ourselves
Believe that
Now let's bring up the subject
Which we brought to mind
Let's discuss the "B" girls
Cause they're one-of-a-kind
Now you can find at least five
Wherever you go
Put 'em in your black Benz
Or your blue Bronco
Everything is chill
With the AC pushin'
In your automobile
You call yourself a lady?
"B" girl is your name
And if you don't know what "B" means
Let us explain
"B" stands for:
Broncos, Benz, BMW, bass, bangles and a pair of bars
When you see us pulling up down the Ave
You'll act like we are stars
We're not tryin' to make a joke
We're just tryin' to make it known
That people of the world that we call "B" girls
Like bars on a Cadillac Brougham.
Now that ain't it, and I believe
That we had to rehearse
Another rhyme on the line
For the second verse:
About a girl in the city
Her name is Judy
Had breasts like Dolly
With a big old booty
Well she was 
And everything was in place
She was my girl for two years
And  doctor 
When I took her to 
She was frontin' 'bout my Nova
And she wanted a Benz
She said "We need a Benz"
And all of a sudden, I paused -
Who did Judy think I was?
Santa Claus?
You call yourself Judy
"B" girl is your name
And if you don't know what "B" means
Let us explain:
Now I was pushin' on my B.M
With no context
It wasn't B.M.W
It was B.M.X
When I seen a young thing
Comin' down the Ave
And I knew from the moment
She's the girl I'd have
So I slammed on the brake
And I asked her name
She said, "My name is Janice
But my friends call me Jane."
I said, "Well Jane, I'm Prince
Can we be friends?"
She said
"Yes, if you could change a BMX to a Benz!"
You call yourself Jane
"B" girl is your name
And if you don't know what "B" means
Let us explain:
Now me and Prince was at the beach
With a couple of friends --
I parked my Nova by a Bronco
And a baby blue Benz
And passed some bottles around
So I said, 
Already drunk from an overdose
Of malt liquor beer
She turned around
And had a nice figure
She said, "Can't you see me walkin' with my nigga?"
"Hey, so? He's a punk!"
She said, "I know he's a punk though
But you in a Nova
And he's in a Bronco!"
She came in my face
She kept yakkety-yakkin'
That's when I popped the trunk
I put the clip in the MAC-10
I'm tired of you "B" girls
Yeah, that's your name!
And if you don't know what 'B' means
Let us explain:
Bars on a Cadillac Brougham
