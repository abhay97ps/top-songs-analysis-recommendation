I come home late at night with my shoes in my hands
Stumble in the back door being quite as I can
And I know she there in bed cold and all alone
And she's crying cause I'm breaking up our home
And she knows  the hell I'm going through
In this world  inside my head
There's a devil  in a bottle
And he wants to see me dead
I fall into her arms and she helps me with my clothes
Yeah she stays on with me cause she really knows
Cause I'm trying lord to find my freedom
By escaping to the only freedom I've ever known
And she knows  the hell I'm going through
In this world  inside my head
There's a devil  in a bottle
And he wants to see me dead
There's a devil  in a bottle 
And he wants  to see me dead
And it's killing her to see me die this way
