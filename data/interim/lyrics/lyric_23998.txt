I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama, hmm
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama

I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no
Wake up and rise and shine 
Best get to work on time 
No more playing video games 
Things are about to change 
We used to be crazy in love
Can we go back to how it was?
When did you get too comfortable?
Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that
Just remember that, hey!

'Cause some things have gotta change 
We used to be crazy in love
