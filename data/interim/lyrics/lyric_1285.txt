I don't want to be the one to
Say I'm gonna miss you
But I will, I will
I don't want to say I'm
Gonna cry my eyes out, baby
But I will, I will
I'm not ashamed for you to know
How much I really loved you so
Cause it was such a thrill
And just remember when you're gone
There'll be that someone sad
Who loves you still
You will look at him and
See me smiling back at you
I know you will, you will
You will find yourself
Repeating things we used to do
I know you will, you will
Don't wonder if
You want to come back
Just come running home to me
And let me feel the thrill
Cause I'm the one who told you
I would love you, dear, forever
And I will, I will
I will, I will
I will, yes, I will
Oh, you will look at him and
See me smiling back at you
I just know you will, you will
And you will find yourself
Repeating things we used to do
I know you will, you will
But don't wonder if
You want to come back
Just come running home to me
And let me feel the thrill
Cause I'm the one who told you
I would love you, dear, forever
And I will, I will, I will
