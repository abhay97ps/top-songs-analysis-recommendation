Magic fills the air whenever you are near
I can finally see the mystery of love in your eyes
It's got me hypnotized
You made me believe our love was meant to be
Now somehow things have changed
You're mentioning his name
But I don't wanna hear
That you've let someone new into your heart
It's tearing me apart
But, darling, I've just got to know
Where does that leave love?
Where does that leave us?
What about the promises and dreams that mean so much?
Where does that leave me?
Living without you?
How can I go on when you are telling me we're through?
Darling, if it's true
Where does that leave us?
Where does that leave love?
Holding back the tears
Holding back the fears
That you would really go
And leave me here to live all alone
No meaning in my life
Now all that is left is a dream that's half alive
I still need you so
I just can't let you go
Can't you find in me
What you have found in somebody new?
After all that we've been through
If I am about to lose you
Where does that leave love?
Where does that leave us?
What about the promises and dreams that mean so much?
Where does that leave me?
Living without you?
How can I go on when you are telling me we're through?
Darling, if it's true
Where does that leave us?
Where does that leave...
You always said that you'd be here
Oh, how could you leave me now?
We got so much more we can share
Where does that leave love?
Where does that leave us?
What about the promises and dreams that mean so much?
Where does that leave me?
Living without you?
How can I go on when you are telling me we're through?
Darling, if it's true
Where does that leave us?
Where does that leave me?
Living without you?
How can I go on when you are telling me we're through?
