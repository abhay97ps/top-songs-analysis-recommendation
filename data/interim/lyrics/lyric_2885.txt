Sometimes 
You make me wonder 
I get the blues 
And then I wonder 
When you should
Hate me day and night
But when I'm home
Everything's alright
Who's the fool, me or you
Sometimes I wonder 
Can I get an answer
You sit there with a
Smile upon your face
What's on your mind 
But you're just prancing
All over the place
When you should
Hate me day and night
But when I'm home
Everything's alright
Who's the fool, me or you
Sometimes I wonder 
You make me wonder 
Sometimes I wonder 
If you should
Hate me day and night
But when I'm home
Everything's alright
Who's the fool, me or you
Sometimes I wonder 
You make me wonder ...
