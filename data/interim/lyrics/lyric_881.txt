Giddy-up, here, boy
When the Lord made me, he made a simple man
Not much money and not much land
He didn't make me no banker or legal charmer
When the Lord made me he made a Blackland farmer
Well my hands ain't smooth, my face is rough
But my heart is warm and my ways ain't tough
I guess I'm the luckiest man ever born
'Cause the Lord gave me health and a Blackland farm
Breakin' up the new ground early in the day
Gonna plant cotton, I'm gonna plant hay
I love the smell of sweet breeze blowin' through the corn
Lord you sure done me right by my Blackland farm
I feel like I'm a-gettin' closer to you, God
A plow in the ground and a-breakin' up the sod
Well, my mind is at ease and I could do no harm
Lord, I owe it all to you and my Blackland farm
