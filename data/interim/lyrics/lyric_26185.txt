Most nights I try to pack
Got you climbin' on my back
Sayin', "Daddy, when am I gonna see you again?"
You know I gotta go out on the road
And get on with the show
So most nights, your mama's gonna tuck you in
When you're missin' me, look at the stars up there
I'll be wishin' on the same ones, and singin' this father's prayer
I hope you see the Seven Wonders
I hope you sail the Seven Seas
I hope you let the whole world in your heart
But you still got room for me
I hope you find a guy that treats you right
On your wedding night, I'll raise a toast
Hope he understands
I'll always be the man that loves you the most
Summer's gone and school is back
It's my turn to help you pack
I'll keep your room exactly how it is
I know you gotta go out on your own
I'm so proud of you, you know
You're the best thing that this old man ever did
When I'm missin' you and all the stars come out
Sing this prayer when the quiet gets too loud
I hope you see the Seven Wonders
I hope you sail the Seven Seas
I hope you let the whole world in your heart
But you still got room for me
I hope you find a guy that treats you right
On your wedding night, I'll raise a toast
Hope he understands
I'll always be the man who loves you the most
Trust your gut, hold your own
But allow for doubting too
Forgive the wrongs and love yourself
That's the hardest thing to do
If your back's against the wall, baby
Come on home
I'm always here for you
And when you've seen the Seven Wonders
When you sail the Seven Seas
When you change the whole world with your heart
I hope you think of me
When I go to sing my final song
Hope you celebrate and raise a toast
If you cry, they'll understand
For the man who loved you the most
