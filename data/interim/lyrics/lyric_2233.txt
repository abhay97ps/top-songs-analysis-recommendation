When I was just a wee little lad full of health and joy
My father homeward came one night and gave to me a toy
A wonder to behold it was with many colors bright
And the moment I laid eyes on it, it became my heart's delight
It went zip when it moved
Bop when it stopped
Whirr when it stood still
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will
The first time that I picked it up I had a big surprise
For right on its bottom were two big buttons that looked like big green eyes
I first pushed one, then the other, then I twisted its lid
And when I set it down again here is what it did
It went zip when it moved
Bop when it stopped
Whirr when it stood still
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will
It first marched left, then marched right, then marched under a chair
And when I looked where it had gone it wasn't even there
I started to cry, and my daddy laughed for he knew that I would find
When I turned around my marvelous toy a-chuggin' from behind
It went zip when it moved
Bop when it stopped
Whirr when it stood still
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will
Now, the years have gone by too quickly it seems, I have my own little boy
And yesterday I gave to him my marvelous little toy
His eyes nearly popped right out of his head, he gave a squeal of glee
Neither one of us knows just what it is but he loves it just like me
It still goes zip when it moves
And bop when it stops
Whirr when it stands still
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will
