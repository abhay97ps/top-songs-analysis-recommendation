You've been around for a long, long time;
I've seen you here before
You'll meet some guy who really turns
And sneak out of the side door
You'll never look my way I know
I ain't much to look at
But one of these nights you're goin' home with me
I'm gonna see to that
Well
I'm just waitin' out my time
Standing at the end of the line
I got a lot of lovin' I'm savin' inside for you
Yeah
I'm just waitin' out my time
Standing at the end of the line
But you're gonna know that you've been loved
When I get through lovin' you
You looked right at me and smiled
One time just last week
And what one look from you did to me
It kept me in my seat
But you picked another guy to entertain you that night
And I was left to entertain myself
So I got into a fight
While
I was just waitin' out my time . .
