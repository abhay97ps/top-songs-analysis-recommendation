What am I living for if not for you
Tell me what am I living for if not for you
Girl, what am I living for if not for you
Oh, oh, nobody else, baby, nobody else will do
What am I longing for each lonely night
To feel your lips to mine, and hold you tight
Yes, you'll be the only girl my whole life through
Oh, oh, nobody, baby, nobody else will do
I want you close to me, that's all I know
I want you all the time, darling, I love you so
What am I living for if not for you
Tell me what am I living for if not for you
I wanna know what am I living, what am I living for if not for you
Oh darling, since nobody else, nobody else will do
I want you close to me, that's all I know
I want you all the time because I love you so
What am I living for if not for you
Girl, what am I living for if not for you
What am I living for if not for you
Oh, oh, nobody else, baby, nobody else will do
Oh, oh, nobody, nobody, baby
