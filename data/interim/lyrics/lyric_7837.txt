Ever since I was a young boy, I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must have played them all
But I ain't seen nothing like him in any amusement hall
That deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
He plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pin ball
He's a pinball wizard, there has got to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist
How do you think he does it? I don't know
What makes him so good?
He ain't got no distractions, can't hear those buzzers and bells
Don't see lights a flashin', plays by sense of smell
Always has a replay 'n' never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him
Even on my usual table, he can beat my best
His disciples lead him in and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall
That deaf dumb and blind kind sure plays a mean pinball
