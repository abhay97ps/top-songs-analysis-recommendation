You will be missed forever 
Rest in peace to love, I gave up a long time ago 
Hard times, everybody left, I'm the one you counted on 
My shoulder took a lot of tears, woulda swore it was a fountain on 
I be cryin' on the inside and smilin' when the cameras on 
Woulda never went against you ever 
I even tried to make the grudge settle 
Yeah, I heard that you slept with a couple fellas 
Still treated you like a virgin because I know you better 
When she suck it, take my soul, she a whole devil 
Bought a Wagon then I covered it with rose petals 
She didn't think I was romantic 'cause I'm so ghetto
Got a Patek and a Birkin, it was fundamental
Then the situation took a U-turn 
Foundation crumbled and the roof burned 
I ain't perfect, I was slidin' like a earthworm, loco
But I never, ever brought the dirt home 
Man, we both played each other, you was worse, though 
Always blamin' me because I did it first, though 
You started sleepin' with your phone in your purse, though
And you had that pussy nigga fragrance on your skirt, ho 
Rest in peace to love, I gave up a long time ago 
Hard times, everybody left, I'm the one you counted on 
My shoulder took a lot of tears, woulda swore it was a fountain on 
I be cryin' on the inside and smilin' when the cameras on 
I had your back, you put a knife in mine 
If you was finna lose your life, I woulda gave you mine 
I sit back and reminisce sometimes 
I used to drink my syrup while you drank your wine 
Can't believe what we came to 
You won't believe what the fame do
We ain't together, any problems, I still came through 
Heard he put his hands on you, that's what lames do 
Got my first taste of love and I thank you 
Savage, never let another woman taint you 
Fallen victim to my feelings, something I can't do 
Get revenge on every bitch, even if it ain't you 
Rest in peace to love, I gave up a long time ago 
Hard times, everybody left, I'm the one you counted on 
My shoulder took a lot of tears, woulda swore it was a fountain on 
I be cryin' on the inside and smilin' when the cameras on 
Truly genuine love never really dies
But lust, infatuation, and unrevealed attraction are all things that over time rarely survive
