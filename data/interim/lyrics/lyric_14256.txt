There he stood in the street
Smiling from his head to his feet
I said 'hey,what is this?
Now baby, maybe, maybe he's in need of a kiss
I said 'hey, what's your name baby
Maybe we can see things the same
Now don't you wait or hesitate
Letâ€™s move before they raise the parking rate
All right now baby,it's all right now
All right now baby it's all right now
I took him home to my place
Watching every move on his face
He said look, what's your game baby
Are you tryin' to put me in shame?"
Said 'slow,don't go so fast
Don't you think that love can last?'
He said 'love, lord above
Now you're tryin to trick me in love
All right now baby, it's all right now
All right now baby, it's all right now
