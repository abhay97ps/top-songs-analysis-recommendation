Look at who the wind's blowing up the road
Shining like the Northern star
Acting like the answer to all my prayers
Baby, I know what you really are
So don't you knock on my door
I won't be home anymore
You can find me out walking in the sun
Oh, you hide it so well
It isn't easy to tell
But I know a heartache when I see one
There was a time I was a true believer
Your love was the only way
You can save all your sweet talking
For some other fool
Only a fool would believe what you say
Oh, time is a teacher
It's taught me well
The loser is the one who cries
And when you've cried like a baby
And you felt like hell
You know the devil by the look in his eye
