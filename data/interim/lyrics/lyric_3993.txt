I'm calling to tell you its over
Yes darling, you're now free to go
You're saying you're sorry you hurt me
But you hurt me much more than you know
You're asking me where this call comes from
Oh, I hope you won't end up here
If your new romance turns out a failure
Here's where you'll find me my dear
Chorus
I'm just on the blue side of lonesome
Right next to the Heartbreak Hotel
In a tavern that's known as Three Teardrops
On a bar stool, not doing so well
The floor has a carpet of sorrows
Yet no one can weep in the aisle
And they say someone broke the bar mirror
With only the ghost of a smile
The hands on the clock never alter
For things never change in this place
There's no present, no past, no future
We're the ones who have lost in loves race
Chorus
