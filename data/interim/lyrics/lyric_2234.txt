Yeah
Yo, I'm feeling good right now
Feel I just got my pilot's license or something
Haha, I'm 'bout to take off
I was in them dark days, rolling through the night man
Running from the light rays, I was living sideways
Now I got my sight straight, captain of my life's plane
I'm 'bout to take off, boy I got the flight plan
I got the flight plan, boy I got the flight plan
I'm 'bout to take off, captain of my life's plan
I'm 'bout to take off, I'm 'bout to take off
I'm 'bout to take off, boy I got the flight plan
And I done made it to the bottom of the sky
Nothing left now, but to take it up higher
Spreading my wings and I keep on flying
Rain drops falling, I stay rising
I was in that sinning living, now I linked with Dee-1
You know I got that Mission Vision, living for, uh, The One
I found peace in God, please believe I'm seeking Kingdom things
I was broke and blind, but I been freed and now I'm seeing change
Running in my sleep tryna' chase my dreams
Grab ya jersey, join the team
I'm about to take off, to a land that I call destiny
Flow so cold man I leave this track froze
Always stay working man I'm on my toes
Never giving up, yeah that's my motto
Set a goal, make a plan, then I'm on the road
Running full speed no I won't slow
I'm straight A's, On a roll 
Hear the "tick tick", know I'm 'bout to blow
Matta' fact, "tick tick", Explode!
It's my time now and I'm running the show
Living my life 'cause the Lord in control
His spirit is near, I ain't fearing you
'Cause the Lord got me, so I know I win!
And I really ain't that new to this
Had my fair share of foolishness
But I waste no time, staying on my grind
I'm climbing higher, manifest
I was in them dark days, rolling through the night man
Running from the light rays, I was living sideways
Now I got my sight straight, captain of my life's plane
I'm 'bout to take off, boy I got the flight plan
I got the flight plan, boy I got the flight plan
I'm 'bout to take off, captain of my life's plan
I'm 'bout to take off, I'm 'bout to take off
I'm 'bout to take off, boy I got the flight plan
Take off, can't wait dawg
Devil looking at me like he want a face off
Haters all around, but I ain't scared y'all
I be living life looking like, "Hey y'all!"
Catching what they pitching like I'm playing baseball
Mission Vision, opposite of Ray Charles
Uh, say dawg, I grind hard, but I pray dawg!
Only focused on upgrading, what up God, shut up satan
What up love, shut up hating
What up now, shut up waiting 
Some can't believe this, some won't receive this
But make sure you see this, I'm a slave for Jesus
Yeah, I wanna go deeper than deep
Wanna make my knowledge inspire, wanna rescue any lost sheep
I know my skills are unique, but I know my flesh is so weak
But I know I'm special 'cause He, steady throwing blessing on me
And the devil stressing cause we, going where we destined to be
I want my seat in the sky, just like a nest in a tree
Every chance a lesson to me, you ain't impressive to me
Man the devil had me in bondage, but I'm finally free

I was in them dark days, rolling through the night man

I'm 'bout to take off, boy I got the flight plan
I got the flight plan, boy I got the flight plan
I'm 'bout to take off, captain of my life's plan
I'm 'bout to take off, I'm 'bout to take off
I'm 'bout to take off, boy I got the flight plan
Everybody telling me that I should stay humble
Boy I'm tryna' eat, I'm a beast, this a jungle
And I got cubs to feed so I'm hunting for my dreams
You could either join the team or be the feast, Uh oh
It's time I put my doubts to rest, It's all about the manifest
I claim it, then I aim for it, I can't afford to miss
It's more than a rap career, and I ain't got a thing to fear
Imma' tell the world 'bout the Lord, and make it clear
When I say I'm taking off, that ain't intuition
It's facts, the plane is packed, you either with me, or you isn't
We ain't tryna' be no stars, this ain't no wishing
We some men of God, yeah, and this our mission
I got the flight plan, boy I got the flight plan
I'm 'bout to take off, captain of my life's plane
I'm 'bout to take off, I'm 'bout to take off
3, 2, 1, and off I blast
