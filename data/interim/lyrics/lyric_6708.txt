So sweet you are
Like a shining star
You brighten my whole world
You bring me joy just being my girl
Everything's good about ya
I couldn't live without ya
You're so sweet, you're so fine
I'm so thankful that you're mine
Full of clover bustin' out all over
You're the summer in the park
You're the candle in the dark
And I love ya, so true, yes, I do
You're the love of my life
You're a pure delight
The short time I've been with you
Such happiness I never knew
Everything's good about ya
I couldn't live without ya
You must've come from heaven above
You're the poets meaning of love
You're tender touch means, oh, so much
You're the sunshine after the storm
When I'm cold you make me warm
And I love ya, so true, yes, I do
It's a lonely day and night
And things will be alright
Together just you and me
Just livin' on pure ecstasy
Everything's good about ya
I couldn't live without ya
You are my guiding light
When things go wrong you make them right
This heart inside is bursting with pride
Please let your heart surround me
And always stay around me
I love ya, so true, yes, I do, yeah
Everything's good about ya
I couldn't live without ya
You're so sweet, you're so fine
I'm so thankful that you're mine
Everything's good about you
