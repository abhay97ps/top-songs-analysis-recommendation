It looked like a twist
It moved like a slop
And everytime I see it, boy
I nearly blow my top
She got a walk 
Oh, what a walk 
She gotta catch your eye
When you see her passing by
What a walk
She don't have to dance
The pony or the bop
She cross against the light
And bring the traffic to a stop
She got a walk 
Oh, what a walk 
She doesn't have a notion
What she doing with that motion
What a walk
Yeah, yeah
She really is a big sensation
I'm telling you, she's the most
Oh, the biggest thing to hit the nation
Anywhere from coast to coast
Oh, she wiggle to the left
She wiggle to the right
And you forget the time and place
And everything in sight
She got a walk 
Oh, what a walk 
No one can entertain her
Boy, there isn't any greater
What a walk
Oh, she wiggle to the left
She wiggle to the right
And you forget the time and place
And everything in sight
She got a walk 
Yeah, what a walk 
But if there's any doubt
What I'm talking about
It's very clear to see
That the girl, the crazy little girl
Is a tiny little puppy dog
Walking with me
 ruff, ruff
