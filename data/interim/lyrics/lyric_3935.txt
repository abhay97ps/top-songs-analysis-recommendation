You and me got somethin' 
That I know is good 
You know how to love me, baby
Just the way you should
And when you hold me, baby
I know I can do no wrong
And when I see you standin' there
I know just where I belong, ow
You make me feel so good , good 
You make me feel so good , good 
You make me feel so good , good 
You make me feel so good
I told you when I met you 
That I was going up 
And if you stuck right by me, baby
I'd give you all that fancy stuff
And then you told me "Baby
Well, anything you do is fine
Well, I don't care if we got nothin'
Just as long as you are mine"
You make me feel so good , good 
You make me feel so good , good 
You make me feel so good , good 
You make me feel so good
So good , good 
You make me feel so good , good 
You make me feel so good , good 
You make me feel so good
Well, so good , good 
Whoa, you make me feel so good , good 
You make me feel so good , good 
You make me feel so good
