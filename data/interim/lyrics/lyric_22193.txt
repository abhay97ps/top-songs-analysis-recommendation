Oh yeah, they tell me I’m a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there
Look at her go on the dance floor
She’s amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it goin', girl, like I got an encore
You got me saying...
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl
Go little bad girl
Oh, yeah, they tell me I’m a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there
Shaking her ass from the left to the right
Moving it round just the way that I like
I wanna see you move like a movie on flight
You got it how I want and I want it all night
Look at her go on the dance floor
She’s amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it goin', girl, like I got an encore
You got me saying...
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl
Go little bad girl
She done got my heart jumping
And my adrenaline pumpin' and gunnin'
Like ain’t nobody ever seen
As a matter of fact, I’ve seen this woman all up in my dreams
Whippin' and flippin' and stackin' and slappin'
I’m attacking after she back it up and make it drop
After I meet her I tell her David Guetta’s on the track
Baby girl, don’t stop
Keep it goin', you never know when somebody’s gonna throw a couple dollars
Got a pocket full of hundred dollar bill’s
Ludacris, Mr. Make-a-Woman-Holla
And every night on the floor putting on a show
Everybody in the club, there’s a little something you should know
Look at her go on the dance floor
She’s amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it goin', girl, like I got an encore
You got me saying…
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl
Go little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl
Go little bad girl
