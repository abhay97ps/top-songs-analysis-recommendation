I don't care what they say
I know this is right
Because I feel it deep in my heart
They say we're young and wild
And we should wait for a while
But nothing's gonna keep us apart
But I don't think we're living in sin
So we can't give up, we can't give in
Because our love is strong, and it can't be wrong
Oo and it feels so right
So I'll be sleeping with you tonight
We'll be together tonight
I don't care if it's wrong or right
I'll be sleeping with you
Sleeping with you tonight
So let's give it a try. I know we'll get by
Because our love's enough to see us through
Well if we take a chance, we can make it at last
I know that it's the right thing to do
But I don't think we're living in sin
So we can't give up, we can't give in
Because our love is strong, and it can't we wrong
Oh and it feels so right
So I'll be sleeping with you tonight
We'll be together tonight
I don't care if it's wrong or right
I'll be sleeping with you
Sleeping with you tonight
'Cause our love is so strong
And nothing's gonna keep us apart
Sleeping with you tonight
We'll be together tonight
Well I don't care if it's wrong or right
I'll be sleeping with you
I'll be sleeping with you tonight
We'll be together tonight
