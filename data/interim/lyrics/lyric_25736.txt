You got potential, you got, you
You got potential, you got, you
You got potential 
You got potential, you got, you
Had a few niggas ride or die for me
Tell me, baby, will you slide for me?
Keep the Glock 40, holding it down for me
I know you're good in the hood, bust a couple juugs for me, yeah
When I’m on the low, will you still cover for me?
Blowin' bands to make me feel lovely
When I'm gone, will you still think of me?
I need to know for sure
’Cause you got potential, you got, you
You got potential, you got, you
You got potential 
You got potential, you got, you
Caught my interest, talkin' that shit
So intriguing 
We could go far, go the distance
I could see it 
I'm not tryna be out here with my hopes up
If you all for me, then let me know what's up
Don't change up on me in the long run
Keep it open, one hunnid
'Cause you got potential, you got, you
You got potential, you got, you
You got potential 
You got potential, you got, you
