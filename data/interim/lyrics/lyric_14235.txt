A million young poets screaming out their words
To a world full of people just living to be heard
Future generations, riding on the highways that we built
I hope they have a better understanding
 Going to work on Monday
 Got yourself a family
 All utility bills have been paid
You can't tell your best buddy that you love him
 Where does our time go
 Got a brand new house in escrow
 Sleeping with your back to your loved one
This is all that we've learned about happiness
 Forgot to say hello to my neighbors
 Sometimes I question my own behavior
 Talking about the girls that we've seen on the sly
Just to tell our souls we're still the young lions
 Getting too drunk on Saturdays
 Playing football with the kids on Sundays
 Soaring with the eagles all week long
And this is all that we've learned about living
This is all that we've learned about living
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
A million young poets screaming out their words
Maybe someday those words will be heard
By future generations riding on the highways that we built
Maybe they'll have a better understanding
 Hope they'll have a better understanding
 Maybe they'll have a better understanding
 Maybe they'll have a better understanding
 Hope they have a better understanding
