He was always such a nice boy
The quiet one
With good intentions
He was down for his brother
Respectful to his mother
A good boy
But good don't get attention
One kid with a promise
The brightest kid in school
He's not a fool
Reading books about science and smart stuff
It's not enough, no
'Cause smart don't make you cool, whoa
He's not invisible anymore
With his Father's nine and a broken fuse
Since he walked through that classroom door
He's all over primetime news
Mary's got the same size hands
As Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints
At Manns Chinese Theater Show
She could’ve been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole
Now we'll never know
No, no, no, no, oh
They were crying to the camera
Said he never fitted in
He wasn't welcomed
He showed up to the parties
We was hanging in
Some guys puttin' him down
Bullying him 'round, round
Now I wish I would’ve talked to him
Gave him the time of day
Not turn away
If I would’ve been the one to maybe go this far
He might have stayed at home
Playing angry chords on his guitar
He's not invisible anymore
With his baggy pants and his legs in chains
Since he walked through that classroom door
Everybody knows his name
Mary's got the same size hands 
As Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints 
At Manns Chinese Theater Show
She could’ve been a movie star 
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole
Now we'll never know
Greg was always getting net from 20 feet away 
He had a try out with the Sixers
Couldn't wait for Saturday 
Now we're never gonna see him slam
Flying high as Kobe can
His life was stole 
Oh, now we'll never know
Now we'll never never never know
Mm now we'll never never never never know
Stole 
Oh whoa yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Mary's got the same size hands 
As Marilyn Monroe 
She put her fingers in the imprints
At Mann's Chinese Theater Show 
She could’ve been a movie star 
Never got the chance to go that far 
Her life was stole 
Oh, now we'll never know
Greg was always getting net from 20 feet away 
He had a tryout with the Sixers
Couldn't wait for Saturday
Now we're never gonna see him slam 
Flying high as Kobe can
His life was stole 
Oh now we'll never know
Oh, no, no, no
Yeah their lives were stole
Now we'll never know
We were here all together, yesterday
