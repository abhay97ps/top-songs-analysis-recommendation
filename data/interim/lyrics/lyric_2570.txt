I'm doing this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey, baby, come on
I know that I can't take no more
Baby, bye, bye, bye
Ay
I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held on to
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
You got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up, and then you call right back
But, I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know, right now you can't tell
But stay a while, and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
This love has taken its toll on me
Shе said goodbye too many times beforе
I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk
I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
I'm so done with wishing
You were still here
[Rihanna - Umbrella
When the sun shine, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
You can stand under my umbrella
Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da, do-do
Just dance
Spin that record, babe
Do-do-do-do
Like
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
I'm glad you came
I'm glad you came
And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life, yeah
Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
I'm like 'hey', 'what's up', 'hello'
Seen your pretty ass soon as you came in the door
I just wanna chill, got a sight for us to roll
Married to the money, I ain't ever letting go
I can't stop the feeling
Just dance, dance, dance
Can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance, dance
One, don't pick the phone
You know he only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You have to kick him out
We out here dripping in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here dripping in finesse
You know it, you know
I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And now you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
And I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, you got that yummy yum, that yummy yum, that yummy yummy
Girl, you got that yummy yum, that yummy yum, that yummy yummy
'Cause I'm bored in the house, and I'm in the house bored
Bored in the house, and I'm in the house bored
Ha, ha
