It's just one of those things you put down to experience
Sad sweet dreamer
It's just one of those things you put down to experience
Been another blue day without you girl
Been another sad summer song
Been thinkin' about you girl
AII night long
Been another sad tear on my pillow
Been another memory who told me "You're the one girl"
Been thinkin' about you girl
All night long
Sad sweet dreamer
It's just one of those things you put down to experience
Sad sweet dreamer
It's just one of those things you put down to experience
Been another long night and I missed you girl
Been another story from those endless magazines
Can't help thinkin' about you girl
All night long
Sad sweet dreamer
It's just one of those things you put down to experience
Sad sweet dreamer
It's just one of those things you put down to experience
Was so happy when I found you
But how was I to know
That you would leave me walkin' down the road
Been another hurt love story
Been another man who thought that he was oh so strong
Been thinkin' about you girl
All night long
Sad sweet dreamer
