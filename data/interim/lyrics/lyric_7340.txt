She struts into the room
Well I don't know her
But with a magnifying glance
I just sorta look her over
We have a drink or two
Well, maybe three
And then suddenly, she starts
Telling me her life story, she says
"Baby, if you want to be my lover
You better take me home
Cause it's a long, long way to paradise
And I'm still on my own"
I told her that I came from Detroit City
And I played guitar in a long-haired
Rock and roll band
She asked me why
The singer's name was Alice
I said "Listen baby
You really wouldn't understand"
And I said
"Baby, if you want to be my lover
You better take me home
Cause it's a long, long way to paradise
And I'm still on my own"
On my own
Oh, baby if you want to be my lover
You better take me home
Cause it's a long, long way to paradise
And I'm still on my own, own
