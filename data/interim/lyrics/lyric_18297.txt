Did I ever tell you
How you live in me?
Every waking moment
Even in my dreams?
And if all this talk is crazy
And you don't know what I mean
Does it really matter
Just as long as I believe?
I will love again, though my heart is breaking
I will love again, stronger than before
I will love again, even if it takes a lifetime to get over you
Heaven only knows I will love again
People never tell you
The way they truly feel
I would die for you gladly
If I knew it was for real
So if all this talk sounds crazy
And the words don't come out right
Does it really matter
If it gets me through this night?
I will love again, though my heart is breaking
I will love again, stronger than before
I will love again, even if it takes a lifetime to get over you
Heaven only knows I will love again
If I'm true to myself
Nobody else can take the place of you
But I've got to move on
Tell me what else can I do?
I will love again, though my heart is breaking
I will love again, stronger than before
I will love again, even if it takes a lifetime to get over you
Heaven only knows I will love again
I will love again, I will love again 
One day I know I will love again 
You can't stop me from loving again, breathing again
Feeling again, I know one day I'll love again
