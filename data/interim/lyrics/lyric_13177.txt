You ask me how I can be so sure
My  love for you will endure
Right  here and now
I'll show you how I know
I just take this pen here in my hand
Set  down and equation, understand
By  the time we find the bottom line, you'll see
How much you mean to me
One  plus one is two 
No dividing me and you 
When I'm minus you
There's no solution
It's  as simple as can be 
Like the sum of you and me 
Just the right amounts
And that's what counts
Mathematics 
Night after night, I'm staying up late
Working with my slide rule trying to calculate
The good you've done
What's to come of us
The tears, the talk
The fights, the fun
They're just parts of a puzzle adding up to one
Like a hand or heart
You're a part of me
Let me show you what I mean
One plus one is two 
No dividing me and you 
When I'm minus you
There's no solution
It's as simple as can be 
Like the sum of you and me 
Just the right amounts
And that's what counts
Mathematics 
Once in your life you happened
To Be in the right place at the right time
Three little words
Can change your mind
Four the better 
It's as simple as can be 
Like the sum of you and me 
Just the right amounts
And that's what counts
Mathematics 
One plus one is two 
No dividing me and you 
When I'm minus you
There's no solution
It's as simple as can be 
Like the sum of you and me 
Just the right amounts
And that's what counts
Mathematics 
No dividing me and you 
When I'm minus you
There's no, no solution
It's as simple as can be 
Like the sum of you and me 
Just the right amounts
And that's what counts
