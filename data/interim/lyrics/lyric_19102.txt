Yeah...
Here we go...
It's a new day, but it all feels old
"It's a good life!" That's what I'm told
But every day, it all just feels the same
At my high school, it felt more to me
Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there, it only made me see
That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna to hear the words you say
And I don't ever wanna, I don't ever wanna be
You, don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you
"Go to college or university
Get a real job!" That's what they said to me
But I could never live the way they want
I'm going to get by and just do my time
Out of step while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind
Do you really wanna be like them?
Do you really wanna be another trend?
Do you wanna be part of that crowd?
'Cause I don't ever wanna, I don't ever wanna be
You, don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you
Shake it once, that's fine
Shake it twice, that's okay
Shake it three times
You're playing with yourself again
You, don't wanna be just like you!
What I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me
You, don't wanna be just like you 
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me
Another loser anthem 
Another loser anthem 
Another loser anthem 
Another loser anthem!
