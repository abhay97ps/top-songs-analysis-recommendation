And when the daylight dies, you'll still be there when I close my eyes
And I'll follow - I'll follow you
Run into the midnight blue, you light a torch it cuts right through
And I'll follow - I'm gonna follow you
I see you on the boulevard like a movie star undercover
And now my heart beats like a drummer
If I lose my way tonight I know it's gonna be all right
'Cause I'll follow, follow you
'Cause I'll follow you
If I ever fall behind, you'll be right there to show me a sign
I can follow - I'll follow you
And if you go away, that's where I'll be
A world without you is no place for me
I'm gonna follow you
When I think of you and the things you say
What you choose to keep, what you throw away
You give the word and I won't be afraid
If I lose my way tonight I know it's gonna be all right
'Cause I'll follow, follow you
'Cause I'll follow you
Maybe I'm a fool to put my trust in you
Don't you know my faith is all I have?
When I think of you and the things you say
What you choose to keep, what you throw away
You give the word and I am not afraid
If I lose my way tonight I know it's gonna be all right
'Cause I'll follow, follow you
'Cause I'll follow you
