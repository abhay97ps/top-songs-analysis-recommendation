Friday night, you and your boys went out to eat, oh
Then they hung out
But you came home around three - yes, you did
If six of y'all went out, ah
Then four of you were really cheap
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
I'll pack a bag so you can leave town for a week - yes, I am
The phone rings, and then you look at me
You said it was one of your friends, down on 54th Street, boy
So why did 213
Show up on your Caller I.D.? Oh
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone, than unhappy
I've been through all of this before
I've been through all this before
So how could you think
Don't think about it, don't think about it
That I would stand around and take some more?
Get gone, get gone
Things are gonna change
Things are going to change, baby
'Cause I won't be a fool anymore
You don't stand no chance, boy
That's why you have to leave
I said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So don't turn around to see my face
Don't you turn around
There's no more tears left here for you to see
Was it really worth you going out like that? Tell me
Was it really worth you going out like that?
See, I'm moving on
And I refuse to turn back, yeah
See, all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for  me
It turns out
You were making a fool of me, yeah!
It's not right,  but it's okay 
I'm gonna  make it anyway 
Pack your bags  up and leave 
Don't you dare  come running back to me
It's not right , but it's okay 
I'm gonna make it  anyway
Close the door  behind you
Leave your key 
I'd rather be alone
Than unhappy
