I can't believe it
I never thought I'd see you smile again
Now that I see it
I get that same old feelin' back again
I don't know how long you'll stay
It doesn't matter anyway
I say welcome home
To the love that got away
I got your number
This time I know exactly what to do
Sometimes I wonder 
What made life worth livin' without you 
I don't know how long you'll stay
It doesn't matter anyway
I say welcome home
To the love that got away
Got away
All of those so called love affairs I had before
They only made me think about you more and more
Well I guess they never knew
I was wishing they were you
Woh, they were you
I've got a fever
Nothin' I've done has done a thing for me
I'm a believer 
I believe that love is liberty 
I don't know how long you'll stay
It doesn't matter anyway
I say welcome home
To the love that got away
Got away
