Well, apples dipped in candy
Sweet-potato wine
One is for your belly
And one is for your mind
Day off on Sunday
When the rent is not behind
But that's jus' the way it goes
Lazy Mississippi
Movin' mighty slow
Like that ol' balckbird
Walkin' down the road
Able when the times get rough
To jus' pick up and go
Farther on down the line
Rich man, poor man
Begger or thief
Oh, Lawd, the first ones getcha down the road, brother
Any others getcha grief
The last one getcha ninety days
Of cotton-pickin' peas
Down on the Captain's farm
We got apples dipped in candy
I tell you now, rich man, poor man
Begger or thief
First ones getcha down the road, brother
Any others getcha grief
The last one gets you ninety days
Of cotton-pickin' peas
Down on the Eastham Farm.
Know what I'm talkin' about, Joe?
Well that's the way it goes
Eastham Farm is a state correctional facility in Eastham, Texas.]
