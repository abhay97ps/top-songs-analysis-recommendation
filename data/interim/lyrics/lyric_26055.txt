Once we start a riot, we can't keep quiet
We want all the smoke, fuck the peace signs
All gas, no brakes, we just gon' keep slidin', ayy
Glock cook a nigga, he get deepfried
Snakes in the grass, watch out for rats and all the feline
I cut everybody off, keep hittin' decline
I swear these painkillers got me on a deep vibe
Miss the old days, got me wishin' I could rewind
Make sure my phone on DND, I keep my door closed
I been tryna put the rap game in a chokehold
Diamonds VVS's, Gucci, Cuban, color rose gold
We got weed, pills, and lean by the boatload
Don't stop at red lights, we stuck in go mode
They killin' kids, wonder why the summer so cold
When your face pop up in my head, all I can say is, "Damn"
Don't try to test us in here like we don't ace exams
For one night, she gon' turn up to this song like it's her favorite jam
And I'll slide in that X7 'fore I take the Lam'
Critiquing all my movements, type of shit that make me hate the 'Gram
Know I'm not perfect, just accept me for the way I am
Once we start a riot, we can't keep quiet
We want all the smoke, fuck the peace signs
All gas, no brakes, we just gon' keep slidin', ayy
Glock cook a nigga, he get deepfried
Snakes in the grass, watch out for rats and all the feline
I cut everybody off, keep hittin' decline
I swear these painkillers got me on a deep vibe
Miss the old days, got me wishin' I could rewind
Had to make some plays up in that field, bitch, we got tired of fumblin'
Hidin' them lil' shorties who stepped up like who gon' slide or somethin'?
My niggas won't play, they hawk shit down 'til you get tired of runnin'
He tripped and fell, they stood over him and that nine was dumpin'
Like taco night, we leave them shells sittin' inside your stomach
Story the same, you know the usual, we die for nothin'
I dressed up for too many funerals, I'm tired of comin'
Made it out that shit, but it left scars, I'm still survivin' from it
All them bad thoughts just tore me down, feel like my mind was crumblin'
I just want all this shit figured out, I swear I'm tired of wonderin'
Just 'cause y'all rep the same thang don't mean them guys a hundred
I come from starvin', fightin' cases, now I'm flyin' to London
Once we start a riot, we can't keep quiet
We want all the smoke, fuck the peace signs
All gas, no brakes, we just gon' keep slidin', ayy
Glock cook a nigga, he get deepfried
Snakes in the grass, watch out for rats and all the feline
I cut everybody off, keep hittin' decline
I swear these painkillers got me on a deep vibe
Miss the old days, got me wishin' I could rewind
