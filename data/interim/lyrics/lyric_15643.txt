80 thoughts run through my head
40 things I never said
20 times I lost my shit
But I'll never admit
Hoping that I’ll let this go
Breathe easy as I take control
Tryna let the demons know
They don't belong here
It's hard to think while we all sink
We can’t breathe with all this grief
It's hard to dream while I clean up the pieces
It's hard to think while we all sink
We can't breathe with all this grief
It's hard to dream while I am constantly
Picking up the pieces
Picking up the pieces
Illusions of the life you own
Knowing that I've lost control
Time to let the rivers flow
Tired of all these tears
Letting all the sunlight glow
Life is never fair, it's cold
Feeling like a neon ghost
I don't belong here
It’s hard to think while we all sink
We can’t breathe with all this grief
It's hard to dream while I clean up the pieces
It’s hard to think while we all sink
We can't breathe with all this grief
It's hard to dream while I am constantly
Picking up the pieces
Picking up the pieces
Welcome to my mind
It's paradoxical
I know that you won’t wanna stay
'Cause baby it's an obstacle
To try and play the games I play
To deal with this shit everyday
The tug of war within my heart
The voices that won't fade away
The voices that won't fade away
Welcome to my mind
It's paradoxical
I know that you won't wanna stay
'Cause baby it's an obstacle
To try and play the games I play
To deal with this shit everyday
The tug of war within my heart
The voices that won't fade away
