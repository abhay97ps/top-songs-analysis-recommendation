Oh, oh, woo-hoo
Oh baby, hey baby, woo-hoo, woo, baby, mhm
Doo doo doo hoo ooh
Doo doo doo hoo hoo
Doo doo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Doo doo doo hoo, yeah
If you look into your heart
With a positive mind
Take some inventory
Of your woman and your glory
Leave the bad things behind
Everybody's got a story, yes they do
About love and the good things
But all the spices of your life
You have got to pay the price
If you know what I mean, yeah
I'm telling everybody I know
How a girl becomes so proud
When I thought that there was nothing left
I do believe I found myself
And I wanna give it to you, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah baby
So if you look into your heart
With a positive mind
Go and take some inventory
Of your woman and your glory
Leave the bad things behind
Ooh, I know my man, he really loves me
We don't have that every day
I know my man really needs me
And whatever he wanna do, I wanna do it with you, baby
Hey hey, yeah
Doo doo doo hoo 
Doo doo doo hoo hoo hoo
Doo doo doo hoo 
Doo doo doo goo 
Ah, I wouldn't lie
Love's not an easy game
And it's struggle and strain
Now that I see what he's given me
And whatever he wanna do, I wanna do it with you, baby
Hey baby, loving you more and more and more
And giving you all and all of me, yeah yeah
Mercy, baby
Loving you more, and more, and more
And giving you all and all of me, ooh baby
More, more
Mercy baby, mercy baby, mercy baby
