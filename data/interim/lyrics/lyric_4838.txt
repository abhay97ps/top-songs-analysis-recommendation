I saw a couple of kids, asked em for their car
They said no but then I said we weren’t goin too far
Took em up a hill and then pulled out my gun
I could feel the thrill I shot em just for fun
Robbed a bank yea it didn’t go too well
Double homicide put me in a chair
Little John and Michael they weren’t treated fair
Popped his brains out you shoulda been there
It’s my fault I’m the one that chose this path
You can’t blame it on what happened in my past
You can be a king or a street sweeper
But everyone dances with the grim reaper
Growin up I ain’t get love from my mama
Childhood filled with a bunch of drama
Experiences gave me all this trauma
But I still only kill cause I wanna
I’m insane yea nothing can stop me
The things I do yea they’re pretty shockin
Killing animals is stuff I do often
Shot that boy with my little brother watchin
I took 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 shots and I ran em down
Then I ran em down
Then I ran em down
Then I ran em down
Then I ran em down
Then I ran em down
It took 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 cops just to get me down
Just to get me down
Just to get me down
Just to get me down
Just to get me down
Just to get me down
Nah dawg, it’s not forreal dog
Robert Harris didn’t have a choice to kill dog
His childhood was messed up that’s forreal dog
His mind is messed up he doesn’t have free will dog
Since he was lil dog, it went downhill dog
His mom would squeal dog, her love concealed dog
Barbara harris said he had to kill dog
The way to control his feels dog
That’s why he took those kids up the hill dog
He took 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 shots and he ran em down
Then he ran em down
Then he ran em down
Then he ran em down
Then he ran em down
Then he ran em down
It took 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 cops just to get him down
Just to get him down
Just to get him down
Just to get him down
Just to get him down
Just to get him down
He had a choice, man he had a choice
Harris chose wrong man, he used his own voice
Free Will exists, that boy Harris was bad
You can’t sit there and blame the mom and dad
The choice is always yours, that you can’t deny
What you choose to do is up your own mind
Yes, no, maybe so the choice is up to you
Harris chose to kill, he made that gun go boom
