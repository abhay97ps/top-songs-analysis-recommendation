Ronnie, I know that you're mad at me
So I'm writing this note to ask you, please
Ronnie, call me when you get a chance
There's something I just have to say
I wasn't flirting with Jim
When you saw me with him
I could never hurt you that way
So Ronnie, call me when you get a chance 
And give me a chance to explain
You saw me talking to Joe
But I want you to know
Every other word was your name 
You saw me with some of your buddies
And that was careless of me 
Everything went wrong 
When you came along 
And saw what you weren't supposed to see
So Ronnie, call me when you get a chance 
So you can get everything right
I only met with the guys 
Just to plan a surprise
For your birthday Saturday night
 You saw me with some of your buddies
And that was careless of me 
Everything went wrong 
When you came along 
And saw what you weren't supposed to see
So Ronnie, call me when you get a chance 
So you can get everything right
I only met with the guys 
Just to plan a surprise
For your birthday Saturday night
Ronnie, call me when you get a chance
Ronnie, call me when you get a chance
Ronnie, call me when you get a chance
