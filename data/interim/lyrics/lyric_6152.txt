You followed me to Texas
You followed me to Utah
We didn't find it there
So we moved on
You followed me to Alabama
Things looked good in Burmingham
We didn't find it there
So we moved on
I know your tired
Of following
My elusive dreams and scheems
For there only fleeting things
My elusive dreams
You had my child in Memphus
I heard of work in Nashville
We didn't find it there
So we moved on
To farm in Nebraska
To a gold mine in Alaska
We didn't find it there
So we moved on
And now we've left Alaska
Because there was no gold mine
But this time
Only two of us move on
Now all we have is each other
And a little memory to cling to
And still you won't let me
Go on alone
I know your tired
Of following
My elusive dreams and scheems
For there only fleeting things
My elusive dreams
For there only fleeting things
My elusive dreams
