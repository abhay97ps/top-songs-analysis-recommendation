Your technique
It leaves me weak
My heart knows
It's the beat I seek
And I found it
Oh yes, I found it
I never worry
That your love is fake
I'm free and easy
And I'm feeling jake
'Cause I found it
Oh boy, I found it
'Cause I never felt
This way before
Like a dog always
Begging for more, yeah
I've been fooled
By love so many times
I gave up all the silly rhymes
Kept my feelings
All inside my heart
A locked door
No key was cut
There was no fit
Now I'm such a very lucky guy
Gang way one side now
Come on here me say
We found the answer
And it's plain to see
I'm for you and you're for me
'Cause I found it
Together we found it
I feel a quiver
Every time we kiss
The sky's the limit
With a love like this
'Cause I found it
Together we found it
'Cause I never felt
This way before
Like a dog always
Begging for more, yeah
I've been fooled
By love so many times
I gave up all the silly rhymes
Kept my feelings
All inside my heart
A locked door
No key was cut
There was no fit
Now I'm such a very lucky guy
Gang way one side now
Come on here me say
We found the answer
And it's plain to see
I'm for you and you're for me
'Cause I found it
