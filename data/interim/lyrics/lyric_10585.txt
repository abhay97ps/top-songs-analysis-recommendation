Across the crowded disco room
Through a maze of dancing people
She sits so quiet and all alone
Wanting to catch the disco fever
And as she raised up her head
Her eyes caught mine
And that was all that I needed
In her eyes I saw the need for love
So warm, soft and feeling
'Cause we made
Eye to eye contact
Eye to eye contact 
Eye to eye contact 
Eye to eye contact
You and me
I was looking at you
You were looking at me
I was looking at you
Girl
Across the crowded disco room
Oh, your eyes told me the story
My heart was beating like a drum
As I fought my way over
I never took my eyes away from yours
Not even for a moment
What I saw in your eyes made me realize
Yeah, yeah
Eye to eye contact 
Eye to eye contact 
Eye to eye contact
Eye to eye contact
You and me
I was looking at you
You were looking at me
I was looking at you
You were looking at me
Oh, girl
Hey, lady
What's your name?
Now that I'm close to you
I don't know what to do
I mighta been safer
Across the room
Girl, but I got to say something
I got to let you see, oh

Eye to eye contact 
Eye to eye contact 
Eye to eye contact 
Eye to eye contact
You and me
