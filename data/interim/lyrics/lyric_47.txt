He's got a house made of glass
Got his own swimming pool
We've got a one room shack
Five by six by the railroad track
What about us, what about us?
Don't wanna cause no fuss
But what about us
He's with a beautiful chick
Every night of the week
We're two poor hung up souls
Girls won't touch with ten foot poles
What about us, what about us?
Don't wanna cause no fuss
But what about us
He goes to eat at the Ritz
Big steaks
We eat our hominy grits
From a bag
He's got a car made of suede
With a black leather top
If we go out on dates
We go in a box on our roller skates
What about us, what about us?
Don't wanna cause no fuss
But what about us
He goes to eat at the Ritz
Big steaks
We eat our hominy grits
From a bag
He's got a car made of suede
With a black leather top
If we go out on dates
We go in a box on our roller skates
What about us, what about us?
Don't wanna cause no fuss
But what about us
What about us, what about us
