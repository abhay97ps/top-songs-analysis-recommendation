Honey said she want somebody break her off proper 
Man, she so relentless so nothing can stop her 
Never left the city  but she swear she's a yardie 
Because it's so awesome how she move her body 
She do the sangria wine , sangria wine 
Moving side to side , front and behind 
Sangria wine , sangria wine 
Sangria wine , do the sangria wine 
Move it, I move it
Move my body like it is a pipe
Tutti Frutti, is all that I got
Counter-clockwise, I'm mixin' it up 
Sip it, sip it, I'll bet that you blush
Yo sé, yo sé, yo sé, yo sé que tú quieres mi cuerpo, eh
Y quieres controlar mi mente, eh
Y todo el mundo quiere ser dueño de ella
Pero nadie puede, ¡ay!

Let's float around like the fruit at the top 
In Miami, where winters are hot
Yo sé, yo sé, yo sé, yo sé que tú quieres mi cuerpo, eh
Y quieres controlar mi mente, eh
Y todo el mundo quiere ser dueño de ella
Pero nadie puede, ¡ay!
