Oh, look there you go again, puttin' on that smile again
Even though I know you've had a bad day
Doin' this  an' doin' that, always puttin' yourself last
A whole lotta give and not enough take
But you can only be strong so long before you break
So, fall, go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine, I'll catch you
Every time you...
Fall, go on and lose it all
Every doubt, every fear
Every worry, every tear
I'm right here
Baby fall
Forget about the world tonight
All that's wrong and all that's right
Lay your head on my shoulder and let it fade away
And if you wanna let go, baby, it's okay
Fall, go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine, I'll catch you
Every time you...
Fall, go on and lose it all
Every doubt, every fear
Every worry, every tear
I'm right here
Baby fall
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
To me
Fall, go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine, I'll catch you
Every time you...
Fall, go on and lose it all
Every doubt, every fear
Every worry, every tear
I'm right here
Baby fall
