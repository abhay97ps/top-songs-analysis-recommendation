Look, up in the sky! It's a bird!
It's a plane!
Nooo! It's Superman!
Superman, I love you Superman
Do it to them, Superman
We love you, Superman
Superman, we love you Superman
Do it to them, Superman
We need you, Superman
Superman, you make me feel like the queen of the world
Superman, you make me feel so special when
You're zooming up and down around
You're flying oh so high and wow!
You lift me up your super bad
I wanna shout again and again
Superman, we love you Superman
Do it to them, Superman
We love you, Superman
Superman, you make me feel like the queen of the world
Superman, you make me feel so special when
You're zooming up and down around
You're flying oh so high and wow!
You lift me up your super bad
I wanna shout again and again
Superman, we love you Superman
Do it to them, Superman
We need you, Superman
Superman, I love you Superman
Do it to them, Superman
I love you, Superman
FADE:
Superman, I love you Superman
