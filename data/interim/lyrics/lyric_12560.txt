Life felt so right, I was drowned in your light
With the world so in tune 'til you made me out for a fool
Left with nothing to do, can't forget about you
With my heart in my hands, pack my bags, leave the memories with you
You gave me nothing but misery
I found so much more
You used me, oh so helplessly
I don't want your sympathy
Why me? Why me? Why me
When I was the one who could set your heart free?
Why me? Why me? Why me?
You took all the love I gave up selfishly
Why me?
Trapped in your space, never thought I could face
Going one step beyond when I knew deep inside I was strong
Now I know what it takes, can't repeat the mistakes
When new love comes along, it'll give me what I'll call my own
