Silver moon
Shining on my bed
Beside my pillow
Light the pathway
To bring that man
To me
Oh, ooh
Something tells me
My words are going straight to his heart
And ooh, something tells me
You will be all mine
Baby, come to me
'Cause I love you
Thinking of you, oh
Baby, come to me
Gotta have you
You got it going on
You're turning me on
Baby, come to me
Know a secret
How to make you want me
How to make you love me
Whoa, oh...
'Cause the moon above
It's a friend of mine
And she'll make you burn
Said, ooh, ooh
Something tells me
The fire's going right up your spine
Whoa, ooh, something tells me
You will be all mine
Baby, come to me
'Cause I love you
Thinking of you, oh
Baby, come to me
Gotta have you, yeah
You got it going on
You're turning me on
Baby, come to me
Whoa, oh, yeah
Come on, baby
You know what I want
That's it
Come a little closer, baby
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Something's telling me, yeah
Fire's going right up your spine
And ooh, ooh, something's tells me, yeah
You will be all mine
Baby, come to me
'Cause I love you
Thinking of you
Oh, oh, yeah
Baby, come to me
Gotta have you
You got it going on
You're turning me on
Baby, come to me

Ooh, baby, I need you
