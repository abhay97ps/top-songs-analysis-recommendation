She was precious like a flower
She grew wild, wild but innocent
A perfect prayer in a desperate hour
She was everything beautiful, and different
Stupid boy, you can't fence that in
Stupid boy, it's like holding back the wind
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice and that's what happens
When the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
Stupid boy
So what made you think you could take a life
And just push it, push it around
I guess to build yourself up so high
You had to take her and break her down
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice and that's what happens
When the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
You stupid boy
Oh, you always had to be right
But now you've lost the only thing that ever made you feel alive
You stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice and that's what happens
When the only voice she hears, is telling her she can't
You stupid boy, oh
Is the same old same old stupid boy
It took a while for her to figure out she could run
But when she did, she was long gone, long gone
