How did I ever let you slip away
Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more
Ever since you closed the door
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darling you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darling you, you'd still be mine
Funny, funny how time goes by
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye
Why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering
When every day I pray please come back to me
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darling you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darling you, you'd still be mine
And you had enough love for the both of us
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darling you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darling you, you'd still be mine
Oh I'd never hurt you 
Never do you wrong 
And never leave your side 
If I could turn back the hands
There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you 
Forever honest and true to you 
If you accept me back in your heart, I love you 
Oh oh, that would be my will
Darling I'm begging you to take me by the hands
I'm going down, yes I am
Down on my bended knee, yeah
And I'm gonna be right there until you return to me
 Oh oh oh
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall
Then I'd come to realize how much I love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
