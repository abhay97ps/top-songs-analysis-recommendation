Haven't seen you in a long time baby
We haven’t shared a cup of coffee who knows when
And though there's been a lot of changes
Everything is still the same
And it feels so good just to hold you again
It's gonna be alright now
It’s gonna be alright now
Gonna make up for the past we left behind
I've been living without you baby
But I never did doubt you baby
And I know that we can make it this time
Never had a chance to tell you so long
I never should have let my tears stand in my way
Maybe I'm a little bit older
Just a little wiser too
Welcome home my love
Let's begin from today
It's gonna be alright now
It's gonna be alright now
Gonna make up for the past we left behind
I've been living without you baby
But I never did doubt you baby
And I know that we can make it this time
It's gonna be alright now
It’s gonna be alright now
Gonna make up for the past we left behind
I’ve been living without you baby
But I never did doubt you baby
And I know that we can make it this time
It's gonna be alright now
It’s gonna be alright now
Gonna make up for the past we left behind
