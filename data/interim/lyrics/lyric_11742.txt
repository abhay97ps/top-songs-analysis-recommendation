In the airport lounge she sat in a fancy feathered hat
The grandest lady I had ever seen
Outside the heavy rains had grounded all the planes
So I asked her if she'd like some company
In my rhinestone studded suit, My cowboy hat and boots
I must have been a sight to see
But she said "Pull up a chair," as she fumbled with her hair
A more unlikely pair you'll never see
I was Mogen David wine, she was Chabls Fifty-nine
But there we sat, the cowboy and the lady
She was evenings at the opera and summers in Paree
I was Grand Ole Opry, Nashville, Tennessee
The cowboy and the lady
As diff'rent as could be
But it seemed so right that rainy night in Tennessee
And somewhere in between her Harvey's Bristol Creme
And the beer I drank and the easy company
We somehow came together for a night of stormy weather
Now there's a little bit of class in this old cowboy
And there's a little bit of cowboy in the lady
The cowboy and the lady
As diff'rent as could be
But it seemed so right that rainy night in Tennessee
We somehow came together for a night of stormy weather
Now there's a little bit of class in this old cowboy
And there's a little bit of cowboy in the lady
