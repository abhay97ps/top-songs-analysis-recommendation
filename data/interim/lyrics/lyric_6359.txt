Hey, have you ever tried
Really reaching out for the other side?
I may be climbing on rainbows
But baby, here goes
Dreams
They're for those who sleep
Life is for us to keep
And if you're wondering
What this all is leading to
I want to make it with you
I really think that we could make it, girl
No, you don't know me well
And every little thing
Only time will tell
If you believe the things that I do
And we'll see it through
Life can be short or long
Love can be right or wrong
And if I chose the one
I'd like to help me through
I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we could make it, girl

Baby, you know that
Dreams
