Hope is an anchor and love is a ship
Time is the ocean and life is a trip
You don't know where you're going
'Til you know where you're at
And if you can't read the stars
Well, you'd better have a map
A compass and a conscience
So you don't get lost at sea
Or on some old lonely island
Where no one wants to be
From the beginning of creation
I think our maker had a plan
For us to leave these shores
And sail beyond the sand
And let the good light guide us
To the waves and the wind
To the beaches in a world
Where we have never been
And we'll climb up on the mountain y'all
We'll let our voices ring
And those who've never tried it
They'll be the first to sing
Oh, my, my
I'll see you on the other side if I make it
And it might be a long hard ride, but I'm gonna take it
Sometimes it seems that I don't have a prayer
Let the weather take me anywhere
But I know that I want to go
Where the streets are gold 'cause you'll be there
Oh, my, my
You don't bring nothin' with you here
And you can't take nothin' back
I ain't never seen a hearse with a luggage rack
So I've torn my knees a-prayin'
Scarred my back from falling down
Spent so much time flying high
'Til I'm face first in the ground
So if you're up there watching me
Would you talk to God and say
Tell him I might need a hand
To see you both someday
Oh, my, my
So I'll see you on the other side if I make it
And it might be a long hard ride, but I'm gonna take it
Sometimes it seems that I don't have a prayer
Let the weather take me anywhere
But I know that I want to go
Where the streets are gold 'cause you'll be there
Oh, my, my
'Cause you'll be there
Oh, my, my
