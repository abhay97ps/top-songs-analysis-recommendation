Blue and black, heart torn out
You uncover what’s beneath my skin
There and back
There’s no doubt your touch is my medicine
I’ll be ok, cause you heal me
And I give you all my pieces broken
In your hands, there’s nothing that you can’t fix
My heart is frayed, my scars are open
So put me back together now, stitch by stitch
Put me back together now, stitch by stitch
What you say, without words
Resuscitates what was numb inside
So repair me every thread of me
'Cause you’re bringing me back to life
I’ll be okay, 'cause you heal me
And I give you all my pieces broken
In your hands, there’s nothing that you can’t fix
My heart is frayed, my scars are open
So put me back together now stitch by stitch
I’m still afraid of fallin'
Somehow it's takin' over me
Don't ever let me let it go
There and back
There’s no doubt
Your touch makes me whole again
And I give you all my pieces broken
In your hands, there’s nothing that you can’t fix
My heart is frayed, my scars are open
Put me back together now, stitch by stitch
Put me back together now, stitch by stitch
So put me back together now, stitch by stitch
