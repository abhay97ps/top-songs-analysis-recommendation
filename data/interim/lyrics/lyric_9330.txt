You don't know me but I'm your brother
I was raised here in this living hell
You don't know my kind in your world
Fairly soon, the time will tell
Oh, you, telling me the things
You're gonna do for me
I ain't blind and I don't like
What I think I see
Taking it to the streets
No more need for running
Take this message to my brother
You will find him everywhere
Wherever people live together
Tied in poverty's despair
Oh, you, telling me the things
You're gonna do for me
I ain't blind and I don't like
What I think I see
Taking it to the streets
No more need for running
Taking it to the streets
Oh, you, telling me the things
You're gonna do for me
I ain't blind and I don't like
What I think I see
Taking it to the streets
No more need for running
Yeah, yeah
Taking it to the streets
Before it steps farther
Oh, lord
Taking it, taking it
Hey, yeah ha
Taking it to the streets
No more need for running
No more need for hiding
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No more
Yeah, yeah
Taking it, taking it
