There's a man in the funny papers we all know
He lives 'way back a long time ago
He don't eat nothin' but a bear cat stew
Well, this cat's name is-a Alley-Oop
He got a chauffeur that's a genuine dinosaur
And he can knuckle your head before you count to four
He got a big ugly club and a head full of hay-uh
Like great big lions and grizzly bears
 He's the toughest man there is alive
 Wearin' clothes from a wildcat's hide
 He's the king of the jungle jive
He rides thru the jungle tearin' limbs offa trees
Knockin' great big monstas dead on their knees
The cats don't bug him cuz they know bettah
Cuz he's a mean motah scootah and a bad go-gettah
 He's the toughest man there is alive
 Wears clothes from a wildcat's hide
 He's the king of the jungle jive
There he goes
Look at that cave man go
He sure is hip ain't he
Like what's happening
He's too much
Ride, Daddy, ride
Hi-yo dinosawruh
Ride, Daddy, ride
Get 'em, man
