Told you to walk away
That was my first and last mistake
I blew without your faith
Oh, what can I do?
Cause I'm just a sinking ship
And you're just a pair of lips
That I've lost in the moment
All I want is for you to come back
Now I'm caught
In the middle of life
And I need
I need you to survive
Survive 
Survive
I need you to survive 
Cause without you by my side
I can't survive
I need you to survive
Cause without you by my side
I can't survive
And this can't be the end
I won't just settle for being your friend
Our broken bond is not too late to mend
But what can I do?
Cause I'm just a sinking ship
And you're just a pair of lips
That I've lost in the moment
All I want is for you to come back
Now I'm caught
In the middle of life
And I need
I need you to survive
She said, "Boy, won't you walk right"
So I can give you one more chance
You're only living in your damn head
, Mmm
, Yeah
Yeah, cause without you by my side
I can't survive
I need you to survive
, Mmm
Cause without you by my side
I can't survive
, Mmm
Yeah, cause without you by my side
I can't survive
