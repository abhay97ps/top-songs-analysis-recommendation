I would walk ten miles on my hands and knees
Ain't no doubt about it baby, it's you I aim to please
I'd wrestle with a lion and a grizzly bear
It's my life baby but I don't care
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
For you baby I would swim the sea
Nothin' I'd do for you that's too tough for me
I'd put out a burnin' building with a shovel and dirt
And not even worry about getting hurt
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
I'd work twenty four hours, seven days a week
Just so I could come home and kiss your cheek
I'll love you in the mornin' and I'll love you at noon
I'll love you in the night and take you to the moon
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
I'd lay in a pile of burnin' money that I've earned
And not even worry about getting burned
I'd climb the Empire State, fight Muhammad Ali
Just to have you baby close to me
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
