Uishi kwa muda mrefu mfalme
Yeah, yeah, and the wind is talkin'
Yeah, yeah, for the very first time
With a melody that pulls you towards it
Paintin' pictures of paradise
Sayin' rise up
To the light in the sky, yeah
Watch the light lift your heart up
Burn your flame through the night, woah
Spirit, watch the heavens open 
Yeah
Spirit, can you hear it callin'? 
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, and the water's crashin'
Trying to keep your head up high
While you're trembling, that's when the magic happens
And the stars gather by, by your side
Sayin' rise up
To the light in the sky, yeah
Let the light lift your heart up
Burn your flame through the night, yeah
Spirit, watch the heavens open 
Yeah
Spirit, can you hear it callin'? 
Yeah
Your destiny is comin' close
Stand up and fi-i-ight
So go into that far off land
And be one with the Great I Am, I Am
A boy becomes a man, woah
Spirit, watch the heavens open 
Yeah
Spirit, can you hear it callin'? 
Yeah
Spirit, yeah, watch the heavens open, open
Yeah
Spirit, spirit, can you hear it callin'? 
Yeah
Your destiny is comin' close
Stand up and fi-i-i-ight
So go into a far off land
And be one with the Great I Am
