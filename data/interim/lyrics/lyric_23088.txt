Rocket number nine take off to the planet, to the planet 
Aphrodite lady seashell bikini, garden panty 
Let’s blast off to a new dimension, in your bedroom 
Aphrodite lady seashell bikini, get with me 
I can't help the way I’m feeling
Goddess of love, please take me to your leader
I can't help, I keep on dancing
Goddess of love, goddess of love
Take me to your planet 
Take me to your planet 
Take me to your leader 
Your leader, your leader 
Take me to your planet 
Take me to your planet 
Take me to your Venus 
Your Venus, Your Venus 
When you touch me I die just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Cause you're out of this world, galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love 
Have an oyster, baby, it's Aphrod-ishy, act sleazy 
Worship to the land, a girl from the planet, to the planet
I can't help the way I’m feeling
Goddess of love, please take me to your leader
I can't help, I keep on dancing
Goddess of love, goddess of love
Take me to your planet 
Take me to your planet 
Take me to your leader 
Your leader, your leader 
Take me to your planet 
Take me to your planet 
Take me to your Venus 
Your Venus, Your Venus 
When you touch me, I die just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Cause you're out of this world, galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Goddess of love, wonder if this could be love 
Neptune, go
Now serve Pluto!
Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury, Venus 
Uranus, don’t you know my ass is famous?
Mars, now serve for the gods
Earth, serve for the stars
When you touch me, I die just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Cause you're out of this world, galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Goddess of love, wonder if this could be love
