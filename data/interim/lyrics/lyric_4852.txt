Susan, looks like I'm losing
I'm losing my mind
I'm wasting my time
Susan, do you
Have to be confusing
I ask myself why
You're saying goodbye
No other girl could ever
Take the place of you
Though you're hurting me
You know I'll always
Be thinking of you
Girl, I love you
No other girl could ever
Take the place of you
Though you're hurting me
You know I'll always
Be thinking of you
Girl, I love you
Love, love, love, love
I love you, yes, I do, I do
I love you, yes, I do, I do
Susan, I love you
Oh, Susan, I love you
My Susan, I love you
My Susan, I love you
