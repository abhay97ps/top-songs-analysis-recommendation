If you can hear me
And know that I'm right here
I heard your heartbeat
It took away the fear
'Cause my life is sliding
I tried to ride the wave
It came down crashing, it's time to start again
Backwards to go forward
Left at every corner
Been there and back again
And when the music ends
Your life is a flashback
A question, a photograph
A statement, a story, a struggle
A chance to laugh
'Cause if you don't laugh you cry
A last crescendo when you die
So hit the rewind and listen
It's the playback
The soundtrack to your life
First step, your last breath
Everything's been planned
There's questions and answers
You'll never understand
I hold on but let go
Give you room to breathe
Remember the best things
Were never mine to keep
Starting at the ending
You won't break while your bending
Been there and back again
And when the music ends
Your life is a flashback
A question, a photograph
A statement, a story, a struggle
A chance to laugh
'Cause if you don't laugh you cry
A last crescendo when you die
So hit the rewind and listen
It's the playback
The soundtrack to your life
Soundtrack to your life
That it goes by like a bullet
And my name
It may be different than yours
But we are the same
Beat up broken back for more
I'll be dragging my own ass off the floor
I've throw myself right in it
What's the point if you don't live it
If you can hear me
And know that I'm right here
I heard your heartbeat
It took away the fear
Your life is a flashback
A question, a photograph
A statement, a story, a struggle
A chance to laugh
'Cause if you don't laugh you cry
A last crescendo when you die
So hit the rewind and listen
It's the playback
The soundtrack to your life
