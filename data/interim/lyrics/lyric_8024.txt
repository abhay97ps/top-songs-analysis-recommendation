Just seventeen, everything that you've seen
It's all there in her eyes
So many years of her poor mama's tears
And her daddy's sweet lies
There's nobody home
Mary-Anne's alone
Almost fully grown
And worrying the whys
Jimmy's been down, he's been out and around
And he knows where it's at
Love to be good if he thought that he could
But it isn't like that
He don't make mistakes
What he makes, he takes
Jimmy gets all the breaks
'Cause he knows how
Jimmy loves Mary-Anne
Jimmy wants to be her man
Jimmy loves Mary-Anne
She thinks it's all right
She's not alone and she picks up the phone
And she hears Jimmy say
Mother I'm beat, I'm so sick of the street
Feel like running away
There's no life here at all
The city seems so small
There's sweeter music calling us away
Let it play
Jimmy loves Mary-Anne
Jimmy wants to be her man
Jimmy loves Mary-Anne
She thinks it's all right
This big dollar town, it can drag you right down
If you go it alone
Even the strong don't survive very long
When they're out on their own
Jimmy knows it's true
Mary-Anne knows it too
They can see each other through
If they hold on
Jimmy loves Mary-Anne
Jimmy wants to be her man
Jimmy loves Mary-Anne
She thinks it's all right
Jimmy loves Mary-Anne
Jimmy wants to be her man
Jimmy loves Mary-Anne
She thinks it's all right
