Baby, listen to me
If I had the chance
I’d say the words
Come on
The bluest of blue
That’s what her eyes are
That’s what I am today
And if I had it all to do all over again
I wouldn’t have waited so long to say
I can’t live without you
Don’t want nobody else
Baby, listen very closely
I love you
I couldn’t lie, she couldn’t wait
I love you came too late
I’d give my life for yesterday
I love you came too late
I should’ve seen the signs
Paid her more attention
But I pushed her love away
So she found someone to give her what she needed
Somebody else not afraid to say
I can’t live without you
Don’t want nobody else
Baby, listen very closely
I love you
I couldn’t lie, she couldn’t wait
I love you came too late
I’d give my life for yesterday
I love you came too late
I can’t live without you
Don’t want nobody else
My heart is in my head
I took a good look at myself
If I had another chance
I’d shout it out to you
The words “I love you”
I couldn’t lie, she couldn’t wait
I love you came too late
I’d give my life for yesterday
I love you came too late
I couldn’t lie, she couldn’t wait
I love you came too late
I’d give my life for yesterday
I love you came too late
I couldn’t lie, she couldn’t wait
I love you came too late
I’d give my life for yesterday
