I walk alone
Where once we wandered
It seems so strange
That you are gone
Until you return
I'll stay the same, dear
I'll still be true
And walk alone
The flame of love
Is brightly burnin'
You know that I'm
Your very own
Until you return
I'll stay the same, dear
And I'll still be true
And walk alone
The flame of love
Is brightly burnin'
You know that I'm
Your very own
Until you return
I'll stay the same, dear
I'll still be true
And walk alone
