You promised me things that meant a lot
Said so much you just up and forgot
What you said to me, about me
You said, I was your strength, the air you breathe
So, help me, honey, you're all I need
To make my life complete
Oh, yes, you did
So then
Why, why don't you, baby?
Make me the woman you go home to
And not the one you leave behind
Not the one you left to cry
With a smile, I fix your evening meals
Iron your clothes, it ain't no big deal
It's all a part of loving you
Stick by your side through thick and thin
Not laying awake to, ask where you been
Cause you'd tell me if you wanted to
Oh, yeah
So, why, why don't you, baby?
Make me the woman you go home to
And not the one you leave behind
Not that one that's left to cry and cry
Make me the woman
You go home to
Make me yours and you'll be mine to keep
So full of joy, you wouldn't need to be
On the other side of town
Fooling around
 is all you get
Knowing this, you will never regret
Finding yourself all around
So
Why? Why?
Oh, good God Almighty, boy
And not that one that you leave behind
Not the one that's left to cry and cry
I don't, I don't know what you want
Make me your woman, oh, baby
Oh, I don't know why
