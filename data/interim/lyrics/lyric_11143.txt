When I'm down, you're always there just to see me through
You understand everything that I do
It's not a wonder that I care for you
And so babe, it's only fair we should hold on tight
Please be careful just to follow the light
I promise everything will be alright
Oh, there ain't nothing sadder than missing so the one you love
And there ain't nothing truer than thoughts of love I'm thinking of
When you're down, I will be there, you can count on me
It's just so easy anyone can see it's not a wonder that you care for me
Oh, there ain't nothing sadder than missing so the one you love
And there ain't nothing truer than thoughts of love I'm thinking of
When I'm down, you're always there just to see me through
You understand everything that I do
It's not a wonder that I care for you
Oh no it's not a wonder that I care
