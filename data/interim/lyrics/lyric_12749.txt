Strange
Ow
Fine lady
Ow
I like the way she walks, I like the way she talks
As she turns me on with a special concern
Now, I'm a different guy, and I don't compare to many
But next to her I'm plain ordinary
Not many can see the light blue aura
That surrounds the girl wherever in the world
She's a nine, a ten, a twenty-fifth
She's bittersweet and a taco treat
 And I like it
 Just the way she is
 Walking down the avenue
 Always doing something new
She's the kind of person everybody knows
She reeks distinction from head to toe
She's my Twilight Zone, my Al Capone
She's my Rolling Stones and my Eva Per√≥n
 Yes, I like it
 The way she wears her hair
 Mmm, mmm
In room 123, she's elusive, you see
Like the invisible man in drag
And when you come to meet her, you'll never greet her
She'll be waving her skirt as a flag
Like the cold in October, she'll take you right over
It's not mean to be facetious
And that look in her eye says you're the guy
She plans to spend this evening with
 And I like it 
 Just the way she is 
 Walking down the avenue 
 Always doing something new
No, no-no, no-no
Knock me off my feet
