I'd sell my soul just to see your face
And I'd break my bones just to heal your pain
In these times I need a saving grace
But time is running out and I'm starting to lose my faith
But if I told you I loved you, would it make you wanna stay?
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you, and making you walk away
And if I wrote you a love song, and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay?
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?
My heart's on my sleeve, but it's turning black
Without your touch, I'm not gonna last
It feels like my walls are caving in
And I'll do anything to have you here again
But if I told you I loved you, would it make you wanna stay?
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you, and making you walk away
And if I wrote you a love song, and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay?
Yeah, the days are cold, the nights are long
And I can't stand to be alone
Please know this is not your fault
And all I want is to tell you I love you, and make you wanna stay
There's gotta be a way
'Cause goin' on without you is killing me everyday
And if I wrote you a love song, and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay?
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?
