I started writing just to get respect
Playing with words the same way gangbangers play with they tecs
Perplexed about death
Is life beautiful or a threat
By god
To show us that we ain’t shit
Since the day we met
Bunch of degenerates degrading with each generation
Pay attention to what’s happening in your surrounding
Shit, how is it sounding
Is the bass thick
Chilling with the homes is how I
Kicks it
Higher than the snare so miss me with that bullshit
Highjack a bank quick like a high hat
Than dip
Money in my pocket
Elevated rocket
Power
I just got it
Since I was a kid
Huh
Men i’m trynna get rich
I Don’t front nigga 
If You know what you want
Scream what you want nigga 
Scream it loud and clear
So they can hear it over there
Over here
Men i’m trynna get rich 
Men i’m trynna get rich
I don’t front nigga 
If you know what you want
Scream what you want nigga 
Scream it loud and clear
So they can hear it
Over there
Over here
Men i’m trynna get rich 
Yo, y’all must not know who raised me 
As a shorty my role model was Jay Z
Til I found out my dad saved millions in Haiti
And I ain’t talking money
I’m talking humanity
That’s why humility flows in my genes
But not humble enough to tell you yo chicks wants what’s in my jeans
Lean back
Style phat
Meet Joe Black
Motherfucks, you don’t want me to attack
You lack crack in your lyrical acrobats
I’m Simone Bills and the balance beam is the track
Black excellence
No arrogance
Check the influence in the history
I don’t need to prove our competence 
But
Men i’m trynna get rich
I Don’t front nigga 
If You know what you want
Scream what you want nigga 
Scream it loud and clear
So they can hear it over there
Over here
Men i’m trynna get rich 
Men i’m trynna get rich
I don’t front nigga 
If you know what you want
Scream what you want nigga 
Scream it loud and clear
So they can hear it over there
Over here
Men i’m trynna get rich 
Trapped in the system
So I rap just to diss them
This men can withstand the quicksand
Stand with henchmen
And we blend in
Like the first black players in the NBA sitting on the bench
Damn
Renegades with grenades trapped in our vocals
This street language is very colloquial
See the focal
Of the bigger picture
We writing scriptures
Before our life sentence dances in a slow entrance
Yeah, in retrospect
I should unload the tec in your neck
And let you dissect what inspector deck meant
When he said protect your
Questions with no mark
So we spark
In the dark
One love to you know who  if I let my dogs bark
Huh
Men i’m trynna get rich
I Don’t front nigga 
If You know what you want
Scream what you want nigga 
Scream it loud and clear
So they can hear it over there
Over here
Men i’m trynna get rich 
Men i’m trynna get rich
I don’t front nigga 
If you know what you want
Scream what you want nigga 
Scream it loud and clear
So they can hear it over there
Over here
Men i’m trynna get rich
