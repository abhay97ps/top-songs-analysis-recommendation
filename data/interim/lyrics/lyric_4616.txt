It wasn't all that long ago that you sat weaving dreams
But things don't look so rosy now you're this side of eighteen
It wasn't all that long ago you gazed up at the stars
And smiled 'cause you know just who you are
Suddenly the good time's gone and I just don't know why
And where did all the good times go, they never said goodbye
Well there's too much damn pollution here and I don't see no stars
Look in the mirror, say I don't know who you are
But you've had much colder nights
And things will be alright
Alright
And is it meant to set me free to know you're leaving town?
To have no fear you'll disappear and I won't see you around
Well it doesn't make me happy and it doesn't make me smile
Because my heart don't take no notice of the miles
And you can call me stupid and you can call me naïve
But I don't think that things will be that different when you leave
I've had you sitting next to me and being miles away
I think I'd be no better off if you would stay
If I got down on my knees
Asked you to set me free
You'd say no
So take me and break me darling, do what you will
Feed upon my dignity and leave me with the bill
If we're honest, you never really did anything else
But you're my kryptonite and that's something I can't help
But I'll get strong and I'll move on without too many scars
Learn to tell the difference between aeroplanes and stars
You'll get old and still more cold and see the reason that you hid
Was I loved you in a way that no one did
If I cried my eyes red raw
Till I could cry no more
And what for
It wasn't all that long ago you understood the rules
Of love and life and unrequited underdogs and fools
But that was all before the last straw left you on the floor
And you don't understand a thing anymore
But you played the cards you're dealt
However hard it felt
And you smiled into the sky
As you began to cry
And you knew why
And you knew why
