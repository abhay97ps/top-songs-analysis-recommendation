So, you're breakin' my heart
Takin' my sunshine from me
Knowing that I'm to blame
Darling, there's nothing that I can say
Darling, I've got to try
'Cause in my heart I know that I
I'll always love you
I'll always love you, baby
Darling, return my love
No matter where you go
Sometimes a man
Has too much pride to see
But losing your love, my darling
Has opened my eyes for me
Darling, you're going away
Hurts me more and more each day
I'll always love you
I'll always love you, baby
Darling, return my love
No matter where you go
Though you're leavin' me behind
Girl, you'll never be out of my mind
I'll always love you
I'll always love you, baby
Darling, return my love
No matter where you go
 Though the sun is burning out
 Though my plans may never turn out
 Girl, you know I
 Will be lovin' you till I die
I'll always love you
I'll always love you, baby
I'll always love you
