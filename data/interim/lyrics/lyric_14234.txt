Back then long time ago when grass was green
Woke up in a daze
Arrived like strangers in the night
 Long time ago when we was fab
 Back when income tax was all we had
Caresses fleeced you in the morning light
Casualties at dawn
And we did it all
 Long time ago when we was fab
 You are my world, you are my only love
And while you're in this world
The fuzz gonna come and claim you
But you mo' better wise
When the buzz gonna come and take you away
Take you away, take you away
The microscopes that magnified the tears
Studied warts and all
Still the life flowed on and on
 Long time ago when we was fab
 But it's all over now baby blue
 Long time ago when we was fab
 Like this pullover you sent to me
 And you really got a hold me
 Long time ago when we was fab
