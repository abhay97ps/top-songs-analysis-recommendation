Oh, I've had girls a'plenty
Out in the evening breeze
Sailed on ships from Mandalay
To the China Seas
I'm comin' home Cindy, Cindy
I'm comin' home Cindy, Cindy
I'm comin' home Cindy, Cindy
And then I'll make you mine
----------
Huh!!
---------
My true love lives in Natchez
And that's a way down South
Got me longin' for a kiss
From her pretty mouth
Chorus
------------------
Hah, Hah!
-----------------
Her hair is piled in ringlets
She has a roving eye
And her voice is heavenly
Sweet as apple pie!
Chorus
----------
Huh!
---------
So get the parson ready
I've got that wedding ring
When church bells start to chime
Everybody sing!:
Chorus
I'm comin' on home Cindy, Cindy
I'm comin' on home Cindy, Cindy
I'm gonna make you miiiiiine.....
