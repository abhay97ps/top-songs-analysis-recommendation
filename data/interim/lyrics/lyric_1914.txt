I dreamed I was in teenage heaven
I saw all the stars in teenage heaven
There was a golden door
With a golden star
And I walked on through
And there were all the
Teenage stars we knew
There was Richie Valens
Singing, Donna, I love you
Next to him, Buddy Holly
Wuh oh, Peggy Sue
Eddie Cochran
Sang Summertime Blues
Into the golden mic
And the Big Bopper
With his laughing face said
You know what I like
On the movie scene
I saw James Dean
Well, what can I say
Then an angel led me
Through the door marked
A hundred years from today
There was Ricky Nelson
Singing Lonesome Town
And all the stars then
Gathered round
Bobby Vee, Brenda Lee
And Fabian too
Connie Francis, Neil Sedaka
And the Fleetwoods sang Mr. Blue
And there was Elvis in a suit of gold
Singing at his very best
Love Me Tender, Don't Be Cruel
And you know all the rest
And as I left teenage heaven
Duane played his guitar
And I heard them call the roll
And the names were teenage stars
Bobby Darin, Chubby Checker
Dion, Dee Dee Sharp
The Everly Brothers, Bobby Rydell
Frankie Avalon, Little Eva
The Shirelles...
