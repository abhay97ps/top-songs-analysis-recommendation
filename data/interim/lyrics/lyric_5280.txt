Down here on the ground
It ain't no place for living
No, no, no
Down here on the ground
Watching the sparrows fly high
I watch the birds
As they make their wings
Flying solid free
How I wish it were me
But I'm down here on the ground
And I'm wanting something better
I'm down here on the ground
Wanting something more
One morning soon
I will find
Some wings on my mind
To take me high
So if you hear a sound
From down here on the ground
My friends
It's only me
Trying to fly
Trying to fly
I would love to fly
Because I'm tired of being
Down here on the ground
I'm tired of being
Down here on the ground, yeah
One morning soon
I gotta find
Some wings on my mind
Wings to take me high
So if you hear a sound
If you hear a sound
From down here on the ground
I said my friends
It's only me
I will be trying to fly
Trying to fly
Live a bird I would love to fly
Because I'm tired of being
Down here on the ground
Yes I'm tired of being
Down here on the ground, yeah
