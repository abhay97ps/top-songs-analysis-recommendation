Can you pay my bills
Can you pay my telephone bills
Can you pay my automo-bills
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' games
Ooh
Ladies leave yo men at home
The club is full of ballas and they pockets full grown
And all you fellas leave yo girl with her friends
Cause it's 11:30 and the club is jumpin', jumpin'
Boys say you got a girl?
Yeah it's true you got a man
But the party ain't goin' stop
So lets make it hot hot!
Now that you're out of my life
I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you
But I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you
But I'm richer
Because my body's too bootylicious for you babe
Popah ye da hoo da deh

When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row

In the closet that's my stuff, yes

You can see that I got it goin' on 
I wanna make sure you remember me
So I'ma leave my number on your video phone
My guilty pleasure--I ain't going nowhere
You can be my sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't want to wake up from you

Because I walk with vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk
Cause I ain't pretending
But I understand
Just where I'm going
I know the woman

It's about time I show it
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I was here 
I lived  I loved

It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
