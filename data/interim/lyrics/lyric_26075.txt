I was so cold and lost
And nothing seemed to ring true
I couldn't bear the cross
For everything I'd been through
And each day, I knew I needed change
But there was no way, no way
And then God whispered your name
And that's when everything changed
And love came out of the rain
And talk about being saved
Suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name
I can see the sunshine
For the first time in a while
Girl, it's like I've been baptized
By the warmth of your smile, hmm
Well, call it fate or faith or call it crazy either way
It's amazin', amazin' grace
When God whispered your name
That's when everything changed
Love came out of the rain
Talk about being saved
Well, suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name
It's just what I needed to hear, baby
It couldn't have been more loud and clear
When God whispered your name
That's when everything changed
Love came out of the rain 
And talk about being saved
Oh, suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name, oh yeah
Ooh, Hallelujah, baby
 Oh, yeah, hmm-hmm 
 Ooh yeah
I can see the sunlight shinin' through your pretty eyes, baby
 Woo, hmm 
I like a man who leaves, time feels like Hell
 Got my hands up high, I got my hands up to the sky
 Ooh, I'm sayin' thank you
