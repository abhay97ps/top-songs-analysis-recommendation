It's a little too late
I'm a little too gone
A little too tired of this hanging on
So I'm letting go while I'm still strong enough to
It's got a little too sad
I'm a little too blue
It's a little too bad
You were too good to be true
I'm big time over you, baby
It's a little too late
No, I don't wanna talk about what we can do about us anymore
Only time you and me wasting is the time it takes to walk right out that door
Yeah, talk about water under the bridge
You should know by now, girl, that's all this is
It's a little too late
I'm a little too gone
A little too tired of just hanging on
I'm letting go while I'm still strong enough to
It's got a little too sad
I'm a little too blue
It's a little too bad
You were too good to be true
I'm big time over you, baby
It's a little too late
There was a time this heart of mine
Would take you back every time
Don't you know?
It's been two packs of cigarettes
A sleepless night, a nervous wreck, a day ago
Now you ain't got no business coming around
I'm closing up shop
Shutting us down
It's a little too late
I'm a little too gone
I'm a little too tired of just hanging on
So I'm letting go while I'm still strong enough to
It's got a little too sad
I'm a little too blue
It's a little too bad
You were too good to be true
I'm big time over you, baby
It's a little too late
I'm big time over you, baby
It's a little too late
