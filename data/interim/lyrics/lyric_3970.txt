I can see no reason
But you're acting so strange
Now put your trust in me
You should try for a change
And I'll be satisfied with you, girl
I'll be satisfied with you
You'll be satisfied with me, wait and see
Now don't be too concerned
About what your friends might say
Cause you're with me tonight
And I'm gonna make you stay
Cause I'll be satisfied with you, girl
I'll be satisfied with you
And you'll be satisfied with me, wait and see
Yes, I'll be satisfied with you, girl
I'll be satisfied with you
You'll be satisfied with me, wait and see
