We are winners and losers, bedfellow choosers
Put here to pass by the time
We are space-age sailors, all had our failures
Now everybody gonna' shine
Keep it shinin' on
Keep it shinin' on
See the fire within them burnin'
Touch the fire, make me feel so fine
Keep the fire within you livin'
Everybody gonna' shine, shine, shine
Keep it shinin' on
Keep it shinin', shinin' on
Keep it shinin' on
Shinin' on
Shinin' on
What?
Alright
Keep it shinin' on
Keep it shinin', shinin' on
Keep it shinin' on
Keep it shinin' on, shinin' on, shinin' on
Keep it shinin', keep it shinin', keep it shinin' on
Keep it shinin', keep it shinin', keep it shinin' on
Keep it shinin', keep it shinin', keep it shinin' on
Keep it shinin', keep it shinin', keep it shinin' on
Keep it shinin', keep it shinin', keep it shinin' on
Keep it shinin', keep it shinin', keep it shinin' on
Keep it shinin', keep it shinin', keep it shinin' on
