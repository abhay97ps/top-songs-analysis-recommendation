Woo!
Yay! 
Today's the day, we're out to play
And lost our way, it's always the same, oh, baby, now
Climb the trees, sailed the seven seas
We've grazed our knees, and no-one's to blame, ohh
Come and sit beside us; we'll give you such a thrill 
We're not nice, we're cool as ice
We'll give you quite a chill 
Your imagination, take over on this ride
Out of sight, alright
Hold on tight!
Come on
Come on
Get it on
We're ridin' in a rollercoaster
Come on 
Come along 
Get it on
We're ridin' in a rollercoaster of love
So don't be shy
You'll soon be high
We'll touch the sky
You'll never believe, oh, baby now
Round and round, but don't look down
We won't be found
You'd better believe it
Come and sit beside us; we'll give you such a thrill 
We're not nice, we're cool as ice
We'll give you quite a chill 
Your imagination, take over on this ride
Out of sight, alright
Hold on tight!
Come on
Come on
Get it on
We're ridin' in a rollercoaster
Come on 
Come along 
Get it on
We're ridin' in a rollercoaster of love
Come on 
Come on 
Get it on 
We're ridin' in a rollercoaster 
Come on 
Come along 
Get it on
We're ridin' in a rollercoaster of love 
Get it on
We're ridin' in a rollercoaster of love
Of love
Of love
Of love
