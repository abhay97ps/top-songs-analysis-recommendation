Keep on loving me honey, keep on loving me true
Baby, I'm going to love you no matter what you do
Just so long as I can have it all, nothing but you
So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause I would stop right where I stand
I'd just be afraid of a man
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe
Keep on loving me honey, don't you go nowhere
Don't you know I'm satisfied with your tender care?
And I get my inspiration, darling, just knowing you're there
So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause I would stop right where I stand
I'd just be afraid of a man
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe
Would you take the heavens out of the sky
Imagine what the world would be like if the rivers ran dry
Oh Tammi
What good am I without you
I can't do without you, darling
Like a sea without a shore
Kicking forever more
Keep on loving me honey, don't you change your mind
Sugar, I can't bear the thought of ever leaving you behind
No matter what I do, another you I'll never find
So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause I would stop right where I stand
I'd just be afraid of a man
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe
If you leave you might as well take the air I breathe
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause I need your love, I need you so desperately
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
