We'll be road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
Southbound
Little bikinis in white sand
I can't sleep, gotta leave
The summer sun is starting to peak
Through my window, lettin' me know
Time's up, it's time that we go
Got a lead foot waiting
And a pocket full of cash
Cooler full of beer
And a little something stashed
In the back of the car, so relax
There ain't a beach too far
We'll be road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
Southbound
Little bikinis in white sand 
In a tank top
Gonna let the guns out, all about
Rocking that farmer's tan
Got the Chev going 70
All the girls looking heavenly
Buncha  kick back and chill
Out ahead of me
Gettin' wild, raisin' hell
And leavin' this town
Like there ain't no stopping us now
Oh tellin', no tellin'
Bet them lips taste like watermelon
Got that Daiquiri kiss
The kind when it hits
Makes you wanna get goin' there
Wherever that is
We'll be road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
South bound
Little bikinis in white sand 
In a tank top
Gonna let the guns out, all about
Rocking that farmer's tan
Got the Chev going 70
All the girls looking heavenly
Buncha  kick back and chill
Out ahead of me
Gettin' wild, raisin' hell
And leavin' this town
Like there ain't no stopping us now
No, there ain't no stopping us now
There ain't no stopping us now
(We'll be road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
South bound
Little bikinis in white sand)
No there ain't no stopping us now
(In a tank top
Gonna let the guns out, all about
Rocking that farmer's tan)
There ain't no stopping us now
(Got the Chev going 70
All the girls looking heavenly
Buncha kick back and chill
Out ahead of me)
No, there ain't no stopping us now
(Gettin' wild, raisin' hell
And leavin' this town)
There ain't no stopping us now
