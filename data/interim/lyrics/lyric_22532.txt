Dark in the city, night is a wire
Steam in the subway, earth is afire
Woman, you want me, give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind
Do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand 
Just like that river, twisting through a dusty land 
And when she shines, she really shows you all she can 
Oh, Rio, Rio, dance across the Rio Grande
Stalked in the forest, too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
High blood drumming on your skin, it's so tight
You feel my heat, I'm just a moment behind
Do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do-do, do, do
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand 
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land 
And when she shines, she really shows you all she can 
Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande
Hungry like the wolf
I'm hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Don't make a sound!
Her name is Rio; she don't need to understand {Yeah!}
Smell like I sound!
Straddle the line!
Mouth is alive!
Burning the ground!
 |Oh!|
Burnin' the ground
