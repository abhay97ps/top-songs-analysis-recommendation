Mmm, eso beso, ooh that kiss
Aah, eso beso, ooh your kiss
It's got something, don't know what
But whatever it's got, it's got a lot
When we samba 
Close like this 
Ay, ay caramba 
Who unleashed that kiss ? 
Hold me closer and we'll soar
For the samba's the quickest way to make amor
As we dip and sway and caress this way
Samba seems to say "Love is here to stay"
Like the samba sound, my heart begins to pound
I go off the ground to where I'm poco-loco
Eso beso  ooh that kiss 
Eso beso  ooh your kiss 
Kiss me mucho and we'll soar
And we'll dance the dance of love forevermore
As we dip and sway we caress this way
Samba seems to say "Love is here to stay"
Like that samba sound, my heart begins to pound
And I go off the ground to where I'm poco-loco
Eso beso  ooh your kiss 
Kiss me mucho  I love your kiss 
Kiss me mucho and we'll soar
And we'll dance the dance of love forevermore
Ah this dance 
Ooh, romance 
I love that kiss 
Kiss me mucho 
A little more mucho 
Then we'll dance
Ah that kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Mucho, mucho, mucho
