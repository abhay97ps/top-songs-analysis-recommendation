Don't try to explain your mind, I know what's happening here
One minute it's love and suddenly it's like a battlefield
One word turns into war
Why is it the smallest things that tear us down?
My world's nothing when you're gone
I'm out here without a shield
Can't go back now
Both hands tied behind my back for nothing
Oh no, these times when we climb so fast to fall again
Why we gotta fall for it now?
I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like a battlefield? 
A battlefield 
A battlefield 
Why does love always feel like a battlefield? 
A battlefield 
A battlefield 
Why does love always feel like...
Can't swallow our pride, neither of us wanna raise that flag, mmm
If we can't surrender, then we both gonna lose what we had, oh no
Both hands tied behind my back for nothing 
Oh no, these times when we climb so fast to fall again
I don't wanna fall for it now
I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like a battlefield? 
A battlefield 
A battlefield 
Why does love always feel like a battlefield? 
A battlefield 
A battlefield 
I guess you better go and get your armor 
Get your armor 
I guess you better go and get your armor 
Get your armor 
I guess you better go and get your...
We could pretend that we are friends tonight 
And in the morning, we'd wake up and we'd be alright
'Cause baby, we don't have to fight
And I don't want this love to feel like...
A battlefield 
A battlefield 
A battlefield 
Why does love always feel like a battlefield? 
A battlefield 
A battlefield 
Guess you better go and get your armor
I never meant to start a war 
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like a battlefield? 
A battlefield 
A battlefield 
Why does love always feel like a battlefield? 
A battlefield 
A battlefield 
I guess you better go and get your armor  
Get your armor 
I guess you better go and get your armor 
Get your armor 
Why does love always feel like...
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Why does love always feel like...
 A battlefield
A battlefield
I never meant to start a war
Don't even know what we're fighting for
I never meant to start a war
Don't even know what we're fighting for
Hey...
