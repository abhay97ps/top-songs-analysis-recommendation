Little games are for little boys
Growing up and changing all my toys
Aeroplanes, motor cars, goldfish in old jam-jars
I just don't play these games no more
Little games are for little boys
Loving games are for bigger boys
Parties in Chelsea flats, mixing with kinky cats
Are games I wanna play some more
Ooh, what they're doing to me
Darling it's so plain to see
My temperature's rising but that's not surprising
When you do what you do to me
Little games are for little boys
I found out there are other joys
Margaret, Josephine, Susie and Catherine
They help me in my little games
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
Play my little games
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Say I need you, I need you
