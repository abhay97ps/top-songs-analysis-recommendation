Inhale and I want you to exhale
And I want you to follow your breath
10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...
I'm off on a adventure 
I'm on my way to heaven 
Birds sing, flying around
You never see them too long on the ground
You want to be one of them 
You want to be one of them 
You might hear the birds singing, flying around
You never see them too long on the ground
You want to be one of them 
You want to be one of them

Can we tag along? Can we take the journey?
Knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? 
When will the heaven begin?

When will the fantasy end?
When will the heaven begin?
