Night school strutter just strutting around
Can't find work since the band left town
Can't get up cause he can't get down
He's a heartbroken bopper
Honor roll student graduation day
Summa cum laude is a big okay
Car wash king is having beans today
Rise from the gutters
There's too much has gone to waste
Rise with the others
There's too much is done in haste
