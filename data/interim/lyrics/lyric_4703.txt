Every time I call on you
It seems positively true
That you've been out with someone that was new
When I ask you to explain
You find excuses and complain
You always underestimate my brain
Wednesday
Such a groovy Wednesday
Never rains on Wednesday
Or any day
For you
Everywhere I go I see my shadows running after me
Her footsteps are no more than right behind
Please try not to bother me
I'm in another world you see
I'm trying to erase you from my mind
Wednesday
Such a groovy Wednesday
Never rains on Wednesday
Or any day
For you
Wednesday
Such a groovy Wednesday
Never rains on Wednesday
Or any day
For you
Any Wednesday
Any Wednesday
Any Wednesday
