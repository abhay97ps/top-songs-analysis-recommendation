He's a good guy, yes he is
Just as sweet as he can be
And I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna love him, come what may
Oh oh oh, he's a good guy, yes he is
Some girls say he's so bad, but I can't agree
'Cause if he makes them sad, he's still sweet to me
I never saw a guy who was sweeter than my guy
Never a saw a guy who was sweeter than he
He's a good guy, yes he is
Just as sweet as he can be
And I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna love him, come what may
Oh oh oh, he's a good guy, yes he is
My folks think he's lazy, but they just don't know him
He works like he's crazy and one day he'll show them
I never saw a guy as ambitious as my guy
Never saw a guy as ambitious as he
He's a good guy, yes he is
Just as sweet as he can be
And I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna love him, come what may
Oh oh oh, he's a good guy, yes he is
My friends tell me "Quit him, " but I pay them no mind
I'll always be with him and he'll treat me so kind
I never saw a guy who's as grateful as my guy
Never saw a guy who's as grateful as he
He's a good guy, yes he is
Just as sweet as he can be
And I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna love him, come what may
Oh oh oh, he's a good guy, yes he is
He's a good guy, yes he is
Just as sweet as he can be
