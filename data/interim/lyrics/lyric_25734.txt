I like the way you talk, I like the things you wear
I want your number tattooed on my arm in ink, I swear
'Cause when the morning comes, I know you won't be there
Every time I turn around, you disappear
I wanna blow your mind, just come with me, I swear
I'm gonna take you somewhere warm, you know j'adore la mer
'Cause when the morning comes, I know you won't be there
Every time I turn around, you disappear
Nice to meet ya
Nice to meet ya, what's your name?
Let me treat ya to a drink
I like the way you talk, I like the things you wear
I want your number tattooed on my arm in ink, I swear
'Cause when the morning comes, I know you won't be there
And every time I turn around, you disappear
Nice to meet ya
One minute, you're there, the next one, you're gone
Been waiting for you all night, so come on
You know what I need, you know what I want
You know what I need now
You know what I need now
Nice to meet ya, what's your name?
Let me treat ya to a drink
Nice to meet ya
Where ya been?
Let me treat ya
To a drink
Nice to meet ya
