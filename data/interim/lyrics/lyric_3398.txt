"The only way to end this is if I use it..... But then
*Swords Clashing*
"FASTER"
"Goddamnit! Just Use It Already!"
"Gotta go faster!"

Royce J: HOOK 
Stacking My Digits I Get Everyday Day-Day-Day-Day
She Ain't Go Tattle, Go Battle The Play-Play-Play- Play-Play
Calling Me Crazy I Get It
What You Feel I Can Tell That You Skip It
Boosting Your Looks By The Day By The Minute
Like A Road Runner, The Morning I Get It
Amaru Son: HOOK 
& I Swear They Be Lying
Wondering Why They Be Trying
The Main Ones That Always Be Crying
Quit Wasting My Time
No I Don't Need A Cosign
I Told You Lil Boys That I'm Fine
Lets Get To The Racks
Player Option Quarterback
Cause I'm Rumbling Thru With Sacks
& Bring It Back
Hating On Me Its A Fact
Getting Mad & Now Look Where We At

VERSE 1: Royce J
You Cry But You See Me Work
No Time You Wanna Go Lurk
Love What You Doing I Think's Your Turn
Lord I Be Thinking My Life Is A Burn
So Many Issues I Gotta Go Learn
Pressing You Niggas I Think It's A Perm
Back To The Past, I Don't Wanna Think
Critics Gon' Chop It Up Thinking It's Me
Look At Me Gazing She Ain't Gonna Blink
Quarter No Telling What I Pour Is Pink
I Keep That Green, You Be Playing No Link
Head Above Water, I Can Never Sink
Choosing A Choice
Never Go Back
I Gotta Deploy
She A Lil Nutty, Like AN Almond Joy
Clutching That Cali, That Bitch Ain't A Toy
Back In The Day
Love A Mission, Might Not Get Your Way
Come & Get You I'm Stopping Your Way
Head Of My Word, I'mma Do What I Say
Nigga Say Nothing, They Might Get You Paid
Crucial Your Pockets, I'm Feeding You Good
Go Get You Something You Looking To Good
Gangsta Lil Bitch And She Fresh From The Hood

VERSE 2: Amaru Son
Hello You
I'm Running Up, Getting This Money, My Numbers Be Changing, Sudoku
Believe In Me, Telling These Stories But I'm Super Sayian, No Goku
Bet There Ain't No Tellin What I Go Though
I Done Paved My Way, Brought It In Two
Doesnt Matter Really Cause It Is True
& Why You Keep Bringing Up All These Problems Like What Is You Thinking
& Don't Try To Play These Games, Lil Mama, Cause Imma Be Seeking
We Can Go
Somewhere Else For Sho
Just Tell Me Now Oh No
I Wanted To Know
& Quit Playing With Fire
Better Yet Call Me A Sire, You Might As Well Go & Retire
Like William Shire
Better Not Mess Up Your Chances, I'm Calling You Out Like A Liar
Not Worried Bout Stress
Matter Fact Clean Up Your Mess
Or I Aim Up Right To Your Chest
No Bullet Proof Vest
Niggas Keep Hating On Me, When I See Them They Copy The Rest
