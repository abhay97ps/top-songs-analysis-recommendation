She's a wizard with her shears
She's been turning heads for years
All the darlings and the dears
Say she's got the touch
An exclusive clientele
Oh she knows each one so well
No one dares to kiss and tell
She knows too much
She's a modern-day Delilah
Keeps her scissors laser-sharp
Once she finds your weakness
She'll cut you to the quick
Stab you in the heart
She'll love you like a lion
Leave you like a lamb
She's a modern-day Delilah
She'll cut you if she can
Oh she's sure what's right for you
Slips it into your shampoo
Only she knows if it's true
That blondes have more fun
When you wake up on the floor
All your strength swept out the door
Take a mirror from the drawer
The damage is done
She's a modern-day Delilah
Keeps her scissors laser-sharp
Once she finds your weakness
She'll cut you to the quick
Stab you in the heart
She'll love you like a lion
Leave you like a lamb
She's a modern-day Delilah
She'll cut you if she can
She's the keeper of secrets
And the mistress of lies
You'll see a cold steel blade
When you look in her eye
She's a modern-day Delilah
Keeps her scissors laser-sharp
Once she finds your weakness
She'll cut you to the quick
Stab you in the heart
She'll love you like a lion
Leave you like a lamb
She's a modern-day Delilah
She'll cut you if she can
She's a modern-day Delilah
