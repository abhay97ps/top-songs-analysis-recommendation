Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah
Make 'em bleed for the season
I got pretty tings overseas, yeah 
Shopping sprees for a week, yeah 
Like FBG, I got free bands, yeah 
Above the trees, hard to breathe in 
We spending G's for no reason, yeah 
Better go sleep, she not leavin', yeah 
Crib in the hills like I'm fiendin', yeah
Huh, huh, huh
'Bout a dollar, huh, huh 
Whip that Panamera, yeah
Piss in my ring, diamonds canary yellow 
I'm sippin' codeine, I'm movin' slower than Donatello 
I doubt that she don't let me fuck, but I swear I won't sweat her 
I'm runnin' the millions up, on God, my fam doin' better 
Bein' broke didn't break us apart, got rich, we still together 
We storm the weather, you get jammed, I'll write you letters 
We flock of feathers , the parasailers 
Gave her a groove like Stella, my vocals makin' her pussy wetter 
Bought a new Louis flannel, flowers all over my white Margielas 
Make 'em bleed for the season
I got pretty tings overseas, yeah 
Shopping sprees for a week, yeah 
Like FBG, I got free bands, yeah 
Above the trees, hard to breathe in
We spending G's for no reason, yeah 
Better go sleep, she not leavin', yeah 
Crib in the hills like I'm fiendin', yeah
Huh, huh
Feel the Miley Cyrus, yeah
We gettin' geeked up at the private party, yeah, yeah
Leak, it ain't no secret, know I drip the hardest 
The valet can't hold my key, I let my people park it 
Got that Escalade BP 'cause I might be a target 
My fans screamin' at me, say I'm they favorite artist 
Pay what I want, no back and forth, don't do no bargain 
We cross the margin 
Fuck niggas barkin', main reason I keep a carbon 
We burn like arsons 
Snakes in the garden 
We rich, I beg you pardon?
My lil' niece is startin' 
The vehicles foreign 
Feel like I'm soarin' 
Make 'em bleed for the season
I got pretty tings overseas, yeah 
Shopping sprees for a week, yeah 
Like FBG, I got free bands, yeah 
Above the trees, hard to breathe in 
We spending G's for no reason, yeah 
Better go sleep, she not leavin', yeah 
Crib in the hills like I'm fiendin', yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
