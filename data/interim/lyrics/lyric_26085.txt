Body bag, toe tag, in the streets, another victim
Juggin' bag, gettin’ it on, cold ass bloody nigga
Just another sign, blow his ass, another trace, another record
Just a bitch who talkin' down or another nigga think he fuckin' with me
Dirty game, fuckin’ shame, kiss me 'cause she love that nigga
Dirt up on my name, fuck the fame, free DDawg from out the system
Gang gon' stay the same, your friends gon' change, slide with my bro and with this pistol
Bitch, I keep my thing, I let it bang, don't play no games, we quick to peel him, yeah
Pistol packin' in the North, 4Trey stack in the North
I'm down to kill a whole house when my feelings involved
I'm down to push the button on y’all, I give my brothers one call
And while I’m singin' all my pain, they plan on tearin’ me down
I'm a rough rider, lowlife, made nigga, yeah
I'm a fuckin' problem, thirty pop him, play, we pop his head
You know Top’ll stop 'em, we clear the scene and leave these niggas red
Where I go, them hitters follow, they on my ass, but I know the game, let's play it
On top my shit, these pussy niggas hatin', face me, nigga
Ridin' 'round in my Rolls-Royce screamin', "Gang," I know you hate me, nigga
We gon' forever bang and stay untamed, they tryna break me, nigga
Bitch, I'm twenty, I done spent four million and dropped a half just for to zip 'em
Lay your bed, I throw the pillow 
Pallbearer runnin' with the fuckin' gravediggers, yeah
Public figure ridin' with the fuckin' K's with him
Don't give a fuck 'bout how I turn out once his mans with him
I'm quick to jump out with my gun out, they gon' slang with him
Pistol packin' in the North, 4Trey stack in the North
I'm down to kill a whole house when my feelings involved
I'm down to push the button on y'all, I give my brothers one call
And while I'm singin' all my pain, they plan on tearin' me down
I'm a rough rider, lowlife, made nigga, yeah
I'm a fuckin' problem, thirty pop him, play, we pop his head
You know Top'll stop 'em, we clear the scene and leave these niggas red
Where I go, them hitters follow, they on my ass, but I know the game, let's play it
AI pull up, all these hoes, they wanna know where Top at
Motherfuck a show, I dropped my tape, now where my fuckin' guap at?
Soon as I walk up in my show, they tryna see where my Glock at
They know I'm strapped up in this bitch, I shoot and you can't stop that
I'm thuggin'
I'm a rough rider, lowlife, made nigga, yeah
I'm a fuckin' problem, thirty pop him, play, we pop his head
You know Top'll stop 'em, we clear the scene and leave these niggas red
Where I go, them hitters follow, they on my ass, but I know the game, let's play it
Body bag, toe tag, in the streets, another victim
Juggin' bag, gettin' it on, cold ass bloody nigga
Just another sign, blow his ass, another trace, another record
Just a bitch who talkin' down or another nigga think he fuckin' with me
Dirty game, fuckin' shame, kiss me 'cause she love that nigga
