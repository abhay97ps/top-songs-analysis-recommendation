Superman was killed in Dallas
There's no love left in the palace
Someone took the Beatles' lead guitar
Have another Chivas Regal
You're twelve years old
And sex is legal
Your parents don't know where or who you are
Used to be the hero of the ball game
Took the time to shake the loser's hand
Used to be that failure
Only meant you didn't try
In a world where people gave a damn
Great big wars in little places
Look at all those frightened faces
But don't come here
We just don't have the room
Love thy neighbor's wife and daughter
Cleanse your life with holy water
We don't need to bathe
We've got perfume
Used to be a knight in shining armor
Didn't have to own a shiny car
Dignity and courage were the measure of a man
Not the drugs he needs to hide the scar
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Can your teacher read?
Does your preacher pray?
Does your president have soul?
Have you heard a real good ethnic joke today?
Mama took her speed
Daddy ran away
But you musn't lose control
Let's cut a class
I got some grass
The kids are wild
We just can't tame 'em
Do we have the right to blame 'em
We fed 'em all our indecision
We raped their minds with television
But what the hell
They're too young to feel pain
I believe that love can save tomorrow
I believe the truth can make us free
Someone tried to say it
And we nailed him to a cross
I guess it's still the way it used to be
