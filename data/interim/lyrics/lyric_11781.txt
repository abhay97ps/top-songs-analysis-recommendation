Well, it seems right
But I wonder and it feels right
But I wonder if I know how true love feels
Well, he shows me
But I wonder

And it feels right
Oh, but I wonder
If we know how true love feels
Is it all infatuation
Is it heartache's consulation?
Tell me again
Please tell me again
Well, it seems right
But I wonder
It feels right
But I wonder
If we know how true love feels
Well, he shows me
But I wonder
He tells me
But I wonder
If we know how true love feels
Well, it seems right
But I wonder
It feels right
But I wonder
