TORTURE
Kris Jensen
Torture, torture
Baby, you're torturing me
Why do you lead me around
And make me chase ya
When I catch ya
You won't let me embrace ya
Please baby, have a heart
Cause can't you see
You're torturing me
Torturing me
This torture that I'm going through
Is worth the pain if I have you
So, if you love me, let me know
But if you don't , please let me go
Torture, torture
Baby, you're torturing me
You know that I'm crazy about you
Yet you make me do without you
Do you mean to hurt, or don't you see
You're torturing me, torturing me
