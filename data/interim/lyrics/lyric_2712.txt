You must belie-ie-ieve me
No matter what the people might say
You must belie-ie-ieve me
Darling, it just didn't happen that way
No, no, it just didn't happen that way
You've come home with somethin' on your mind
Darlin', tell me, why are you cryin'
You say be serious, no time for fun
While tryin' to tell me somethin' that I've done
The things you've heard couldn't be denied
But before your opinion, listen to my side
And you must belie-ie-ieve me
No matter what the people might say
You must belie-ie-ieve me
Darling, it just didn't happen that way
No, no, it just didn't happen that way
Woah it's alright
Woah it's alright
Girl you're wrong to believe what was said
For you see nothing could ever be that bad
Though the talk is now all over town
Darling you know I'd never put you down
True, her and me we're at the party as guests
There's nothing else to say about whom I love best
And you must belie-ie-ieve me
No matter what the people might say
You must belie-ie-ieve me
Darling, it just didn't happen that way
No, no, it just didn't happen that way
Woah it's alright
Woah it's alright
Woah it's alright
Woah it's alright
