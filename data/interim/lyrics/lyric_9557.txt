I
Have never been so much
In love
Before
What a difference a true love made in my life
So nice
So right
Loving you gave me something new
That I'd never felt, never dreamed of
Something's changed
No, it's not the feeling I had before
Oh-oh-oh, it's much, much more
Love
I never knew that a touch
Could mean
So much
What a difference
And when we walk hand-in-hand
I feel
So real
Lovers come and then lovers go
That's what folks will say
Don't they know?
They're not there when you love me
Hold me and say you care
And what we have is much more than they could see
What we have is much more than they could see
What we have is much more than they could see
What we have is much more than they could see
What we have is much more than they could see
What we have is much more than they could see
What we have is much more than they could see
What we have is much more than they could see
What we have is much more than they could see
What we have is much more than they could see
What we have is much more than they...
