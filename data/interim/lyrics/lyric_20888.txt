Well, here we are again
Throwing punch lines, no one wins
As the morning sun begins to rise, we're fading fast
And we won't work this out
No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight
Every single word's been said 
Broke each other's hearts again 
As the starlit sky begins to shine, we're breaking down
She screams out
No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight
We don't have to fight tonight
We just gotta try tonight
We don't have to fight tonight
We just gotta try tonight
No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight
Well, there's no need to fight, we're just wasting time
If you give it a try well then maybe you'll find
Well, we know we're in love, so let us keep it alive
I'm starting to see the morning light
We finally worked this out
