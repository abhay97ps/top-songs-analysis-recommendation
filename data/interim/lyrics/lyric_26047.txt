It's just the thug life, baby
Come and take a walk in my shoes if you can
Probably wouldn't stand a chance
I'm from the bottom, it turn boys into men
Up before the sunrise, catch me if you can
And you know I'm with the gang wrong or right, yeah
Willing to pay with my life, so if I don't make it home tonight 
Bury me a gangsta
It's just the thug life, baby 
It's just the thug life, baby 
It's just the thug life, baby
It's just the thug life, baby, the bottom made me crazy
Daddy gone and mama couldn't save me
So hard times made me, I done spinned the block in my Mercedes
Reminiscing on the times we didn't have shit
Even was I broke, I knew that I wasn't average
Mixed with passion, ain't no recipe
This thug life shit might be the death of me
And I say that selfishly 
Because I'm grown now, kids of my own now
Mama, hold on now, your baby boy strong now
Money getting long now, got a reason to live
They don't know the route that we took to get here
'Cause where I come from, they ain't chasing a dream
Where I come from, it ain't safe to believe
Where I come from, it's a race to eighteen
They jump straight off the porch and land straight in the streets, goddamn
Heard you keep the glizzy in your pants, goddamn
I heard you have plans to be the man, goddamn
I won't let a nigga get a chance, thug life, bitch, until the end, end
Come and take a walk in my shoes if you can
Probably wouldn't stand a chance
I'm from the bottom, it turn boys into men
Up before the sunrise, catch me if you can
And you know I'm with the gang wrong or right, yeah
Willing to pay with my life, so if I don't make it home tonight 
Bury me a gangsta
It's just the thug life, baby 
It's just the thug life, baby 
It's just the thug life, baby
