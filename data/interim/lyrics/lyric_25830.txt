Nine in the morning, the man drops his kids off at school
And he's thinking of you, like all of us do
Sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon
Around 1:32, like he knows what to do
She , she lives in daydreams with me 
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is 
He takes a boat out, imagines just sailing away 
And not telling his mates 
He wouldn't know what to say 
She , she lives in daydreams with me 
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is 
She , she's the first one that I see 
She lives in daydreams with me, and I don't know why
I don't know where she is 
Lives for the memory
A woman who's just in his head 
And she sleeps in his bed 
While he plays pretend 
So pretend 
She , she lives in daydreams with me 
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is 
She , she's the first one that I see 
She lives in daydreams with me, and I don't know why
I don't know where she is
