Sweet soft summer nights
Dancing shadows in the distant lights
You came for me to follow
And we kissed on distant shores
Long quiet hours of play
Sounds of tomorrow from yesterday
Love came for me to follow
And we kissed on distant shores
The careful glance of children playing
Raindrops fall as if they're saying
Quiet thoughts of you caressed by time
The breeze of summer's gone
Whispered memories as nights grow long
You came for me to follow
And we kissed on distant shores
