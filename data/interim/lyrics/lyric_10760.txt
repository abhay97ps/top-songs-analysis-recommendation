You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Baby, we couldn't get much higher
Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
The time for hesitation's through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we could only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre
Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Baby, we couldn't get much higher
Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
The time for hesitation's through
There's no time to wallow in the mire
Try now 'cause we could only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre
Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
One-three-seven disco heaven
One-three-seven disco heaven
Disco, disco heaven
One-three-seven disco heaven
One-three-seven disco heaven
Disco, disco heaven
One-three-seven disco heaven
One-three-seven
Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
The time for hesitation's through
There's no time to wallow in the mire
Try now 'cause we could only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre
Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
 Light my fire
 Come on, baby
 Light my fire
 Come on, baby
 Come on, baby, light my fire
 Come on, baby, light my fire
 Light my fire
 Light my fire
 Light my fire
 Light my fire
Come on and light, you better light
Throw me the light, come on and light
Ooh light 
You better light 
Come on and light 
Throw me the light 
Come on and light 
You better light 
Come on and light 
Throw me the light 
Ooh light 
Come on and light 
Throw me the light 
Come on and light
