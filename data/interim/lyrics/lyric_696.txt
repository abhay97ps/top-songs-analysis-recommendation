Don't forget, I made BANANA
Pull out my rapper, run through you like agua
Cock back, go pa pa
Hit a couple dirty 'sabi packets in the Wawa
World in my palm like my first name Saba
Sángo make you samba
Kaytra leave your baba open, haha
Dame a trip to Bahamas
With a lil' tata, leave wearing tie-dye
Shirt on my back, on my head a bandana
Red stripe with it like I'm Frankie
Don't forget that Lolo always told me bring a hankie
Screw up, get a spanking
Move up and I'm thanking, views in the making
Been a couple years since the Scapegoat escaped though, hoe
So many blessings and I'm grateful, oh
Can't slip up like banana peel, ooh
Looking in the mirror, gotta stay true, dude
I go beast mode every time I speak on a track
Hit a full court, swish then I run the game back
Ooh, I am legend like I'm Robert Neville
Head straight, mind right, I stay on the level
Like I'm Mac, but I don't smoke cigs
Talking mess, bruh it ain't that serious
I'ma just chill here and peel this back
Spending winter in New York with my anorak, huh
Got a couple plátanos cooking up on the stove
Grinding like I'm in an R&B joint, be back by 4
Won't be long 'til I get my due, pass my time
Gazing at the view, I ain't pass my prime
I ain't even come close yet, but the people closest to me
Wanna trip me up and close my zone, but
I got love for my enemies, that's what Jesus told me
You could beat me up, tear me down, I'ma turn the whole cheek
Bald boy with the bald fade
Had a lot of hard times but I'm good, pretty scarface
And winter don't seem 'bout as long as it used to
Summer ain't bright, I just see blue
No more parties in Anaheim
Khaki off, I need to be getting mine
Ugly boy, but I'm feeling real pretty right now
Feeling real pretty right now
I'm so high I could never come down
I could never calm down
I'm that kid, hotter than the surface on Venus
Only seventeen, college boy with a mean demeanor
I'ma take her to the floor and samba mama to some Sángo
Pretty mami, with the body, indubitably
You been having good times just cooling with me
Plantains on the plate, and they steaming on me
