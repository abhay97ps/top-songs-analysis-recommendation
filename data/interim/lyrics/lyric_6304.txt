INTRO
It’s a breeze for the 1 P
And a test of us for the rest of us
I gotta leave this city
And start a brand new colony
Won’t you take my hand
Come with me x3
Throw the jumpest parties
And Broadcast 90s TV
Center everything around creativity
And have the livest energy
Neo-renaissance
Have everybody ballin'
Everyone’s interconnected
Highly regarded
And well respected
Like the beginning of the internet
We’ll be so supportive
Your whole life’s distorted
Oh my Gah
I’ll change it up on yo ass
Code switchin'
Switchin' lanes with the codeine sippin' 
VERSE 1
I don't have emotions x2
If I ever feel down I take a super potion
In my mind I realize that I am the shit
And I can't deduce the fact that anything else exists
That's a Descartes complex
Oh my god please help me with this
I really need an assist
Steph Curry with the dish
East Indian fish
With the callaloo
Roti skin
Wrapped up
Like she did Hijab
Where's the love
People taking numbers and they're shooting every single odd
Go and tell Elon that I'm down for mars
And to put all my belongings in a pod
Like I'm never coming home I'm moving on to better things
But one more thing
I'll need one of those self landing rockets
I'll need more fabric for deeper pockets
Oh your the plug I'll stick you in sockets
Or maybe get socked than the socket boys
I'm blasting off high like I’m rocket boy
We're never coming back bring all your toys
Impulsive and bullish 'cause I'm a Taurus
Eat a smorgasbord Aqua Teen Hunger Force
The force strong with this one
He’ll start a resistance
And then keep on fishin' for money trees
Don’t you ever try to stand in front of me
I’ll banish you by fiat that’s by decree
Burn a dollar for something illegal
Burn the flag to do something illegal
You'll pledge to the flag then pledge to me, you'll
HOOK
It’s a starry night in the sky and I tried to get enlightened
I saw the violence of the world in the shape of a cloud I got frightened
What can a mortal do
Just meditate
On a swing x2
Feel the force
Feel everything
Everything x2
Aye
Low G’s and the high G's
Uh
Low G’s and the high G's
Uh
Low Gs' and the high G's
Like a tall tee worn by a peewee
That could put a hit out on me
On me
I’d take one for you
What would you do
There’s only one love don’t you understand monism
My brothas
My sistas
My niggas
Alone we are meek
But together there is no need for a retreat
Oh my gah
VERSE 2
Maneuvering like fighter pilots in coming fire
Let's kick it into hyperdrive to find something nicer
Ready for battle if blood must shed on my visor
If they need a martyr I volunteer as sacrifice for
What I believe in
Love honesty and
Excellence
Set the precedent
So they revel in
Revelation
When they realize race is
A manifestation
Of hate
Man you gotta dig deeper than Deepak Chopra
The new king cobra
Watch Kobe Bryant fade away
And fizzle like a soda
I never told ya
Deeper than when I dove into the deep end and almost drowned in some chlorine
I don't feel a thing like I'm numb from morphine
I rep Houston where they leanin' and sippin' codeine
And there's dope fiends
And prostitution rings
Not just beautiful things
I hope you're good at filtering
I consume you
Ingest the nutrients and dispel the toxins
That is my filtering process
You might as well get your groove on on a Camelbak
I am yo chiropractor girl throw it back
I got private practice meet me in the back
I create stimuli and then you react
Lesbi-honest this is an impulsive act
I have no regrets as a matter of fact
Say fuck it and keep on movin'
I'll be good whatever I'm doin'
I'd rather be violent then oppressed
My MLK's struggling with Malcolm x
And now I'm perplexed
Wondering where my heart will take me next
OUTRO
Monism monism
Monism my nigga
Oh my god x3
