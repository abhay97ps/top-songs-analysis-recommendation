The best things in life are free
That's why I love to cause envy
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
So you can grab them, spin them around in the air like a roller-coaster
And what doesn't kill me just makes me stronger
What doesn't hurt my feelings makes these raps longer
And remember, love thy neighbor as yourself thank you
Except when thy neighbor obtains more wealth than you!
Your mission is to listen to my dissing that I'm dishing
I'll be pissin on your bonfire, better consider yourself missing
I'll throw you so-called potents in the oceans so your parents best get fishing
When you see me you'll be kissing both of my motherfucking shoes
But i'll stamp on you snakes the next time you try hissing, my haters will be the ones that fucking lose
Yeah, you better back off all you haters
All you couch potato's turn to fucking mash taters
All you fuckers over the internet, probably fat fucks, man that I bet
I'll throw you in the air like I just don't care and you'll land n' make a crater!
Quit your bull shittin'
You ain't nothin', your all just pawns in my game
Just another poor person that got caught in the rain
All your whining lies in my brain
Your just making me go insane
And you won't like it when I show you my rage
My true form will bust out of its cage
I'm too much of a force to contain
All you show-ponies, I'm the dark horse so get the fuck off that stage
A sage has a lower i.q than me
You pricks, why dont you see
I only need a few minutes to explain that my limits have a non-stop possibilty
You fuckers drained in hippocricy
Soaking wet with controversy
You can't possibly get close to stopping me, there's more chance winning the lottery
I'll assassinate, mutilate and eviscerate, all these haters
I've gone rogue, away from the mainstream
Although this is how its always been
I'm gunna start taking these matters into my own hands
You couldn't even stop me even in your wildest dreams
These lyrics to hard to comprehend?
Well here's something much more difficult
You brains haven't even formed due to your adolescence
The inevitability of your demise is a consequence
You must be facing when you hit the brick wall 
Take it away Hippy-Green
I’m lean, mean Hippy-Green, sickest MC you ever seen
Here with Nylo triple nine, where the baddest asses there’s ever been
Got the power to turn a cripple fine, that’s more dope than Charlie Sheen
‘999’ is the number in Britain that you’ll be ringing when you need a vaccine
Cos we’re so sick we can make you pricks suddenly develop gangrene!
Yeah, at the pace i’m at there’s no stopping us now
Not cos I dont want to, it’s cos I really dont know how
Cos we’re going so damn fast it’s un-controllable
Un-stoppable, un-plausible, incredible!
Our pedestals, un-breakable, un-climbable, it’s inevitable!
Cos the way we rap, we cut all the crap, our MC names: unforgettable!
We’re un-beatable, your critical, we’re credible, your minuscule!
Top THAT one you sons-a-bitches!
