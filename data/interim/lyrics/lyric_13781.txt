Girl, I wanna sit you down
And let you know just how I feel
It's been a long time since I felt so strong
And much too long since love's been here
Now I know there's many questions running through your mind
You're wondering have you felt true love this time
Have you found the one who cares, who will always be right there
I wrote this song just to ease your mind
Now your love 
I won't play games 
And when I look 
That's how I feel, I'm for real 
They say in life you take a chance
And in love there's no guarantees
But the sweetest satisfaction comes from sharing our lives
And tearing down the walls of mystery
What we share is special, it's mystical
There's magic when I look in your eyes
Oh, but this is no illusion, I never want to lose you
Say you'll be with me for the rest of my life, oh, girl
 I want your sweet love
I'll pray for you every day
Pretend no more, darling, girl
 Oh...
Your love to me is very serious
I won't play games with your tender heart
And when I look into your eyes and say I love you, oh
That's how I feel, I'm for real
