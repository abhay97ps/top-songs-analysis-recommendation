I am the man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I bid farewell to ol' Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised
For six long years
I've been in trouble
No pleasure here on Earth I find
For in this world I'm bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me out
Kids fare the well
My old true lover I never expect to see you again
For Im bound to ride that Northen Railroad
Perhaps I'll die upon that train
You can bury me in Sunny Valley
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave
Maybe your friends think im just a stranger
My face you'll never see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shore
