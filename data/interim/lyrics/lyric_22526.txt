I dropped you off
Just a little after midnight
Sat in my car
'Til you turned off your porch light
I shoulda kissed you
I shoulda pushed you up against the wall
I shoulda kissed you
Just like I wasn’t scared at all
I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock
You turned the lock
And met me on the front porch
And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that I've kissed you
It's a good night, good night, baby, goodnight
You couldn't see me
Watching through the window
Wonderin' what went wrong
Praying that you wouldn’t go
You shoulda kissed me
You shoulda pushed me up against the wall
You shoulda kissed me
I was right on the edge and ready to fall
So I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock, you turned the lock
And met me on the front porch
And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that I've kissed you
It’s a good night, good night, baby, goodnight
I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Half scared to death, can’t catch my breath
Aren't these the moments we live for?
And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that I've kissed you
It's a good night, good night, baby, goodnight
It's a good night, good night, baby, goodnight
It's a good night, good night, baby, goodnight
It's a good night, good night, baby, goodnight
