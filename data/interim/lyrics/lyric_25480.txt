Yeah, won't you bust it for a real nigga? 
Slim thick, lil' butt, but it feel bigger 
I know you just a lil' problem, I can deal with ya

Right back on your mothafuckin' ass

Eight rounds in me, we could do it all night 
And I ain't tryna fight, see my future lookin' bright 
If you ready for the pipe, I could give you what you like 
Bitch, slide 
Bow down to the Coke Boys, fuck me? Fuck you, lil' ho 
Had respect for yo' ass

Get the money, told T, get the butter

Saw some mark-ass niggas on the corner flaggin' me
Like, "What's up with you? 'Sup with Max B?
What's up with the Coke Wave? What's up with the crew?
Is that nigga still in jail? What the nigga do?"
I said, "If you ain't up on thangs
Coke Boys still the gang, Coke Wave in my veins"

Two dicks on me, a cock and a big Glock 
Reach for my piece like openin' your eyes in Bird Box 
Gunshots 
Start a track meet

Won't you bust it for a real nigga? 
Slim thick, lil' butt, but it feel bigger 
I know you just a lil' problem, I can deal with ya
