When you drag in the sunrise
All over your feet
I never ask you where you've been
I always let you sleep late
Then bring you breakfast, baby, in bed
Lord, what a woman in love won't do
At times I've caught you lyin'
With your bare face hangin' out
But I just couldn't follow through
I'd just be provin'
That you're bein' untrue
Lord, what a woman in love won't do
What makes me keep on
Puttin' up with this?
What keeps me kneelin'
Underneath my master's kiss?
Could it be
That I'm leaving
Or bein' untrue too, like you?
Lord, what a woman in love won't do
Woo, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
In love won't do
Woo, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
In love won't do
