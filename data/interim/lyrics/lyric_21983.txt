I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, so can't you see? 
How can I tell you about my loved one? 
Ah, you gave me more, you gave it all to me, so can't you see? 
How can I tell you about my loved one?
You'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs 
But I look around me and I see it isn't so 
Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs 
And what's wrong with that? 
I'd like to know 
'Cause here I go  again! 
I love you, 
I love you, 
I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, so can't you see? 
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me, now can't you see 
Love doesn't come in a minute, 
Sometimes it doesn't come at all, 
I only know that when I'm in it, 
It isn't silly, 
No it isn't silly, 
Love isn't silly at all, not at all
I love you, 
I love you,  
I love you,  
You'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs 
But I look around me and I see it isn't so, oh no 
Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs 
And what's wrong with that? 
I'd like to know, 'Cause here I go again 
I love you, 
I love you, 
I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, so can't you see?
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me, now can't you see
I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, how can I tell you about my loved one?
