Alright - and we gon' get it on tonight
Yo, now I was downtown clubbin', ladies night
Seen shorty, she was crazy, right?
And I approach baby like: "Ma, what's your age and type?"
She looked at me and said, "You's a baby, right?"
I told her, "I'm 18 and live a crazy life
Plus I'll tell you what the '80s like
And I know what the ladies like
Need a man that's polite, listens and takes advice
I could be all three, plus I can lay the pipe
Come with me, come stay the night"
She looked at me laughin'; like "Boy, your game is tight"
I'm laughin' back like, sure, you're right, get in the car
And don't touch nothing, sit in the car
Let's discuss something, either we lovin' or I'll see you tomorrow
Now we speedin' up the West Side
Hand creepin' up her left side, I'm ready to do it
Ready to bone, ready for dome
55th exit, damn, damn, already we home
Now let's get it on
Hey ma

Yo, uh
Now that I got a girl, my ex wanna holla and spit
Told me to acknowledge her quick
She like, "Cam, stop frontin' on that Dave Hollister tip
Come over, let's swallow and sip."
I'm like: "Momma is sick
I promise you dick, usually have a problem with chicks 
They all say I'm rotten and rich"
But not her, boobies real, high heel doobie feel
Plus got them Gucci nails, huh
You a cutie still 
And this my down girl too - ain't no groupie deal
We left the movies with Uzis, Suzuki wheels
To the Jacuzzi, I tell you, my boo be's real
I mean she do be winnin', Louie spinnin'
Go to the crib, she got the Gucci linen 
I see boo be grinnin' 
She looked and said, "Cam, I know that you be sinning"
"Naw! I'm a changed man, look at the Range, ma'am
 I got a whole new game plan"
Looked and said, "That's nothing but game, Cam"
She was right, she was up in the Range, man 
Dropped her off at the L, now I'm flippin' the cell
That's right, I had to call up L
Yo L, what up? I hit, what else?
Plus dome, say word, and we got it on tonight
