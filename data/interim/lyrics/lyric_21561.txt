Feels just like a weight has lifted
How can I repay you help me understand
Currency, a fistful of tears I can afford
Fight of your life is not the cost
Time will reveal, yeah
All along, you're the one who's losing
Cause I, I go insane
Crazy sometimes
Trying to keep you from losing your mind
Open your eyes
See what's in front of your face
And save me my fistful of tears
You can make it disappear girl
All you got to do is just, raise up, face up, stay up
All things will heal, we'll feel it, with a kiss from the skies
Don't you let it go
Don't you let it go
Cause I, I go insane
Crazy sometimes
Trying to keep you from losing your mind
Open your eyes
See what's in front of your face
And save me my fistful of tears
We gon' fight the war
We gon' fight our fears
The only thing I want to throw is a fistful of tears
We gon' fight the war
We gon' fight our fears
The only thing I got to throw is a fistful of tears--
We gon' fight the war
We gon' fight our fears 
The only thing I want to throw is a fistful of tears
Cause I, I go insane 
Crazy sometimes 
Trying to keep you from losing your mind 
Open your eyes 
See what's in front of your face
And save me my fistful of tears 
Cause I, I go insane 
Crazy sometimes 
Trying to keep you from losing your mind 
Open your eyes 
See what's in front of your face
And save me my fistful of tears 
I go insane
Crazy sometimes
