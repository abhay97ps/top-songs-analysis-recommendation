Hey, yeah
It's all about you
Yesterday changed my mind
Now I see you as one of a kind
How I really need you
Hope you feel the same way too
'Cause if you look you will find
It's me you need in your life
It's really not about me
It's really all about you
It's driving me crazy
Can't figure you out
How to keep you steady going this route
Tell me that you feel the same
The thought has crossed you won't remain
Just to think that I
Could bring joy in your life
It's really not about me
It's really all about you
I know what you're going through
Every girl expects from you
They just wanna take control
You'll never have to figure out
I'm one woman who's not with that crowd
You've gotta believe me
It's really all about you
It's really all about you
It's really all about you
It's really all about you
So I'll give you time
To let go what's hurting inside
To let go what's on your mind
It's really not about me
It's really all, it's really all
All about you
It's really all about you
'Bout you
'Bout you
Baby, yeah
It's really all about you
Mm, hmm
All about ya, baby
It's really all about you, yeah
Oh yes, it is
