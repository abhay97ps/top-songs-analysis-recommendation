Time and the river
Will bring my love to me
If I must, I'll wait forever
By the river that took her to the sea
Here by the river
We loved, we laughed, we cried
But with time, my love, my darling
Left my arms and was gone with the tide
*How long I've been lonely;
Star of love, shine bright
I need her; oh, lead her
To my arms tonight
Time and the river
How swiftly they go by
But my heart will beat for no other
Till time stands still and the river runs dry
How long I've been lonely;
Star of love, shine bright
I need her; oh, lead her
To my arms tonight
Time and the river
How swiftly they go by
But my heart will beat for no other
Till time stands still and the river runs dry
