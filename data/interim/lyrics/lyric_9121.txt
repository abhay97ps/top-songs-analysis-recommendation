Showed that I loved you
When you gave me your heart
I love you too much
To ever tear it apart
When I kiss you, dear
The Earth moves under my feet
And church bells ringing
The angels singing
Church bells ringing
And the angels singing
Be by my side
Forever and forever
Just you and me
Just you and me
It's time, time for love
Baby, it's time, time for love
You have the flowers blooming
In the middle of the night
Whisper to me baby
While I'm holding you tight
You are the answer
To why I cannot sleep
And church bells ringing
The angels singing
Church bells ringing
And the angels singing
Wherever you go
I'll be there in the shadows
Just waiting for you
Just waiting for you
Baby, it's time, time for love
The clock on the wall will tell you
The look in my eyes will tell you
It's time for love
Baby, it's time, time for love
Oh, it's time, time for love...
