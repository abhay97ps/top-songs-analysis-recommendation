Ready to go
Ready to go
You're weird, in tears
Too near and too far away
He said, "saw red"
Went home, stayed in bed all day
Your t-shirt, dish dirt
Always love the one you hurt
It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops shouting out
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back and ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out
It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops having it
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back and ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out
Shout it out
You sleep too deep
One week is another world
 Big mouth
 Drop out
You get what you deserve
You're strange, insane
One thing you can never change
It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops shouting out
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back and ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out
It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops having it
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back and ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out
Shout it out
Ready to go
Abused, confused
Always love the one
That hurt ya, hurt ya, hurt ya, hurt ya
It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops shouting out
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back and ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out
It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops having it
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back and ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out
It's a crack
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
