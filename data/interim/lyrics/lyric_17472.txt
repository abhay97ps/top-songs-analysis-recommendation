Davina - “So Good”
Never have I been so mystified by anyone’s love before
Hey, I feel so natural.  I keep coming back for more
And each time we touch, you open up a new door
Baby, you’re such a midnight tease, uh
It’s gonna take everything to keep you from me, hey
And the joy that your loving brings
Can separate the mountains from the sea
I don’t wanna be wrong, but it feels right
If loving you is so wrong, I don’t wanna go on
I don’t wanna be wrong, but it feels right
It feels good, so good, so good, so good
Spent so many nights believing I was wrong for you being in my life
I can’t ignore it when some say that it ain’t right 
But I decided you’re the best thing that happened in my life
I haven’t had everything, oh no
But you come close to everything that love means, hey, yeah
In Heaven’s eyes, love is embraced between you and I
Now that we have each other, I don’t have to dream
I don’t wanna be wrong, but it feels right
If loving you is so wrong, I don’t wanna go on
I don’t wanna be wrong, but it feels right
It feels good, so good, so good, so good
I don’t wanna be wrong, but it feels right
If loving you is so strong, it could be wrong
I don’t wanna be wrong, but it feels right
It feels good, so good, so good, so good
I don’t wanna be wrong, but it feels right
If loving you is so wrong, I don’t wanna go on
I don’t wanna be wrong, but it feels right
It feels good, so good, so good, so good
