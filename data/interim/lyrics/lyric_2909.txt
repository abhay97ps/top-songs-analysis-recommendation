Somewhere in your heart
Try to save a place for me
Somewhere in your heart
I don't care where it might be
One little corner
May not mean that much to you
But one little corner
Will be enough to see me through
Somewhere in your dreams
Let my lips come close to you
Though they're only dreams
Someday they may all come true
Is it so much to ask
For such a tiny part?
Won't you save a place for me
Somewhere in your heart?
