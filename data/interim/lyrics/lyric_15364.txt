Wow
I'm beautiful
Or so you tell me so
You say I've got the body
That you just love to hold
It's so seldom
People tell you what you wanna hear
It's so rare
That your adventure overcomes your fear
Ooh
Wow
That feels good
When you touch me there
No one's done it quite like that
Maybe no one really cared
So baby
When I say I burn for you
This fire is truly your deed
When all the others fail
I turn to you, baby
You see
Ooh
Ooh, this I need
Ooh, this I need
It's so seldom
People tell you what you wanna hear
It's so rare
That your adventure overcomes your fear
Ooh, this I need
If this is an addiction
Why do I feel so free?
All I know is
Ooh, this I need
No
2001 is not that far away
Oh, no
Yes, I live in the future every single day
Every second brings me closer
To something that you'll say
In your hallucinogenic, funky fire-starting ways
Wow
I'm with this
Ooh
Ooh, this I need
Wow
I'm beautiful
Or so you tell me so
You say I've got the body
That you just love to hold
So, baby
When I say I burn for you
This fire is truly your deed
When all the others fail
I turn to you, baby
You see
Ooh
I'm with it, baby
Ooh, this I need
