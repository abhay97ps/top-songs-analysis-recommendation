First to put it down for North Carolina
But guess what , it's been worth it
I'm a superstar, bought me a big ol' car
Four point six 
Black with the bars from the front to back
And got a button in the middle, make the trunk go "eh-eh"
But it ain't 'bout that
It's about getting what you getting and driving all back here
Big fellas 
Half of me and Carolina niggas done time together
Polk, Bladen, Marshall, Hoke, Greene County, Tillery, damn
Transfer, Sandy Ridge, Browns over here 
Pasqoutank, down on the, Odom East 
Johnson County, Franklin, Burgaw, Newport, Warren, Shelby, Kenansville
 Tarboro, Triangle, Goldsboro, Halifax, Statesville
And all my niggas doing life behind the wall

You remember them days y'all, we used to play y'all
The radio and put our own lil' part in the song y'all
We used to 
Running through the school halls
Just before our basketball pep-rally jumped off
 My house, my home, my hood 
My brother, my sister, my cous' 
My niggas that was there from the beginning
Been wit me even 'fore they knew what bein' with me was
Y'all niggas just glanced at it, now I got y'all staring at it
But it's been the same ol' North Carolina it's been being
Y'all niggas just getting it, oh it's a shame isn't it?
Oh you thought we said we were coming wit a whole lotta something
We were bullshhh!

Man I had to do it
Just in case you were one of the ones
Who wanted to come and ask something stupid
 What it look like?
Putting it down for my niggas in the south side
North Carolina, South Carolina
And all my little bitty overlooked hick towns
We gonna hit y'all asses, ain't nothing but a T. T. blast
What we got coming at you?
 slamming,  classic
 What's after platinum?
And I don't meant to scare ya
But I'm about to bring it home
Blow these valleys, these hills, these streams
And N. C. outta the water
How's it feel to look a motherfucker dead in the grill
And tell 'em, "I told ya!"
This one's for North Carolina! Come on and raise up
Take your shirt off, twist it 'round your hand
Spin it like a helicopter
North Carolina! Come on and raise up
