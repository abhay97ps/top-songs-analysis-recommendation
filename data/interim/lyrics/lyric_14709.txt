When you dance that way
When you dance that way
I feel the rhythm in my soul
When your body sways
When your body sways so close to me
I lose control
When you do what you do to me
I don't know if it's right or wrong
When you do what you do to me
I don't know what is going on
Day or night?
Yo no sé
Wrong or right?
Yo no sé
I can't tell
Yo no sé
When I'm in your spell
Yo no sé
When you dance with me
When you dance with me I get this feeling every time
Is it ecstasy?
Is it ecstasy that makes me go out of my mind?
When you do what you do to me
I don't know if it's right or wrong
When you do what you do to me
I don't know what is going on
Day or night?
Yo no sé
Wrong or right?
Yo no sé
I can't tell
Yo no sé
When I'm in your spell
Yo no sé
Day or night?
Day, day, day or night?
Day, day, day, day, day or night?
Day, day, day or night?
When you dance that way
When you dance that way, I feel the rhythm, I feel the rhythm
When you dance that way
When you dance that way
When you dance that way
When you dance, when you dance...
When you do what you do to me
I don't know if it's right or wrong
When you do what you do to me
I don't know what is going on
Day or night?
Yo no sé
Wrong or right?
Yo no sé
I can't tell
Yo no sé
When I'm in your spell
Yo no sé
Day or night?
Yo no sé
Wrong or right?
Yo no sé
I can't tell
Yo no sé
