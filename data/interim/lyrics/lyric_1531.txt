Go, Drac, go
Master, master, I want to mash
I'll take your chains off later, Frankie
Master, please let me mash
You’re next, Igor
Right after Janos
Boris, I still like the Transylvania Twist better
Who asked you, you bloodsucker?
Wail, Frankie, wail
Mash good
Igor, you're cramping my style
Alright, let's try it with a little bit of soul now
Alright, now let’s try it without soul
Somebody stepped on my wing
Work hard, my children of the night
Blow, blow, daddy
Igor, you're cramping my style
Master, master
Calm yourselves, my children, calm yourselves
Go, you zombies
Go, you bats and jackals
Go, my children
I like the twist better
Igor, will you get out of my way, please?
Mash good
