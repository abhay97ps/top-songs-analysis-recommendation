I don't want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you promised
Beneath the silvery moon
Well, you think I could be happy
With your money and your name
Just to hide myself in sorrow
While you play your cheating game
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrow
In the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love for money
Cause I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
I don't want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you promised
Beneath the silvery moon
Ah
Ah
Ah
You can't buy my love for money
Cause I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
Mine
Mine
Mine
