There's something special about six o'clock
In the mornin' when it's still too early to knock
And the dusty light shines down on the block
And reflects up and down on the hands of the clock
Six o'clock, six o'clock
A few hours ago she was standin' here
Just watchin' the stars in our eyes and the lights as uptights disappear
And I could feel I could say what I want
That I could nudge her and call her my confidante
And now I'm back alone with just my shadow in front
At six o'clock, six o'clock
I went home and found that tryin' to sleep was a laugh
Just watchin' my eyelids knowin' my brain bids the night not to pass
I got up and got scufflin' around
But somehow it just wasn't the same happy town
And the bells didn't ring with the same happy sound
At six o'clock, six o'clock
If I go back where we parted
Could I ever be like that again?
Guess I'll just have to wait 'til tomorrow
But what can I do 'til then?
Guess I'll go back home and just wait until dawn
Guess I had to learn goin' back where we were wouldn't help at all
And I wish my head had been workin' right
We'd have gone for coffee and talked all night
But now I'm back alone feelin' twisted up tight
Six o'clock, six o'clock
Now, I'm back alone
Yes, now I'm back alone
I'm back alone
