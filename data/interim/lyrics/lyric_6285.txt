Many a tear has to fall
But it's all in the game
All in the wonderful game
That we know, that we know as love
You have words, you have words with him
And your future's looking dim
But these things
Your heart can rise, rise above
Once in a while he won't call
But it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet, a sweet bouquet
With a sweet bouquet
And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart, your hearts got to fly
Fly way
Come on and sing now...
And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away
It's all in the game, the game called love
It's all in the game, the game called love
