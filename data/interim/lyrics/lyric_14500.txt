Verse 1]
My Lady, my Girl
As I guess I used to call you babe
Just stop running, wait
Why do you have to exaggerate things?
Stop screaming, girl silence’s a bliss
Just hear me out, listen to me
I don’t mean to end it, truly
Overseas romance, hence be gone
I hate to have a heart of stone
Did you not try, was it me
How do we now break free
Company closed, out on auction
Needless to say we've missed that junction
Sign, turn, lights, whatever the fuck
We went on the wrong fucking track
How the fuck did that happen
I cannot resolve - Rubik’s cube – Chris Gardner
Come and help – I though I’ve found her!
Gimme one last look, say it'll work out
Gym’s closed babe, no doubt
Don’t speak, I can’t hear what you’re thinking
It’s passed,while we were blinking
And then you say…
I said Stop running, wait, hold up baby
Don’t cry look at me, I do not want it baby
Hey gazelle, where are you heading?
I’m here for you, why you keep on forgetting
I don’t buy this crap, why you keep on selling
Babe was it serious or just a bit of petting
Been loving you for too long, Otis Redding
Telling you to chill, why the fuck then I'm sweating
Ok, let’s try and apply a new setting
Grab your hand, tell it ain't over till we’re over
I’m so confused, wish I wasn't sober
Babe, just tell me what you think
Just tell me what tomorrow’s gonna bring
We don’t act like we’re together
,we’re just like: whatever
However you say that you can change
Because word us started to sound strange
Fine babe, let’s get shit rearranged
Fine honey I don’t want us to estrange
I know you want me to take a bow
But I wanna make it batter babe, tell me how
I want what’s best for you, shit I’ll even stay
But we gotta make it different, together find a way
Cos' now all we do
Is we fight and we fuck
It's like we live in Westeros
Love is a game
Love is a game
Love is a game of fucking thrones
