I can't seem to quite get through to you, baby
Looks like your reception isn't too clear
We must be tuned in to 2 different wavelengths
You just don't hear
Get the message that I'm sending
With a heartbeat never-ending?
Can you hear me when you're near me?
Do you read me? Do you need me?
Please receive me, please believe me
'Cause I love you, 'cause I love you
Get the message? Get the message?
What I'm trying to tell you is very simple
They've been communicating this way for years
If you still don't understand what I'm saying
Just look at my tears
Get the message that I'm sending
With a heartbeat never-ending?
Can you hear me when you're near me?
Do you read me? Do you need me?
Please receive me, please believe me
'Cause I love you, 'cause I love you
Get the message? Get the message?
