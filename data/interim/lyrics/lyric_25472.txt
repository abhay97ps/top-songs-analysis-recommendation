A Night... falls, and I'm alone
Skin... yeah, chilled me to the bone
You... turned and you ran, ohh yeah
Oh, slipped... right from my hands
Yeah!
Blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream
Never change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
It's like blue on black
Blind... oh, but now I see
Truth... lies and in between
Ohh Wrong...
Can't be undone
Well it slipped...
From the tip of your tongue...
Yeah!
Blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream
Never change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
It's blue on black
Blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much...
Blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream
Never change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
It's blue on black
Yeah, blue on black
Yeah, it's blue on black
Yeah, blue on black
