Yo, I mean, so, is there a way we can know we're about to record?
Oh there you go, for sure!
Aight, let's go!
We're goin'?
One, two, three, bust it
Oh, baby!
You can touch the stars
But darling please, hold on tight
Oh, baby! 
You can touch the stars 
But darling please, hold on tight
Yo, uh
She wanted pleasure
I gave her feathers, we be fly forever
Baby girl, we could be fly together like that common one song
So we could find forever
I'm hidden, just like the lord's treasure
Chris young bitch, I pull every lever
No one can ever savor
Any competitor thinking that my heav is not fresher
Ever, have I ever been
Her heart, it could be my residence
She like an angel, the chick's probably heaven-sent
Chris young bust rhymes in benevolence
She like you number one, dude, could you get that mood
Listen, baby girl can you feel me sue
She like the freestyles that I do
She said I really like you, you real cute on youtube
I said I'm more than a gimmick, more than a image
We're past the love, way more for the limit
Absorb like a sponge, she felt the tongue
Kissed her oh-one, I became a gold son
Fuck a Chris Young, said you wanna get some
She said baby boy this is where I come from
I said baby girl can you see where you are
Put your hands in the sky, you can touch the stars
Oh, baby! 
You can touch the stars
But darling please, hold on tight 
Oh, baby!
You can touch the stars
But darling please , hold on tight
Take it away...
Yo, she wakes up, touchs stars, felt reality
We should touch the stars, she felt the galaxy
I told her baby, do you see my black soul
Opened up my heart, she felt the black hole
I ain't to mars and I ain't to jupiter
No, I don't _ stupider
Said I'm the cupid for the upiter
Move the lines, so divine, I know, you know
Smooth flow, she tried to make me small like pluto
I told her lady see, you ain't hurtin' me
Oh certainly, gave me the poison like mercury
She said chris young, you murking me
Famous genius, hate to be an anus, but I'm flyer than uranus
She said Chris Young I mean it
The angel here, he has to claim it
She was my love, ever since my birth
Fuck the other planets, she's mother Earth
Vision into wishing to get it inside her purse
For the cash and the stash, what was that wallet worth
Rehearse, disperse, line for the ball
As my boy Alex Rossman plays the guitar
 Who you kid
Baby girl you know what love is 
My flow is benevolant, on the top of the residence
Heaven-sent, dead like the presidents 
Wake me up, need a resurrection
Said baby boy will you be my protection 
I said I'm protection, approclamus
Touch the stars, baby I'm your rocket ship
Oh, baby! 
You can touch the stars 
But darling please, hold on tight 
Oh, baby!
You can touch the stars
But darling please, hold on 
Hold on tight
— Instrumental bridge —
— Background chatter & instrumental continues —
Oh, baby!
You can touch the stars
But darling please, hold on tight
Yo, I came back with a freestyle
To the flow, in the middle of a pee
Now touch the stars, we gon' spit it for the people
Get a sequel, get a prequel
I mean a precall and I can't follow
We made this song _
Put it on facebook, they commented
And I saw deep inside of my conscience
She said don't be developed in nonsense is
The dude Alex Rossman and the dude Chris
We was in the same pledge class
Now the whole world could kiss our ass 
Cause now we got the girls and the star touchin'
Galaxy is in the constellation, beats like concussion
You wanna see son, Jupiter is speaker
Gravity no I and she wanna see the thing
I proposed to her with Saturn's ring
She told me it's gon' blast the king
I'm in a view, new planet, I'm Nibiru
With a alien and a UF-flow
Space in my ship, so she could know
Uh, and that's like that galaxy shit
We're good
Oh, baby!
You can touch the stars 
But darling please, hold on tight
