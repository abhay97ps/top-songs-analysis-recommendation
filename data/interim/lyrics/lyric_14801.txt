Ooh
Ooh, yeah
I've never known someone before
Who feels the way you do
All my dreams somehow came true
With you
And I've never wanted someone more
As much as I want you
Love will last forever, it's true
With you
I will always fear
Awaking in the night
And not having you by my side
We all need love and understanding
And make a love that's everlasting
We'll be as one
I can see it in your eyes
When I looked at him
(And he turned to me
He said you're more than a friend)
To love to need
When I looked at him
(And he held me so tight
When I looked at him it's love)
Eternally
They say I should be acting cool
They tell me I'm a fool
But they don't see the things I see
In you
We cannot forget
The changes we've been through
I could never love someone new
It would tear in two my heart
And we could never be apart
We'll be as one
I can see it in your eyes
When I looked at him
(And he turned to me
He said you're more than a friend)
To love to need
When I looked at him
When I looked at him it's love
Eternally
We all need love and understanding
And make a love that's everlasting
We'll be as one
I can see it in your eyes
When I
Looked at him
To love
To need
When I looked at him
Eternally
When I looked at him
(And he turned to me
He said you're more than a friend)
To love
To need
(When I looked at him
And he held me so tight)
Held me, held me tight
When I
Looked at him
When I looked at him
