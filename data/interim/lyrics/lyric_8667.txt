Dirty old hole in the side of the road
For the man who cleans the streets
Open pub doors where the working class goes at night
Written on walls where the cats never crawl
For the glass along the top
Man, I was born there, I'm gonna walk right back
Costafine Town, it's a fine town, I'm coming home
I feel so lonely, I've been too long away
Costafine Town, it's a fine town, I'm coming home
I wish I'd never made up my mind to stray
Nobody owns all the dirty old clothes
That are lying in the lane
Whistling loud, the 4:30 shift has gone
Little old man with a pole in his hand
Lighting lamps along the way
Hurry me back there, I wish I'd never gone
Costafine Town, it's a fine town, I'm coming home
I feel so lonely, I've been too long away
Costafine Town, it's a fine town, I'm coming home
I wish I'd never made up my mind to stray
From Costafine Town, it's a fine town, I'm coming home
I feel so lonely, I've been too long away
Costafine Town, it's a fine town, I'm coming home
I wish I'd never made up my mind to stray
Costafine Town, it's a fine town, I'm coming home
I feel so lonely, I've been too long away
Costafine Town, it's a fine town, I'm coming home
