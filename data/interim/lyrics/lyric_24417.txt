She don't give a damn 'bout your Benjamin Franklins
She wants Aretha
She don't really care how you're spending your money
It's all how you treat her
She just want a friend to be there
When she opens her eyes in the morning
She wants you to say what you mean and mean everything that you're saying
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That’s how you get with the lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl
She don't give a damn 'bout your pride or the lies that you're hiding behind
She just want to feel that you're real
That she's near to the man that's inside
She don't need to hear she's a queen on a throne
That she's more than amazing
She just wants you to say what you mean and to mean everything that you're saying
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That’s how you get with a lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl
That's how you speak to, speak to her
That's how you speak to, speak to her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That’s how you get with a lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl
That's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
