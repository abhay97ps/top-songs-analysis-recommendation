You've got that smile that only Heaven can make
I'll pray to God every day that you keep that smile
Yeah, you are my dream , there's not a thing I won't do
I'll give my life up for you 'cause you are my dream
And baby, everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely, girl
'Cause you are the only thing that I got right now
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you
Nothing will ever come between us
'Cause I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you
If you had my child 
You would make my life complete 
Just to have your eyes on little me
That'd be mine forever 
And baby, everything that I have is yours 
You will never go cold or hungry 
I'll be there when you're insecure 
Let you know that you're always lovely, girl
'Cause you are the only thing that I got right now
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you 
Nothing will ever come between us
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you
We're made for one another , me and you 
And I have no fear, I know we'll make it through
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you, whoa-oh
One day when the sky is falling 
I'll be standing right next to you 
Right next to you 
Nothing will ever  come between us 
I'll be standing right next to you 
Right next to you 
Oh yeah, stand by my side, side, side 
When the sky falls down
I'll be there, I'll be there
You've got that smile that only Heaven can make
I'll pray to God every day to keep you forever
Oh-oh
