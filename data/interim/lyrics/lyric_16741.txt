Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, I heard  it through grapevyne
I heard it through the grapevine
That you ain't feelin' too fine
And I hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do
You looked into my eyes
You said to me that night
That you would never cheat on me
Or break my heart
Inside I never knew
Your love was so untrue
I thought that I was your only
Boy, was I wrong, so wrong
Never do somethin' that'll catch up to ya
Lovin' me could have been good
I heard it through the grapevine
That you ain't feelin' too fine 
And I hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do  really
Happened on the day I left
Since that day you haven't been the best 
And I hope that you feel much better 
Yes, I do
We choose to play love games
We lose, we face the pain
Those lonely nights and that heartache
That empty space
I'll share with you, my dreams
Those precious tender things
Everybody plays a fool
I guess I played my part for you
Never do somethin' that'll catch up to ya
Lovin' me could have been good
I heard it through the grapevine
That you ain't feelin' too fine
And I hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do  really
Happened on the day I left
Since that day you haven't been the best 
And I hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do
Oh, boy, you had my faith, you had my trust, you had my love
But now I have to take it back, it didn't work for us
And all I really needed was your lovin'
Yes, all I really needed was your lovin'
I was your lady and there's nothin that I would not do
Now here's a Dear John letter that I've written just for you
And all I really needed was your lovin'
Yes, all I really needed was your lovin', hey
Never do somethin' that'll catch up to ya
Never do somethin' that you'll live to regret
Deep in my heart I feel sorry for ya
Lovin' me could have been good
I heard it through the grapevine
That you ain't feelin' too fine
And I hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do 
Happened on the day I left
Since that day you haven't been the best 
And I hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do 
Heard it through, heard it through 
I heard it through that great grapevyne 
Heard it through , heard it through
Grapevyne, grapevyne
