Once I had a little girl, sometimes I think about her
Buddy, you know she's not really there
When memories do call and I just can't live without her, no, no
But tryin' all the time is so hard to bear
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me down
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me down
Now, I don't cry no more, I live while I'm flying
But I'll think back and you can hear me say
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me down
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me down
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me down
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me down
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me down
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker, bringing me down
