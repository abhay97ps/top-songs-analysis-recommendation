I never loved any boy like I loved Johnny Jingo
I never kissed any boy like I kissed Johnny Jingo
Im through with Billy, Willy, Ricky, Dickey, Eddie, Freddie

Ooh what he does what he does to my heart when he holds me
Ooh how I love when he whispers in my ear
This is love, the feeling is zingo, zingo
I never loved any boy like I loved Johnny Jingo
Ooh what he does what he does to my heart when he holds me
Ooh how I love when he whispers in my ear
This is love, the feeling is zingo, zingo
I never loved any boy like I loved Johnny Jingo
Yeah! I never loved any boy like I loved Johnny Jingo
I said Jingo
