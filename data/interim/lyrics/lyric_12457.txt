Friday night, I'd just got back
I had my eyes shut, was dreaming about the past
I thought about you while the radio played
Should've got moving, some reason I stayed
I started drifting to a different place
I realized I was falling off the face of your world
And there was nothing left to bring me back
I'm a million miles away
A million miles away
I'm just a million miles away
And there's nothing left to bring me back today
Took a ride and went downtown
The streets were empty, there was no one around
All the faces that we used to know
And all the places we used to go
I'm at the wrong end of the looking glass
Just trying to hold on to the hands of the past and you
And there's nothing left to bring me back
I was a million miles away
A million miles away
I'm just a million miles away
And there's nothing to bring me back today
Bring me back today
Bring me back today
I started drifting to a different place
I realized I'm falling off the face of your world
And there was nothing left to bring me back
I'm just a million miles away
I'm a million miles away
I'm a million miles away
And there's nothing left to bring me back today
Bring me back today
Bring me back today
Bring me back today
