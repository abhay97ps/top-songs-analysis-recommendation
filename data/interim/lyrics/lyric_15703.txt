Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
When I walked in the gym your man was talkin
Lickin his lips while I was walkin
He called my name to make me smile
Cause his buds were in the gym and I'm walkin with style
So he grabbed my by the arm and pulled me to the side
Said he'd be mine till the day I die
He told me he'd love me till the very end
Hey girl! I got your boyfriend!
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
When I first saw your man, he was really fine, he had a natural shake, it was so devine, he had a red mercedes benz that was drop down low, gold pin stripe it was good to go, it had a gucci rad top, with a system that thumped 30 foot ___ w/ a boom in the trunk, he kissed me on the cheek, and you know that's all he got, now he calls me everyday saying "I like you a lot"
