Need a hand, need a handout
When I make a bet I swear that I never back out
Pay up or you’re ‘bout to be regretting it
There’s a standard and you better start setting it
What do I look like to you? A fool? A bank?
When I’m giving you charity and you can’t give me thanks?
Psychopath with some gas and a light in his hand
Better start running when you’re stabbing a knife in the back!
Running up on you like I’m The Iceman
Violently rhyming and flying trying to fight it
I’m the guy that you would expect to let you trample over
But if you don’t give me what you owe me I’ll start up a riot
You come to me when you need me thinking that I will cower
Cause you’re the best there is and I’m your victim of the hour
But when I tell you no you’re so mad that you don’t have power
Screaming at me but it’s other voices that get louder
I couldn’t imagine being as sad as you
Gonna be droppin’ a couple of bombs all over your latitude
The saddest fool eliminating the baddest dude, I’m glad it’s you
Neck knife and barrel right to your jugular: stab and shoot
I’m tired of hiding so I’ll hide no more
You’re selling lies to everyone, I’ll buy no more
I’ll party alone, as if I’m in the 504
Living an elegant way that I’m dreaming of living as Eleanor
You better start giving me what you owe me or you won’t be living
Hey! Lil’ faggot when I’m speaking to you listen!
I aim for the head and I never be missin’!
Go steal your bitch we be fuckin’ not kissin’!
You praying to God for some help well I’ve been it!
You’re just a snitch, little bitch just admit it!
Say one more word to me, I swear you’re finished!
Need a hand, need a handout
When I make a bet I swear that I never back out
Pay up or you’re ‘bout to be regretting it
There’s a standard and you better start setting it
What do I look like to you? A fool? A bank?
When I’m giving you charity and you can’t give me thanks?
Psychopath with some gas and a light in his hand
Better start running when you’re stabbing a knife in the back!
Running up on you like I’m The Zodiac
Hope you got brought some backup with you today to hold me back
Back up, treat you like I treat the beat when I’m on the track
Not sorry, homie, you owe me
I gave you chances to make things right 
Take the right path and see the light 
Now I gotta find a way to fake the suicide
Cinder block to your ankle tight and throw you in the lake at night
Faggot ass white kid so you bet you can rob me?
I got a butterfly, and a Glock, and a tommy
“Man, it’s all talk,” if that’s the case then come stop me
Book your funeral, go there and see the sobbing from your mommy
“Bobby, he’s gone too soon,” I’m sorry, truly
But it was my doing and it had to be done
Somebody found your body, that just ruins the fun
If the cops have a problem they can come meet my gun
You better start giving me what you owe me or you won’t be living
Hey! Lil’ faggot when I’m speaking to you listen!
I aim for the head and I never be missin’!
Go steal your bitch we be fuckin’ not kissin’!
You praying to God for some help well I’ve been it!
You’re just a snitch, little bitch just admit it!
Say one more word to me, I swear you’re finished!
Need a hand, need a handout
When I make a bet I swear that I never back out
Pay up or you’re ‘bout to be regretting it
There’s a standard and you better start setting it
What do I look like to you? A fool? A bank?
When I’m giving you charity and you can’t give me thanks?
Psychopath with some gas and a light in his hand
Better start running when you’re stabbing a knife in the back!
