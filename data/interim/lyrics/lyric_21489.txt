Seems like I was walkin' in the wrong direction
I barely recognize my own reflection, oh
Scared of love but scared of life alone
Seems I've been playin' on the safe side, baby
Buildin' walls around my heart to save me, oh
But it's time for me to let it go
Yeah, I'm ready to feel now
No longer am I 'fraid of the fall down
It must be time to move on now
Without the fear of how it might end
I guess I'm ready to love again
Just when you think that love will never find you
You run away, but still, it's right behind you, oh
It's just somethin' that we can't control
Yeah, I'm ready to feel now
No longer am I 'fraid of the fall down
It must be time to move on now
Without the fear of how it might end
I guess I'm ready to love again
So come and find me
I'll be waitin' up for you
I'll be holdin' out for you tonight
Yeah, I'm ready to feel now
No longer am I 'fraid of the fall down
It must be time to move on now
Without the fear of how it might end
I guess I'm ready... ready to love again
Ooh, I'm ready to love again
