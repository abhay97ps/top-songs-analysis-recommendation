Verse 1 :
To keep it real
I don't even know who to trust
Uh
I stay out of the way and
Lay in the cut
Uh
Don’t hit my phone today cuz I ain't picking up
They saying that I work too much
But I don't think I’ve done enough
I was still in the garage
Tryna make six milly off of like 16 bars
All black on my body
So you can't see these scars
Uh
Yeah...
Seeing the payment
Please just pray my patience  I...
Get on these beats & I execute them with excellence my....
Predicament that made me somewhat of a pessimist why...
Do all these suckas want to deconstruct my progress I....
Don't hit the blunt
I hit the booth whenever I'm stressed I'm...
Still putting on for a city that don't reciprocate
Couldn't even give me ten dollars for the take
But you got $200 dollars to go and see Drake
Fake love, Fake Love, straight up to my faaaaceeee
Uh
I'm unimpressed by these perpetrators
But I ain’t pressed cuz I’m one of the best with this pen and paper it's.....
Only a matter of time
Before they recognize a real
That’s right in front of they eyes
Ain't no fake over here
Keep it 100 with mine
And to all the BS
I'm dumb, deaf, and I'm blind
That B-Dub on the rise
The whole team finna shine
How you expecting to ball?
If you don’t work like Lebron?
Man you gotta go get it
It ain't gone fall out the sky
Uh
Yeah yeah
It ain't gone fall out the sky
Look
Ten years in it
Been grinding before my growth spurt
The kid got more drive then the show-fur
Told my momma when I get older
That this little planet called earth
I was finna take over
And this is ain't cocky
The confidence is just overt
They think I'm stuck up
Cuz I be bumping my own work
Verse 2 :
Stuck up no I don't think
Strung out no I don't know
Bent out of shape on broken roads
And I don't mow on other lawns
No pawn I'm a queen and I mean
For myself by any means
Sanity I keep for my health
And I meld to the mold
Oh behold and bow down
To the master of the sounds
That make you feel
Every type of thing, every type of way
Every type of being, know you're gonna stay
Know you need to stay, know you can't lay
Down besides anyone else no one else will
Motivate your dreams the way I can
No plan can beat my genius it slides in
Short notice, creeps up call it perfect shot all wins
Just know on empty plates, I fill my soul and feed my tomb
Absurd it is to know the waking moments of the truth
What's the price for excellence? x5
Didn't know the price for living life was life in order to make moves
Name your price, know your price, yah, yah,keep it cool
Think twice, think twice
Before estimating me, think twice
Think twice, think twice, before your beat
