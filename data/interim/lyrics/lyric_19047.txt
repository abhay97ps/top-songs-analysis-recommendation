It's like the most amazing sunset
You've ever seen
There's never another quite the same
It just falls into some eternal sea
Like the end of a movie that makes you cry
You're sad when it's over
But you're glad you had
That moment that moved you deep inside
Beautiful goodbye, baby, goodbye
I enjoyed the ride
We really had us a time
It's a strange kinda high
A beautiful goodbye
I'm standing here watching you drive away
We were so grown up about it all
But how will it look in the light of day?
I miss you already, but don't turn around
It's funny how you know when it just won't work
And how letting go can make the sweetest sound
Beautiful goodbye, baby, goodbye
I enjoyed the ride
We really had us a time
It's a strange kinda high
A beautiful goodbye
So ironic, it's so confusing
To do the right thing and be losin
I'm always stuck with choosin
Ain't that just like life?
Hey yeah
Hey yeah yeah
Beautiful goodbye, baby, goodbye
I enjoyed the ride
We really had us a time
It's a strange kinda high
A beautiful goodbye
Goodbye, yeah
Na na na na, na na na na
Na na na na na na goodbye
Na na na na, na na na na
Na na na na na na goodbye
