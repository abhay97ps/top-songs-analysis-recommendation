Used to call you mom but now I call you wifey
There's no death row but I'm doing it for a lifey
Now we're on a honeymoon chillin' in Hawaii
And whenever we kissed, man she so spicy
Get over here, get your mind right
Diamond ring, take my name take my last one
Quavo, you should take your mask off
We should take our pants off
We should make a dance up
Put my ass in a Tesla
Give you all my best love
You make me feel special
That's why I'm down for forever
Something just feels right
When we're together
I think I want to stay here with you for, forever
For, forever, forever and ever and ugh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, forever
Oh, oh-oh, oh, forever
See lot of thangs, been around the block
I'll be the best uncle just give me one shot
Just nine months, keep tryin' don't stop
'Cause family vloggers are so hot
What's next? I don't know
When it comes to uncles I'll be the best
I'll beat the rest
I'll save the marriage, I stop the stress
All the women like the way I dress
What's next?
Twins in a stroller
Amusement parks and roller coaster
What will I do when they get older?
Strong like winds so I can whip the stroller
Get over here, get your mind right
Diamond ring, say my name take my last one
Quavo, you should take your mask off
We should take our pants off
We should make a dance up
Put my ass in a Tesla
Give you all my best love
You make me feel special
That's why I'm down for forever
Something just feels right
When we're together
I think I want to stay here with you for, forever
For, forever, forever and ever and ugh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, forever
Oh, oh-oh, oh, forever
They'll be screaming out "Jerika!"
All across America
I think I wanna marry you
I think that's what I gotta do
Let's make some babies, don't be shy
You've been treated badly but I'm your guy
If you were a dude I think I'd die
I think I would fly 'cause I'm your guy
So cute, wanna eat you like a chicken thigh
So sweet, just call this shit apple pie
Our love through the roof and out the flippin' sky
Conversations got me like oh my oh my
Uncle Kade in the shed, that shit no lie
Scuba divin' on an island with my diamond like Rihanna
Conversations so amazin', we're just talkin' 'bout my husband
Counting up all my blessings, yeah we do this every hour
Concentration automatic, Wonder Woman, super power
When we're together
I think I want to stay here with you for, forever
Something just feels right
When we're together
I think I want to stay here with you for, forever
For, forever, forever and ever and ugh
