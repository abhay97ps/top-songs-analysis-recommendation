In the early rush of morning
Trying to get the kids to school
One's hanging on my shirt-tail
Another's locked up in her room
And I'm yelling up the stairs
"Stop worrying about your hair, you look fine"
Then they're fighting in the backseat
And I'm playing referee
Now someone's got to go
The moment that we leave
And everybody's late
I swear that I can't wait until they grow up
Then they do, and that's how it is
It's just quiet in the morning
Can't believe how much you miss
All they do and all they did
You want all the dreams they dreamed of to come true
Then they do
Now the youngest is starting college
She'll be leaving in the Fall
And Brianna's latest boyfriend
Called to ask if we could talk
And I got the impression
That he's about to pop the question any day
I look over at their pictures
Sitting in their frames
I see them as babies
I guess that'll never change
You pray all their lives
That someday they will find happiness
No more Monday PTA's
No carpools, or soccer games
Your work is done
Now you've got time that's all your own
You've been waiting for so long
For those days to come
Ah, then they do
