Buddy you and me go way back
Camp Lejeune, all through high school
And before that
So I don't mind telling you I'm scared to death
The doctor's going in on the 25th
It's the same thing my daddy had
Thank God they caught it fast
But if something should happen
Stop in sometime and say hello to Katherine
You and Mary Anne could always keep her laughing
She's going to need a lot of that
Take her out to a movie
Its going to take some time before she's back on her feet
I know you think that I'll be fine and I'm talking crazy
But there's always that chance
That's why I'm asking
If something should happen
Little Nathan's growing up so fast
This November he'll turn 10
He wants to play quarterback
I'm supposed to coach his team this fall
But I may not get to after all
He's going to need someone to catch a pass
And to throw it back
If something should happen
Oh promise me you'll take that boy out camping
Throw a line out in that water every now and then
Answer any question that he has
Maybe once he gets older
You can sit and have that first cold beer together
And tell him a couple stories on his father
He's always known you were my best friend
That's why I'm asking
If something should happen
I hope I live until I'm 80
And I get to see my son get married
And have babies
And make a million more memories with my wife
Yeah buddy I pray alright
But if its my time to leave
Would you watch over them for me?
If something should happen
If something should happen
Mm hmm hmm
