I'm checking out of Hotel Loneliness
All my lonely days, they're all through
I'm checking into Hotel Happiness 
Because, darlin', I found you
I left my teardrops in that old lonely room
Left my broken heart  back there, too
I won't be needin' them in Hotel Happiness 
'cause, darling, I found you
I woke up  dreamin' of your crazy kisses  
I woke up  tellin' Mr. Misery "Here's your key" 'cause
I'm checking out of Hotel Loneliness
And no, I won't be back, yes it's true
Gonna make my new address at Hotel Happiness 
You know why, darlin', so glad I found you
No more, make my new address at Hotel Happiness
'cause, darlin', I found you
