Gone tomorrow, one day closer to your heart
Lost around me, is time in itself when you're near
Take the time, I'll show you the love I've for you
You're too young, to know what it is that I feel
All that I can do is wait for you...Just wait for you
All that I can do is wait for you...Just wait for you
Full of sorrow, your eyes are too wide and too new
All I know is these feelings I get when you're near
Keep in mind, I can't give you love without fear
You're too young, I don't know what's keeping me here
All that I can do is wait for you...Just wait for you
All that I can do is wait for you...Just wait for you
All that I can do is wait for you...Just wait for you
All that I can do is wait for you...Just wait for you
All that I can do...ooooooh...oooooooooh...
