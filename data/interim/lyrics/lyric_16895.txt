Aw, girl, what's up? Aw, not again
So you're packin' your bags and you're leaving?
But that ain't right
You need to stay a while, think about it
But wait a minute, before you go
There's just one thing I want you to know
We both agree that this love ain't what it used to be
We just grew apart
I got nothin' but love for you, baby
Girl, you'll always be my heart
It's gonna to be strange living without you
Ain't felt so empty before, no
See, I miss your smile and even your fussin'
When I left my clothes on the floor, oh, baby, say now
I'm gonna miss your face 
I'm gonna miss your moods 
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you
And even though you haven't gone yet, I'm already missing you 
It's hard to say goodbye , but things will be better
You go your way and I will go mine
Let's keep in touch, let me know how you're doing
Girl, things will change in time, said
Don't want you to leave, keep sayin' I'm sorry
But I guess I'm repeating myself
Girl, you know I'm here when you need a shoulder
I can't see you in the arms of someone else, oh, baby
I'm gonna miss your face 
I'm gonna miss your moods 
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you
And even though you haven't gone yet, I'm already missing you 
I'm gonna miss your face 
I'm gonna miss your moods 
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you 
And even though you haven't gone yet, I'm already missing you 
Already missin' you 
See, I know you're leavin' soon, baby
Already missin' you 
And I don't think I can live without you, baby, yeah, sun set 
Even though you haven't gone 
I'm missin' you 
Gonna cry, I'm gonna be lonely
Missin' you, baby 
Funny face, funny face 
I know 'cause it's your style 
You know I see your face 
I know you're gettin' ready to leave
Not a thing gonna make me happy
The way I miss your style, baby 
I never thought you'd leave me, baby
I never thought you'd go
It's gonna be strange livin' without you, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
You know my name when you need a shoulder
I'll miss you, baby 
I'll miss you, girl
I'll miss you, sugar
I'll miss you, girl
I'll miss your smilin', baby
Smile for me, baby
Before you leave, before you leave
Smile, girl
Smile, baby
Smile, girl
