Ha-ah, ha-ah, ha-ah!
I am Sir Nose D'Voidoffunk
I can't swim
I never could swim
I never will swim
Oh, put me down!
Let go my leg! 
I told ya...will you shut up!...I told ya I can't swim!  Ha hOwww no!
Put me down, I hate water, ho
Will you shut up!
 Never learned to swim
Can't catch the rhythm of the stroke
 Why should I hold my breath
Feelin' that I might choke 
Things ya blow through, because of things ya swim through
Why hold your nose to spite your face 
With the rhythm that it takes to dance to what we have to live through
You can dance underwater and not get wet, OH!!!

I hate water, let me go, put me down!  Hah-ho
You're all wet!
 Never mean to drown
  Can't comprehend all the strokes
  Why should I hold my breath?
   Feelin' that I might choke! Oh!
  There's a magic rhythm one with a real drum
 Why blow your nose to spite your face
With the rhythm it takes to dance to what we have to live through
 You can dance underwater and not get wet
Boogie with who?  
I am the Nose 
I don't swim
I don't dance  
I don't swim or dance  
I'm too cool to swim,  or dance
I might get my hair wet 
I don't even sweat 
I'm cool
Go head wit 'cho funk!
Put me down
Turn me loose!
Ahh, let go my leg, I hate water! 
Oh,  leave me alone
You're crazy!
Ohhh.....hah ... stop it!
Oh there you go again
Oh it feels good, oh it feels good!
Oh it feels good
I am the Nose, leave me alone
