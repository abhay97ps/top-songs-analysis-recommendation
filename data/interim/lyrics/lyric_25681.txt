Ooh, yeah, yeah, hey
Such a long time 
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time 
Such a long time
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time 
Such a long time 
Ooh, this shit bliss, I'm so rich 
Abs like Abercrombie Fitch 
Mille, on my 
Versace boxers on my dick 
Bud Light runnin' through my piss 
On a yacht, 50 meters, it's offish 
50 carats on my fist 
The roof go down when I hit switch 
I money ball like Bradley Pitt 
I worked so hard for all this shit 
Pumpin' out classics 
In the Batmobile, goin' bat shit
Such a long time 
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time 
Such a long time 
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time 
Such a long time
I'm in Saint-Tropez, I had to check wrist 
I just bought my girl a new necklace 
One, two, three, four, five, six 
I'll take 'em all, don't matter what the price is 
I said I'm sorry mama for my vices 
You'll never understand what my life is 
One, two, three, four, five, six 
Shit, I'm checking off my bucket list 
You try to give advice, I don't need it
I've been doin' what I want since fetus
What you call a holiday , I call another day 
And I ain't ever stoppin', no apologies
Such a long time 
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time 
Such a long time 
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time 
Such a long time
I'm in Saint-Tropez, I had to check wrist
