Hey, buddies that I grew up with
All straight-laced and married up now
You ain't foolin' me, wasn't long ago
We tore the roof off that one red light town
And hey, darlin', sippin' that red wine
All classy, kicked back on the couch
You smile and I see ya shootin' tequila
Us shuttin' them college bars down
And no matter how much time goes by
And no matter how much we grow up
For worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young
And hey, babies, crawlin’ on the carpet
No, you won’t be that little for long
One day, you’ll move away, but you’re still gonna stay
This innocent after you’re gone
'Cause no matter how much time goes by
And no matter how much you grow up
For worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I hope when we get to Heaven
He looks at us all like we're kids
Shameless and painless and perfect and ageless
Forgives all the wrong that we did
And no matter how much time goes by
I hope we never have to grow up
We'll say for worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young
Whoa-oh-oh, oh
I'll always remember you young
