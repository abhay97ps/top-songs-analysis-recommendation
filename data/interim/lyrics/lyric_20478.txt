I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Adore you, and want you so
I'm just a no one
With nothing to give you but, oh
I love you
You, you buy her diamonds
Bright, sparkling diamonds
But believe me, hear what I say
That she can give you the world
But she'll never love you the way
I love you
He can take you any place he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
But I can only watch you with
My nose pressed up against the window pane
I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Must watch you go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else
When darling, it's I
Who loves you
I love you
I love you
I love you
