Get all the homies to bounce
Switch from the bed to the couch
And get to know how I'm feelin' inside
So much conversation, words so sweet
Been so well-behaved, but, boy, I'm weak
Yeah, my body's gotta say something to you
That's one way to tell I speak the truth
Don't wanna wait on it 
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
What you waitin' for?
