I need somebody who's consistent with me
Someone already there when I need company
'Cause when I'm feeling low
I don't wanna have to go out looking for a part time love
And when the dreams and rainbows start to disappear
I don't want somebody up and running out of here
'Cause when you stop and start, 
Baby, it's just too hard upon my heart.  
That part time kind of love
 I can't take you, darling, living here
Wait and see
I want somebody who's committed now to me
Mmmm, hmmm
 Somewhere,  someday, you got to take a chance
 If you like the music, baby
Get up and dance
If we go together daring to dream
I know we're gonna find our share of peaches and cream
And when the juice is low, 
I don't want no, no, no excuses.  
Just want your full time love for me
 Just want your full time love for me
