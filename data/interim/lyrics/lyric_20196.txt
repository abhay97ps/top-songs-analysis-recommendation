Mm hmm
I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in your touch
I know that you're scared
But you've never been this loved 
It's a long shot, baby
I know it's true
But if anyone can make it
I'm betting on me and you. 
Just keep on moving into me
I know you're going to see
The best is yet to come
And don't fear it now
We're going all the way
That sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down
And it's a leap of faith
But we're never giving up
Because I know we've got a once in a lifetime love
Everybody's looking
For what we've found
Some wait their whole life
And it never comes around 
So don't hold back now
Just let go of all you've ever known
You can put your hand in mine
And don't fear it now
We're going all the way
That sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down
And it's a leap of faith
But we're never giving up
Because I know we've got a once in a lifetime love
I close my eyes and I see you standing right there
Saying I do and they're throwing the rice in our hair
Well the first one's born
And a brother comes along
And he's got your smile
I've been looking back on the life we had
I'm still by your side
And don't fear it now
We're going all the way
That sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down
And it's a leap of faith
But we're never giving up
Because I know we've got a once in a lifetime love
