When I fall in love
It  will be forever
Or  I'll never fall in love
In a restless world
Like this is
Love  is ended before its begun
And  too many moonlight kisses
Sing too cool in the warmth of the sun
When  I give my heart
It will be completely
Or I'll never give
My heart
And  the moment
I can feel that
You feel that way too
That's when I'll fall
In love with you
