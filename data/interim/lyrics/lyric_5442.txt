You jump in front of my car when you
You know all the time that
Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain
You say you just want me to take you for a drive
You're just like 
So hard to get through to you
I don't need to run over you
All you do is slow me down
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run
Tire tracks all across your back
I can ha, I can see you had your fun
But uh, darling can't you see my signals turn from green to red
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead
You're just like 
So hard to get through to you
I don't need to run over you
All you do is slow me down
And I got better things on the other side of town
Yeah, yeah
Look out, 
Look out baby, comin through
Yeah yeah, 
 yeah, 
Look out, look out baby
Yeah, 
What's that on the street?
Move over
