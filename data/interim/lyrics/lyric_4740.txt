Baby, my heart is breaking
And there's no hope, no hope inside
The sky is an ocean of darkness
No one, no one, no one to hold me
In the lonely night
Tell me, how can I
Oh, how can I forget you, oh
How can I go to sleep
When I know that I love you
I love you and always will
 oh, heart be still
 heart be still
 heart keep still now
 oh, yes, baby
 when you're lonely
 oh, oh 
And you're feeling so blue
 I want you to think it over
 baby, just think it over
 oh, think about
All the love that I gave to you
Oh, no, you'll never, never have to be alone
 my arms are waiting, yeah
 come back home, baby
 come back home, baby
Oh, oh, my arms are waiting
 oh, heart keep still be now
 maybe, maybe
You'll come backs some day
 heart keep still, yeah
 listen here, baby
Let me tell you something
 if you ever need me
 oh, if you ever want me
 you know the way, baby
 I ask you to now
 baby, baby...
