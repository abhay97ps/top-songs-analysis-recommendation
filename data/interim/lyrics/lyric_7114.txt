I know you think you're out of sight
'Cause all of the girls really like you
And just because of that build you got
You think no girl can refuse you
I'll bet you do, oh yes you do
But I've got some news for you now
You need somebody to tell you 
You need somebody to tell you 
You need somebody to tell you 
You think you're hot stuff
But in my book, you're not hot enough now
You think you're hot stuff
But I'm the one who's gonna cool you off
When the other girls looked at you
I know how they got fooled
Their mistake was they got carried away
And they didn't know what to do now
Baby, baby, I know what you're after
But I know what you're not gonna get
You just need somebody to tell you 
You need somebody to tell you 
You need somebody to tell you 
You think you're hot stuff
But in my book, you're not hot enough now
You think you're hot stuff
But I'm the one who's gonna cool you off
Yes I am now
Many girls have been fooled
By too many men like you
And it's about time you got put in your place
And it's just what I'm gonna do now
I know I've got to give my love to some man
But you can bet it won't be you
'Cause you need somebody to tell you 
You just need somebody to tell you 
You need somebody to tell you 
You think you're hot stuff
But in my book, you're not hot enough now
You think you're hot stuff
But I'm the one who's gonna cool you off
You think you're hot stuff
But in my book, you're not hot enough now
You think you're hot stuff
But I'm the one who's gonna cool you off
You think you're hot stuff
But in my book, you're not hot enough now
You think you're hot stuff...
