I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl that you could be down for
'Cause when I look at you, I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on
And if I don't let you know, then I won't be for real
I could be wrong, but I feel like something could be going on
The more I see you, the more that it becomes so true
There ain't no other for me, it's only you 
I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down 
I wanna be down with you 
No matter the time 
Of day or night, it's true 
I wanna be down
I know anybody's gonna be lonely
Without the reason they got someone to care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on
If that's a fact, then I'll be more than you ever could dream of
If all you need is my time, that I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my love until you want me, baby
I wanna stay by your side
Be there to cool you out
And let you know everything will be alright
I wanna be down 
With what you're going through 
I wanna be down 
I wanna be down with you 
No matter the time 
Of day or night, it's true 
I wanna be down 
I wanna be down
With what you're going through 
I wanna be down 
I wanna be down with you 
No matter the time 
Of day or night, it's true 
I wanna be down 
Down, down, down
Oh yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Down, down, down, down, down
I wanna be down 
With what you're going through 
I wanna be down 
I wanna be down with you 
No matter the time 
Of day or night, it's true
I wanna be down 
I wanna be down 
With what you're going through 
I wanna be down 
I wanna be down with you 
No matter the time 
Of day or night, it's true 
I wanna be down 
I wanna be down 
With what you're going through 
I wanna be down 
I wanna be down with you 
No matter the time 
Of day or night, it's true 
I wanna be down 
I wanna be down 
With what you're going through 
I wanna be down 
I wanna be down with you 
No matter the time 
Of day or night, it's true 
I wanna be down
