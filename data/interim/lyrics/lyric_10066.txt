Short people got no reason
Short people got no reason
Short people got no reason to live
They got little hands, little eyes
They walk around tellin' great big lies
They got little noses, tiny little teeth
They wear platform shoes on their nasty little feet
Well, I don't want no short people
Don't want no short people
Don't want no short people â€˜round here
A fool such as I
It's a wonderful world
Short people got nobody
Short people got nobody
Short people got nobody to love
They got little baby legs, they stand so low
You got to pick 'em up just to say hello
They got little cars that go beep, beep, beep
They got little voices goin' peep, peep, peep
They got grubby little fingers and dirty little minds
They're gonna get you every time
Well, I don't want no short people
Don't want no short people
Don't want no short people 'round here
