Friends of mine try to change
My mind about loving you
They say I made a bad mistake
So I stop  and I listen
Giving up just ain't no way
I'm like a man stranded on an island
Where's the nobody but me and you
Oh, it just couldn't be no better
I'd like to live here forever
And I just got to tell you
And I just got to tell you
I just got to tell you
Never gonna let you go
I like your loving, do you like mine
I like your loving, do you like mine
I like your loving, do you like mine
I like your loving, do you like mine
I'm like a man stranded on an island
Well, there ain't nobody there
But me and you, no, no
Oh, it just couldn't be no better
I'd like to live here forever
And I just got to tell you
And I just got to tell you
And I just got to tell you
Never gonna let you go
