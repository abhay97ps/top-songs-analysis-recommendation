Goodnight, my love
Pleasant dreams
And sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me
Before you go
There's just one thing
I'd like to know
Is your love still warm for me
Or has it grown cold
If you should awake
In the still of night
Please have no fear
For I'll be there
Oh, you know I care
Please give your love to me, dear
Goodnight, my love
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight
My love 
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me
Close your eyes, my love
Sleep and dream of me
My love, my love, my love
My love, oh, my love
