Our love will never be another
You're just a devil undercover 
Found you when you were in the gutter 
Shit was sweet until I was a sucker, shout out Jonas Brothers
I learned more than I cared to discover 
Don't you know that I'm more than a come up? 
You act up and then act like it's nothin' 
Sold your soul, you stone cold, you a stunner 
Every time you left , shit was never right 
In another bed  every single night 
Had it to a science , you were so precise 
See it in your eyes , saw you in the light 
Somehow, mami, I still want you
Listen to me, don't drive away 
Kill me softly, your hold on me is 
Somethin' I can't explain
I know you could never be my bitch 
Shit could never be like this 
I know, stop thinkin' you're in my plans 
Hunnid times you blew another chance 
I know you were gettin' down on the low 
Then runnin' back to me in the morning 
I know shit could never be like this
You could never be my bitch
No, no
Our love will never be another 
You're just a devil undercover 
Found you when you were in the gutter 
Shit was sweet until I was a sucker 
Rather be single for life 
Than be fuckin' with you
I ain't rollin' the dice, no 
I ain't playin' to lose 
Every time you left, shit was never right 
In another bed  every single night 
Had it to a science, you were so precise 
See it in your eyes, saw you in the light 
Somehow, mami, I still want you 
Listen to me, don't drive away 
Kill me softly, your hold on me is 
Somethin' I can't explain
I know you could never be my bitch 
Shit could never be like this 
I know, stop thinkin' you're in my plans 
Hunnid times you blew another chance 
I know you were gettin' down on the low 
Then runnin' back to me in the morning
I know shit could never be like this 
You could never be my bitch
No, no
Be my bitch
It could never be like this
Shit could never be like this
It could never be like this
