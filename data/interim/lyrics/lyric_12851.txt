A voice inside my car told me today
There was a song of love they would not play
She was black, he was white
A voice inside my car told me today
Black stations, white stations break down the doors
Stand up and face the music, this is 1984
Black stations, white stations feet on the floor
Dance on the ceiling with us, this is 1984, ha!
When I dream, I dream in black and white
Trip the light fantastic through the night
Dance with me while they sleep
When I dream, I dream in black and white
Black stations, white stations break down the doors
Stand up and face the music, this is 1984
Black stations, white stations feet on the floor
Dance on the ceiling with us, this is 1984, ha!
If waves could speak, I wonder what they'd say
The tides are growing stronger everyday
Sink or swim, let them in
If waves could speak, I wonder what they'd say
Black stations, white stations break down the doors
Stand up and face the music, this is 1984
Black stations, white stations feet on the floor
Dance on the ceiling with us, this is 1984, ha!
Black stations, white stations break down the doors
Stand up and face the music, this is 1984
Black stations, white stations feet on the floor
Dance on the ceiling with us, this is 1984, ha!
She was black, he was white
She was black, he was white
She was black, he was white
She was black, he was white
