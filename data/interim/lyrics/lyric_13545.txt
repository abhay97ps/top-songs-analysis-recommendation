Nobody knows
The trouble you feel
Nobody cares
The feeling is real
Johnny, we're sorry
Won't you come on home?
We worry
Won't you come on?
What is wrong in my life that I must get drunk every night?
Johnny, we're sorry
Use the phone
Call your mom
She's missing you badly
Missing her son
Who do you know?
Where will you stay?
Big city life
Is not what they say
Johnny, we're sorry
Won't you come on home?
We worry
Won't you come on?
What is wrong in my life that I must get drunk every night?
Johnny, we're sorry
You'd better go
Everything's closed
Can't find a room
Money's all blown
Nowhere to sleep
Out in the cold
Nothing to eat
Nowhere to go
Johnny, we're sorry
Won't you come on home?
We worry
Won't you come on?
What is wrong in my life that I must get drunk every night?
Johnny , we're sorry
Won't you come on home?
We worry
Won't you come on home?
Johnny , won't you come on home?
We worry, won't you come on home?
