Yo
It's lit
*Run it*
[Verse 1: HighRise}
Started with a hunnit mother fuckers my clique
25 fell off and 25 turned bitch
49 turned Steelers on some Roethlessberger shit
I got 99 problems and a hunnit round clip
Pay em with a bullet and make change
99 shells spent flips George to Abe
I swear I only need a penny to stay paid
Cuz every penny that I spend is a Benji made
And that's blood money, never run money
Feed the family on my in da cud money
Serving bloody Mary's to these bloody hunnies
Tell them bitches cut a fucking rug money
I'm addicted to cash that's drug money
These fiends see the stash, want a cut from me
Bouta step on the gas and pop the clutch money
I broke outta rehab, this is run money
Dime bags out the dollar store
You got 50 cent? You need 50 more
Run it to the bank and get it out the jar
By the time you're back shit I flipped the floor
I got a hunnit skills, I got a hunnit trades
Seen a hunnit ladies, that's a bunch of cake
Two hunnit pounds, I'm under double dames
Lift them meaty bitches I done raised the steaks
A1 sauce, got it on deck 
And she can suck it off me gim'me good neck 
I can count a hunnit ways that she can make me cum next
And 99 are everything butt sex
Count up the bottles a hunnit of em on the wall
I started pulling from the bottom and making em all fall
I think I muddy my liver, I think I'm a hunnit a sinner
I think I'll run with the killers, and at a hunnit still ball
25 I'm livin' life 
25 still roll the dice 
25 shots got me feelin' right 
Won't catch me servin' 25 to life
I'mma keep it hunnit till the day I die
I been the illest around the city
Don’t need a second opinion I kill it
They got my pity I’m in it
I’m feelin' the feelin' of when
I'm young and feelin' myself
My records are gonna sell and yours will sit on the shelf
Oh lord, tell me really are you feelin' the pain?
I got em all up in arms over the feelin' I bring
Killin' the brain, novocaine
Full of venomous rage
Doper than the funny shit they be shovin' in veins 
Tell em I’m feelin' the yay
Pull up in Hotwheels and leave with ya bae 
I do not care what they say
Ice on my wrist got the wickedest sprain
Top droppin' back like it’s Curry in paint
Bad lookin' broad tell her do something similar
Illest and vicious and bringin' the pain
Burnin' they asses like cinnamon enimas
A1 for day ones, check it
All about the pay stub, get it
Booty like a bass drum, hit it
Told a nigga say sum, wit it 
I’m all in, I’m ballin', like Spaulding
Cheeky motherfucker with all of the fingers frost bit
Long bib, I’m saucin', and bossin'
Lick game crazy they thinkin' I fuckin' lost it
But you don’t know nothin' about me
If you not my clique get the fuck from around me
I’m drownin' in niggas that told me they doubt me
That turned life support like I can’t live without em, shit
But I don’t hear none of it
All of the shit you think is hard, I’m making fun of it
Niggas on funny shit, if you not with it, shit
Might as well run from it
21 and I don’t need a manager, 
20 1’s is what I fuckin' handed her 
I got 20 drums for misunderstandings bruh 
21 and I bet I’m savager
17 more cause I’m bad at adding, been a hunnit
I keep it a hunnit, I'm charged up
There's a couple trees that you shouldn't bark up
Fake is something that I'm far from
I been through it, you can see the scars bruh
Got a hunnit problems, want more than hoes
Made a 100k and I bought a rose
Made a hunnit more and I bought a rollie
When I make a hunnit more Imma buy the globe
Two places at the same time
I been sippin' on the grape wine
I heard a lot of shit through the grape vine
I found out good things take time
A hunnit bars when I'm in the booth
The liquor that I'm sippin' is a hunnit proof
In my life I broke a hunnit rules
Check my closet, got a hunnit shoes
Hit the road and I make fifty bands
By twenty-five I'll be a millionaire
Shorty 5'5" and she really bad
I keep shit a hunnit til the day I'm dead
Hit the road and I make fifty bands
By twenty-five I'll be a millionaire
Shorty 5'5" and she really bad
I keep shit a hunnit til the day I'm dead
25 I'm livin' life 
25 still roll the dice 
25 shots got me feeling right 
Won't catch me servin' 25 to life
I'mma keep it hunnit till the day I die
