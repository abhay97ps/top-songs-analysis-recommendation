Makers
Run that back, Turbo
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Designer head to toe 
I sip to the head and float 
I already bagged the pole 
You niggas too scared to go 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I clean up like hands and soap 
Get a mink, let it drag on the floor 
It's a nine in the bag that I tote 
Workin' hard, we ain't havin' no hope 
Bitch, I'm the man 
Did it with no advance 
Gave my nigga a chance 
Tryna see what he gon' do 
He done ran up them bands 
I done got me some bands too 
I could drip on the 'Gram too 
Said my hood like the damn zoo 
I can't decide, which foreign car I'ma ride, mmh
That Phantom Rolls body is wide 
I made the boy bleed like the watts, mmh
I put some more rocks in the watch 
Middle finger to the cops, mmh
Me against the world like 2Pac 
Say the wrong word, get you shot 
The whole world love you when you hot 
Thank God, He gave me a shot 
The same ones that thought I was shy 
I took off and went straight to the top 
You can't feel me, a nigga too high 
You need to stop livin' a lie 
You know we keep sticks like the Chi' 
I knew I'd be rich 'fore I die 
They won't respect you 'til you try
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Designer head to toe 
I sip to the head and float 
I already bagged the pole 
You niggas too scared to go 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I clean up like hands and soap 
Get a mink, let it drag on the floor 
It's a nine in the bag that I tote 
Workin' hard, we ain't havin' no hope 
I got luck like a charm 
Fifty racks on her arm 
My tsunami a storm 
I stay fly, I was airborne 
Fuck these hoes like it's porn 
I get higher than Osborne 
I like captions for tourin' 
Gettin' money is so important 
Niggas thought I was done 
Oh, I can go on and on 
My car is a foreign 
I crank up and start soarin' 
My heart is torn 
Shoot a movie like Barry Gordon 
A star was born 
My left wrist like a damn storm 
My life a lil' fun 
Ain't no one of my hoes boring 
Got Chanel by the ton 
More Sheneneh than Martin Lawrence 
Skinny jeans with a gun 
Play with me, it's a whole war 
I ain't finished or done 
We got some, but we come to get more 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Designer head to toe 
I sip to the head and float 
I already bagged the pole 
You niggas too scared to go 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I clean up like hands and soap 
Get a mink, let it drag on the floor 
It's a nine in the bag that I tote 
Workin' hard, we ain't havin' no hope 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
