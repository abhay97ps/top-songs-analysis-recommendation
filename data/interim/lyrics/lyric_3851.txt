Neighbor, neighbor, don't wonder what goes on in my home
You're always lookin' for somethin' to gossip about
You're goin' around from door to door
Runnin' your mouth about things you don't know
Neighbor, neighbor, don't wonder what goes on in my home
Neighbor, neighbor, don't worry how I make my bread
'Cause my success is drivin' you out of your head
You got in those troubles, my trouble, too
Something bad's gonna happen to you
Neighbor, neighbor, don't worry what goes on in my home
Neighbor, neighbor, don't worry how I treat my wife
Quit tellin' ev'rybody we fuss and fight ev'ry night
You're sweepin', peepin' through the hall
Keepin' your big ears glued to my wall
Neighbor, neighbor, don't worry what goes on in my home
Neighbor, neighbor, don't worry who knocks on my front door
You're walkin', a-talkin', a-pacin' all over the floor
You're sweepin', peepin' through the hall
Keepin' your big ears glued to my wall
Neighbor, neighbor, don't worry who goes in and out of my door
Tend to your business
Leave mine alone
Neighbor,  neighbor
