I drink sweet wine for breakfast
I slept but an hour or so
I smiled a little in the silence
Deciding on where to go
"Meet me under the whale
At the natural history museum"
I think that's what she said
A little bit sad about having to leave them
Yawning in the sun
It's like a child I run
Don't do it if you don't want to
I wouldn't do a thing like that
Now don't do it if you don't want to
I wouldn't do a thing like that
So little do you think of beauty
Isn't it a shame, what-ho
Maybe you should go get your parents
And make all your troubles go
There she stood in drag
Looking cool in astrakhan
She's lookin' a little wiped out
She said I looked like Peter Pan
And yawning in the sun
It's like a child I run
Don't do it if you don't want to
I wouldn't do a thing like that
Now don't do it if you don't want to
I wouldn't do a thing like that
Now don't do it if you don't want to
I wouldn't do a thing like that
Now don't do it if you don't want to
I wouldn't do a thing like that
