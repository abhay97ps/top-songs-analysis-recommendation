Mmmâ€¦ Mou matenai-yo...
Yeah, people always talk about the ones that got away
I just seem to get the ones that always want to stay
I'm just too distracted with the life I'm tryna paint
Say, I got all these women too attracted to the fame
Got too many niggas that will end up in the way
Nothing's gonna stop me, I'ma get it either way
Why would you wanna take away from this moment?
We can own it
Why would you wanna take away from this moment?
Woo-hoo!
You don't have to spend your life with me
You don't have to waste your energy
We can just be rockin', yeah
We can just be rockin', yeah
I just want your body next to me
'Cause it brings me so much ecstasy
We can just be rockin', yeah
We can just be rockin', yeah, yeah, yeah
You see me texting, baby, you see those missed calls
I'm actin' reckless baby, I'm 'bout to lose it all
This liquor got me crazy, mixed with that Adderall
I'm focused on the beat, oh yeah
Why would you wanna take away from this moment?
We can own it
