Something happened
To this heart of mine
When I saw you standing
In the sun
Something happened
And I can't define
How I knew you
Were the one
The world stood still
While my head
Went spinning round
I always will
Thank the Lord
For what I found
Something happened
And my prayers were heard
Now I'm walking in
The sun with you
Something happened
And without a word
I was sure you
Loved me too
The world stood still
While my head
Went spinning round
I always will
Thank the Lord
For what I found
Something happened
And my prayers were heard
Now I'm walking in
The sun with you
Something happened
And without a word
I was sure you
Loved me too
I was sure you
Loved me too
I was sure you
Loved me too
