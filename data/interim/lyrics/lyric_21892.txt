Rwar, rwar!â€‹
I have a heart, I swear I do
But just not baby, when it comes to you
I get so hungry when you say you love me
 if you know what's good for you
I think you're hot, I think you're cool
You're the kind of guy I'd stalk in school
But now that I'm famous, you're up my anus
Now I'm gonna eat you fool
I eat boys up
Breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty, I drink their blood
Carnivore, animal, I am a cannibal
I eat boys up
You better run
I am cannibal 
I am cannibal 
I am cannibal 
I am cannibal 
Whenever you tell me I'm pretty
That's when the hunger really hits me
Your little heart goes pitter-patter
I want your liver on a platter
Use your finger to stir my tea
And for dessert, I'll suck your teeth
Be too sweet, and you'll be a goner
 I'll pull a Jeffrey Dahmer
I eat boys up
Breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty, I drink their blood
Carnivore, animal, I am a cannibal
I eat boys up
You better run
I am cannibal 
I am cannibal 
I am cannibal 
I am cannibal 
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh
I am cannibal 
I am cannibal 
I am cannibal 
I am cannibal 
I love you
I warned you
Rwar!
