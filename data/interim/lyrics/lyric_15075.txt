When something is wrong with my baby, something is wrong with me
And If I know that she's worried, I know I'd feel the same misery
We've been through so much together, we stand as one, that's what makes it better
When something is wrong with my baby, something is wrong with me
And just what she means to me now, oh, you just, you just wouldn't understand
People can say that she's no good, but she's my woman and I know I'm her man
And if he's got a problem, whoa, I know I gotta help him solve them
When something is wrong with my baby, something is wrong with me
When something is wrong with my baby, something is wrong with my baby
When something is wrong with my baby, something is wrong with me
