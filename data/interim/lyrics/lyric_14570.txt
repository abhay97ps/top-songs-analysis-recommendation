Some people suppress you
They parch you
And reap a disaster
Reeducation for the enfants
Who demanded for an innocent instance
The great commandment shows the contempt
Between the world and their embarrassing pavement
Believe the scholars, read the readings
Realize the man who says anything
The great commandment
The needies believe you
They treat you
Like survivors of a disaster
Reeducation for the enfants
Who demanded for an innocent instance
The great commandment shows the contempt
Between the world and their embarrassing pavement
Believe the scholars, read the readings
Realize the man who says anything
The great commandment shows the contempt
Between the world and their embarrassing pavement
Believe the scholars, read the readings
Realize the man who says anything
The great commandment
