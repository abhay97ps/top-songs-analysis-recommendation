Yo Rich, what you telling them bro? 
A-yo, Rich what's really good? What you telling them homie
Them ladies that doubted you
Them teachers at school 
Them mandem deya 
Fam what you saying ?
Say no more, i'm closing doors
On everyone that couldn't take me rough and poor
Why you lying for? You never knew what i'm on, sleeping on the kid, now your necks sore
No, No, don't reply, you ain't got time, so do i, i'm not looking back, your Lot's wife
Yes, yes, i decline, 2 face pricks, no more lies
To basic, normal in the mind
Pushing people away, like a party with balloons in my face
God has answered me, He showed me who strays
And they're currently, not calling my name
Thanks for showing me, that your not the one
To stay by my side, and calling shotgun
When we need to ride, and tell them we won
Are you in my life, or asking for one?
I am not Dobby, i'm Noddy
Hook
So make way, your in the way, of my lane
For the fame, but the vision ain't the same
So make way, i'm not looking for the fame, that's a shame, i just wanna make a change
So make way, your not ready for your flame, cuz you blame, everyday and complain
So make way, your gonna know my name
Your gonna--

I'm trynna leave my old ways, 
If they don't leave i replace, 
If they don't leave i'm no ace, 
I do not need any chase, need any cakes, 
Need any haze, need any jakes
Need any case, need any fakes
I don't need people's praise, what is life without grac--
Maybe i'll lie for a bit, 
Maybe hit the skins for a bit, 
Maybe i'll just take a sip, 
Maybe inhale for the lift, 
Oh my days, then i flop, drop
Everything i said the other day
Got to stop what's
Telling me to faze how i changed, it's a cockblock
All these voices in my head are just opps
But I pray that this loop stops
Opps
"Richy i want your soul
Not from your feet, ten toes
But your dreams, and your plans, and goals"
"Richy let it go
Let's get some p's and hoes
Remember me, when you drank and smoked"--
Thank God, that i don't, not anymore
10 no's, not anymore 10 no's
Get the rest and 
Know it was a test, i got a first
Know it got me blessed and no hearse
But i almost got burst
4 times i could of done dirt, froze up when my boy jerked
And it could of been worse
Soul ties leaving a man a curse, O God
All i need is a verse, to be, certi and calm
Psalm 91 or a gun
Are the answers in my heart or my palm
Or the speech from my tongue
Is it loud loud in my lungs? Fat back? Yak? 
G i'm running--
World Change
If i could make the whole change
And i will, watch me, hear me, change the whole game
If i could make the whole change
And i will, watch me, hear me, change the whole game
I will change, everything, and everyone
Free them from the pain that  they gained, from very young
Raise Queens and Kings, and reign their dominion
With all the number 8's like David, the Holy one
The blacksmith, i'm trynna smash my Lz into Ws
Ignoring all your fails, and Ls, what's wrong with you
What would time tell, if we only got Ws
The times you were weak, will only make the stronger you
I finished weapon X
My healing factor's better than the rest
I move on quick, move on slick
Do not quit, and i accept
I'm only 21, and my mind is old
When, times get rough my heart turns cold
Real-ness in blood and bones, when my talents shown
And warning to my foes, don't let me in my zone
On top of that, one fact, i'm not alone
I got a lit team, family, and a home
This world's gonna change this world before i leave
This coming from the Throne
Not mine, this way above the sky 
That's my real home
I'm here to put my name on the rock 
Before i go back home
Will i change the world?
That's not a question, this message, it's not from me, it's coming from--
