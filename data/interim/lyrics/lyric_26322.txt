Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Have it all, rip our memories off the wall
All the special things I bought
They mean nothin' to me anymore
But to you, they were everything we were
They meant more than every word
Now I know just what you love me for 
Take all the money you want from me
Hope you become what you want to be
Show me how little you care
How little you care, how little you care
You dream of glitter and gold
My hеart's already been sold
Show you how little I care
How littlе I care, how little I care
My diamonds leave with you 
You're never gonna hear my heart break 
Never gonna move in dark ways 
Baby, you're so cruel
My diamonds leave with you 
Material love won't fool me 
When you're not here, I can breathe 
Think I always knew
My diamonds leave with you 
Shake it off, shake the fear of feeling lost
Always me that pays the cost
I should never trust so easily
You lied to me, lie-lied to me
Then left with my heart 'round your chest 
Take all the money you want from me
Hope you become what you want to be
Show me how little you care
How little you care, how little you care
You dream of glitter and gold
My heart's already been sold
Show you how little I care
How little I care, how little I care
My diamonds leave with you 
You're never gonna hear my heart break 
Never gonna move in dark ways 
Baby, you're so cruel
My diamonds leave with you 
Material love won't fool me 
When you're not here, I can breathe 
Think I always knew
My diamonds leave with you 
Woah-oh 
Woah-oh 
Always knew
My diamonds leave with you 
Woah-oh 
Woah-oh 
Always knew 
You're never gonna hear my heart break
Never gonna move in dark ways
Baby, you're so cruel
My diamonds leave with you
Material love won't fool me
When you're not here, I can breathe
Think I always knew
My diamonds leave with you, oh
You're never gonna hear my heart break 
Never gonna move in dark ways 
Baby, you're so cruel 
My diamonds leave with you 
Material love won't fool me 
When you're not here, I can breathe 
Think I always knew
My diamonds leave with you 
Woah-oh 
Woah-oh 
Always knew
My diamonds leave with you 
Woah-oh 
Woah-oh 
Always knew
My diamonds leave with you
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
