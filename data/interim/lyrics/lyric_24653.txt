Smooth
Like a Tennessee Walker
Just a walking on the water
You're smooth
Like a Sunday morning Elvis singing Gospel
It's a hell of a
Groove
Like the lines on her Mercury
Girl, you're put together perfectly
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
'Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody
That do me like you
The way you move that body
Girl, you're so smooth
Like cat daddy driving a caddy from Cali, baby
You're smooth
Like young love buzzing
Off an Old Camp bottle by the
Moon
Blackberry jam, finger-licking
Off your hand flying out the window
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
'Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody 
That do me like you 
The way you move that body 
Girl, you're so smooth 
Smooth, smooth
You're a stroke on the canvas
A brick road to Kansas
My little summer time jam 
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
'Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody 
That do me like you 
The way you move that body 
Girl, you're so smooth 
Smooth, smooth 
Smooth
