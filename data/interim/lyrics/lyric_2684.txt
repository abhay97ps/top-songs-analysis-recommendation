There must be a place
A place where love has gone
A bright, shiny world
Somewhere where love has gone
Where dreams and desires
As cold as yesterday's fires
Start to blaze anew
There must be a star gleaming in space
That doesn't grow dim
With each last embrace
They say love's gone when it goes
And I'm naive, I suppose
Thеre may not be such a place
Thеre may not be such a star
But still my fool of a heart
Just leads me on
It wants to be there
There with you
Where love has gone
To that bright and shiny world
Where love has gone
To that gone forever world
Where love has gone
