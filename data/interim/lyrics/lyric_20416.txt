There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's something about her
And you don't know why
But you're dying to try
You want to kiss the girl
Yes, you want her
Look at her, you know you do
It's possible she wants you too
There's one way to ask her
It don't take a word, not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl 
Shalalalala
My oh my
Looks like the boy's too shy
Ain't going to kiss the girl
Shalalalala
Ain't that sad
It's such a shame
Too bad, you're going to miss the girl
Go on and kiss the girl 
Now's your moment
Floating in a blue lagoon
Boy, you better do it soon
No time will be better
She don't say a word
And she won't say a word
Until you kiss the girl 
Shalalalala
My oh my
Looks like the boy's too shy
Ain't going to kiss the girl
Shalalalala
Ain't that sad
It's such a shame
Too bad, you're going to miss the girl
Shalalalala
Don't be scared
You better be prepared
Go on and kiss the girl
Shalalalala
Don't stop now
Don't try to hide it how
You want to kiss the girl
Go on and kiss the girl
Lalalala, Lalalala
Go on and kiss the girl
Lalalala, Lalalala
Go on and kiss the girl
Shalalalala
My oh my
Looks like the boy's too shy
Ain't going to kiss the girl
Shalalalala
Ain't that sad
It's such a shame
Too bad, you're going to miss the girl
Lalalala, Lalalala
Go on and kiss that girl!
Lalalala, Lalalala
Go on and kiss the girl
Kiss the girl
Go on and kiss the girl
