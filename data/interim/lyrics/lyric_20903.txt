Don't walk away like you always do this time
Baby, you're the only thing that's been on my mind
Ever since you left, I've been a mess
I'll say it once and I'll leave you alone
But I gotta let you know
I wanna get back to the old days
When the phone would ring and I knew it was you
I wanna talk back and get yelled at
Fight for nothing, like we used to
Oh, kiss me like you mean it, like you miss me
'Cause I know that you do
I wanna get back, get back with you 
Don't look at me that way, I see it in your eyes
Don't worry about me, I've been fine
I'm not gonna lie, I've been a mess since you left
And every time I see you, it gets more and more intense
I wanna get back to the old days
When the phone would ring and I knew it was you
I wanna talk back and get yelled at
Fight for nothing, like we used to
Oh, kiss me like you mean it, like you miss me
'Cause I know that you do
I wanna get back, get back with you
You were the only one I wanted
And you were the first one I fell for
You're the only one that I'm in need of
And I don't wanna be lonely anymore
I wanna get back to the old days
When the phone would ring and I knew it was you
I wanna talk back and get yelled at
Fight for nothing, like we used to
Oh, kiss me like you mean it, like you miss me
'Cause I know that you do
I wanna get back, get back with you
 Get back
 Get back
 Get back
 Get back
Oh, kiss me like you mean it, like you miss me
'Cause I know that you do
I wanna get back, get back
I wanna get back, get back
I wanna get back, get back
Get back
Yow!
