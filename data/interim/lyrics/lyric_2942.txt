It's better to have it 
And not need it 
Than to need it, than to need it
Baby, baby, and not have it now
Talking about love
L-o-v-e, love, baby
It's something else, honey
When you don't have it
Now listen
You left me, baby
Went on out of town
That wehen you got back
Mmm, you didn't wanna
See me around, baby
But I got so lonesome
I just didn't know
What to do with myself, baby
But I needed love
Now, everybody say yeah 
Everybody say yeah now 
Evertbody say yeah 
Say it a little bit louder now 
Sometime it make me feel weak 
Sometime it make me feel weak 
Till I can't hardly eat, baby 
Sometime it make me feel weak 
Whoa, I can't hardly eat, baby 
It's better to have it 
And not need it, honey 
Than to need it, than to need it
Baby, baby, and not have it now
Talking about love
L-o-v-e, love, baby
It's something else, honey
Yeah, when you don't have it
Now, everybody say yeah 
Everybody say yeah now 
Evertbody say yeah 
Say it a little bit louder now 
Sometime it make me feel weak 
Sometime it make me feel weak.....
