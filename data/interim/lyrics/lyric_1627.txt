We've been friends for oh, so long
I let you share what's mine
But when you mess with the boy I love
It's time to draw the line
Keep your hands  off my baby
I ain't gonna tell you but-a one more time
Oh, keep your hands  off my baby
Girl, you get it through your head
That boy is mine
I don't mind when you lend my clothes
My jewelry and such
But, honey, let's get something straight
There's one thing you don't touch
Keep your hands  off my baby
Girl, you get it through your head
That boy is mine
Keep your hands  off my baby
I ain't gonna tell you but-a one more time
Oh, keep your hands  off my baby
Girl, you get it through your head
That boy is mine
Oh, keep your hands  off my baby 
I ain't gonna tell you twice
He's mine 
Yay, yay, yeah, he's mine
You better watch yourself, now
