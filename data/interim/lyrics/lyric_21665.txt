Bum, bum, bum
Ba da ba, ba da bum
Bum, bum, bum
Ba da ba ba da bum
Bum, bum, bum 
Ba da ba ba da bum
Steve walks wearily down the street
With his brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready 
Are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Yeah!
Bum, bum, bum 
Bum, bum, bum 
And another one gone 
Hey, I'm gonna get you to
Another one bites the dust  {Yeeaah!}
How do you think I'm gonna get along 
You took me for everything that I had and 
Are you happy? Are you satisfied
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look Out!
Bum, bum, bum 
Bum, bum, bum 
And another one gone 
Hey, I'm gonna get you to, another one bites the dust 
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust 
Another one bites the dust {Hey, hey!}
Another one bites the dust 
Ooh shoot out
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah!
But I'm ready, I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat 
Bum, bum, bum 
Bum, bum, bum 
And another one gone 
Hey, I'm gonna get you to, another one bites the dust {Shoot out!}
Another one bites the dust {Yeah}
Another one bites the dust {Alright}
