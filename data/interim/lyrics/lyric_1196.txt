He can stay away too long
Then come back like nothin's wrong
I'm a fool
And no one knows it better
Than the one I love
He knows I love him too much
He knows I love him too much
He knows I'm gonna forgive
'Cause I couldn't live
Without him
When he's through with someone else
Then he takes me off the shelf
My heart's a toy
And like a little boy
He breaks it when he's through
He knows I love him too much
He knows I love him too much
But I don't care if I cry
I know I would die
Without him
He knows I love him too much
He knows I love him too much
But I don't care if I cry
I know I would die
Without him
He knows I love him too much
Mm, mm-mm, love him too much
He knows I love him
