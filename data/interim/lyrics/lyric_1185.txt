Paint two eyes
Make them cry
Paint two lips
Make them lies
And you're painting
The portrait of a fool
Paint one heart
That's been untrue
Paint one soul
Make it blue
And your paintin'
The portrait of a fool
There are somethings that look so familiar
Strange what this resemblance can be
And now as I look in the mirror
I know, I know the fool you are painting is me
Paint one fool
Let it talk
Paint two hand
That once held it all
And you've painted
A portrait of a fool...
