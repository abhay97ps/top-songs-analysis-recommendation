You'll always hurt the one you love
The one you shouldn't hurt at all
You'll always take the sweetest rose
And crush it till the petals fall
You'll always break the kindest heart
With a hasty word you can't recall
So if I broke your heart last night
It's because I love you most of all
You'll always break the kindest heart
With a hasty word you can't recall
So if I broke your heart last night
It's because I love you most of all
