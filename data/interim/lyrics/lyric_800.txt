Packed up an left me
Didn't even tell me the reason why
Whoa, you packed up an left me
Didn't even tell me the reason why
Well, if I didn't please ya, baby
Ain't because I didn't try
Well, it was long about midnight
When I heard that old lonesome Cannonball
Well, it was long about midnight
When I heard that old lonesome Cannonball
Well, when I think about ya, baby
Tears begin to fall
I've gotta find you, baby
If it takes my whole life
To track you down
I've gotta find you, baby
If it takes my whole life
To track you down
Well, if I don't find you by plane
I'm gonna use my old bloodhound
