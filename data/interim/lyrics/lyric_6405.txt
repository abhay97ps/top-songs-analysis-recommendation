When I was just a little girl
I asked my mother, "What will I be?
Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?"
Here's what she said to me
"Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
What will be, will be"
There's a song that I sing
Autumn, winter, summer, spring
Da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da, da, da
Da-da-da, da, da
When I grew up and fell in love
I asked my lover "What will there be?
Will there be rainbows day after day?"
Here's what he said to me
"Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
What will be, will be"
There's a song that I sing
Autumn, winter, summer, spring
Da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da, da, da
Da-da-da, da, da
Now, I have children of my own
They ask their mother "What will I be?
Will I be handsome? Will I be rich?"
I tell them tenderly
"Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
What will be, will be"
Sing a song
Sing along
Sing a song with me
