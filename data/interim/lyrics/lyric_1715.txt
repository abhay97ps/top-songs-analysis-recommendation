If you should ever think of leaving me
Don't let it go too far
The love of a lifetime
Darling that's what you are
I know I could never
Ever stop loving you
No man is an island
And I need you, honest I do
Every single day my love for you
Keeps growing more and more
The lips of an angel
Never kissed me before
And now that I've found you
I'll be counting on you
To love me forever
'Cause I need you, honest I do
It took an awful lot of looking to find you
Oh, what a time I've been through
'Cause darling it's not very easy
Finding an angel like you
The two of us together hand in hand
We stand at heaven's door
Together forever
I'll be yours evermore
Through all of my lifetime
I'll be counting on you
To love me forever
'Cause I need you, honest I do
