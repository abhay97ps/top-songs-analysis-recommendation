"Crash!"
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on!
"Crash!"
{Angel}
Crash, here I go, watch the flash
Light as it shines, bright in the night
Rhymes I recite, rhymes that you might like
Maybe not, in fact I don't really care
So I just came here, to get you hyped
I'm like fire, get your body filled with desired
Start to dance!
All together, let's just party
All together, let's just have some fun
Knocks me off my feet
Makes me want to get down
To the funky beat, to the funky sound
{Kayel}
Crash, sounds like thunder and lightning
Electricity, fire, but exciting
That's the way it sounds to you
Now you know what you gotta do
Step up, jump up, make a move
Just shake, check out this groove
It's a jam for the underground youth
So whatcha gonna do?

Crash, she don't need no introduction
The bomb, bombshell, of seduction
{Michelle}
Crash, I'm breaking, ain't no mistaking
Which one of you is gonna move
As my body starts to groove
I know you're clocking, I feel you watching
Now is time for me to start stomping
Vanilla child is coming through
I'm gonna show you what to do
As TKA drops rhymes with me
We'll harmonize in ectasy
But as you know it's not complete
'Til a woman speaks her piece
But it's time for me to go so, Yo!
I got something here, I got something here
I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got something here!
I got something here, I got something here
I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got something here!
{Tony}
Crash, that's our music, this is it now
It's time to use it
Move, groove, improve
We'll do you Miss
And if you like it, you can do this dance
Now get on the floor and
Give yourself a chance
Thinking about it? No doubt about
You can dance
Have fun! That's what we say
When you're slamming with the
T, the K, and the A!
All together, let's just party
All together, let's just have some fun
Knocks me off my feet
Makes me want to get down
To the funky beat, to the funky sound
Let's funky, let's funky, let's dance
Crash! Crash! Crash!!!!!
