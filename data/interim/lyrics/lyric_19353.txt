The door is coming off the hinges 
About to pass out
No doubt it's hot in here
Because the club is full of women 
It's wall to wall and I got my crew with me
We grab a table, spot to chill in
Hunt down a waitress, make an order
Here we go
Throw back a drink and let it kick in
It takes a minute, whose ready to have some fun
Get up and take a lap to mingle
Love being single on a night like this, yeah
So many beautiful young people 
The game is legal
You don't have to kill 'em though
Just look at everyone as equal
While you were dancing, she was watching
Feelin' you
Her and her girlfriends by the speaker
Are movin' on each other
This is when the show begins
Baby girl, you keep looking at me
Move your body, so sexy
Nice and slow, watch you roll
You know how I like it
Baby girl, 'cause you know you got me
Move your body, so sexy
Nice and slow, watch you roll
You know how I like it
Some girls dance with women
Knowing that it gets them attention
I wanna get in with them
So pass me a drink and let's roll 
Some girls dance with women
Knowing that it gets them attention
I wanna get in with them
So pass me a drink and let's go 
Might have to peel me off the ceiling 
I'm like a soda that's been shaken up, boom
I find your playfulness appealing
The cat and mouse race
On your mark, get ready, go
Send you a drink, see what the deal is 
Held up your glass and blew a kiss, then took a sip
When you were finished, back to business
You and your girlfriends move up
This is how you draw them in
Baby girl, you keep looking at me
Move your body, so sexy
Nice and slow, watch you roll
You know how I like it
Baby girl, 'cause you know you got me
Move your body, so sexy
Nice and slow, watch you roll
You know how I like it
Some girls dance with women
Knowing that it gets them attention
I wanna get in with them
So pass me a drink and let's roll 
Some girls dance with women 
Knowing that it gets them attention
I wanna get in with them
So pass me a drink and let's go 
Oh, I like the way you twerk it, twerk it, twerk it
You and your girlfriend, sexual whirlwind 
Right there booty jiggling while you jerk it
Dirty's gonna work it out 
Now I'm ready to put my work in
Double my pleasure, whatever, let's get together 
Spend the night with me, that's alight with me 
Long as you bring the thong, the thong thong
If you wanna freak make noise
I'm your boy
I like, sippin' on juice and gin
Touching bucknaked skin
Your girlfriend and twin
Step right up and spin the wheel
All charged up on what you feel
Make an approach, tryna keep it real
What's you name, girl?
Try your luck and spin the wheel
All charged up on what you feel
Make an approach tryin' to keep it real
I wanna take you home
Yeah, yeah
Some girls dance with women 
Knowing that it gets them attention 
I wanna get in with them whoa oh oh
So pass me a drink and let's roll 
Some girls dance with women 
Knowing that it gets them attention 
I wanna get in with them 
So pass me a drink and let's go 
Some girls dance with women 
Knowing that it gets them attention 
I wanna get in with them 
So pass me a drink and let's roll 
Some girls dance with women 
Knowing that it gets them attention 
I wanna get in with them
So pass me a drink and let's go
