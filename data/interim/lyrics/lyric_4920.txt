Hey little one so far from home and so alone
Hey little one I'm just like you I'm lonely too
The road of life is a long long road when you walk alone
Then I found you I found a love a love I've never known
A love I've never known
Hey hey hey hey little one don't go away
Tell me you'll stay
Hey hey hey hey little one I'm just like you
I'm so lonely too
