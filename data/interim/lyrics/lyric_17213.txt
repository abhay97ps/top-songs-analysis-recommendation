Girl it's your body 
Oh, oh, girl it's your body 
I just can't seem to get enough, yeah
Enough of your lovin'
Girl it's your body 
Oh, it's your body
Girl it's your body 
Gir-ir-irl
Listen 
Don't think that I'm crazy
See you've been my lady
For so many years
And I think it's time that I let you know how I feel
You see I finally figured it out
Why I still can't seem to get enough of your love
Enough of our love, yeah, yeah
Every time I'm near you
My whole body can't keep still
Girl I'm on fire
Temperature's rising
Higher and higher
Girl I lose all self control
Every time, every time you're near
Every time you're near
Oh, I know that it's your body
That keeps me yearning
That keeps my body burning
Can we make babies
Can we make babies
Can we make a family
Girl it's your body
That keeps me yearning all night long
Yeah
Don't think I'm crazy
See you've been my lady
For so-o-o-o-o-o-o many years
And I think it's time that I let you know that
That I finally figured it out 
Why I still can't seem to get enough of your love
Girl it's your body, baby
So you know what I want you to do, I want you 
Step into my bedroom 
Take off all your clothes 
Lay down
Let me rub your body down 
Let me feel your body down 
Let me squeeze your body 
Let me give you everything that you want
Eveything that you need
Now let me take my time 
To express myself girl 
Your body's so unusual
It makes me weak 
But I'll be honest baby
I don't want nobody else
Nobody, nobody,nobody else
You're my computer love
You're my computer love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Shoo-be-do-wop
I want your body, body baby
Shoo-be-do-wop
I want your body, body girl
I just can't seem to get enough
Fade out
