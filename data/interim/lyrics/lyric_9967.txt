Life is just too short for some folks
For other folks it just drags on
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey
Others figure tea is too strong
Well, I'm the type of guy that wants to right down the middle
I don't like all this bouncing back and forth
Me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie
And my head in the cool blue North
In a small suburban garden
Not a single neighbor knows our name
I know the woman wishes we would move someplace
Where the houses aren't all the same
Jesse, I wish you would take me where the grass is greener
I really couldn't say where it may be
Oh, some place high on a mountain top
Or down by the deep blue sea
And there we'll do just as we please
It ain't nothing but a breeze
One day I'll be old gray grandpa
All the pretty girls will call me "Sir"
Now, where they're asking me how things are
Soon they'll ask me how things were
Well, I don't mind being an old gray grandpa
As long as you'll be my gray grandma
But I wish we would move with our tea and cookies
To the shade of the old paw-paw
There we'll do just as we please
It ain't nothing but a breeze
Life is just too short for some folks
For other folks it just drags on
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey
Others figure tea is too strong
Well, I'm the type of guy that wants to right down the middle
I don't like all this bouncing back and forth
Me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie
And my head in the cool blue North
Oh me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie
And my head in the cool blue North, yeah, yeah
