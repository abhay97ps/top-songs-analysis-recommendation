Everybody, have fun
Everybody
Plenty of good food
And all the good joys
Plenty of music
In the kiddie room
There's plenty of toys
Review all the dances
All from the old and the new
With a real, a real live show
For you and you and you
From the baby section
Teenagers, adults at once
All in their own bag without
Without an ounce of grudge
You don't have to stand
When all can share the fun
Without an ounce of grudge, alright now
With your mom, your son and your hon
So keep the band rocking
So, band play on, play on
'Cause soon everybody
Will be in a real mellow ton&101
So keep the band, the crew
And don't and don't get back
'Cause you can have a real lotta fun
When it's tit for tat and no taking back
Play with your hand
Play volleyball
Hide and go seek
Okay, one more time
Come on genius
All right, everybody line up
Ready, you ready
Watch my hands
Everybody sing, come on
Plenty of good food, alright you
And all the good joys
Plenty of music
In the kiddie room
There's plenty of toys
Review the old dances
All from the old and the new
With the real live show, everybody
For you, you and you
Come on now
From the baby section
Teenagers, adults at once
All in their own bag
Here's what you want
Without an ounce of grudge
Now, together
You don't have to stand
When all can share the fun
Without an ounce of grudge
With mom, your son and your hon
Come on
