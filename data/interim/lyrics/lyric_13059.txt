Whodini, launchin' rockets in the 90s!
Now I remember in the days of way back
With just a 4-track
With no SP-12 to make tracks
Wearing leather suits and boots was the gear
Of fly bands and hip hop stars of the year
"Hey-ho" when rockin' on the street was the show
When the people clapped but they went home with no dough
Sportin' All Star walking to the beat of the Funky Four + 1
And the awesome Treacherous Three
Bump it in your Walkman, the music was explodin'
But these are The Breaks from the king Kurtis Blow
And giving us The Message is Grandmaster Flash, The Fearless Four
But still they said that rap won't last
Radio was playin' it, street kids were sayin' it
Soulsonic Force had the funk and they were bringing it
Then we threw the Whodini sound in the crew
With Magic Wand, had it going on 
Bringing the freaks out at night, Rapper's Delight
Fly girls were giving hip hop a new light
Pioneers who've given rap its life and itself
All praise due and remember that time repeats itself
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
 reputation
Let's do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
 reputation
Now check it out
I remember in the days when we wore gold chains
And leisure suits, Adidas and Pumas with no strings
And boppin' to The Rap Attack
Run-DMC was hittin' everywhere with Rock Box
The inner-city was complimentin' Big Mouth
One Love, and Friends
The Five Minutes of Funk, those days will never end
The Dynamix would break and all over town
All over the world, hip hop came and made its rounds
Taking up the fresh cuts, 1, 2, and 3
That was Whodini and Run-DMC
Lookin' at the kids with boomboxes on their shoulders
Sheepskins, Gazelles, leather bombers lookin' bolder
Then LL and Rakim came to life
One for makin' us dance, the other insight
The fans was getting bigger, look what we delivered
You still think that rap is gonna die, how do you figure?
Every time you say it's gonna pass
Hip-hop comes out with another style of rap and slaps your ass
Boogie Down Production, Biz and Public Enemy
DJs The Red Alert and Magic gave us energy
Tour and tour and show after show
And everybody freaked when Marley Marl had control
And pioneers who've given rap its life and itself
All praise due, remember that time repeats itself
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
 reputation
Let's do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
 reputation
Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it
I'm thinkin' of today's sound and how it all changed
To hear it on the radio, no longer in the game
Videos just get me depressed
Well I guess a 9 to 5 isn't a way to end my quest
I see mad MCs with fat raps and 
Thinkin' if Whodini could ever compete with that
Little kids rockin' on the mic with pure terror
Whatever happened to the nameplates of funky fresh era?
Then I see Run-DMC comin' back
Old school MCs become the new school styles of rap
Like Naughty by Nature, Leaders of the New
A Tribe Called Quest, Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy too
Red Alert keepin' it street for the core
Of hard rocks, respect to you Red and many more
Awesome Two paved the way thru and thru
Thanks to all the DJs keeping it real and true
We used to be on the outside lookin' in
Now Whodini is comin' back to do it all again
Pioneers who've given rap its life and itself
All praise due and notice that time repeated itself
