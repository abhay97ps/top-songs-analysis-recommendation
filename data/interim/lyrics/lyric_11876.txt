Never thought I'd fall in love
'Till you came and took my heart
Never thought it could be love, baby
Should have known it from the start
I used to be, oh, so lonely
Now everything has changed
To be with one woman only
Was always viewed as strange
Never, ever, never thought I'd fall in love
With you tonight
I never, ever, never thought I'd fall in love
With you and it feels so right
Now we're so happy here together
Love has chased my blues away
Like the sun can change the weather
You have brightened up my days
Never, ever, never thought I'd fall in love
With you tonight
I never, ever, never thought I'd fall in love
With you and it feels so right
I've got a song, right here in my heart, little girl
I, I should have know it from the very start
I never dreamed that you would be the way you are, little girl
Your love light, it shines like the light from the brightest star
I don't know how you do the things you do to me
You got the kind of love that makes a grown man talk and a baby walk
