Oh-no-no
Ah!
Whoa-oh-oh...
It's late at night, I can't fall asleep
Shadows on the lake are obsolete
So I just stay awake
Images running 'round my brain
Paint your picture, you're the king of the walk
Declare your space and prepare to shock
There is no precedence
Alone in your room your first offence
So I turn surprised, 
Reflections from behind
And I gaze to the sublime, 
Said, na na na na na na
Dancin' with my mirror, 
Dancin' bring me nearer to you
Dancin' with my mirror, 
Catch it when I can
Oh, no
Hear "Roxanne" on the radio, 
The red light burns, tell me where to go
I found my decadence
Obscure but approved experience
So the truth can't be denied, 
Though sometimes I have tried
Oh, the blast from the looking glass, 
Say, na na na na na na
Dancin' with my mirror, 
Dancin' bring me nearer to you
Dancin' with my mirror, 
Catch it when I can
I am dancin' with my mirror, 
Dancin' bring me nearer to you
Dancin' with my mirror, 
Catch it when I can, oh, no
Oh, no, no
So I turn surprised, 
Reflections from behind
And then I gaze to the sublime, 
Said, na na na na na na na na na na na na
Dancin' with my mirror, 
Dancin' bring me nearer to you
Dancin' with my mirror, 
Catch it when I can
I am dancin' with my mirror, 
Dancin' bring me nearer to you
Dancin' with my mirror, 
Catch it when I can
I am dancin' with my mirror-r
Yeah - oh, no, no, no
Late at night, I can't fall asleep
Late at night, I can't fall asleep
It's late at night I can't fall asleep
I said no, no, no, no, no, no
