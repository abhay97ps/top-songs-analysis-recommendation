Well, I look out the window
And what do I see
The breeze is a blowing
The leaves from the trees
Everything is free, everything but me
I'm gonna take this chain
From around my finger
And throw her just as far as I can sling her
'Cause I wanna be free
When my baby left me
Everything died but a little bluebird
Was singing just outside
Singing twidle-de-dee, fly away with me
Well, you know
I think I'm a gonna live
Gotta lotta love left in me to give
So I wanna be free
I've released my heart, my soul
And my mind and I'm a feeling fine
I broke the chains, the ring of gold
Before it broke my mind
Well, look who's crying
And it ain't me
But I can't hardly hear
And I can't have see
Oh, I wanna be free
I've released my heart, my soul
And my mind and I'm a feeling fine
I broke the chains, the ring of gold
Before it broke my mind
Oh, and look who's crying
And it ain't me
But I can't hardly hear
And I can't have see
Do I wanna be free?
Did I wanna be free?
Yeah, I wanna be free, free
