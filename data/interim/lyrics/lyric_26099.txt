Rest in peace to Static, yellin' "Shawty want a thug," ayy
Bottles in the club, ayy, know I love to touch 
Weezy played that shit for me and Kobe on the bus
Went and got a chain for me, I had to give it up

Fuck that, I'm back, baby, where the love? 
Rappers that I threw an alley-oop are throwin' subs

Bottles in the club, ayy, know she wanna fuck 
Weezy played that shit for me and Kobe on the bus
We ain't even get to reminiscin' what it was 
Moral of the story is the story finished us
Damn, and you know that lesson stuck 
Haven't left the 6ix in like a month 
Fuck that, I'm here, baby, where the love? 
Fuck that, I'm here, baby, just because 
I would never leave, but I could, though 
Yes, I know I leave you, not for good, though 
Same way you could diss, but you wouldn't, though
'Cause you know good and well that I'm...
