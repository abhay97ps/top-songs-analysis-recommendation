I turned around
But the carnival sounds only passed me by
I heard a song, made me lift up my head
Made me want to cry
Ain't a single reason to be found
Wait for your lovin' 'til it all comes down
'Cause you can't show me one in this whole town
That is so fine
But now that you're mine
Things are getting better
Any hour of the night or day
There's a star above and I want love to stay
Now my head is clear
Nothin' more to fear
No more feelin' down and broken-hearted
Let's get started right away
Can you imagine a drеam so sweet
Or a love so long?
I can't recall any moment at all
Whеn it stirred so strong
I'm gonna open up my heart to you
I'd give you anything you asked me to
'Cause, baby, you don't know
What I've been through
Just to find someone like you
Now things are getting better
Any hour of the night or day
There's a star above and I want love to stay
Now my head is clear
Nothin' more to fear
No more feelin' down and broken-hearted
Let's get started right away
Let's get started, let's get started
Ooh, now my head is clear
Nothin' more to fear
There's a star above and I want...
I want love to stay
Ain't a single reason to be found
Wait for your lovin' 'til it all comes down
Round and round
Let's get started, let's get started
Ooh, now my head is clear
Nothin' more to fear
There's a star above and I want...
I want love to stay
Ain't a single reason to be found
Wait for your...
