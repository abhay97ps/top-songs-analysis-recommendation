On Fire
You asked me if i'd write a song about you
Turning to you girl, there's no human way how to
Capture your essence, in lyrics expressed, in words tamed
Barely even catching my breath, the worst way
Is how I want ya since the second I heard ya name
And the unusual stresses commenced, procure dames
Is my regular method, it blurs days
But these seconds I'm blessed with ya presence it sets in my chest a firm blaze
To say I like ya underestimates, yes it's just pure lame
I'm next to the best of the feminine sex, it's sure plain
If my respect isn't evidenced in my unsure gaze and my fright
Well, I can right it, tonight it's our first date
This ain't the type of connection I'm letting spirit away
This ain't light this is heavy, so i'll squirrel it away
The time ain't right for the message in such an early display
The mic and I can show discretion til that nearness is made
I will invite you to confessions you can hear from the stage
Since I laid eyes on your redheaded-ness my world was a blaze
Escortin ya in my new yorker
The tom ford billboards that go by are admiring, obscured by the pane
The key club just whipped by, on the sunset strip I
Can't deny by my side is a permanent flame
I told you I might write this song about you
My comfort in performing it for you is sort of doubtful
You might be in the house or in the back of the crowd
Or I'm at your show and I clap when you bow, who's imagining now?
Thought I'd escape from you baby, you craved to bracket me down
It ain't happening now, but pure freedom is as sad as it sounds
The apron strings you done wrapped em around, and smiled
I wanted my cake and I ate it entitled
Now I'm laying in my bed, in the black in a mound
Where's my pack of them now? I wanted the racket of child
Too apprehensive of your affections to interact in that style
I'd rather have you back than this absence, I'm saddled with doubt
I still got some of them pictures in which you happen to smile
You asked me to grow up, but I'm just an adult in size
I always wanted a girl that everyone else wanted to wanted me, I got it
I marauded from one fire sign to it's copy, two years of solace
Thoughts that I wanted a partner only to have my heart put a stop to it
Once she offered that she wanted it monogamous there was a problem with it
The populace watched and made positive comments
Why would I want to go walk tall from all of it?
All I want is massages in the calmest of augusts
A broad not a follower whose thoughts are the strongest
She honest and she call when she promise
March me to her apartment and ensnarl my garments
After the carnage we can loll in the darkness, so far from apartness
As I get back on the 2, I'm thinking of those that think I'm needy and go
In my sleep I can hold, you and the ladies I like, same mistake every night
You needed me so I'm keeping alone, I'm on fire for you though you moved on
You're not here, this fire's what's keeping me warm
