Alone in a crowd on a bus after work
I'm daydreaming
The guy next to me has his girl on his arm
My arms are empty
How does it feel when the girl that you love
Says "Yes, she loves you"
It seems unfair when there's love everywhere
And yet there's none for you
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys have a little sunshine in their life
My life is only filled with rain
Someone to take on a walk by the lake
Dear Lord, let her be
Someone who's shy
Someone who liable to cry at sad movies
Ooh, I do believe I would die just to look in her eyes
And find them filled with me
But you're just a dream and as real as it seems
I'm not that lucky
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys have a little sunshine in their life
My life is only filled with rain
It's just a losing game
The things have got to change
Some girl will give my love a try
With my luck, she'd have her overnight, oh well
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys have a little sunshine in their life
(The guy next to me has his girl on his arm
My arms are empty)
My life is only filled with rain
