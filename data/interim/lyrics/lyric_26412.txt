Well, I ain't gonna work today
Just wanna sit around and play
Gonna hit balls off the dock
Kick back in my flip-flops
Don't owe nothin' to the lender
Nothin' spinnin' in the blender
The only thing on my agenda is
Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime
Back porch nights in South Carolina
Ain't nothin' finer than me and my girl strikin' up a little lighter
'Cause everybody's down in a world gone crazy
Don't know how to fix it but I think maybe
Turn on the good times, turn off the TV
Yeah, the only B.S. I need is beers and sunshine
I'm gonna call my girl and say
Let's get our friends and hit the lake
Grab a boat and get to floatin'
A little buzzed and a little toasted
We're gonna hang and have a little fun now
Flying high like we'll never come down
We're gonna roll until we run out of
Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime
Back porch nights in South Carolina
Ain't nothin' finer than me and my girl strikin' up a little lighter
'Cause everybody's down in a world gone crazy
Don't know how to fix it but I think maybe
Turn on the good times, turn off the TV
Yeah, the only B.S. I need is beers and sunshine
Oh, beers and sunshine, oh
Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime
Back porch nights in South Carolina
Ain't nothin' finer than me and my girl strikin' up a little lighter
'Cause everybody's down in a world gone crazy
Don't know how to fix it but I think maybe
Turn on the good times, turn off the TV
Yeah, the only B.S. I need is beers and sunshine
Oh, beers and sunshine
Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime, time, time
Oh, oh oh, yeah
