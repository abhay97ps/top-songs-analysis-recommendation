Up a lazy river by the old mill stream
Lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger awhile in the shade of a tree
Throw away your troubles, dream with me
Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Wakes the mornin', we roll along
Make me blue skies above
Everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy we'll be
Up a lazy river with me
Up a lazy river by the old mill run
That's a lazy, lazy river in the noonday sun
You can linger for a while in the shade of a tree
Throw!, away your troubles, baby, dream a dream of me
Up a lazy river, where the robin's song
Wakes a brand new mornin' where we can roll along
There may be blue skies up above
But as long as we're in love
Yah, we'll be up a lazy river, how happy we could be
Up a lazy river with me
Yeah, up a lazy river where the robin's song
Awakes a brand new mornin', we can roll along
A-a-a, threre are blue skies up above
And as long as we're in love
We'll be up a lazy river
Up a crazy river
Up a lazy river
I ain't goin' your way
Get out'a my way
Up a lazy river with me...
