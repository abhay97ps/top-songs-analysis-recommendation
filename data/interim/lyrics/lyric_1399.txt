Goodbye  I hate to see you go
But have a good time 
So long, I'll miss you, dear, I know
But have a good time 
Have your fling, be gay with your new love
I'm setting you free
Dance and sing, pretend that it's true love
Don't worry 'bout me
I-I-I-I know  that tears will only drive you
Farther away 
Just go, forget that I'm alive
It's your holiday 
When you're tired of being reckless and carefree
Remember that I'll be waiting to welcome you home
So have a good time 
Sax continues behind SPOKEN: "Bye, baby. Gee, I hate to see you go but have a good time."
So long SPOKEN: "You know, I'm really gonna miss you but have a good time."
End of sax
And, honey when you're tired of being reckless and carefree
Remember that I'll be waiting to welcome you home
So have a good time 
Fade
SPOKEN: "Have a good time, baby."
