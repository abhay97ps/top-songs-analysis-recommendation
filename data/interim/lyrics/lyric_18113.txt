If you love me
Like you say you do
Won’t you show me
Just how much you do?
If you love me unconditionally
Say that you'll always
Always be with me
In my heart
There is a love
That's yearning for you
Let me know if you feel the same
The yearning that I do
All I know is
That I need a love to get what I need
Don’t be afraid or hesitate
I’m trying to make you see how it's gotta be
If you love me
Like you say you do
Won’t you show me
Just how much you do?
If you love me
Unconditionally
Say that you’ll always
Always be with me
All the words
That you didn’t say
Pushed me away from you
Words of love that
I need to hear
To let me know you do
Seems at night
I dry my eyes
For now I have learned
Lonely tears
They fall the same
When love is not returned
Love is not returned
If you love me
Like you say you do
Won’t you show me
Just how much you do
If you love me
Unconditionally
Say that you’ll always
Always be with me
If you love me
Like you say you do
Won’t you show me
Just how much you do?
If you love me
Unconditionally
Say that you’ll always
Always be with me
If you love me
Like you say you do
Won’t you show me
Just how much you do?
If you love me
Unconditionally
Say that you’ll always
Always be with me
