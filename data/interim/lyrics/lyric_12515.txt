I know when to go out
And when to stay in
Get things done
I catch the paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try
I try
There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try
I try
Never going to fall for
 walks beside me
 walks on by
 gets me to the church on time
 terrifies me
 makes me party
 puts my trust in God and Man
 no confessions
 no religion
 don't believe in Modern Love
It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye
But I try
I try
Never going to fall for
 walks beside me
 walks on by
 gets me to the church on time
 terrifies me
 makes me party
 puts my trust in God and Man
 no confessions
 no religion
 don't believe in Modern Love
 walks beside me
 walks on by
 gets me to the church on time
 terrifies me
 makes me party
 puts my trust in God and Man
 no confessions
 no religion
 don't believe in Modern Love
Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love
Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love
Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love
Modern love, walks beside me 
Modern love, walks on by 
Modern love, walks beside me 
Modern love, walks on by 
Never gonna fall for
