Ruby said that you were on your way
Well, the red alert was sounded and it blew the night
Locked me in the back room out of the way
Well when they say you've lost your touch I smiled
They couldn't handle anything you're laying down
It's a fact you put the "snap" in crocodile
You send me crazy when you said
We're gonna spend all day in bed
My heart went out of style
I get scared inside when you stand by
My aftershave has given my hiding place away
Stiletto heels a split skirt, you're a dream
But when you locked that bedroom door I screamed
You send me crazy when you said
We're gonna spend all day in bed
My heart went out of style
I get scared inside when you stand by
Ruby said that you were on your way
Well, the red alert was sounded and it blew the night
Locked me in the back room out of the way
You send me crazy when you said
We're gonna spend all day in bed
My heart went out of style
I get scared inside when you stand by
You send me crazy when you said
We're gonna spend all day in bed
My heart went out of style
I get scared inside when you stand by
