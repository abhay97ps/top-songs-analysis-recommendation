Ten percent of something
Ten percent of something
It beats one hundred percent
Of nothing at all
I only see you
Maybe once or twice a week
You make it worth my while
You treat me like a king
I cherish any time
That I can spend with you
Just say the words
And I'll do anything
But you must be true, oh
Ten percent of something
Ten percent of something
It beats one hundred percent
Of nothing at all
Ten percent of something
Ten percent of something
It beats one hundred percent
 of nothing at all
I do not like those guys
Who try to get all they can
Cause when it's over
They're right back where they began
It's better to have loved
Than never to have loved at all
I'm with you til the water runs uphil
Ten percent of something
Ten percent of something
It beats one hundred percent
Of nothing at all
Ten percent of something
Ten percent of something
Ten percent of something
Ten percent of something
Ten percent of something
Ten percent of something
Ten percent of something
Ten percent of something
Ten percent of something 
Ten percent of something 
Just say the word
I'm not like those guys, love
I try, try, try, try allI can, girl
I'm gonna be with you
Be with you til the water runs up hill
Yes, I will, yes, I will, baby
Said I'll cherish, I'll cherish
I swear, my darling
And I'll try my best
To do the best, girl
I need not one
Not two, not three, baby
I need ten percent, ooh...
