Sleepy Joe
Sleepy Joe
Rise and shine, Sleepy Joe
Now's the time, don't you know?
To get into a new kind of dream
You've been living alone
With no Bell telephone
And you don't have a shirt that is clean
You can rest your head on the corner of your bed
You can watch the world go by
But you're never gonna see
What the other people see
If you're always gonna be a Sleepy Joe
Rise and shine, Sleepy Joe
There are places to go
There are windows to clean on the way
You've got nothing to lose
But the shine on your shoes
Do the best things you can every day
You can get upset at the way the people get
You can turn your back on the crowd
But you never gonna see
What is absolutely real
If you're always gonna be a Sleepy Joe
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la 
La la la, la la la, la la la 
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la 
La la la, la la la, la la la 
Rise and shine, Sleepy Joe
Now's the time, don't you know?
To get into a new kind of dream
You've been living alone
With no Bell telephone
And you don't have a shirt that is clean
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la 
La la la, la la la, la la la 
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la 
La la la, la la la, la la la 
Rise and shine, Sleepy Joe
There are places to go
There are windows to clean on the way
You've got nothing to lose
But the shine on your shoes
Do the best things you can every day
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la 
La la la, la la la, la la la 
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la 
La la la, la la la, la la la
