Got no time to stop and speak to friends passing by
Got no strength to wipe away the tears from my eye
I don't care what's going on
Only know she's gone
And the sun don't shine anymore
And I don't feel fine anymore
'Cause she ain't mine anymore
No, I don't feel fine anymore
I ain't got time anymore
Seems to be such sadness now in each place I go
Other people laugh and, still, I just wouldn't know
Never stop to see who's there
Once I used to care
But the sun don't shine anymore
'Cause she ain't mine anymore
And I don't feel fine anymore
No, I ain't got time anymore
I ain't got time anymore
I can't get used to being left on my own
It takes up all my time just trying to be alone
Used to take an interest in the state of world
Now I only know how much I'm missing that girl
Hope the world will understand
I can't lend a hand
'Cause she ain't mine anymore
And I don't feel fine anymore
'Cause she ain't mine anymore
And I don't feel fine anymore
No, I ain't got time anymore
'Cause she ain't mine anymore
And I don't feel fine anymore
'Cause she ain't mine anymore
No, I ain't got time anymore
She ain't mine anymore
And I don't feel fine anymore
'Cause she ain't mine anymore
I ain't got time anymore
