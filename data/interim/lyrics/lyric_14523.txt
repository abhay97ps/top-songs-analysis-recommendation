Of all of the people that I used to know
Most never adjusted to the great big world
I see 'em lurking in bookstores
Workin' for the public radio
Carryin' their babies around in sacks on their backs
Movin' careful and slow
It's money that matters
Hear what I say
It's money that matters
In the U.S.A
All of these people are much brighter than I
In any fair system they would flourish and thrive
But they barely survive
They eke out a living
They barely survive
When I was a young boy, maybe thirteen
I took a hard look around me, asked "What does it mean?"
So I talked to my father; he didn't know
I talked to my friend; he didn't know
I talked to my brother; he didn't know
I talked to everybody that I knew
It's money that matters
Now, you know that it's true
It's money that matters
Whatever you do
I talked to a man lived up on the county line
I was washin' his car with a friend of mine
He was a little fat guy in a red jumpsuit
I said, "That looks kinda funny"; he said, "I know it does too -
But I got a great big house on the hill here
Great big blonde wife inside it
Great big pool in my back yard
Another great big pool beside it!
Sonny, it's money that matters
Hear what I say
It's money that matters
In the U.S.A
It's money that matters
Now, you know that it's true
It's money that matters
Whatever you do"
