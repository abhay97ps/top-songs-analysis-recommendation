Woah
You guys wanna go to the beach with a freak-freak, huh?
Totally 
We rock 
Yeah 
Woah
It's the wave 
It's big wave 
Surf, surf , surf, surf 
Surf, surf, surf, surfin' 
Surf, surf , surf, surf
Surf , surf, surf, surfin' 
These niggas gon' ride the wave 
Your ass is just like a tank 
These niggas gon' ride the wave 
I'm 'bout to go fill up a safe 
These niggas gon' ride the wave 
These niggas gon' copy for days 
These niggas gon' ride the wave 
They tryna find out where I stay 
I had a lock with a latch to see who break in, it just was a test, ah
Virgil was sending me drip just to see if I like it or rockin' with it
There go lil' mama, I don't wanna fuck her, she burnin', she trippin' 
I'm wavy, goddamn
Niggas want smoke with the slatt, we can meet in the kitchen 
I'm burnin' the ham
These so-called gangsters don't know how to approach the man 
I chop up his ass, I chop up his friends, his mamas, and all his six kids 
I come with that lead
I chop off the top of the Benz and all it gets fierce
They can't wait to shred
I told 'em to chop off your penis, you keeping your head 
I had a drum with a K and it's fully loaded, nigga play in this bitch 
Catch him down bad, you know I'm puttin' dick in your wife, Iâ€™m not sparing shit 
Shawty pussy so tight I had to finger her shit with a stick 
Niggas ain't come from my tribe, I can barely say they hit 
I need some brand new tires, I done burned off of the Z06 
I know 'bout family ties, I know 'bout the mob, but can't say shit 
Couple things I done seen in the dark, I know I gotta die with it
Couple mains, I done sent a couple on the Spain, a couple on French 
Surf , surf , surf , surf 
Surf, surf, surf , surfin' 
Surf, surf , surf, surf 
Surf, surf , surf , surfin' 
They tryna ride the wave, nine times out of ten, these niggas gon' drown 
We got some slimy ways, don't care 'bout the bro, wipe his nose for a pound 
I count it up, see what I made today
Beat it up, you gotta pay to play 
Underdog, I gotta name to save
Some niggas won't ever get out 
I'm having major waves 
Drip like I made the rain 
Scared and I'm gripping the grain 
All of this dripping, ain't drain 
I copped a Bentley Mulsanne, the money been healin' the pain 
The coupe the same color cocaine, I hope you don't sniff anything 
She say she like giving me brain, I hope you didn't get her a ring
In the Clearport, I'm boarding the plane, G6 is known for a king
Overseas, I got plenty of the tings, all pretty foreign tings
Yves Saint Laurent jeans , I drop a four in a cream
Surf, surf, surf, surf
Surf, surf, surf, surfin' 
Surf, surf , surf, surf 
Surf, surf , surf , surfin' 
These niggas gon' ride the wave 
Your ass is just like a tank 
These niggas gon' ride the wave 
I'm 'bout to go fill up a safe 
These niggas gon' ride the wave 
These niggas gon' copy for days 
These niggas gon' ride the wave 
They tryna find out where I stay
