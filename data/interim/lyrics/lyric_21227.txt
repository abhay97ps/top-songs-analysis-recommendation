I'm countin' the days since I began to live without you
I'm covered in rain, but it feels just like it's the sun
And it don't get me down
Don't come around
You're better off leavin' town
I'm fine here alone now without you
Hey! I'm screamin' at you
Hey! Don't care enough to
Write you a letter now that I'm doin' better alone
Hey! I'm screamin' at you
Hey! Don't care enough to
Write you a letter now that I'm doin' better
Better off without you
You're stuck in a world of make-believe and I can see it
I gave it a chance, you must be crazy not to leave
You're never gonna bring me down
Don't come around
You're better off leavin' town
I'm fine here alone now without you
Hey! I'm screamin' at you
Hey! Don't care enough to
Write you a letter now that I'm doin' better alone
Hey! I'm screamin' at you
Hey! Don't care enough to
Write you a letter now that i'm doin' better
Better off without you
I'm givin' it up now you're takin' away
All of my time; now get out of my way
Never meant much to anyone
It's me they want, without you I'm the same
So hear me now, I'm screamin' out your name
Hey! I'm screamin' at you
Hey! Don't care enough to
Write you a letter now that I'm doin' better alone
Hey! I'm screamin' at you
Hey! Don't care enough to
Write you a letter now that I'm doin' better
Better off without you
Better off without you
Cause I'm better off without you
I'm screamin' at you
Hey! Don't care enough to
Write you a letter now that I'm doin' better
Better off without you
