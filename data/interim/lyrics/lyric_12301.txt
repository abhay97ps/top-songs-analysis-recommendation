You won my heart
It's s just the start, babe
There's much more to love
Than the way you're thinking of
To wear my ring
Worth something special
Now you close the door
The ring thrown on the floor
But if it's alright with you
I won't take a second chance
I don't have to take it
And you don't have to fake it anymore
Eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a lover by the toe
That's the game of love we play
It doesn? t have to be that way
We took a vow
Never to part, babe
Now you're telling me
That you have a change of heart
Now it's my turn
To feel like crying
Hope some day you'll see
What you meant to me
Say eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a lover by the toe
Said that's the game of love we play
It doesn't have to be that way
Eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a lover by the toe
That's the game of love we play
Eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a lover by the toe
