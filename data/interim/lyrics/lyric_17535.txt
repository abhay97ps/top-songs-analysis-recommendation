Hook:
Tell her let me go
I'll see you in the morning
Finna pull up with the rari, Bottle of bacardi
You already know
This is what you wanted, Love it when I'm haunted
After every show
After every party, We'll be laughing hardy
Feel it in your soul
Ice over your body, Love it dont you shawty
Bridge:
You already know
You been playing possum ducking on me shawty
I already know
Hate cause I ain't poppin soon you gonna know
The power of the flow hoe
Pull up on em so sos so you gonna know hoe
Hit em with whow hoe
Feeling like I'm flawless you already know
Verse:
You been playing shawty
Hop up out the bushes and I gut em what a rush ah
Jungle where I rumbaaaa
Man this ain't wakanda but we ruled by that panther
Pussy on the throne fuck a pedestal
Those our edibles add some mustard
Sip a little custard
Have that woman running like she castor
Oil that booty up fuck tha castor
Should I rhyme faster
Hop out bushes and chop up a body a bastard
Pull out the desert to dust call it Kinshasa
Send em all under
Shit what a hell of a hell of a hell of a blunder
Sip on a fanta
Jumping and humping while Bumping the london
Hook:
Tell her let me go
I'll see you in the morning
Finna pull up with the rari, Bottle of bacardi

This is what you wanted, Love it when I'm haunted
After every show
After every party, We'll be laughing hardy
Feel it in your soul
Ice over your body, Love it dont you shawty
