Johnny have you seen her-She was headed out this way
And I notice, that you don't have much to say
Do you think that she's been wanderin', a little far from home?
Oh Johnny tell me, what's been goin' on
Johnny can you hear me, 'cause I could really use a friend
And I've known you, since before I can't say when
Did you think I was the kind of man, to leave well enough alone?
Oh Johnny tell me, what's been goin' on
If you could look inside this tortured heart of mine
You would see the pain I'm goin' through
Can you look me in the eyes and tell if I am blind
Maybe then I might believe you 
'Cause I wanna believe you
Johnny did she tell you, that her heart belongs to me?
And did she tell you, that I will never set her free?
For the vows that we made years ago, are carved upon a stone
Oh Johnny tell me, what's been goin' on
If you could look inside this tortured heart of mine
You would see the pain I'm goin' through
Can you look me in the eyes and tell if I am blind
Maybe then I might believe you ..Oh yeh
'Cause I wanna believe you
Johhny, Yeh!
Johnny have you seen her-She was headed out this way
And I notice, that you don't have much to say
You can take me for the fool I am-That's where the line is drawn
Oh Johnny tell me, what's been goin' on
If you could look inside this tortured heart of mine
You would see the pain I'm goin' through
Can you look me in the eyes and tell if I am blind
Maybe then I might believe you 
I wanna believe you
I wanna believe you
Yeh I wanna believe you
