Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, little devil
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, little devil
Hey, little devil, you're always running around 
It's time that someone started bringing you down 
There'll be  some changes made
Your roving days are through
Hey, little devil, I'm gonna make an angel out of you
Hey, little devil, you got me all in a whirl 
You're a cute little devil and I'm gonna make you my girl 
A-you're out  to break a-my heart
But just before you do
Hey, little devil, I'm gonna make an angel out of you
They say beware
But I don't care
I love you just the same
You're an old heartbreaker and a mischief maker
But I'm wise to your name
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey, little devil, everything is gonna be fine 
Cause someday soon I'm gonna make you all mine 
There'll be  no running around
You met your Waterloo
Hey, little devil, I'm gonna make an angel out of you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey, little devil, everything is gonna be fine 
A-cause someday soon I'm-a gonna make you all mine 
There'll be  no running around
You met your Waterloo
Hey, little devil, I'm gonna make an angel out of you
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, little devil
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, little devil
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, little devil
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, little devil
