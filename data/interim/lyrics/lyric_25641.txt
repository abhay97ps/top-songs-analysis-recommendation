Yellow tape, I put that on 
Hold up, wait, life's great 
Hold up, wait, ice skate 
Hold up, wait, crime pay 
Hold up, wait, slatt, slatt 
Twenty cars, matte black 
Surfin' at a Ritz Carlton 
Two pink toes 
Oxycontin what I piss
Flip it to the dog like a dish
Accept the loss before I quit
She slept at the house, I bought her Ruth Chris
What's up, mate? Got cake, mate 
Got cheese, mate, got bread, mate 
Got cups, mate , no fucks, mate 
Give no fucks, mate , I'm up, mate 
It's up, mate, I buck, mate

Got cups, mate,  no fucks, mate

Fucked my classmate , fuck, shit, let's splash, mate 
Or suck that shit, let's splash, hey
Smokin' on loud, we don't fuck around with y'all
Wanna try this shit, let me know
We prepare first and then Columbine
Trenchcoat, under a nigga's sleeve
Wipe his nose, wipe his nose 
Wipe his nose,  wipe his nose 
Wipe his nose,  wipe his nose 
Wipe his nose, , wipe his nose 
Doubled the cups and then doubled it up and I doubled it up 
Jump in the Bentley, I jump in the truck and I trucker the truck 
Chuggin' it down, I'm smokin' a pound, I'm fuckin' around 
Smokin' on loud, we don't fuck around with y'all
What's up, mate?  Got the blicky, featherweight 
Got the cash, I bake the cake,  ayy, what's brackin', mate?

Get no sleep, mate,  I'm geeked, mate, pushin' weight, outta shape 
Red wings, red bottoms, I'm a fuckin' devil 
Twenty tennis chains on, not no Ric Flair medal 
I don't gotta run it back, you heard what Gunna tell 'em 
Put my diamonds in a bowl, that look like Fruity Pebbles
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bitch wanna hit her a lick, yeah 
Bitch wanna suck on the dick, yeah
Bitch wanna get her a brick, yeah 
Bitch wanna fuck on a bitch 
Bitch wanna fuck on the clique 
Euros on euros, I'm gettin' it 
Step on the floor, now I'm lit 
Wipe his nose, wipe her nose 
Kick a door, keep the Ruger 
Put the pole in his ho, bend her over 
Then you buy that bitch a brand new Range Rover 
I'm so high, all I can say is "Woo, woo, woo"
I can't talk, I barely could say, "Woo, woo, woo"
Count a M and count another one, ooh, ooh 
Fuck that shit, I enter the lotto, woo, woo 
Count a half and another
I can never be a facade relative
Up to the sky with my mom, brothers
They let it hit from the side, they were all cudders
Oh, okay, fuck her good, make her try voodoo
Okay, my plug put me on, I call him Lou Lou
Hood nigga, pay it in full, I'm a black Jew
What's population? I come from the trenches, we pray for a brick
What's poppin', lady? Bitches love a nigga's accent 
Pain pills, codeine, hydro, acid 
I hang with some slimes, pullin' kick doors 
Outchea, outchea, quit your reachin'
Gucci socky on my feet
Sloppy toppy, keep it neat
One, two, three, I got freaks
Ooh, four girls on fleek
Ooh, bad and saditty
Ooh, ass and her titties
Ooh, that ting litty
And my Spanish ting, she bad like J. Lo 
I crushed up an X pill in her asshole 
Fifty-round clip, got my Draco 
I should, I should teach drug classes 
I stay on my grind, Margiela ten toes 
Money on my mind, I'm a nympho 
Ooh, ass and her titties 
Ooh, that ting litty 
Ooh, ass and her titties 
Ooh, that ting litty 
Ooh, ass and her titties 
Ooh, that ting litty
