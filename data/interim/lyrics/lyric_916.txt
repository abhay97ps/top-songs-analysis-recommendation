Please don't be shy
I'm not a tough guy
Electric, that's how I feel
Around you I go so crazy
I love you, I don't mean maybe
Noxema white with skin just like Barbie
You've got my heart
Let's take a photograph
Feel just like Jimmi Hendrix on butane
At the arcade I saw you playing Miss Pacman
You had on a pink bikini and your shoulders were sunburned
I threw down my quarters
And I looked into your big blue eyes
We went down to the beach and I rolled out some reefer
I felt like I was in a Duran Duran video
And by the way you were acting I knew that I was gonna get with you
The summer's here and school is over
Forget your fucked up parents and lets go
I know a good place down in the valley
We can get lost on all the back roads
This chick named Brenda has a Jacuzzi
Her mom and dad are in the Bahamas
And we just scored some killer acid
We can watch our heads explode just like a car crash
Go down to the basement and pretend we're dead
Sitting in the love light you look just like an angel
And I don't give a fuck what the fuck they say about us
Drive to the supermarket and bang out in the parking lot
You don't have to be horny until 11:30
