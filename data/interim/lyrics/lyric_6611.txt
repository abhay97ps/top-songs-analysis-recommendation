Child isn't born with a prejudiced mind
He only learns what he sees
Or what he's taught to do
Think about your children, mother
Help all mankind
Don't let the weight of hate
Weigh the world down
Here we are in this world together
We were meant to live with each other
Tell the child the truth, it's your own son
And everybody know about freedom
It's a shame that ever had to be
But we can't change the past
Think about your children, mother
Save all mankind
Don't let the weight of hate
Weigh the world down
I can see a good day comin' 
More of love and no time for hating 
There will be no need for debating 
And everybody know about freedom
Here we are in this world together 
We were meant to live with each other 
Tell the child the truth, it's your own son 
And everybody know about freedom
Think, think
Help them love one another
Think about the children
Think, think
Help them love one another
I can see a good day a-comin' 
More of love and no time for hating 
There will be no need for debating 
And everybody know about freedom
