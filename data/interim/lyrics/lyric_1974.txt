Everybody wants to shine
But they can keep on wishing, cuz ain't no stars made overnight
And ain't no competition , 'petition , 'Petition  x2
I don't see no competition
Where they at, where they at, I don't see no one
I'm Ray Charles, I'm Stevie Wonder, with a blindfold on
It's getting darker than a bitch out here
Hard as hell to get a pitch out here
Throwing money like I'm rich out here
Drinking liquor like a fish out here
Momma, I wanna be famous
Let them all know what my name is
I gotta make some arrangements
Money come go and it changes
Just to be working the latest
I pray every day like a Christian
Mommy and Daddy and all of my family, I don't see no competition-oh!
Everybody wants to shine
But they can keep on wishing, cuz ain't no stars made overnight
And ain't no competition , 'petition , 'Petition  x2
I don't see no competition
Where they at, where they at, I don't see nada
And I got eyes like I'm Fetty Wap, I don't see nothing but dolla's
Bouncing harder than a check out here
Hard as hell to get respect out here
I just wanna be the next out here
They be wanting me to flex out here
Momma, I just wanna make it
Make all the girlies get naked
Make 'em drip drop on the dance floor
Pockets so fat that my pants low
Just to be working the latest
I pray every day like a Christian
Mommy and Daddy and all of my family, I don't see no competition-oh!
It's a rumble in the jungle underneath the stars
But we ain't going nowhere 'till we win the war
I'm fighting but my back is up against the wall
The bigger that they are, the harder that they fall
We gotta keep movin', keep movin', it's all to carry on
But Imma dispute it, dispute it, dispute it, the champion
Where they at, where they at, I don't see know one x8
Everybody wants to shine
But they can keep on wishing, cuz ain't no stars made overnight
And ain't no competition , 'petition , 'Petition  x2
I don't see no competition
Everybody wants to shine 
Everybody wants to shine 
Everybody wants to shine 
Everybody wants to shine
