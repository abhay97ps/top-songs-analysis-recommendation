Written by Bob Welch and John Henning
Now there is a way to say I love you
And it's said everyday by some kind of fool
But where is the way to tell her goodbye
We both can't be wrong, I must be right !
Hot love cold world, gonna make you cry
Hot love corld world, oh yeah
Hot love cold world, gonna make you cry
Hot love cold world, oh yeah..
Our connection was strong I thought it could last
Dreams of the future not a care for the past
But look at us now not knowing what to do
You're looking so sad I feel so cruel...
