So many years gone, still I remember
How did I ever let my heart believe
In one who never gave enough to me
And so many years gone,love that was so wrong
I can't forget the way it used to be
And how you changed the taste of love for me
You were my one more chance
I never thought I'd find
You were the one romance
I've always known in my mind
No one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
I might have saved the best of me for you
And we'll have no ending if we can hold on
And I think I've come this far because of you
Could be no other love but ours will do
You were my one more chance
I never thought I'd find
You were the one romance
I've always known in my mind
No one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
I might have saved the best of me for you
No one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
No matter how much we have to learn
I saved the best of me for you
