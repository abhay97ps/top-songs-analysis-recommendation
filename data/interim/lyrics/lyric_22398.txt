Two, one, two, three!
Now, red solo cup is the best receptacle
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs and festivals
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinkin' from glass 
Hey, red solo cup is cheap and disposable
And in fourteen years they are decomposable
And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable
Freddie Mac can kiss my ass, woo!
Red solo cup, uh huh, I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
I love you, red solo cup, I lift you up
Proceed to party, proceed to party
Now, I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
'Cause when beer runs down the front of my back
Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky
But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admirin' how sharply my first name is written
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hittin'
On them to help me get lucky
Red solo cup, I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
I love you, red solo cup, I lift you up
Proceed to party, proceed to party
Now, I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow
But only you, red, will do for this fellow
'Cause you are the Abbott into my Costello
And you are the Fruit to my Loom
Red solo cup, you're more than just plastic
You're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic
Believe me when I'm not the least bit sarcastic
When I look at you and say:
"Red solo cup...
You're not just a cup 
{God no!}
You're my... 
You're my friend, yeah 
Thank you for being my friend"
Red solo cup, I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
I love you, red solo cup 
I lift you up
Proceed to party, proceed to party
Red solo cup, I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
Red solo cup, I lift you up
Let's have a party, proceed to party
Solo cup, solo cup
Solo cup, solo cup
Solo cup, solo cup
Solo cup
