What you want from me?
Just got myself free
Oh yeah
Baby what you want from me?
Only in a day
To change over night?
Ooh I could see you
Tried to love
Tried to find the one
You'll love forever
You'd just a rich baby
How'd you let him get away from you?
I could be walking
Years ago
No one knew my name
Watch out now
How do I know?
Nothing but what I am
This is the picture
I don't know why
I don't know why I bother
But you tried to love
I tried to find the one
You'll love forever
I don't know why you come
By you're wasting your time
I don't know why you come
By nothing left
I can't see why you should lie
I don't know why you come by
I don't know why you come by
I can't see why you should lie
I don't know why you come by
