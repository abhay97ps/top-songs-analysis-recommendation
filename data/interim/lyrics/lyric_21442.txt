This is the moment
It's on the line
Which way you gonna fall?
In the middle
Between wrong and right
But you know after all
It's your life
What you gonna do?
The world is watching you
Everyday the choices you make
Say what you are and who
Your heart beats for
It's an open door
It's your life
Are you who you always said you would be?
With a sinking feeling in your chest
Always waiting for somone else to fix you
Tell me when did you forget
To live the way that you believe
This is your oportunity
To let your life be one that lights the way
