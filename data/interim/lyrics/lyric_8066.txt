Was a hot afternoon
The last day of June
The sun was a demon
The clouds were afraid
One ten in the shade
And the pavement was steaming
I told Billy Ray
In his red Chevrolet
I needed time for some thinking
I was just walking by
When I looked in her eye
And swore it was winking
She was thirty-one and I was seventeen
I knew nothing about love, she knew everything
I sat beside her on the front porch swing
And wondered what the coming night would bring
The sun closed her eyes
As it climbed in the skies
And started to swelter
The sweat trickled down
The front of her gown
I thought it would melt her
She threw back her hair
Like I wasn't there
She sipped on a Julep
Her shoulders were bare
And I tried not to stare
As I looked at her two lips
Then she looked at me, I heard her softly say
"I know you're young, you don't know what to do or say
But stay with me until the sun has gone away...
And I will chase that boy in you away."
Then she smiled
And we talked for awhile
Then we walked for a mile to the sea
We sat on the sands, and a boy took her hand
But I saw the sun rise as a man
Ten years have gone by
Since I looked in her eye
But the memory lingers...
I go back in my mind
To the very first time
The touch of her fingers...
