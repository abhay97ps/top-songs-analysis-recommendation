Cowardly Lion:
"Rrrruf! Rrrruf!! Rrrruf!!!
Put 'em up, put 'em up!"
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

If ever a Wiz there was
If ever, if ever a Wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because, because, because
Of the wonderful things he does
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
Wicked Witch:
 "I'll get you my pretty!
And your little dog, too!"
