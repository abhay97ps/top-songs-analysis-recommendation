He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood
He's bussin' it to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood 
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood
He's bussin' it to Hollywood 
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood
He's waited at bus stops all his life
He's been in and out of those spaces
Seein' eyes that spoke to him
From sad and empty places
Sad and empty places
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood
He's bussin' it to Hollywood 
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood 
You know he's gonna be dressed to kill
He's gonna find some brand new thrills
Whatever he's been looking for, tell him that there's so much more
In Hollywood
Hollywood
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood
He's bussin' it to Hollywood 
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood 
Painted faces, sun-burnt skin
Fixed expressions, smiles worn thin
Caught in the blinkin' neon of Hollywood
Bending battles, maneuvering schemes
False expressions, washed up dreams
Everybody makes believe
In Hollywood
Hollywood 
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood
He's bussin' it to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood 
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood
He's bussin' it to Hollywood 
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood
