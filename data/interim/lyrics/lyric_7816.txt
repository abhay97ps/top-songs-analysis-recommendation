Muffin warm and basket brown
Smiling faces gathered round our dinner table
Close together, hand in hand
I always cook with honey
To sweeten up the night
We always cook with honey
Tell me, hows your appetite
For some sweet love
Find in favor with your neighbor
Well, it can be so fine
Its easier than pie to be kind
We've been searching for so long
Now our house has turned into a home
Well, our door is always open
And there's surely room for more
Cooking where there's good love
Is never any chore
Some come to get to know us
There'll be a place set just for you
Sweet wine before dinner
That is surely bound to soothe
