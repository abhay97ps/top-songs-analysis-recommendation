Once you saw me laughing
Once you saw me crying
Once you saw me so in pain
You thought I was dying
Said I needed some of what you had to offer
But you offered me nothing and that's why I'm off
That's why I'm saying
I wash my hands of the deal
I wash my hands of the whole damn deal
I wash my hands of the deal
I wash my hands of the whole damn deal
Right on, right on, right on
Right on for me, right on for good yeah
Yeah, whooo
Get away, gotta get on down
Get away, gotta get on down
I'm just sick and tired of this plastic cold  situation
The sealing and  of our nation
The man who washes his hands and keeps on going
While the other still not talking or never knowing
Just what they're doing
I wash my hands of the deal
I wash my hands of the whole damn deal
I wash my hands of the deal
I wash my hands of the whole damn deal
Right on, right on, right on
Get away, get on down
Get away, gotta get on down
Get away, gotta get on down
Get away, gotta get on down
Once you saw me laughing
Once you saw me crying
Once you saw me so in pain
You thought I was dying
The others stand by talking but never knowing
That the man who washes his hands and keeps on going
On down the line
While I'm saying
Gotta get away
Get on down
Get away
Get on down
I have to get away
I gotta get away
Gotta get away
Gotta get away
Gotta get away
Get away
From the whole damn deal
Get away
Get away
Get away
Get away
It's alright
Get away
Get on down
Get away
Get away
Get away
Get away
Get away
