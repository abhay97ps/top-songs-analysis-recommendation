Should've known better
Thinking that we'd ever stay together
It's only a matter of time
Something just didn't feel right, oh-oh
I can see what's happening
You were busy acting, look what you're attracting
Telling me she's just a friend
So what are the benefits then? Oh-oh
No you can't have it both ways 
Hope you're enjoying your cake 
I don't want my heart to break 
'Cause I know you got nothing left to say
I don't even care that breaking up is hard to do
The only thing I want back is for this get back to you
I don't even react after everything you put me through
Can't you see I'm just so over, over, over
I'm over getting over you
I'm over getting over you
Don't want to hear excuses
I knew what you been doing
You put me through this
All of your calls and your texts
Now all you can call me is ex 
Thank you for the motivation
Got me out of the situation, translation
It don't matter what you do
It's too late, I'm so over you 
No you can't have it both ways 
Hope you're enjoying your cake 
I don't want my heart to break 
'Cause I know you got nothing left to say
I don't even care that breaking up is hard to do
The only thing I want back is for this get back to you
I don't even react after everything you put me through
Can't you see I'm just so over, over, over
I'm over getting over you
I'm over getting over you
Bet you wish you could forget
All those memories in your head
Every time I picture it all I see are no regrets
No regrets, no regrets
'Cause what you give is what you get 
Breaking up is hard to do 
The only thing I want back is for this get back to you 
I don't even react after everything you put me through 
See I'm just so over, over, over
I'm over getting over you 
I'm over getting over you 
I'm over getting over you 
I'm so over
I'm over getting over you 
I'm so over you
