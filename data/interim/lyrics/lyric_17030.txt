Baby dim the lights
While I pour the wine
Slip the music up nice and slow
Wanna move with u inside a groove
Like no one's ever known
Let your body unwind in the warmth of mine
Tell me what you like
Cause tonight I wanna turn you on to paradise
Sweet thing hold me close
And we can make the magic flow
Once the music is right
Give me slow jams and hot romance
Rock me with that tender dance
Share my sweet groove the whole night through
Let me lay my beat on you
Let me get a taste of some babyface
And you know it'll be alright
Cause the road that ends at boyz to men
Is the road I wanna ride
We can go to the moon on a stevie tune
Fly ribbons in the sky
Give me everything r. kelly sings Let us bump and grind
Baby feel the beat
Move with me in ecstacy
Let the melody rise yeah yeah
Give me slow jams and hot romance
Rock me in that tender dance
Share my sweet groove the whole night through
Make tonight a dream come true
There's something that feels so right
Deep inside of your rhythm
When I feel your beat inside my soul
 can't control
Sweet thing hold me close
We can make the magic flow
Once the music is right
Give me slow jams and hot romance
Rock me with that tender dance
Share my sweet groove the whole night through
Let's keep this good thing going Move in time with something good
