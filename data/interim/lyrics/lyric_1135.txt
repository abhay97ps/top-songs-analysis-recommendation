Mmmmm
Here comes the mailman walking up the street
And it looks like he has a letter today for me
Wait a minute let me look inside no it couldn't be from my guy
Because he he brought me, 
I said he he brought me, 
A letter full of tears
I thought we had a love so strong 
It would take a lifetime to break us apart
Oh yes
But I found out today I was wrong
And my reward was a broken heart my my heart
Oh here comes the teardrops welcome a welcome to my eyes
And I couldn't hold 'em back no matter if I tried
Wo wo oh
You know it hurt me so inside
Won't you pardon me while I cry
Because he brought me 
I said he brought me  a letter full of tears
 Those aren't drip drop tears 
Can't you see them falling  wo
Wo oh wo wo oh wo wo oh oh oh (hey, yes he did, hey hey , yes he did, hey
Hey hey woo
Yes he did)
I thought 
We had a love so strong
