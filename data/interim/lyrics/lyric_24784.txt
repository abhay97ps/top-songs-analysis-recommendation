Huh?
Huncho, Gato
Bad bitch know somethin' 
Give her that money, go and blow somethin' 
She want a rack 'til I pop somethin' 
She want a trick, I'm not one 
Pull up and hop on a baddie 
She wanna text me the addie 
They know we havin' it 
Drums to the face, closed casket 
The pot look greasy 
Suck me up, she please me 
Chanel like CC 
Upgrade a bitch from Bebe 
If she see money, she go get it 
All of her friends, they go with her 
She keep up them bands with no nigga 
She keep up them bands with no nigga 
She see blue faces, it's no explanation 
Can you make this paper all across the nation? 
Told her just be patient, I'ma make you famous 
If yo' nigga want beef, treat it like it's Angus 
Little bit of dick, get nasty  I gotta tip her 
I got a pretty girl, low-key classy  I gotta flip her 
I ain't here for no pictures  put Huncho in the middle 
Young nigga poppin' them bands  like Marshawn poppin' them Skittles 
Young nigga got a big green truck, lookin' like Riddler, Riddler 
What bitch name with the mean suck? Damn, I can't even remember 
Money fall, yell, timber  ice on in the winter 
Put the plug in the blender  then he showed up for dinner 
Bad bitch know somethin' 
Give her that money, go and blow somethin'  
She want a rack 'til I pop somethin' 
She want a trick, I'm not one 
Pull up and hop on a baddie 
She wanna text me the addie 
They know we havin' it 
Drums to the face, closed casket  
The pot look greasy 
Suck me up, she please me

If she see money, she go get it 
All of her friends, they go with her  
She keep up them bands with no nigga 
She keep up them bands with no nigga 
I suppose, propose, to show off my Rollie in Rolls 
This goes, them hoes, we OC, outta control
Fuck the folks and the border patrol
Coast guard, free all of the bros 
We the goats, who want some smoke
Cause we set all of the smokes
We got lows, my 66' spokes
They look like dinner rolls 
I hit my coupe, now it's a centerfold 
Multi-million, but I jiggalo 
My portfolio say I sold plenty coke
Wop!

Applyin' the pressure for mo' millions 
The bricks come from Japan and Korea 
I done made 2.5 on my Nokia 
He got kidnapped after that shit too real
Bad bitch, she walkin' with Chanel on her feet 
Litty got her titties done, now she on fleek
Plain Jane rollin' with the bust AP 
I make the thottie meet me at the Grand Marquis 
Playin' for keeps, gotta move it low-key 
She tryna fuck, she in heat 
Yeah, she gotta fuck by the three 
Tip toein' back door and creep 
I don't know no tricks, but I treat 
I told her to suck with a beat
Put Emerald sets in my links 
24-karat my sink 
17-5 for the mink 
Turn the housewife to a freak 
And I got the ice on fleek 
Chanel, double down, CC 
He'll tell you, it's a price on me 
Ran off, made your life on me 
No gun, pull a knife on me 
Back back, get your wife off me 
On sight with me  my diamonds fight with me 
Can't clone, we on, fly like drones, they bitin' me 
A sight to see  this gas tank on E 
North Pole, wrist on freeze , wait 'til my dawg get free
