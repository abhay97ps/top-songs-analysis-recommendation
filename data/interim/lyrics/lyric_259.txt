(Hey, Bill Bailey, Don't look now but somebody's calling you
Who? Why, your lady friend, that's who
If I were you, If I were you, I'd get my little old self home)
Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home?
She moans the whole day long
I'll do the cookin', honey, I'll pay the rent
I know I done you wrong
Do you remember that rainy evenin'
I threw you out with nothin' but a fine tooth co-oo-omb?
Ya, I know I'm to blame, ain't it a shame
Bailey, won't you please come home

I know, I know I done you wroo-oo-ong
Do you remember that rainy evenin', ah
