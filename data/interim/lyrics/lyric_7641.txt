Sittin' stoned alone in my backyard
Askin' myself "Why should I work so hard?"
Sittin' dreamin' 'bout the days to come
Half-undressed, just soakin' up the sun
Sittin' here, I hope I don't get fried
Two years ago, you know, I almost died
And yet, there's nothin' better for your soul
Than lyin' in the sun and listenin' to rock 'n roll
Sunny days
Oh, sunny, sunny, sunny days
Ain't nothin' better in the world, you know
Than lyin' in the sun with your radio
Sunny days
Oh, sunny, sunny, sunny days
Ain't nothin' better in the world, you know
Than lyin' in the sun with your radio
I really think there's nothin' quite so fine
As lettin' the sun rejuvenate your mind
Don't get me wrong, I really dig the moon
But it was four in the afternoon when I wrote this tune
And now the sun's about to fade away
I'm feelin' better than I've felt for days
You know, there's nothin' better for your soul
Than lyin' in the sun and listenin' to rock 'n roll
Sunny days
Oh, sunny, sunny, sunny days
Ain't nothin' better in the world, you know
Than lyin' in the sun with your radio
Sunny days
Oh, sunny, sunny, sunny days
Ain't nothin' better in the world, you know
Than lyin' in the sun with your radio
------ instrumental break ------
Sunny days
Oh, sunny, sunny, sunny days
Ain't nothin' better in the world, you know
Than lyin' in the sun with your radio
Sunny days
Oh, sunny, sunny, sunny days
Ain't nothin' better in the world, you know
Than lyin' in the sun with your radio
