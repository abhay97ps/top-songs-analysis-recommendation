Tired of drifting, searching, shifting through town to town
Every time I slip and slide a little further down
I can't blame you if you won't take me back
After everything I put you through
But honey you're my last hope
And who else can I turn to
Come on Silver Lady take my word
I won't run out on you again believe me
Oh, I've seen the light
It's just one more fight
Without you
Here I am a million miles from home
The Indiana wind and rain cut through me
I'm lost and alone, chilled to the bone
Silver Lady
Double talkers, backstreet walkers at every turn
Seedy motels and no star hotels still I had to learn
That the one shining thing in my mind
Was the sweet love I had with you
And honey you're my last hope
And who else can I turn to
Come on Silver Lady take my word
I won't run out on you again believe me
Oh, I've seen the light
It's just one more fight
Without you
Here I am a million miles from home
The Indiana wind and rain cut through me
I'm lost and alone, chilled to the bone
Silver Lady
Can't you find it in you to forgive me
Cause here I am a million miles from home
The Indiana wind and rain cut through me
I'm lost and alone, chilled to the bone
Silver Lady
Come on Silver Lady take my word
I won't run out on you again believe me
Oh, I've seen the light
It's just one more fight
Without you
Here I am a million miles from home
The Indiana wind and rain cut through me
I'm lost and alone, chilled to the bone
Silver Lady
