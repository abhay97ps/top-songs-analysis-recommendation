Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Bass
It's quarter to two
And I've still got you
On my mind, oh baby
I'm just a prisoner
Trapped in the chains
Of your love, it cuts like a knife
Imagining life without you
Oh, darling
I'm up to the challenge
And I'm willing to fight
I'd do anything to have you
With me tonight, oh baby
I'd swim a river
If the river was wide
I'd climb a mountain
If the mountain was high
I'd do anything, girl
Just to be by your side
I'm out of my mind
My love is a fire
It's heaven on earth
And we don't need words
To describe it
I'm lost in forever
I don't ever wanna come down
I was a fool
I broke every rule before you, girl
Searching for answers
And I've looked high and low
Now that I've found you, girl
I can't let you go, oh baby
Id swim a river
If the river was wide
Id climb a mountain
If the mountain was high
Id do anything, girl
Just to be by your side
I'm out of my mind
My love is a fire
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm burning up, can't cool down
Flames getting higher
Burning down to the ground
I'd swim a river
If the river was wide
I'd climb a mountain
If the mountain was high
I'd do anything, girl
Just to be by your side
I'm out of my mind
My love is a fire
I'd swim a river
If the river was wide
I'd climb a mountain
If the mountain was high
I'd do anything, girl
Just to be by your side
I'm out of my mind
My love is a fire
I'd swim a river
If the river was wide
I'd climb a mountain
If the mountain was high
I'd do anything, girl
Just to be by your side
I'm out of my mind
My love is a fire
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
