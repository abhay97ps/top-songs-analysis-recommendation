If it ain't one thing it's another
If it ain't one thing it's another
It's a crazy mixed up world, it's a dog eat dog world
Life is full strife, people just aren't nice
Everybody's talking smack, Running games on this and that
Racial resentment adds to this contentment
Talk to any guy he'll tell you taxes are too high
Books movies are corrupt, suicide is way up
Kids are a sorry lot, some folks say it's kind of pot
Phony ego trips, everyone has flipped
If it ain't one thing it's another
If it ain't one thing it's another
Everybody's shacking up, married folks are packing up
Country's going up in smoke, Where is Noah with his boat
Blacks marching on dc, 400 years still not free
Martin paid all a man can pay, still he's not a holiday
Folks messing with my mind, make me Frankenstein
This woman by my side, she's Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde
Can't get my head on right, problems day and night
Try to calm my nerves I've tried smoke, Doctors give me dope to cope
If it ain't one thing it's another
If it ain't one thing it's another
If it ain't one thing it's another
My funky two bit job went on strike
I've put up with a lot of crap I don't like
And to add to my woes, this ugly woman named Sadie called and said she's having my baby
Go have mercy
From my day of birth I've called hell on earth
A number is all I am, ain't got no frills don't give a...
If you don't got no pull, you've got to put up with a lot of bull
This funky world is cold, I oughta flush myself down the...
If it ain't one thing it's another
If it ain't one thing it's another
If it ain't one thing it's another
If it ain't one thing it's another
My friends, I wonder if it's ok if I talk to you this evening
A long time ago my old grandmother bless her heart
Used to sit me on her knee and pull out her Good Book
And she said my son, my child, don't you ever get to grown, to famous, to rich to forget the man upstairs
And she used to turn to Matthew chapter 24, and there the disciples would talking to the master
And they said Lord tell us what will be the sign of your coming
And the end to all this confusion on Earth
And the Good Lord said, my children watch out that nobody deceive you
For the last days, there'll be lots of tribulation, wars, and famines
And earthquakes on different places on the Earth
And there will be no understanding among the people of the Earth
He said but as you see these things occurring
Don't become too discouraged, just lift yours head up high
Because your deliverance is getting nearer
And he spoke about the proclamation about coming kingdom or government of god
That will eventually take over this Earth and rule over the whole Earth
And turning to Daniel chapter two
And there Daniel describes that this kingdom won't be an earthly kingdom
But it will be ruled by God
Note in the book of Revelations it talks
About how there will be a man who'll be Jesus
And whose faithful 144, 000 who would bring all of mankind back to perfection
Aw, somebody out there knows exactly what I'm talking about
Isaiah, Isaiah, a long time ago said I see old people growing young again
I see lame people running and leaping just like a gazelle
And blind people will see again
And we won't have to worry about our children going out to play at night
They'll be able to play with a snake, brotherhood
There'll be brotherhood and peace and tranquility on the earth
Aw it makes me feel good when I read over in Revelations
That it say God would wipe out every tear from my eyes
Yeah that's in Revelations chapter 21
Why don't you pick up a Good Book and read all about it for yourselves
And my friends I don't know if I'll ever see you again
Life is certainly uncertain these days
I'm sure you'll agree to that
But keep dreaming the big dream
Get down on your knees and ask the big guy in the sky for his spirit to sustain you
And pray for me, I'll be praying for you
