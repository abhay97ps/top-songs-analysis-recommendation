Yeah, time to bring your ass to the table, y’all
It’s X to the Z, Xzibit, yeah
Yeah, Snoop double D, uh, OG
What
Bringin' it live, Dr. Dre, what
Throwin' up a big ass W coverin' up the world, right
Yeah, ha
Listen
You ain't tryna hot box with me, I swing much quicker
Goin' down by the second round, all hail the underground
How that sound? Xzibit backin' down from a conflict
Nothin' but nonsense and terrorists keep the bomb lit
Glass and metal in every direction
Anybody tryna stop us taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
The reason you talkin' loud but keep on steppin'
Xzibit ready to scrap like Mike Tyson with his license back
9 to 5 minimum wage? What type of life is that
For me? It's blasphemy
You touchin' down with the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy
You had the audacity to wanna tangle with the X
I suggest you give me five feet and show some respect
Stay hungry, always stackin' my loot
While other rappers gettin' "Treated Like a Prostitute"
Just check the SoundScan
All I wanna be was a G, ha
My whole life, homie please, ha
Breakin' off these keys for the G's, ha
Let's do this for them DPG's, ha
Homie, you don't wanna step to this
Ah nah, big Snoop Dogg
Back up in the heezy, baby
You jockin' my style? You so crazy
Dre say, ain't "No Limit" to this 
As long as we drop gangsta hits
Now look here, trick, you fine and I dig your style
Come chill with a playa, do it doggystyle
I'll be gentle, sentimental
Yeah, we did it in a rental
Lincoln Continental, hmm
Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago
I get the coochie everywhere that I go
Ask the chickens in your hood 'cause they know
I get the coochie everywhere that I go
Ask the chickens in your hood 'cause they know
Trick, please, me and Snoop came to give you what you need
Look, you dealin' with some real OG's
I'll show you how to flip it into cheese
Trick, please; trick, please
You're lookin' for some real OG's
Me and Snoop came to give you what you need
Yeah, I'll show you how to flip it into cheese
Trick, freeze
Trick, please - now what you need to do is
Hem my coat, and pass me some smoke 
Different strokes  for different folks
Oh, you like settin' homies up and gettin' them locs?
Ol' cute lil' freak with a whole lotta heart
The lick gets thick when them lights gets dark
She say she got a lick for me 
Worth about 200 G's and 30 ki's
Now check this out, Dre: now, if I don't move
Then a G like me, then I don't lose
But you know me, Dogg, I'm movin'
Ain't nothin' to it but to get to groovin'
You've been waitin' on a G like me 
To take that chance and rob your man and beat up the coochie
A victim of the circumstance 
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
See, we go out with a bang 
I'm tryna work this cold thang
And take this whole thang
I get the money everywhere that I go 
I bust a trick and take her money fo' sho 
I get the money everywhere that I go 
I bust a trick and take her money fo' sho 
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming DPG 'til the day I D-I-E
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming DPG 'til the day I D-I-E
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming DPG 'til the day I D-I-E
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming DPG 'til the day I D-I-E
