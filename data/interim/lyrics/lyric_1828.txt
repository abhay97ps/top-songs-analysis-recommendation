I want to know, know, know, know, know
I've got to know, know, know, know, know
How could I forget
When I was lonely, she chased away
The little girl chased away all of my blues
When I was down and out
She went somewhere and bought me
She brought me a brand new pair of shoes
So tell me, tell me, tell me
How, how, how, how
How could I forget
Yesterday she left for somebody new
My friends all say forget her
Go out and do the same they do
But how when her kisses still lingers on my lips
And my cheeks, ask for her finger tips
Since she's been gone, I can't sleep at night
And since she's been gone, I can't eat or bite
Oh, so tell me, tell me, tell me
How, how, how, how, how
How can I forget
I wanna know how can I forget
And I've got to know, I've for got know
How can I forget
I've got to know somebody help me forget my baby, baby, baby
How can I forget, forget, forget
