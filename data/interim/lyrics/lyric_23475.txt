I never thought youâ€™d pick up the phone
It's Friday night, you should be out on the town
Didn't think you'd be sittin' at home all alone like me
Nothin' on TV, nothin' to do
Nothin' to keep my mind off you and me
And the way it was
Are you thinkin' 'bout it now because
I could be there in five
One more one last time
We don't have to be lonely tonight
We don't have to be lonely tonight
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heartbreak's gone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight
That taste, that touch, the fire I miss
Those kiss me eyes, your red wine lips on mine
Like it used to be
Baby I want you and and you want me and
We don't have to be lonely tonight
We don't have to be lonely tonight
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heart breaks stone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight
I can be there in five
One more one last time
We don't have to be lonely tonight
We don't have to be lonely tonight, tonight, tonight
Yeah, yeah
