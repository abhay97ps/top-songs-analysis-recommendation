Some kids have and some don't
And some of us are wondering why
Mom won't watch the news at night
There's too much stuff that's making her cry
We need some help
Down here on earth
A thousand prayers, a million words
But one voice was heard
A house
A yard
A neighborhood
Where you can ride your new bike to school
A kind of world where Mom and Dad
Still believe in the golden rule
Life's not that simple
Down here on earth
A thousand prayers, a million words
But one voice was heard
One voice, one simple word
Hearts know what to say
One dream can change the world
Keep believing
Till you find a way
Yesterday, while walking home
I saw some kid on Newberry Road
He pulled a pistol from his bag
And tossed it in the river below
Thanks for the help
Down here on earth
A thousand prayers, a million words
But one voice was heard
One voice was heard
One voice was heard
