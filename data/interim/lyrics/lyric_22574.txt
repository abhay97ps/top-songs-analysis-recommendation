And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party
I stumble up to the window
Opened the curtains to blinding lights
Make up all over the pillow
What went on? What went on?
What went on last night?
You look so sweet while you're dreaming 
Holding your bottle of Tanqueray 
It isn't even the weekend
Baby, that's how I know you're the one for me
I wanna party and bullshit 
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit 
And party, and party
'Cause when the sun sets, baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah, when I'm with you
So put your arms around me, baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do
We got that sweet, hot loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets, we're running
Shut down every bar
So put your arms around me, baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
Hungover, I think I'm broken
You say the fix is a shot of Jack
I said, "Man, what are you smokin'?"
But alright, pour a glass, and we'll throw 'em back
I wanna party and bullshit 
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit 
And party, and party
'Cause when the sun sets, baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah, when I'm with you
So put your arms around me, baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do
We got that sweet, hot loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets, we're running
Shut down every bar
So put your arms around me, baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party
I wanna party and bullshit 
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit 
And party, and party
'Cause when the sun sets, baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah when I'm with you
So put your arms around me, baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do
We got that sweet hot loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets we're running
Shut down every bar
So put your arms around me, baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and party
