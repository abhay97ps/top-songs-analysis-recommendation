It's a happening thing, and it's happening to you
Full moon and thunder, ribbons of blue
Ice on the window, ice in my heart
Fooling with thunder, every time we start
It's been raining for so long
It's been raining for so long
Oh is it any wonder, the streets are dark
Is it any wonder, we fall apart
Day after day straight rain falls down
All over town, rain come
It's been raining for so long
It's been raining for so long
Don't you go out in the rain
Don't go out in pouring rain
If you go out in the rain
We'll never have that time again
Is it any wonder, streets are dark
Is it any wonder, we fall apart
All these feelings that seem so wrong
Remember when we were so strong
Well it's been raining for so long
It's been raining I can't go on
Don't you go out in the rain
Don't go out in pouring rain
If you go out in the rain
We'll never have that time again
Don't you go out in the rain
Don't go out in pouring rain
If you go out in the rain
We'll never have that time again
Don't you go out in the rain...
