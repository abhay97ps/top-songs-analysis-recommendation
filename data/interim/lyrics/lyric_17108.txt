The radio plays our favorite song
And it's what keeps me holding on
Baby, do you miss me
Now that I'm gone
I remember the love we had
How could I forget
I remember the tears I cried
Over one regret
Now we're alone, so alone
I can't help thinking about you
All the love in the world
And I'm lonely without you
Chorus:
The radio plays our favorite song
And it's what keeps me holding on
Baby, do you miss me
Now that I'm gone, yeah
Get the DJ to play our favorite song
'Cause it's what keeps me holding on
Baby, do you miss me
Now that I'm gone
I remember the love we had
Not a day goes by
Heaven knows where you are right now
But my heart won't lie
We were in love so in love
My mind's been speaking about you
All the love in the world
And I'm lonely without you
