I never thought I'd see
You turn your back on me
And taste another kiss with such delight
It hurt me so inside
Oh Lord
I musta' cried
The tear of the year
Last night
And darlin'
When I heard
That final, crushing word
That someone else's arms would hold you tight.,
I wished that I was dead
Oh Lord
You konow I shed
The tear of the year
Last night
I built my whole world around you
By each and every dream
And now you're slipping
Through my fingers
Like the ripples
In a stream
Oh!
Oh darlin'
You can say
Our love has seen it's day
But I'll forever go on feelin' blue
I feel the hurt inside
I felt the night I cried
The tear of the year
Over you
Oh!
The tear
Of the year
Oh!
Over you
