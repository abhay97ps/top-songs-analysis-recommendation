I know it hurts
It truly, truly hurts
When you know
The girl don't care
You cry, cry her a river
But she don't care
You know the girl don't care
Silently, you wait
Not wanting to complain
Convincing yourself
Convincing yourself
That things will change
But meanwhile
It hurts, it hurts
It truly, truly hurts
When you know
The girl don't care
You cry like a baby
But she don't care
You're getting nowhere
You're getting nowhere
Oh, you're getting nowhere
What can the future hold
The future hold, hold for you
Oh, we're lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, baby
Lonely and forever blue
They say, they say
They say, they say
That you and I
That you and I
We shouldn't cry
But I just wanna tell you now
Come on, fellas, come on now
Let's tell the truth
Let's tell them, tell them
Tell them, tell them that it hurts
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, how it hurts
Oh, you know the girl don't care
You bend over backwards
You do everything you can
To make her happy but
The girl, she just don't care
My, my, my, my
No matter what you do
The girl, she just
She just don't really care
Come on, fellas
Let's tell them how it hurts
Let's tell them how it hurts
And then maybe, the girl
She just might care
