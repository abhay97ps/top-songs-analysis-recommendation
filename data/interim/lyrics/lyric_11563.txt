She spins the wheel of fortune on the boardwalk
Where lovers draw their secrets in the sand
Those Coney Island boys in satin jackets
Choose up among themselves
To see who get a chance at those
 They like to talk tough
 They shine in the rough
 Hold on, I'm coming for you
She dreams about the lights across the river
Dances in the dark while the radio plays
She knows that someone out there must be waiting
To take her in his arms
And steal her heart away, oh
 They like to talk tough
 They shine in the rough
 Hold on, I'm coming for you
So much love, lost in a crowd
Take a look around
She's just waiting to be found
 They like to talk tough
 They shine in the rough
 Hold on, I'm coming for you
 They like to talk tough guy
 They shine in the rough
 Hold on, I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you 
Brooklyn girls, they like to talk tough
Brooklyn girls, they shine in the rough, hey
I'm coming for you
