Slow Pain
The O.G
The album
Past due
I made this album for my fans
Cause I love you
Everything I say
Everything I do
Is comin' from the heart
Come here, little youngster
Let me take you on a ride
The journey
In my low-low
Slow Pain
The bald headed cholo
Uh
You feel me
Slow Pain, homeboy, I love the game, homeboy
Ten years strong, doin' my thang, homeboy
Put the raza on the map 
Since way back
In '95, doin' car shows with Roger and Zapp 
Thinkin' back to the good days
The good times
Bust a freestyle raps
To It's A Thin Line
Mary Wells in my lowrider 
I got Two Lovers 
Makin' love Between The Sheets by The Isley Brothers 
Fifty-thirties creased up
I said it first 
My feet rollin' in a Regal since my first verse
Remember me?
The Baby O.G
Yellin' 213
When it's sorry, used to be 
No 562's
No 310's 
No 626's
No wack ass flows 
Just a few good men
Rappin' on the mic 
Yellin' brown ride
Reppin' that raza right 
Chorus: Slow Pain
This is how we ride
Every single day
Livin' do or die
Rollin' through L.A
Born into the game
My daddy was a G
If I'm Lil' Savage, then my son's Savage Three
Repeat Chorus
Hooked up with Tony G and the homie Eazy E 
Then the song Coup DeVille
With the sickest A.L.T. 
I miss my dawg 
Alvin Louis Trevette 
He was the baddest brown rapper that I ever met
Get at me, homie 
You know I'm still right here 
Both our hands in the air
And a tall can beer 
Like it used to be
Back in the days
When we was broke as fuck in my room, playin' spades
Hit the Alley Colliseum with Cypress Hill and Ice Cube
In my
County blues and howl slipper shoes
I rock that shit 
Like a '64 rag
Forty thousand gangsta homies
Wavin' the Mexican flag
In the year before
I was in the crowd, at the top 
Chest to chest
Beefin' with the cops
Me and my dreams come true 
Now, I'm in the rap game
Ten years later, sayin' gracias for everythang 
Repeat Chorus Twice
I met Bone Thugs 
Before they had any Harmony
Did the Superbowl half time party 
With Kris Kross, Jump Around, Deborah Cox and Keith Sweat
All drunk, got subbed with Eazy tatted on my neck
Came home and bought a dope ass
Supersport
In '98, hooked up
With the playa Too $hort 
He said, "Slow Pain
You little Tony Montana" 
Two days later, I was recording in Atlanta
Kickin' back with Andre Rosland
And Eightball
At the strip club, watchin' Top Shaw shotcall 
Sippin' on Corona with a gangsta lean
I swear to God it all happened, I know it sounds like a dream 
And to my fans
There's no me without you
My kids won't eat without you
That's why I love you 
That's some real shit 
It's comin' straight from the heart
It's 12 o'clock midnight 
And I'm sittin' in the park 
Repeat Chorus Til Fade
