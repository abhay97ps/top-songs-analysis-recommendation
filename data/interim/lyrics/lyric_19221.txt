So, you lit her cigarette
You're feeling pretty good
You think you've got a shot
Most girls, you probably would
Yeah, this is that kind of place
But she ain't that kind of girl
You're reading it all wrong
Let me tell you about her
She only smokes when she drinks
She only drinks now and then
Now and then when she's tired
Of being let down by men
You can give her a light
But it's not what you think
Everybody knows she only drinks alone
And she only smokes when she drinks
Did you ask her to dance?
Let me guess, she told you no
Got to take her someplace quiet
And see how far that goes
Oh, don't take it all that hard
When she smiles and turns you down
For a complicated girl
She ain't that hard to figure out
She only smokes when she drinks
She only drinks now and then
Now and then when she's tired
Of being let down by men
You can give her a light
But it's not what you think
Everybody knows she only drinks alone
And she only smokes when she drinks
Oh, she only smokes when she drinks
She only drinks now and then
Now and then when she's tired
Of being let down by men
You can give her a light
But it's not what you think
Everybody knows she only drinks alone
And she only smokes when she drinks
Yeah, that's right
