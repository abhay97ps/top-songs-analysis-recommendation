I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
Oh, I'll be waiting on you 'cause I...
I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
With you, with you
Sitting here, I've been drinking cheers
Thought I'd have me some fun
Feeling free, being me
While the night's still young
Oh, I've been watching you
I'm waiting to
Well, I've got this in hand
There's a style
In your smile
You fit right into my plan
I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
Well I'll be waiting on you, 'cause I...
I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
With you, with you
You didn't think I saw
You out there on the floor
The truth is I've been watching
Since you walked right in the door
So let me make it clear
The moment that you're near
I'm gonna put my hooks in you
There's nothing you can do
I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
That's what I've been waiting for, yeah, yeah
I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
With you, with you
I'm reaching out, I'm hoping that
You will take me by my hand
Slip your soul right into mine
Say you'll, say you'll be my dancing man
Movements flow, it's time to go
Tell me, your place or mine?
Me and you
'Cause love is new
Let's try this one more time
Now that we have met
I'd really like to get
To know the way you feel
About the things I say
So baby, let me know
'Cause I don't wanna go
So give me all your lovin' and
We'll dance forever more
I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
That's what I've been waiting for, yeah, yeah
I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
With you, with you
I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
Did we do alright tonight?
Can we go all night tonight?
I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
With you, with you
Rock me
'Til I'm ready
Hold me
Hold me steady
