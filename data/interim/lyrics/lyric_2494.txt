Paroles de la chanson Big Party :
Big party, big party, big party
She invited me cause she
Knew you would bring me
She make it so plain to see
She's trying to take you from me
It's a big party
But a sad party for me
I can hear her laughter
And I know what she's after
Can I make you see
She's trying to take you from me
It's a big party
But a sad party for me
So if you want her
More than you want me
Tell me now, tell me now
So I can leave
Don't ever bother taking me home
I know the way there, all alone
Oh, it's a big party 
Oh, yes it is 
Oh, big party 
Now she turned the lights down low
And the music they playing is slow
I see the way she look at you
I see the way you look at her too
 oh, yes it is
 I wish I was with him
 oh, it's a big party
 whoa, yes
 oh, yes
 it's a mighty
A mighty big party
 a mighty fine party
 whoa, oh, oh
 whoa, oh, oh
 some party
 I wish I wasn't
Here tonight
