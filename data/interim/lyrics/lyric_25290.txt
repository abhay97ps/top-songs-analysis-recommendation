I was like whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-woah-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Won't look back on my mind
Won't let bad out my shine
Won't let you cloud my mind
Won't let you cloud my mind
All my days, I was cryin'
All my lows, all my highs
Told my Mom, "I'm gon' shine"
Told my love, "I'm gon'-"
And I was like
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
And I was like
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
