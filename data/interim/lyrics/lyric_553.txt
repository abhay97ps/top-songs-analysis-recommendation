VERSE 01: Eminem
Something's burning, I can't figure out what 
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded, must just be the powder from the power of 
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone, is that my soon to be spouse’s moan
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt I
Think I might be about to busta, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts - brace
Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo," cause my head already goes to worst case Scenario, though in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face
First, "no  you don't  under  stand 
I  don't  do  this for anyone, ever"
Yeah that ain't what they all say
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiance
'Til you sucked on Wayne, Andre, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e, Polow Tha Don, Dre
Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame
Guess I'm gettin' my g-god dang Jigga on, eh
Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playing
BRIDGE:
The game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la love
HOOK: Kendrick Lamar
She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her

VERSE 02: Kendrick Lamar
I told that bitch
I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick
Sucking dick in your momma tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion, they booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fucking Ferris Wheel
Fucking spinning on me, fuck you think we gon' get married still?
Fucking Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fucking feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it or fucking eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day,"bitch, you serious
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fucking with me, you cut me deep as a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin,I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killing him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talking cordial, yeah I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it, what about if I was as famous
As Marshall? Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin' "I hope she's good enough"
Meanwhile you're chasing her
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me,I'ma live with the

HOOK: Eminem & Kendrick Lamar
VERSE 03: B.K.P
I'm kinda scared of this three-way
We all breakin hearts is like we in a relay
She jumps team to team like D Wade's ex teammate
Now she's getting ready for a cremate
Here's goes my last excuse, cliché, it's always my fault anyway
We fuckin on the table? Lemmie hope it's able
She pushes my face into the cement, she stomps and steps on it
Each day like she is my cheese grate
They say what we display, is symbolic of a simple play
We got back together but she forgot my b-day, so I made it judgment day
Simple misunderstandin but just as I tried to save our love
That's when I realized that it may be broken but wait
Bitch my life be so much better, so I fixed it like 6 ways
Goin on 15 to 16, thank God there's an exit coming up
What the motha S.H.I.T's wrong with her?
Shit my fuckin pants off when she reached into my goddamn vault
Now here she comes at full speed, she's coming at me, okay
You wanna lie to me, eh?
Snatched a bitch out her car through the window, she screamin
And created a sinkhole, buried this ho in it
Then asked if she'd like her V-ga remade
 Woke up next to MJ
In a dream state like I'm here playin next to the great during the big game
Guess I eventually scored though, cause some girl was layin next to me
In bed aiming directly at my goddamn head
Woke up again and jumped up like fuck it, I've had it, I'm checkin into rehab
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I can't think clearly
Every girl I've ever had said I am too much of a challenge
Or I'm too fuckin romantic
Man what the fuck is the matter, I'm just a fuckin sporadic
I fuckin love you, you fuckin bitch!
Excessive, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at my ex
I might have set off a chain reaction of translated events
I said, “Take a load” and after she left, I sent that bitch a text
I said, “Be careful drivin, don't read this and have an accident!”
She glanced to look at it and texted
“Too bad, thought we had a connect, no sense crying makes”
Never been more confused thinkin what's next
Next to a bitch covered in lipstick and mace
Who fell from heaven 15 feet for storytellin
While the whore was yellin, “Help”
Til her vocal cords were swellin
And her voice is smellin worse than two mating mates
Still they skipped the dates
And went right to the bed, don't ask me too join a way
Wait, fuck it, it may be sweaty as MJ in a big game
But if she's overweight, don't ask me for a date
But wait, I think that's a mistake
I don't want a three-way, I want a real bae
I have infinite love for fat butts
It's mainly because of the game of, 
“Wait, that ass straight?”
I have infinite love for fat butts
It's mainly because of the game of....
OUTRO:
Love, love, love, love
L-l, I-I-I-love
