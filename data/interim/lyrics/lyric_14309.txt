It was late one night
And we had a fight
And it seemed like nothing
Was going right
Then you turned around
And you walked
Right out the door
Now it`s not the first time
It`s not the last
I know all about
Your checkered past
And we played this game
One thousand times before
Do you remember the night
I can see it so clear
All the sweet little things
That you sang in my ear
There were promises made
But I think you forgot
What you said
There`s a real fine line
Between love and hate
And I`m not the type
To just sit and wait
I`ve made up my mind
I can`t wait for you anymore
But when we kiss
It feels like this
And when we touch
It means so much
So many days go by
And I still want you so
If it was up to me
I`d never let you go
You`re the only true love in my life
And I want you to know
All this passion and pain
I think I`m going insane
We`ve got nothing to lose
And so much to gain
If you love me today
Who`s to say you`d not leave me again
Do you remember the night
I can see it so clear
All the sweet little things
That you sang in my ear
There were promises made
But I think you forgot
What you said
There`s a real fine line
Between love and hate
And I`m not the type
To just sit and wait
I`ve made up my mind
I can`t wait for you anymore
But when we kiss
It feels like this
And when we touch
It means so much
