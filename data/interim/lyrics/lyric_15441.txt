Black silk on satin skin, it's late at night and it's as hot as sin
We're gonna make it, get hotta yet !
Red velvet rocking-chair, I'm gonna show you why I put it there
To build a rhythm you won't forget !
We got the chemistry to make the fantasy become reality
You got the attitude to put me in the mood
Ooh la la la, I said ooh la la, baby do that ooh la la
I really love your ooh la la, do whatever you want with me !
I want ooh la la, a little harder, ooh la la
Ah, easy now, ooh la la, I'm coming closer to ecstacy !
One time whet my appetite, I could eat a lot more tonight
And you can feed me like no one else !
We're asleep from dawn to noon, waking up in a double spoon
Another turn on this carousel !
We got the chemistry to make the fantasy become reality
You got the attitude to put me in the mood
Ooh la la la, I said ooh la la, baby do that ooh la la
I really love your ooh la la, do whatever you want with me !
I want ooh la la, a little harder, ooh la la
Ah, easy now, ooh la la, I'm coming closer to ecstacy !
Ya know it feels so good, ya know it feels so right, girl
Come on come on come on
