It's strange to hear your voice
I did not expect for you to call
You wonder how I'm doing
How I'm holding up
Since you did me wrong
Well how am I doing since you did what you done to me?
I can't lie I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doing since you did what you done to me
Well now wait one minute, I
Failed to mention
Those tears I cried, are tears of joy
Cause' it was no fun there
Under your thumb and
Now that we're done I'm
Getting right every night
With every single ever-loving girl in sight, so
Well when all my friends heard what a
You know what you were they
Took me out on the town
But then I heard our song and
I dance along but
It felt all wrong cause
She was sweet, she let me lead
She never took her ever-loving eyes off me so
Well I don't know what you were thinking
Running round on me
Now you say you're sorry
Well honey I agree...so
How are you doing since you did
What you done to me
Girl don't lie you know you cry
Cause' you know how good it used to be
Yeah, tell me does the thought of
Losing my true love make it hard to sleep, baby
How are you doing since you did
What you done to me
Yeah how are you doing, now that you know
How I'm doing since you did
What you done to me
