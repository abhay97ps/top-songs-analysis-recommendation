The note was short, but lord so strong
It simply said I can't go on
And live a lie with someone I don't love
She couldn't tell me face to face
Oh, but how my world was changed
By the hand that held the pen
That wrote the words that broke the heart
Of the one the only one that really loves her
My tears fell down like falling rain
But they can't wash away the pain
How will I go to sleep without her in my arms
She never meant to break my heart
Oh, but how my world was torn apart
By the hand that held the pen
That wrote the words that broke the heart
Of the one the only one that really loves her
With one stoke of the pen
She wrote off all my dreams
Erasing all those plans we made together
There's no one that I can blame
But how my world was changed
By the hand that held the pen
That wrote the words that broke the heart
Of the one the only one that really loves her
I am the one the only one that really loves her
