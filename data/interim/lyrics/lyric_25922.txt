Y'all just love me for my lifestyle, baby
Y'all just love me for my lifestyle, uh
Y'all just love me for my⁠—
Rock star lifestyle might not give up
Wake up every day next to different bitches
I'm still thinking 'bout the times I was wit' ya
Used to see me broke, now you looking at me lit up
Rock star lifestyle might not give up
Wakin' up next to different bitches
Nine times out of ten I probably won't miss her
Niggas want the juice so they movin' like Bishop
Eliantte got me iced out, yeah, yeah
I ain't nothin' like a rapper, I'm a artist
Hundred for a show is light now, light-light
And I need my money right now, swear to God, yeah
Fuck a forty, with a knife I'm crazy
He was frontin', left blood on the pavement
I was never that boy you should play with
That's word to my dawgs, I'ma stay rich
I'm livin' the good life, no complainin' 
Porn stars in my backyard like the slave ship
Took a blue pill, feel like I was in the Matrix 
Shit is too real, it get hard for me to fake it
Rock star lifestyle might not give up
Wake up every day next to different bitches
I'm still thinking 'bout the times I was wit' ya
Used to see me broke, now you looking at me lit up
Rock star lifestyle might not give up
Wakin' up next to different bitches
Nine times out of ten, I probably won't miss her
Niggas want the juice so they movin' like Bishop
Rock star lifestyle, rock star wife for the ride-ride
Rastafari, love life
My bossin' will be a lifetime, hey
Take the Rolls Royce and the Ferrari, bitch, it's time, yeah
Take a spoon and fork and peel his motherfuckin' eyes out
I'm a real mobster, I'm a kind one
I been shinin' out the rough, I'm a diamond
Fuck it, walk inside the club, change climate
Y'all tellin' on each other, pigs rhymin'
Ain't no scrubs 'round me, we all climbin'
Ain't no subs in the back, I got to find one
'Bout to sing to her pussy, Mariah
Yellow stones in the bracelet like a sinus
Give the dawgs all a 'Ghini when I signed 'em
I don't know how to keep her, she albino
SS to a million because how the way she get on top and ride that
Oh, woah, Minnesota rider girl 
Yeah, I could color all your stones like tie-dye
Get a dermal, put a stone on your side eye
'Cause I done sold over a million pies, yeah, yeah
Rock star lifestyle might not give up 
Taking out her hair, fuck a pull-up
Your stomach ain't there, baby, good luck
Welcome her to Barbie life
Rock star lifestyle might not give up 
I just bought a Range with the peanut butter guts
Put some Forgiatos on a pickup truck
Eldorado Bronco up in Colorado
Rock star lifestyle might not give up 
Wake up every day next to different bitches

Used to see me broke, now you looking at me lit up
