See I'm walkin', see I'm talkin'
Notice everything in me
Oh feel the need 
Feel the need in me
I need you by my side to be my guide
You see my arms are open wide
Baby feel the need 
Feel the need in me
Every day I need, every way I need
Without your sweet sweet love, I'd rather die
I need it constantly, your love is good to me
Your love is sweeter to me than apple pie
Just put your hand in mine, love me all the time
That you, you will plainly see
Baby, feel the need 
Feel the need in me
Come on and feel it
Feel it, feel it
Come on and feel it
Feel it, feel it
Come on and feel it
Feel it, feel it
Come on and feel it
Feel it, feel it
Come on and feel it
Feel it, feel it
Come on and feel it
Feel it, feel it
Come on and feel it
Feel it, feel it
Come on and feel it
Feel it, feel it
Hit it, uhn!
Dweet-do-do-do-do, do, do-do-do
Dweet-do-do-do-do, do, do-do-do
Do-hoo, do-ah
Dweet-do-do-do-do, do, do-do-do
Dweet-do-do-do-do, do, do-do-do
Do-we, do-ah
See I'm walkin', see I'm talkin', mama
Notice everything in me
Just put your hand in mine and love me all the time
The truth you will plainly see
So come on and feel it
Feel it, feel it
Come on and feel it
Feel it, feel it
Come on and feel it
Feel it, feel it
Come on and feel it
Feel it, feel it
Come on and feel it
Feel it, feel it
Come on and feel it
Feel it, feel it
Come on and feel it
Feel it, feel it
Come on and feel it
Feel it, feel it
Hit it, bl-bl-uhn!
Dweet-do-do-do-do, do, do-do-do
