Like Howdy Doo
Your tin soldiers your clowns too
They’re all laughing at you
I’m laughing at you too
Like basketball, five fouls and that was all
The games you really knew yeah, why couldn't I beat you
In the middle of the room, got no time to
Count my sheep today
How could I let you get away
When I knew I’d need somebody soon
How could I let you get away
When I knew I’d need somebody soon
Like mother goose
Winds you up then turns your loose
Block 10 was beatin’ two
And I can’t tell green from blue, no no
Like cat and mouse, games of chase instead of house
I’d get so mad at you
Like parents often do
In the middle of the room
Got not time to
Count my sheep today baby
How could let you get away
When I knew I’d need somebody soon
How could I let you get away baby
When I knew I need somebody soon
Oooh baby, how could let you get away baby
When I knew I need somebody soon yeah
Hey baby I didn’t count my sheep I let my woman weep baby
I knew down inside I needed someone
Like Mother Goose I done let you lose
And I need you baby yeah
Ooh wee, I need somebody soon
Help me now to keep my feet on the ground
