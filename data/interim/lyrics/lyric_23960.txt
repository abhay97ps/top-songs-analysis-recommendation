I wanna try something, all night
I wanna try something, all night
Don't know your name, but I guess I really don't care
I probably should wait, but I wanna let you go there
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something
By the way you looking tonight
Only one thing comes to my mind
When the lights come on at two
I'll still be moving with you
Boy, you're looking at nobody
Just my body
Don't know your name, but I guess I really don't care
I probably should wait, but I wanna let you go there
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, wanna try, babe
Ah-ah-ah, all night
Ah-ah-ah, all night babe
Oh I, oh I, oh I
Baby, oh I, oh I, oh I
Oh I, oh I, oh I
Baby, oh I, oh I, oh I, baby
Hey, what you doing tonight?
I see that look in your eyes
I feel the same, yeah, yeah
Miss your lips, girl, when we kiss 
Why don't we handle this? 
Girl, you know I need some affection 
Don't know your name, but I guess I really don't care
I probably should wait, but I wanna let you go there
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, I wanna try, babe
Ah-ah-ah, all night
Ah-ah-ah, all night, babe
This ain't forever, baby, just tonight
Just sit back and take my direction now
Don't know your name, but I guess I really don't care
I probably should wait, but I wanna let you go there
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something new, all night, oh 
Ah-ah-ah, hey, I wanna try, baby
Ah-ah-ah, I wanna try, baby
Ah-ah-ah, ooh, babe
Ah-ah-ah, girl, if you let me
Ah-ah-ah, I wanna try, baby
Ah-ah-ah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah-ah-ah, ooh, babe
I like that new-new, boy, I like that new
Wanna try
Give me that new-new, boy, give me that new
Wanna try
I like that new-new, boy, I like that new
Wanna try
Give me that new-new, boy, give me that new
All night
