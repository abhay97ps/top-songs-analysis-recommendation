Pulled in the driveway, picked up the paper
Found my key and unlocked the door
I walked in, felt like a stranger like I'd never been there before
As I wandered room to room, it was silent as a tomb
Could've heard a teardrop, could've heard a heartbreak
Never saw the flood come even though I felt the rain
Never heard a house sound so loud with memories
Where there used to be a happy home
In the house on the corner of lonely and gone
If she talked about leaving I wasn't listening
If she showed me a sign, well, I never saw
Did she stop believing? Did I stop giving?
Can't put my finger on, what went wrong
Now the quietest noise I'm told is the sound of letting go
Could've heard a teardrop, could've heard a heartbreak
Never saw the flood come even though I felt the rain
Never heard a house sound so loud with memories
Where there used to be a happy home
In the house on the corner of lonely and gone
Whoa, never heard a house sound so loud with memories
Where there used to be a happy home in the house on the corner
In the house on the corner of lonely and gone
