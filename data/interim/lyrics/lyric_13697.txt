And when I see the sign that points one way
The lot we used to pass by everyday
Just walk away Renee
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block
Are not the same
You're not to blame
From deep inside the tears, I'm forced to cry
From deep inside the pain, I chose to hide
Just walk away Renee
You won't see me follow you back home
Now let the rain beat down
Upon my weary eyes
For me and mine
Just walk away Renee
You won't see me follow you back home
Now let the rain beat down
Upon my weary eyes
For me and mine
Your name and mine inside a heart upon the wall
Still finds a way to haunt me
Though they're so small
Just walk away Renee
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block
Are not the same
You're not to blame
