We both said some things we don't really mean
Sometimes love can be like that
And right now they hurt, but they're only words
They're nothin' we can't take back
But every time we don't see eye to eye
You worry, I might say goodbye
Not on your love, not in this life
Could I ever leave; I wouldn't think twice
Of letting you go, by now you should know
I need you too much
Not on your love, no way in this world
Could I ever live without you girl
When times get tough, I'm not giving up:
Not on your love
When we started out we made a vow
Not to sleep 'til we settled the fight
And there have been times, we've seen the sun rise
But it always worked out all right
Even in the darkest hour before dawn
I never thought of moving on
Not on your love, not in this life
Could I ever leave; I wouldn't think twice
Of letting you go, by now you should know
I need you too much
Not on your love, no way in this world
Could I ever live without you girl
When times get tough, I'm not giving up:
Not on your love
When times get tough, I'm not giving up:
Not on your love
