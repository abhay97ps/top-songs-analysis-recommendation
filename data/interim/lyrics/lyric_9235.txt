A long time forgotten are dreams that just felt by the way
And the good life he promised ain't what she's living today
But she never complains of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord
She's just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to come
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter they'll pass though his world hand in hand
A good hearted woman lovin' her good timin' man
He likes the night life the brightlights and good timin' friends
When the party's all over she welcome him back home again
Lord knows she don't understand him but she does the best that she can
To be a good hearted woman to a do no good good timin' man
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his wicked ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter they'll pass though his world hand in hand
A good hearted woman lovin' her good timin' man
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves me in spite of my wicked mouth ways hat she don't understand
