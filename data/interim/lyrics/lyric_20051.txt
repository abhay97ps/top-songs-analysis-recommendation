This is, this is, this is 
You like this 
You are now witnessin' 
The flyest shit in the world 
I can't think of nothin' else to say
Christina Milian, Cool & Dre, come on
I got the urge to scream out
Pull out the vert, let's be out
And I don't know about you
But I'ma get it poppin' like I'm supposed to do
Don't hold your breath, girls, breathe out
Sweat out your perm, pull your weave out
And tell the world it's time
That we gonna be heard, we gonna scream out loud, say
I'ma make it happen, I'ma make a way
If you got somethin' to prove and you feel the same way
Say I, I
I'ma keep it gangster, I'ma make it hot
If you feelin' like I do, then people, throw your hands up
And say I, I 
You wanna dance, then get down
You're tryna chill, then sit down
Do what you wanna do
Don't let nobody tell you what you're supposed to do
You on the corner, you grindin'
Tryna duck the feds, you ain't tryna do no time, and
I know you feel it's rough 
And if you with me, people, let me see your hands up and say
I'ma make it happen, I'ma make a way 
If you got somethin' to prove and you feel the same way
Say I, I 
I'ma keep it gangster, I'ma make it hot 
If you feelin' like I do, then people, throw your hands up 
And say I, I  
My nephew gettin' older and he startin' to talk 
Now my moms got sick and she can't walk 
No high school diploma, but I know math 
Ain't write one song and she still want half
"Deadbeat dad," that's what the media say 
"Best father in the world," that's what my son would say
"Won't stop 'til you broke," that's what his moms would say
But hey, them the types of games she play 
The media talk so bad about me
But the streets, they'll do so bad without me
Can't ban the snowman
This is Thug Motivation, just part of the program 
The first day of class 
And all you gotta do is stack cash to pass 
Don't mind me, I'm just thinkin' out loud 
Purple haze got my head in the clouds
Get into it, let's just face it
We can do it if we try 
Ain't nothin' to it, let's just take it 
We can make it if we try 
Let's just do it, we can make it
I know we'll make it if we try 
I'ma make it happen, I'ma make a way 
If you got somethin' to prove and you feel the same way
Say I, I 
I'ma keep it gangster, I'ma make it hot 
If you feelin' like I do, then people, throw your hands up
And say I, I 
Get into it, let's just face it
We can do it if we try
Ain't nothin' to it, let's just take it
We can make it if we try
I'ma make it happen, I'ma make a way
If you got somethin' to prove and you feel the same way
Say I, I
