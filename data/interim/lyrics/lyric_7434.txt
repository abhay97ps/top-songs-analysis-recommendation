Giving up
Is hard to do
When you really
Love someone
Giving up
So hard to do
When you still depend upon
Her warm and tender touch
Her kiss and her caress
Ooh, that used to mean so much
And bring you happiness 
Giving up
So hard to do
I've tried 
But it just ain't no use
Giving up
So hard to do
I said I've tried
But it just ain't no use
But my light of hope
Is burning dim
But, but in my heart I pray, yeah
That my love and faith
In the girl
Whoah Will bring her back one day
Yeah Yeah
I'm talking about
Giving up's so hard yeah
Ooh, whether
Whether she knows or not
She really needs me too
The little girl
Is all I got
Yes she is
And giving up
Giving up is so hard to do
Whoah
Giving up
So hard to do
Giving up
So very hard to do
I said I've tried it
Hey But I just can't get loose
Woooh Giving up
So hard for me to do
I don't want to lose you
'Cause you mean
So much to me
Ooooh Giving up...
