Baby, life's what you make it
Can't escape it
Baby, yesterday's favourite
Don't you hate it?
Life's what you make it
Baby, life's what you make it
Don't backdate it
Baby, don't try to shade it
Beauty's naked
Life's what you make it
What you make it
Baby, life's what you make it
Celebrate it, anticipate it
Yesterday's faded, nothing can change it
Life's what you make it
Life's what you make it
Life's what you make it
Make it, make it
Life's what you make it
