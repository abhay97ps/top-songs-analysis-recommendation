I'm all alone and fancy free
But that ain't the way I wanna be
Now girls get your game up tight
Were gonna have a wing, ding doodle tonight
But right now
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
Tonight the skys the limit
I got some money and I wanna spend it
Its Saturday night and I wanna play
I'm gonna groove til the break of day
Now look a here
Im looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
Got a brand new pin stripe suit of clothes
Big wide polka-dot tie
Cuff links as big as j-bird eggs
And look at that shoes made out of alligator hide
Well say something else here
I'm ripe and ready and hot to trot
Girl you can get everything I got
I got got the money if got the time
All you gotta do is gimme a sign
Lookee hear
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox

Lookin' for a fox 
Lookin' for a fox
