Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
First time I saw you, baby
I knew right away I wanted you for my lady
I had to rush right over to you 
And ask you if you felt the same way too
Now we've known each other many a night
And I want you to know my intentions are right
For making you my lady
The one and only lady in my life 
I wanna be two places at the same time
Inside you and inside your mind
Both of these ways I wanna love you
'Cause one without the other just won't do
I wanna be two places at the same time 
Inside you and inside your mind
Both of these ways I wanna love you
'Cause one without the other just won't do
I'm so thankful that I found the woman
Who I can trust with all my lovin'
'Cause as a love affair goes on and on 
It takes more than good looks to keep the feeling strong
Personality is a must
'Cause I forget only you I will trust
With my heart, baby
Girl, I offer you my only heart 
I wanna be two places at the same time
Inside you and inside your mind
Both of these ways I wanna love you
'Cause one without the other just won't do
No, girl, it just won't do, ow
Two places at the same time
You mean more than just fun to me
And that's the reason why I've got to be two places
Two places, same time 
Inside you, inside your mind
Both of these ways I wanna love you
'Cause one without the other just won't do
Two, two places at the same time 
Inside you and inside your mind, ow
Both of these ways I wanna love you
