No I can't slow down
'Cause I'm so fired up
I've got a physical addiction babe
And I can't get enough
I can feel the heat
When it's cold outside
So baby open up your doors
And let me see what lies on the other side
Oh----I just wanna be loved
By a girl like you
Oh----I just wanna be loved
So, baby, put the hurtin' on me
Is there a doubt in your thinking
That if you give it up too soon I'll be leavin'
But there ain't no rules in this hungry heart
I can see temptation in your eyes babe
That's the way I know it should start
Oh----I just wanna be loved
By a girl like you
Oh----I just wanna be loved
So, baby, put the hurtin' on me
'Cause I just wanna be loved
By a girl like you
Oh----I wanna be loved
Baby, put your lovin' on me
Come on, girl
See for yourself
You want love
Oh----I just wanna be loved
By a girl like you
Oh----I just wanna be loved
So, baby, put the hurtin' on me
'Cause I just wanna be loved
Now I'm asking for the last time
Oh----I wanna be loved
Baby, put the hurtin' on me
