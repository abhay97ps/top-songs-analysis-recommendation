Turned away
Turned away
Turned away
Turned away from love
Too many times I feel
We are losing time once shared
And only when you're in ecstasy
You seem to really care
Didn't you say not to worry
I can only speak for myself
How do you think that I'm happy, baby
With a love like mine locked up on a shelf
Remember my love had a place
It was a part of the game
And just when I went all the way
I'm in too deep
Girl, you made the choice and turned away
When you should've been giving
Oh, as I started believing
Just as I was living
I discovered you were untrue
So unfortunate for you
There is nothing that I wouldn't do
I only gave you the best I ever had to you
Don't let sympathy show her face
Girl, let's not pretend
I'm no longer in this race
You've got your space
Still it hurts me that you turned away
Oh, when you should've been giving
Oh, as I started believing, yeah, yeah
Oh, just as I was living
Ooh, ooh
When you should've been giving
Oh, everything's here today
Oh, just as I was living
You turned away from my love
Oh, you turned away from my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you turned away from love
Oh, when you should've been giving
Oh, just as I start believing
Oh, just as I was living
You turned away, you turned away from love
Oh, when you should've been giving
Oh, just as I start believing
Oh, just as I start believing
Ooh ooh
Oh, when you should've been giving
Oh, just as I start believing
Oh my love, oh my love, why did you have to turn away?
Oh my love, oh my love, why did you have to turn away?
Oh my love, oh my love, why did you have to turn away?
