1-2-3 like a bird I sing
'Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Hey!
I'm down to my last dollar I've walk right though my shoes
Just a small reminder of the hell that I've gone through
But look at me still smiling as I'm wondering what I'll do
Since I ain’t got nothing I've got nothing to lose
Everybody say "hahaha, hahaha"
My friends are always giving me watches, hats, and wine
That's how I know this is serious that's how I know it's time
I don't have to worry about things that I don't have
'Cause if I ain't got nothing I've got nothing to hold me back
1-2-3 like a bird I sing
'Cause you’ve given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Fly away, fly away
There's nothing that's worth keeping me
From places I should go
From happy Ville to loving land
I'm going to tour from coast to coast
I'm leaving everything behind
There's not much that I need
'Cause If I ain't got nothing
I'm footloose and fancy free
1-2-3 like a bird I sing
'Cause you’ve given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Fly away, fly away
Look at me so free
Nothings holding me down 
Look at me so free
Can't keep my feet on the ground
1-2-3 like a bird I sing
'Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and
1-2-3 like a bird I sing
'Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Fly away, Fly Away, Fly away, Fly away
Fly away!!
