All I am, all I'll be
Everything in this world, all that I'll ever need
Is in your eyes, shining at me
When you smile I can feel, all my passion unfolding
Your hand brushes mine
And a thousand sensations seduce me 'cause I
I do, cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will, love you still
From the depths of my soul, it's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much
I do
In my world, before you
I lived outside my emotions, didn't know where I was going
'Til that day, I found you
How you opened my life to a new paradise
In a world torn by change
Still with all of my heart until my dying day
I do, cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will, love you still
From the depths of my soul, it's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much
Yes, I do
If you're asking do I love you this much
I do, oh, I do
