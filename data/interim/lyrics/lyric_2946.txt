You were sitting by your window
Just looking up at the moon
Your eyes shined so bright
Like stars in the night
As I watched you
Yes, I watched you from below
And I said
Hello, pretty girl, pretty girl
Won't you come out tonight
Take a look at yourself
Sitting up there alone
Now that's not right
Come on down, little girl
Take a walk in my world
Where you belong
You shouldn't be alone
No, no, no, no, no
You shouldn't be alone
Now I'm going to keep talking
Even if it takes all night
Cause I made up my mind
That you're gonna be mine
As I watched you
Yes, I watched you from below
And I said
Hello, pretty girl, pretty girl
Won't you come out tonight
Take a look at yourself
Sitting up there alone
Now that's not right
Come on down, little girl
Take a walk in my world
Where you belong
You shouldn't be alone
No, no, no, no, no
You shouldn't be alone
Come on down, little girl
Take a walk in my world
Where you belong
You shouldn't be alone
No, no, no, no, no
You shouldn't be alone
Come on, girl
I love you so
Come on with me
Walk with me
