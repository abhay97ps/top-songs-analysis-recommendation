The sweet things you do to me like holding my hand
When I'm low you let me know you always understand
And, I know  the way you love
You make me feel so fine
I love the way you love
Because I know you're mine, all mine
I'll never do you wrong, I'll never make-a you cry-why-why
If you stop loving me I know that I'll just die
Because I love 
Yay, it makes me feel  so fine
And I love  the way you love
Because I know you're mine, all mine
Folks tell me now and then "Find somebody new"
I don't care what the people may say, I'm stickin' right here with you
Because I love 
Yay, yay, I know 
And I love  the way you love
Because I know you're mine, all mine
Folks tell me now and then "Find somebody new"
I don't care what the people may say, I'm stickin' right here with you
Because I love 
Yay, it makes me feel  so fine
And I love  the way you love
Because I know you're mine, all mine
One more time!
I love 
The way you hold me, baby
Yay, a-yay, a-yay
I love  the way you love
