I ain't never been no Silly Ho 
Waitin' for your call
Like the other girls want you
I ain't never been the one to mess 
With someone else's mess
That's not a thing for me to do
I ain't never been that chickenhead 
To wake up in your bed
After every club or two
Gonna be the one to make me skurt 
Always wanna flirt
With every player on the team
So if you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
If you really wanna know
Boy, you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
And if you really wanna know
Boy, you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do, ooh ooh
I ain't never been no silly bitch 
Waiting to get rich 
From a nigga bank account
I have always had my own things 
Bought my own rings 
Not gon' let you catch me out
You should take a lesson from me 
I ain't the one to be 
Depending on someone else
I can run a scam before he can 
I am better than a man 
I always keep my game on deck
If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
If you really wanna know
Boy, you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
So if you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
And if you really wanna know
Boy, you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do, ooh ooh
If you really wanna find 
Someone to get some behind 
I ain't the one for you 
If you really wanna know 
Boy, you need a silly ho 
To do whatever you wanna do 
If you really wanna find 
Someone to get some behind 
I ain't the one for you 
And if you really wanna know 
Boy, you need a silly ho 
To do whatever you wanna do, ooh ooh
You know you can't get with this 
One night you just 
Go and bust, find a ho to get it up 
Why you even try your luck? 
Stuck on silly shit 
Boy, you know you need to quit 
Ain't the one for all this 
You missed out
I'm-I'm-I'm-out 
I'm-out-I'm-out, out-out 
I'm-I'm-I'm-out-out 
I'm-I'm-out 
I'm-out-out-out 
If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind 
I ain't the one for you
