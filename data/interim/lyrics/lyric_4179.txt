Blue Autumn, falling leaves with red and gold
Pretty colors, I am told
But I only see only shades of blue
Because I'm loosing you
Blue Autumn, there's a rainbow in the sky
But no matter how I try
I still see only shades of blue
Because I'm loosing you
Such pretty colors I am told, they're for all to see
But falling leaves of red and gold
Have all turned blue to me
Blue Autumn, a love like yours I'll never know
Other girls may come and go
But I only see shades of you
And all my autumns will be blue
Blue Autumn, a love like yours I'll never know
Other girls may come and go
But I only see shades of you
And all my autumns will be blue
