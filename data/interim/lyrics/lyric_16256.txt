When this world that I see
Is too hard to take and too much for me
And everything's in blue
When the rain's pourin' down
I can't find the sun
Don't mean the sun can't found
It always comes through
There's not a soul that's lost
That can't find its way
There's not a night that's long
That can't find the day
As long as I can dream
There's a better world
Oh, there's a better world
I see it shinin'
And in my dreams I see
There's a better world
Oh, there's a better world
As long as I can dream
In my heart there's a place
Where there's always hope
And always a way
To make it through the night
And in my soul, I believe
If I just have faith
Then I will be free
I'll be alright
There's not a soul that's lost 
That can't find its way
There's not a night that's long
That can't find the day
As long as I can dream
There's a better world
Oh, there's a better world
I see it shinin'
And in my dreams I see
There's a better world
Oh, there's a better world
As long as I can dream
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Oh
There's not a soul that's lost
That can't find its way
There's not a night that's long
As long as I can dream
There's a better world
I see it shinin' on me
In my dreams I see. yeah
There's a better world
As long as I can dream
I can see it
Yes, it's shinin' on me
In my dreams I see
Mmmmm
Just as long as I can dream
