Yes it's me and I'm in love again
Had no lovin' since you know when
You know I love you, yes I do
And I'm savin' all my lovin' just for you
I need your lovin' and I need it bad
Just like a dog when he's goin' mad
Ooo-ee baby, ooo-ee
Baby won't you give your love to me?
Eenie meenie and miney-mo
You don't want me 'round no more
Ooo-ee baby, ooo-ee
Baby don't you let your dog bite me
Oh yeah
Yes it's me and I'm in love again
Had no lovin' since you know when
You know I love, you yes I do
And I'm savin' all my lovin' just for you
I need your lovin' and I need it bad
Just like a dog when he's goin' mad
Ooo-ee baby, ooo-ee
Baby won't you give your love to me?
Eenie meenie and miney-mo
You don't want me 'round no more
Ooo-ee baby, ooo-ee
Baby don't you let your dog bite me
