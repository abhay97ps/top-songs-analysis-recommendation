Sitting in the corner
Left it standing, standing and shaking its feet
The  is screaming, the kids are going mad
So I pull out my hair and I swear I'm dead
Dance with my fellow dead
Burning burning burning, my oh my oh my
I wanna lose my  and 
Let's dance to The Cramps
Everybody let's dance
I wanna dance to the Cramps
Everybody let's dance
My mind is dead and dizzy
My limbs are numb
Getting weary
And  is ?
The  is screaming, the kids are going mad
So I pull uot my hair and I swear I'm dead
And dance with my fellow dead
Burning burning burning
My oh my oh my
I wanna lose my  and
Sitting in the corner
Left it standing and shaking its feet
The  is screaming, the kids are going mad
So I  my hair and I swear I'm dead
Dance with my fellow dead
Burning burning burning, my oh my oh my
I wanna lose my  and ''
Let's dance to The Cramps
Everybody let's dance
I wanna dance to the Cramps
Everybody let's dance
