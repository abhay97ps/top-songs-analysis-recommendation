If you're the kind who grooves behind
The special feelin' that love can bring
That type of thing
And while we're one we'll let our fun run
As far as we want it to and when it's through
Capture the moment, the joyful explosion
That we just shared, don't let it die
Keep it livin' inside, so, it's always there
A memory, well, it should be
A lovin' keepsake that you can find
In the pocket of your mind
And when you cry, just reach inside
And it would love to make love to you
Here's what to do
Capture the moment, the joyful explosion
That we just shared, don't let it die
Keep it livin' inside, so, it's always there
Capture the moment, the joyful explosion
That we just shared, don't let it die
