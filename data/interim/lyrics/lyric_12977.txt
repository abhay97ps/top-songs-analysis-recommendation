I wanna rock! 
I wanna rock! 
I want to rock 
I wanna rock! 
"Turn it down," you say?
Well all I got to say to you is
Time and time again I say no! 
No, no, no, no, no!
Tell me not to play
Well, all I got to say to you
When you tell me not to play, I say, "No!"
No! No, no, no, no, no!
So, if you ask me why I like the way I play it
There's only one thing I can say to you
I wanna rock! 
I wanna rock! 
I want to rock 
I wanna rock! 
There's a feelin' that
I get from nothin' else and there ain't
Nothin' in the world that makes me go! 
Go, go, go, go, go!
Turn the power up
I've waited for so long so I could
Hear my favorite song so let's go! 
Go, go, go, go, go!
When it's like this I feel the music shootin' through me
There's nothin' else that I would rather do
I wanna rock! 
I wanna rock! 
I want to rock 
I wanna rock! 
I wanna rock! 
Rock! 
Rock! 
I wanna rock! 
Rock! 
Rock! 
I want to rock 
Rock!

I wanna rock! 
Rock! 
Rock! 
I wanna rock!
I wanna rock! 
I wanna rock! 
I want to rock 
I wanna rock! 
I wanna rock! 
Rock!
