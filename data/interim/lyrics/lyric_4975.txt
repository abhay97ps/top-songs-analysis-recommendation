D-d-d-d-do you really believe 
Th-th-th-that there are secret mind-writing messages 
W-w-w-woven in the music-music-music
The music of the young? 
Music of the young?
And if you were happy, you might let your guard down, and then they'd get you
Look into my mind, tell me what you see, what you find
Can somebody tell me what's happening this time?
I don't know, I'm breakin' down again, losing control
With these demons inside still pulling at my soul
Still reaching for my coat, I choke and black out
Without a lung to pump any more oxygen out
Am I doomed on the Earth with these mental symptoms
'Cause your church won't grant the dead an exorcism
Let me get two turntables and a microphone
Black rain, bloody murder means spike your dome
Why, I, don't know why
Pressure released from my head when you die
 Empty pill bottles on the shelf
Got this hunger and a sexual drive to end your health
Fucking headaches 
You gotta die, I'm sorry, but you gotta die
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump up in
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump up in
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again
Fallin' through emotion and passin' through memories
Descendin' into dark with my hands in front of me
Wavin' and screamin', fallin' like a way through Hell
What's at the bottom? I don't know, but I'll find out when I get there
Hands grabbin' at me, but I'm dodgin' 'em all
Slicin' each and every wrist with my hatchet as I fall
And if I reach the bottom with my life intact
I'm a climb right to the top and go right back and do it again
If you can see what I was thinking then no one would have to die
It would be as simple as lookin' inside of my mind
And through time, all the pressure has come to a head
And I release it on the innocent and leave 'em for dead
Could be a chemical imbalance, but I blame it on this challengin' remark
So I waited in the dark where his car was parked
A couple whacks with the axe to his back
And he was down, and then I hit the ground
Somebody catch me
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump up in
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump up in
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again
If you listen too close you might lose your mind
If you look too close your head could explode like mind bomb  Did Blaze really get shot the fuck down? 
Did Twiztid really sell they souls to the underground? 
After the Sixth, will ICP kill theyself? 
Is ABK a real warrior or something else?
I don't know and I don't care
Just remember me with my fucking Lotus in the air 
Keep talking mother fucker , do it again, don't push me
You fuckin' with a old school cat that ain't friendly
So take it to that level, go ahead keep pulling my chain
'Cause when I get upset I get strange, you have no clue
Check this out, I be fiending for mood swings
Ready to throw down and knock the shit out of soft range
Heartless, ready to lift out whatever
So if you're in my path, we best be walking together
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump up in
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump up in
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump up in
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump up in
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump up in
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again
