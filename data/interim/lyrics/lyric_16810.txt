Sometimes I wonder
What I would do without you in my life
At night I wake up and all I see is your face
I know we have problems
But I still can't walk away
And all I want you to do is tell me why
'Cause I can't live without you
Tell me why
Look at us, baby
Up all night
Tearing the love apart
Aren't we the same two
People who lived through years in the dark
Ooh, every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why
No baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
Oh no
No baby
When we're crazy
It just ain't right
'Cause baby I get lonely too
You don't have to worry
Just hold on tight
You've got to know I'll always love you
Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
You make it harder than it has to be
And I can't tell you why
No, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
It's your love
And it makes me feel real good
No, I, I can't tell you
No, I, I can't tell you
No, I can't, no, I can't
I, I can't tell you
No, I, I can't tell you
Why I love you
Why I need you
Why I love you
I've gotta have you here by me
I've gotta have you here by my side
Won't you help me
Won't you help me
I've gotta tell you why
I can't tell you why
Tell you why, tell you why
Somebody tell me why
Somebody tell me why
Tell me why
Please tell me why
