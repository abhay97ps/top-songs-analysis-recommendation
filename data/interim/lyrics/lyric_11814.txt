I was lost ... in time
Feelin' like the victim of a perfect crime
Until that night ... I met you
How was I to know just what your love could do
Now I believe
There has been a change in me
Yeah, I believe
That it was meant to be
Can't you see
I believe in you and me
In the dark ... of night
We can be what we would like to be, and it's all right
When it's you ... you and me girl
Well I feel like we're the only people in the world
I believe
There has been a change in me
Yeah, I believe
That it was meant to be
Can't you see
I believe in you and me
Oh, It's so easy, so damn easy
To see
The way I feel for you
And you ... for me
Now I believe
There has been a change in me
Yeah, I believe
That it was meant to be
Can't you see
I believe in you and me
Oh, Can't you see
I believe in you and me
Oh, Can't you see
I believe in you and me
Oh, Can't you see...
