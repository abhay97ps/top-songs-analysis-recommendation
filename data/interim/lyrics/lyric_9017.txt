I want everybody to put your dancin' shoes on
I want you to clap your hands right here
I just want you to join in, and help me to sing a little bit
The music in my bones, and I can't sit down
Come on y'all, come on and
Yeah, sing it one more time, if you don't mind
Oh, I'm trying so hard to make it to my seat
 ooh yeah
But my body's shaking all over, and I'm groovin' with the beat now
 yes I am
I feel good, I really feel good, baby
I like the groove, and I like the blues
I like music, that puts me in a mood
Oh, excuse me while I do my thing, y'all
Come on and... ooh yeah
If you think you can outdo me, just step into the ring now
 ooh yeah
Come on, come on and do it, oh yeah

Get set, and let's go; come on and, come on and do it
Come on and, ohh... I'm really feeling good tonight, yes I am
