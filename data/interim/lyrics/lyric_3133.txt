The chains of love are the kind
That bind me to you and you to me
The chains of love are not made of steel
But something deep inside that I feel
Oh, I, oh, I don't want to be free
Baby, make a prisoner out of me
With your
Keep on drawing me closer
Don't turn me loose
Now, that's life, baby
Just a little bit tighter
Just a little bit tighter
The chains of love are the kind
That I can't see
You've got the lock, I've got the key
But the key's no good to me
Whoa, and I said that I
Oh, I don't want to be free
Baby, make a prisoner out of me
With your
Keep on drawing me closer
Don't turn me loose
Now, that's life, baby
Just a little bit tighter, baby
Whoa, and I said that I
Oh, I don't want to be free
Baby, make a prisoner out of me
With your
Keep on drawing me closer
Don't turn me loose
Now, that's life, baby
Just a little bit tighter
Tighter, baby
And I like it, ooh, just a wee bit tighter
