First your mama and your papa sent you to the finest schools
Never let it be said that their little darling was a fool, so with a credit card
And your good name, you were drawn like a moth to the flame
To that crowd of the night where you more or less lost your cool
You had 20-20 vision and still you are walking 'round blind
And whether right or wrong, I'd still tag along behind
Now if you think that's reality and girl that's where you wanna be
It's time to say, you go your way and I'll go mine
It's been a gas but I'm gonna have to pass
These are not my people
These are not my people
Looks like the end, my friend
I got to get in the wind, my friend
You found yourself naked in the world with no place to hide
Then you feel the pulse of your god and he has died
Now you're a rebel that's got no cause, yeah, a tiger that's got no claws
They promised you the world on a string but you know they lied
You said you'd be back in a big black limousine but you know
I'm inclined to believe it's not the kind you mean 'cause when you fall
Down up off your cloud and you're just a little face in the crowd
They're gonna throw you away like the last week's magazines
It's been a gas but I think I'm gonna pass
These are not my people
These are not my people
Looks like the end, my friend
I got to get in the wind, my friend
Looks like the end, my friend
I got to get in the wind
