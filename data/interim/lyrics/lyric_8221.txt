Well
Get down
Nah nah
Hi yah hi hi hi
Ahh yah ha
Hey  Oh, doctor and lawyer
 And let your reputation sit a while
Hey hey 
Hey, Mister Businessman 
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
Hey Mister Businessman you're always on the go
You've made your fortune
Yet you're working harder than ever before
All those pills you're taking daily will never see you through
Cause none of them are prescribed for what's really ailing you 
It don't take no doctor long to see what you got, well
Your life has turned into one great big knot
Hey yay hey now
Can you let it down?
Let it down, let it down, awww
 And let your reputation sit a while
Hey 
Don't ever be ashamed of what you're doin' 
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy - Hey hey hey
How do you do, Miss Saditty?
Uptight - You look such a pity
I've got some advice for you
Take this record in your room
Lock the door, and get some groove
Let it down 
Let your hair down 
Ayy hey
All you got to do is let the music take your mind
Show your partners
Anything they can do, you can do better
 Well, well, well, well
This is the part of the song where the horns take the throne
Down  dih down down hey
Let it down, let it down - hey
Let it down, let it down - hey
Let it down, let it down
Hey, let it down
Let your hair down
Hey, doctors and lawyers
 And let your reputation sit a while
Hey hey 
Hey, Mister Businessman 
Don't you know - all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
Hey hey hey 
Let it down, let it down, let it down, let it down
 And let your reputation sit a while - do it, hey
