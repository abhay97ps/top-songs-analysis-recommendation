Up there 
Who do I have?
Heaven and hell, my friend 
I won't shed a tear
Let them see me in pain again
Hello , from the dark side in
Does anybody here wanna be my friend? 
Want it all to end
Tell me when the fuck is it all gon’ end? 
Voices in my head
Telling me I'm gonna end up dead 
So save me , before I fall 
So save me, I don't wanna go alone 
So save me , before I fall 
So save me , I don’t wanna go alone
