Heart and soul
I fell in love with you
Heart and soul
The way a fool would do
MadlyYeah
Because you held me tight , held me tight 
Held me tight , held me tight 
And stole a kiss there in the night
Heart and soul

GladlyYeah
That magic night we kissed , oh, we kissed 
Oh, we kissed , oh, we kissed 
There in the moon mist

Much too much too thrilling
Never before were mine so
Strangely willing

What one embrace can do
Come on and look at me

MadlyYeah
That little kiss you stole , oh, you stole 
Oh, you stole , oh, you stole 
All my heart  and soul 
All my heart  and soul 
Oh, you stole  oh, my heart 
Oh, you stole
