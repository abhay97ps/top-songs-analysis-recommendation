I won't say I'm sorry over and over
Can't just say I'm sorry, I've gotta show you
I won't do it again, I'll prove my love is true
I hope the last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry to you
The first time I slept on the couch, was our first New Year's Eve
I heard words come out my mouth, that I still can't believe
Broken hearts and shattered champagne
We both don't wanna feel that again
The second I apologized, you said, "Boy, I don't know"
I said it 'cause I meant, but you still wouldn't let it go
So I swallow my pride, see it from your side
I promise I'll do the best I can do
I won't say I'm sorry over and over
Can't just say I'm sorry, I've gotta show you
I won't do it again, I'll prove my love is true
I hope the last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry to you
No, oh, oh-oh 
No, oh, oh-oh
To you
No, oh, oh-oh
No, oh, oh-oh
The last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry
If I could build a perfect world I'd only make you smile
I'd hang the stars, the sun, and moon outside this room, but I'll
I'll never be perfect, though I'm gonna try
Oh, I'm gonna do better, I swear that I
I won't say I'm sorry over and over
Can't just say I'm sorry, I've gotta show you
I won't do it again, I'll prove my love is true
I hope the last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry to you
No, oh, oh-oh 
No, oh, oh-oh
To you
No, oh, oh-oh
No, oh, oh-oh
The last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry
No, oh, oh-oh 
No, oh, oh-oh
To you
No, oh, oh-oh
No, oh, oh-oh
I hope the last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry, to you
