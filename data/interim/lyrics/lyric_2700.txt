Well, I don't care if the sun don't shine
I don't care if the bells don't chime
Just as long as you love me
And I don't care if the tops don't spin
I don't care if the gins won't gin
Just as long as you love me
So darling, let it rain, let it snow
Let the cold north wind blow
Just as long as you love me
North or south, east or west
You know I will stand the test
Just as long as you love me
Well, I don't care if the birds don't sing
I don't care if the bells don't ring
Just as long as you love me
I don't care if the world don't turn
I don't care if the fire don't burn
Just as long as you love me
So darling, let it rain, let it snow
Let the cold north wind blow
Just as long as you love me
North or south, east or west
You know I will stand the test
Just as long as you love me
Oh darling, just as long as you love me
