JERRY: All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.
GEORGE: Fine.
JERRY: They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?
GEORGE: I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.
JERRY: But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!
GEORGE: I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..
JERRY:  At least it's show business..
GEORGE: But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.
JERRY: What if she's got no interest in you?
GEORGE: W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.
ELAINE: Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

GENE:  What is the matter with you?
ELAINE: Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
GENE: Haven't you done enough already?
Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.
ELAINE:  It's locked..
The meat-packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.
JERRY: So this is it, huh?
GEORGE: But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..
JERRY:  I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?  Let's get out of here George.
