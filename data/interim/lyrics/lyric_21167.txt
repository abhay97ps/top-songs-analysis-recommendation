Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Violence is an energy against the enemy
Well, violence is an energy, rah-eh!
Bringing on the fury, the choir infantry
Revolt against the honor to obey 
Overthrow the effigy, the vast majority
While burning down the foreman of control 
And silence is an enemy against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul 
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
The insurgency will rise
When the blood's been sacrificed
Don't be blinded by the lies in your eyes, say!
Oh-eh-oh-eh!
Oh-eh-oh-eh!
Well, violence is an energy 
Well, from here to eternity 
Well, violence is an energy 
Well, silence is the enemy, so gimme, gimme revolution!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Overthrow the effigy, the vast majority
While burning down the foreman of control 
Silence is an enemy, against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul!
