Your pillow wasn't slept upon
Your closet was empty too
All of your shirts and ties were gone
There wasn't a trace of you
How could you go and leave so completely?
Nothing was left of all the memories
That we used to share
Just an empty tube of toothpaste
And a half filled cup of coffee
Odds and ends of a beautiful love affair
At least you could have said goodbye
You shouldn't have run away
Were you afraid that I would cry?
My tears might have made you stay?
What of the dreams that kept us together?
Nothing was left to show
That we were once so happy there
Just an empty tube of toothpaste
And a half filled cup of coffee
Odds and ends of a beautiful love affair
How could you go and leave so completely?
Nothing was left of all the memories
That we used to share
Just an empty tube of toothpaste
And a half filled cup of coffee
Odds and ends of a beautiful love affair
Odds and ends of a beautiful love affair
