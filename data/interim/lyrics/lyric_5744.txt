Ooh, every day you make me cry, girl
I cry too much
And today you say goodbye, girl
It's just too much
Hey, I swallowed each and every lie
That you gave to me
Where lies the man that I was
And the future that could never be?
Tomorrow every one gonna know me better
And tomorrow every one gonna drink my wine
And tomorrow every one gonna read my letter
And my story of love and a love that could never be mine
Ooh ask you to be my wife, girl
You were playing
Now I ask you where is my life, girl?
You were saying
Hey, I swallowed each and every lie
That you gave to me
Where lies the man that I was
And the future that could never be?
Tomorrow every one gonna know me better
And tomorrow every one gonna drink my wine
And tomorrow every one gonna read my letter
And my story of love and a love that could never be mine
Tomorrow every one gonna know me better
And tomorrow every one gonna drink my wine
And tomorrow every one gonna read my letter
And my story of love and a love that could never be mine
