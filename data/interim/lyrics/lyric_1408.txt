There is no place like home
There is no place like home
Do you remember
You left this morning at nine
With everything fine
Welcome home, baby
It's been a long, long time
Do you remember
That little stain on your lips
Where honey drips
Welcome home, baby
It's been a long, long time
Well
Well, at ten o'clock I was lonely and blue
At twelve o'clock I thought of nothing but you
From two o'clock till a quarter of four
I waited patiently to hear your footsteps at the door
Do you remember
That little stain on your lips
Where honey drips
Welcome home, baby
It's been a long, long time
Welcome home, baby
It's been a long, long time
Welcome home
