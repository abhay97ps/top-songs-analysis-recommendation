All my love
Give me the right to give you
All my love
With all my might I give you
All my love
If I had only half a chance
Into your world
Oh let me come and bring you all my love
No other one could give you half the love
That I feel in my heart for you
Come to me
Come and let me share your destiny
Can you see
There's just you within the heart of me
So o o o wonderful
I know our love could be so wonderful
For it is written in the stars above
That you were made for ALL MY LOVE
