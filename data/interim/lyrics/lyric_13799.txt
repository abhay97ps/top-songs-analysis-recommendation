Love's touch comes to mean so much
Love's way, S'abandonner
Slip inot the velvet glove
Parted lips so filled with love
French kissin' in the USA
French kissin' in the USA
Hey French kissin'
French kissin' in the USA
French kissin' in the USA
Lips are in motion
 Woah
Paris is calling
Lips close then blossom like a rose
Lips wide holding you inside
Kisses hard kisses deep, a kiss to wake us from our sleep
Take you lover by the hand, speak in tongues and understand
French kissin' in the USA
French kissin' in the USA
Hey French kissin'
French kissin' in the USA
French kissin' in the USA
Lips are in motion
 Woah
Paris is calling
French kissin' in the USA
French kissin' in the USA
Hey French kissin'
French kissin' in the USA
French kissin' in the USA
