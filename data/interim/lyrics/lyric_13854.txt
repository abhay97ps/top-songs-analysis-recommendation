We can stay
Or we can move along
Either way don't leave me all alone
I'm sorry about your eye
I'll find a way to make amends
It's only that sometimes
I've got to break before I bend
Come on darling there's a show downtown tonight
Let's go out dancing we can drink until the light
I know I haven't been
Everything a man should be
But I promise I will change
You just leave that up to me
And I'll kiss your face
Attend to your aches
I swear that I can make you happy
And you'll rub my back
Forget the past
And baby I know that that ain't so easy
It ain't too late
To salvage all of this
It ain't too late
We could fix it with a kiss
All I want is one more chance
So that we could have a home
Cause I would not stand a chance
If I had to make it on my own
O let me kiss your face
Attend to your aches
I swear that I could make you happy
And you'll rub my back forget the past
And baby I know that that ain't so easy
Come on maybe someday
You will remember what I say to you today
Come on maybe someday
And where would you go anyway
Please put that suitcase down
Leave it for another day
Stop this fooling around
I could never let you get away
Let me kiss your face
Attend to your aches
I swear that I can make you happy
And you'll rub my back
Forget the past and baby
I know that that ain't so easy
Please
