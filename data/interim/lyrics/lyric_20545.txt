Honey lookin' good from her head to her toe
Beauty overload, body out of control
She twenty-four, she could be a model
So beautiful, also natural

'Cause her mama lookin' so hot packin' that heat
So be a good girl and thank your mama

Look at her, look at her, here she come now
Look at her, look at her, here she come

Girl, your beauty is a sensation
You send men into temptation
I never knew a girl could shine like a sun
You better thank your mama 'cause girl you the one
We should have a day of celebration
Celebratin' God's best creation

Maybe 'cause your beauty keep the dues on sprung
Wonderin' just where you got that from, from, from...
