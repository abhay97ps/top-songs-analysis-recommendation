Coming to carry, coming, sweet Mary
Lay down my body, my sins I will bare thee
Now I lay me down to sleep
Lord, I pray my soul to keep
When the bells a-ring out
I'm a gonna sing out
Mama, don't you, Mama, don't you
Mama, don't you weep no more
I know where I'm going
Got no hurry, no worry, nothing to hide
Now I lay me down to rest
When I know I've done my best
When my day is over
I'll be coming over
Mama, don't you, Mama, don't you
Mama, don't you weep no more
I know where I'm going
Got no hurry, no worry, nothing to hide
I've got nothing to hide, I'm satisfied
Gonna rest my soul on the other side
Coming to carry, coming, sweet Mary
Lay down my body, my sins I will bare thee
Repeat and fade
