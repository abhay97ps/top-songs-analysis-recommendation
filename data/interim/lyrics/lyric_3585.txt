Everybody's talking about the girl in black
I'm all shook up about the one in slacks
I like the way the little girl look at me
She was talking to bobby this is what she said
Get back, get back‚ get back‚ get back
Get back‚ get back, get back, get back
Get back‚ babe
Well let me tell you men what happened to me then
I met a guy named Willie and a chick named Sarah
Well they looked at me and said listen boss
I'm private property so keep hands off
Get back, get back, get back‚ get back
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, babe
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, babe
Now there's my type and ain't she fine
She digs guitar and that gal's mine
Well I took her by the hand said don't get fresh
Get to steppin Roy you acting up too much
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, babe
