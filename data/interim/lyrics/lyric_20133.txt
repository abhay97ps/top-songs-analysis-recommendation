I've had a bad day
And nothing ever seems to go my way
I've got a heartache
Don't wanna think about it
And every time I try to smile
I cry
So I'll just hide my face
Get out of my way
Don't wanna talk about it
And I'll be fine
I just need some time
I'm hanging on today
And nothing's gonna stop me anyway
I'm holding on
I'm strong
I'm the only one who can make it change
I don't wanna fight
Gotta live my life
I'm gonna make it alright
I'm hanging on
And nothing's gonna stop me, anyway
I went the wrong way
But I'm not lost
It's a good mistake
I saw the day break
I'm gonna shout about it
Oh
And every time I turn around
I find that I'm alone again
I've had a bad day
I'm gonna laugh about it
And I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
When I feel lonely
I feel like I'm floating
Nothing is real
I'm above it all
I'm above it
I'm above it all
I've had a bad day
