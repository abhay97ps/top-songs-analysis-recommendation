I carry your books I give you looks that say "I love you"
I send you flowers Spend my hours thinking of you
But I saw you late last night You were holding another boy tight
Go ahead, explain But remember, if you lie
The bogeyman will get you And your nose is gonna grow
So remember if you lie Ev'ryone will know
Remember, if you lie your nose is gonna grow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And ev'ryone will know
You're holding my hand Making plans to stay together
Promising me that our love will be forever
If everything you say is true who's the boy I saw with you
Go ahead, explain But remember if you lie
The bogeyman will get you And your nose is gonna grow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
So remember, if you lie ev'ryone will know, ooh-oh-oh
The bogeyman will get you Your nose is gonna grow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
The bogeyman will..............FADE
