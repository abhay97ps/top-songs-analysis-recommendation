Oh I dreamed last night I was hearing
Hearing your voice
And the things that you said well they left me
Left me no choice
And you told me we had the power
And you told me this was the hour
That you don't know how
If I could show you now
Well I dreamed last night you were calling
Calling my name
You were locked inside of you secrets
Calling my name
And you told me lost was the key
And you told me how you long to be free
That you don't know how
Oh let me show you now
Like a bird on a far distant mountain
Like a ship on an uncharted sea
You are lost in the arms that have found you
Don't be afraid
Love's plans are made
Oh don't be afraid
If there's a time
And a place to begin love
It must be now
Let it go
Set it free
Oh I dreamed last night I was hearing
Hearing your voice
Why did you say those things that have left me
Left me no choice
When you told me we had the power
Why did you tell me now was the hour
But you don't know how
Oh let me show you now
Like a bird on a far distant mountain
Like a ship on an uncharted sea
You are lost in the arms that have found you
Oh don't be afraid
Love's plans are made
Don't be afraid
If there's a time
And a place to begin love
It must be now
Let it go
Set it free
Oh I dreamed last night I was hearing
Hearing your voice
