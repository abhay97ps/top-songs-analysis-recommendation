A girl like you is never wrong
Someone like me can't be too strong
I know you always get your way
You better listen when I say
Don't make me do it
Don't make me do it to ya
Don't make me do it
Don't make me do it to ya
I won't just be your broken toy
You look again, you've got no choice
There's no such thing as wrong or right
When does the day become the night
Don't make me do it
Don't make me do it to ya
Don't make me do it
Don't make me do it to ya
