Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Runnin' in circles
Comin' up tails
Heads on the science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It’s such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start
I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science
Science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
 tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh, when I rush to the start
Runnin' in circles
Chasin' our tails
Comin' back as we are
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
No one ever said it would be so hard
Aa-aa-ah 
Nobody said it was easy
No, no, no, no 
Nobody said it was easy
No, no, no, no 
Nobody said it was easy
No, no, no, no 
Nobody said it was easy
