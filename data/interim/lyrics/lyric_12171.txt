I saw your eyes
And you made me smile
For a little while
I was falling in love
I saw your eyes
And it touched my mind
Though it took a while
I was falling in love
I was falling in love
I saw your eyes 
And you made me cry 
And for a little while 
I was falling in love
I was falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
