You could take my heart away tonight
You could take my heart away tonight
Come on, girl, reach into my life
Can keep what you want if you hold on tight
You could take my heart away tonight
You could be my dream machine tonight
You could be my dream machine tonight
You caught me turning out the light
Don't let me down, keep me up all night
You could take my heart away tonight
You could help me find my way
You could fill these empty days
You could take my heart away tonight, oh baby
If you should walk away I'll be all right
I could play it cool with all my might
I could fake it through this lonely life
You could take my heart away tonight, tonight
You could take my heart away tonight
Come on, girl, reach into my life
If not forever maybe once or twice
You could take my heart away
Let me know what part to play
You could take my heart away tonight
Lead me through this lonely life
You could take my heart away tonight
Take me all the way tonight
Take my heart away tonight
Take me all the way, all the way
Take my heart away tonight
