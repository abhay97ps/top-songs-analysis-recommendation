Let's go home and tell my folks
I think they ought to know
Hope they don't start making jokes
My father kids me so
Maybe we should wait a while
And keep it to ourselves
No let's not, I just can't wait
I've simply got to tell
That we know we're in love
Ooh, we're in love
Ooh, we're in love
Ooh, we're in love
Friends think that it's just a game
A thing we'll overcome
They don't see we'll play for keeps
'Cause we're not out for fun
We know we're in love
Ooh, we're in love
Ooh, we're in love
Ooh, we're in love
Oooh, I'll treat you tenderly
I'll love you 'til the day I die
Oooh, and you'll be good to me
Now that you're my guy
I never felt like this before
That's how I know it's real
You're the boy that I adore
Tell me how ya feel
We know what is right for us
We'll never have to fear
I've got you and you've got me
That's all that matters, Jack
We know we're in love
Ooh, we're in love
Yes, we know we're in love
We know we're in love...
