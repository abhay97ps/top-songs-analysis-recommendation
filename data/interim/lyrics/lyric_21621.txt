Yo, VIP
Let's kick it
Ice Ice Baby
Ice Ice Baby
All right stop, collaborate and 
Ice is back with a brand new invention
Something grabs ahold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
 Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights, huh, and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
 bum rush the speakers that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
 When I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
 You better gain way
You better hit bull's eye 
If there was a problem,  I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice Ice Baby
Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby
Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby
Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby
Now that the party is 
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas all 
Quick to the point, to the point no 
Cooking MCs like a pound of 
Burnin' 'em if you ain't quick and 
I go crazy when I hear a 
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
 In my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby, waving just to say "hi"
 No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead, yo, so I continue to A1A 
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
 'Cause I'm out gettin' mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
 for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight balls {Eight balls}
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine, all I heard were shells
 on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
 You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice Ice Baby
Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby
Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby
Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby
Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical 
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't 
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical 
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and 
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step 
Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJs say 
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the 
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem 
Check out the hook while DJ revolves it
Ice Ice Baby
Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby
Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby
Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby
Too cold, too cold
Ice Ice Ice Ice
Yo man, let's get out of here
Word to your mother
