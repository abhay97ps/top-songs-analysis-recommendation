I kicked off my shoes and felt the good earth under my feet
I loosened my tie and felt what it feels like to breathe
I found the secret to life
I took some time for livin'
I took off my watch, found I had all the time in the world
I opened up my arms so I could hold life like a beautiful girl
I laid down
All of my hang-ups forever
I looked around
And saw what sweet things can be found
Simply by takin' some
Time for livin'
Doin' the little things
Life is givin'
From now on I'm takin'
Time for life
Too busy to stop and notice the things that are real
Embarrassed to talk about all the things that I feel
It's so strange
Never noticed the world all around me
Hey, look, I've changed
My attitude's been rearranged
From now on I'm takin' some
Time for livin'
Groovin' on everything
Life is givin'
I'm gonna be takin'
Time for life, for livin'
Groovin' on everything
Life is givin'
Gonna be takin'
Time for life, for livin'
Groovin' on everything
Life is givin'
I'm gonna be takin'
Time for life, for livin'
Groovin' on everything
Life is givin'
I'm gonna be takin'
Time for life, for livin'
Groovin' on everything
Life is givin'
I'm gonna be takin'
Time for life, for livin'
