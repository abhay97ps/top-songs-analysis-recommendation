Yo', I'm tired of everybody telling me
What I can and can't do
So I'm not doing a grand finale
And there'll be no special thanks on this track
'Cause this is my trademark
So if you can't take what you're about to hear
Then cover your ear and gimme some guitar
Nah, it's gotta be harder
Gimme me some drums
Yeah! 'Cause there's a time to be nice
But right now, it's time to be Ruthless!
Yo', girls, I can handle a mic, right? 
So why they all playing me like
I can't hang when the name of game is retail
That's right, I'm a female
Punk motherfuckers and I'm too strong
To let you stop me, I'll prove you wrong
Male chauvinists who refuse to believe
That a girl like me can achieve
Status, the same as a man
I'll be damned, let's make a Ruthless Jam
Gimme a coat so I can clear my throat
Call this a sequel to 'Murder She Wrote'
More trouble for a devil on a level of a gangstress
To the boys in my band, I give thanks, this
Beat is just what I need to get my point across
I'm the female mob boss
You know my rep and I ain't half-stepping
Kick the rhythm as I stash my weapon
Cops are left and right
The label's under question 'cause we're too damn hype
And outspoken so remaining anonymous
It is impossible the name it is synonymous
With Ruthless, who will you pick
My name is Tairrie, and the B is for bitch
"Black murderous, the bitch is ruthless"
"What the fuck is you doing now?"
I'm gonna tell you about a ho' I know name Linda
Never with a groupie, get over so I'm fi'n ta
Diss the hooker, you're just jealous
'Cause I pimped all your so-called fellas
I say to myself, it's time you get caught
Linda can't pretend to be something she's not
I operate with sex appeal
You're on the doctor's dick for a deal
When it comes down to it
You're nothing but a prostitute
Knocking boot
And now you wanna come to my town
There's only one female on Comptown, tramp
Don't think you stand a chance
I'm fed up, so let's go head up
I'll kick your ass and if that don't stop you
'Cause you ain't no rapper, and what do you look like
Rumor has it, you're a dyke
By now you must be 43
Tell me how you gonna get with me
I'm young and beautiful, playing with the full deck
In full effect
You got no respect and your lyrics are corny
Whoever told you that you could rap, they were horny
And you were nothing more than a skeez
Please, get real, you'll never get record deal
You're Fatal Attraction, that shit is scary
Who's gonna sign an ugly wannabe Tairrie? No one
You should have known better
 Yeah, let her
Then well see what the B is for
I'll autograph the fan and pimp slap the whore
She ain't down, she looks like a clown
And she's jocking every rapper and producer in town
So why, you ask, would I bother to do this?
Tell her girls... 
"There's plenty of that and much more"
"It's about time one of you hear it"
"Remember the old days when you could beat up a woman?"
Now when it comes to men, I got a one track mind
Step to me and you just might find
A female who stands her ground
So when provoked, I won't back down
All you had to do was love me
But instead you chose to shove me
'Till death to us part for the rest of my life?
No, I won't be no battered wife
Taken for granted 'cause you rock my world
Take advantage, you're fucking with wrong girl, punk
I don't care if you're drunk or sober
Put your hands on me, it's over
'Cause I don't play coy, not with a boyfriend
But I'll play you, just like a toy, friend
Throw you away when I'm done
'Cause a bitch is a bitch but I ain't the one
To be cheated on or beaten on
I'm talking Burning Bed, enough said
The fire is dead, so there ain't no use
Don't try to come back, you got no juice
I want a real man to respect and love me
Not a punk little sucker to push and shove me
Play it again, lemme say it again
I'm well prepared when it comes to men
You see, nowadays, I rap with a vengeance
I'm a new woman but this ain't revenge
It's putting the past on the shelf
'Cause 'bitch' means 'being in total control of herself'
I'm not your baby doll, you juiceless
The bitch is back and this bitch is ruthless
"A crazed bitch with a gangster profanity pitch"
"Take me to the next plateau"
Verse four, I got a score to settle
This ain't high energy or heavy metal
It's rap, so when it comes to punk motherfuckers
Lemme tell you about a man and his band of suckers
Two tramps who think they can sing
Tried to rap when they thought it was a in thing
Couldn't even write a good rhyme
'Cause you ain't legit, you don't know the time
To answer to LL? Gimme a break
No heart from the start, which proves you're fake
And nowadays, you 'Love to Bass'
'Cause house is the latest craze
So you jump on the bandwagon, sell your soul
What's next, rock-n-roll?
You got sexed
So how does it feel to slut your way to a deal
I don't sell my body for money or a meal
And the name I use is real
What the fuck is Acacia?
It's a name of a tree
Look up Tairrie B
You'll see the definition is Ruthless, rival, your enemy
Get off my tip, you ain't no friend to me
How you feel, you look real sick, not sexy
More like anorexic 
It's either that or smack 'cause your body is wack
Put a little meat on your bone
Pick up a fork and drop the microphone
You going down while I'm coming on Comptown
We sell sold gold, platinum bound
An underground sound guaranteed to succeed
'Cause looks ain't all you need
You gotta have talent, you know, skill?
You can't reply on the birth control pill
So if you wanna get ill, I suggest you chill
Don't attempt to diss, you know I will
Step to ya' face to face
It doesn't matter the time and you can name the place
Take a look at my cover
I'm a Ruthless bitch, far from a lover
"B-I-T-C-H"
"Something far from a lover"
"What you want me to?"
I'm the artist, the hardest
Executive producer, writer, arranger
So don't be too sure
That I'll be played and give the credit away
And let them call me a protégé
I didn't come in like a sucker
And I'm not going out like one motherfucker
Yeah, I speak my mind, don't tell me to shut up
Play me close homeboy 
If your name ain't on it
Then my record won't hit?
If you don't produce it, it ain't legit?
That's bullshit, you living like a sucker
You stuck up, suped up, sorry motherfucker
A Ruthless attack is what's going down
But you ain't got nothing to do with Comptown
I produce myself so I brag it
Go back to wearing sequins, 'cause you look like a faggot
World Class? You got no class
So when they said that you'd produce me, I said I'll pass
As for the Grammys, I'll put that on the shelf
It takes a punk motherfucker to play himself
Your best shot was weak, I didn't need no stiches
Get this straight, I ain't one of your bitches
You cartoon gangsta, I'm calling your bluff
Hitting a woman that makes you real tough
I had enough of you flaunting your grip
I'm no fan so get off of your own tip
'Cause the music you make may come from the streets
But it sounds like Ultimate Breaks & Beats
My opinion is you ain't all that
You're a pussy, the definition: cat
And that ain't no joke you think that it's funny?
Integrity is more important than money
And either you got it or you don't, but I won't front
I'm just here to stunt
One producer who said he'd produce this
With or without you, I'm Ruthless
And there you have it, a Ruthless bitch
Now ask yourself, are you that ignorant punk-ass fucked up overweight wannabe gangster?
Or maybe you're that psycho, civil jocking Jerry Heller, washed-up over the hill, pushing 50 rap star tipping, ugly wack demo never gonna be nothing, hooker?
Yeah, you probably are
I told you not to fuck with me
