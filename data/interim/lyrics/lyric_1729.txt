Not a weak guy, but not a kid that’s Scruff McGruff
I needed something rough, no chaser to toughen up
Hard shots like Kenan Thompson knuckle puck
A couple bucks, yeah just a couple bucks
Nothing thug life about the times I hurl then
Nothing poetic like Pac’s Me and My Girlfriend
This is alcohol and where we stand at 35
It’s not a farewell, just things that I’ve internalize
Iron City would get us through the circle of death
Keystone had a whole circle of mess
High gravity, 40’s when there’s girls to impress
Thank you for making us Stefan out of Urkel effect
You were like Popeye’s spinach to kids in puberty
You helped us tongue-tie verses, developed fluid speech
Truancy, lied to parents, how smooth are we
Sign up for the foolery and rise up for the mutiny
This ain’t belligerent, I’m only getting started
And you don’t know my pain, you don’t know where I come from
I’m in a world of hurt, I’m on a fucking bottom
The realest thing I’ve ever known is in this liquor bottle
I know the Devil put in work on me
But this Jimmy seems to give me all the strength I need
It’s in the 40oz, the freedom, or the fifth to the jail cell
Im’ma guzzle to the farewell
Into my 20s, college would make you mandatory
Underages would serve to me as a badge of glory
I didn’t have a job after, but we have some stories
Cake sand, and flip cups, and Magnum 40’s
We drank to celebrate, bring life to the weekend
For the courage of wolves to go out at night without sheepskin
The older we get, the more we would spend
Drank at concerts and shows, and at sporting events
My later mid 20s, I struggled with liquor
Made a pack with my mom, quit as my mother got sicker
But I stuck with the beer, it’d be chugging the pitcher
It was hard when she passed; it was tough on my liver
So I drank to escape, and I drank to be comfortable
Drank really late; show up to work punctual
Couple drinks wonderful, couple more humbles you
My primary function was just to be functional
This ain’t belligerent, I’m only getting started
And you don’t know my pain, you don’t know where I come from
I’m in a world of hurt, I’m on a fucking bottom
The realest thing I’ve ever known is in this liquor bottle
I know the Devil put in work on me
But this Jimmy seems to give me all the strength I need
It’s in the 40oz, the freedom, or the fifth to the jail cell
Im’ma guzzle to the farewell
Little man’s looking at me like whoa
And I don’t want no trouble from the city Five-O
My city call me superstar, my city need those
I got another mouth to feed, I’m getting so close
My brain is always telling me: you doing the most
My hood say I’m survivalist, my liver say close
But Im’ma rebound from this, I gotta play post
I need to be alive for this one as good as a ghost
When I hit my 30s, recovery slowed
It was damn near impossible to get up and go
Never in DUI, and trust me I know
That’s not being responsible, I’m lucky I don’t
Know my family history—the alcoholism
Know the stories I heard, mine is bound to be different
Yeah you haven’t made a difference on my health yet
So I step-up running, rather than 12 Steps
And I would tell myself that I’m special somehow
But the pub at the corner says I’m regular now
What are the warning signs? Will I be warning time?
My am I drunk? My girl says that I’m borderline
Just give me the heads-up, when I give ‘em control
When the symptom gets old and prohibits my goals
When the miserable, hard to live with the toll
‘Cause I need an advice, not a grip on my soul
This ain’t belligerent, I’m only getting started
And you don’t know my pain, you don’t know where I come from
I’m in a world of hurt, I’m on a fucking bottom
The realest thing I’ve ever known is in this liquor bottle
I know the Devil put in work on me
But this Jimmy seems to give me all the strength I need
It’s in the 40oz, the freedom, or the fifth to the jail cell
Im’ma guzzle to the farewell
