My number one
There could never be no one like you
How come I feel this way about
My number two
Never tried to tell me what to say or do
I'm so in love with two
I don't wanna push it
I don't wanna fight
But this feeling keeps me up all night
Chorus
If I only could decide
But I can't make up my mind
I'm breaking all my rules
Because of you
You can tell me it's not right
And it tears me up inside
But the problem is
I'm so in love with two
Heyeh.........
I don't know what to do
Heyeh..........
I choose the both of you
My number one
You're givin' me everything I need
But some things still are betta with
My number two
He's the one that really makes me feel ---so good
I'm so in love with two
I don't wanna push it
I don't wanna fight
But this feeling keeps me up all night
Chorus
If I only could decide
But I can't make up my mind
I'm breaking all my rules
Because of you
You can tell me it's not right
And it tears me up inside
But the problem is
I'm so in love with two
Heyeh..........
I don't know what to do
Heyeh.........
I choose the both of you
Don't wanna fight
An other Night
Just wanna
Make it right
C'mon
Oh my number one
Oh my number two
Oh somebody tell me what
I'm supposed to do
Oh my number one
Oh my number two
Somebody tell me why
I'm so in love with two
Chorus 
Heyeh heyeh heyeh he he
I choose the both of you
