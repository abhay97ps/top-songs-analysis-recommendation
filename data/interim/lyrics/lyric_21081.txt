I learned the hard way real early in life
That money sure don't grow on a tree
And there's a few things that a dollar can't buy
The best things in life, they come free
So girl I can't buy you a big diamond ring
No house on a hill full of life's finer things
And I'll tell you right now there's a whole lot that I just can't do
Oh, but baby don't think I can't love you
And when I get home after working all day
I'm beat down girl, I'm dead on my feet
But as tired as I am if you want to play
Well, playing sounds real good to me
