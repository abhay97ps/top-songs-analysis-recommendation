A poem with no rhyme
A clock without time
A ship without sails
Just drifting on the water
That's just how I feel
Whenever she's gone
That's just how I feel
My life's unreal, but I go on 
I wait till Julie comes around
And sings a happy song of summer
And lifts my spirit up
And fills my foolish mind with wonder
She smiles a gentle smile
And suddenly I get that feeling, and then
I'm inside out with love
'Cause Julie's come around again
She's just like a bird
She follows the sun
She spread out her wings
And once again she leaves me
It's always the same
I'm broken in two
But after a while
I always know what I must do
I wait till Julie comes around
And sings a happy song of summer
And lifts my spirit up
And fills my foolish mind with wonder
She smiles a gentle smile
And suddenly I get that feeling, and then
I'm inside out with love
'Cause Julie's come around again
When Julie comes around
And sings a happy song of summer
And lifts my spirit up
And fills my foolish mind with wonder
When Julie comes around
