Baby, I'm through
Running
It's true
I'd be a fool to try to escape you
And maybe I'm beat
But
Oh, what a sweet surrender
You keep your rights
I'll take your nights
No one can lose
When we turn the lights out
Tasting defeat
Loving that sweet surrender
I'm giving up myself to you
But I didn't really lose at all
I gave the only love I've known
And it never hurt me to fall
Now that it's done
So glad you won
I know our lives have only begun
No more retreat
Only my sweet surrender
Mmm, babe
I may be beat
Oh, what a sweet surrender
Surrender
And you
Sweet thing in my life
I surrender to you
