This is a song for
Every girl who's
Ever been through something
She thought she couldn't make it through, yeah
I sing these words because
I was that girl, too
Wanting something better than this
But who do I turn to?
Now we're moving from the darkness into the light
This is the defining moment of our lives
Cause you're beautiful
Like a flower
More valuable
Than a diamond
You are powerful
Like a fire
You can heal the world
With your mind and
There is nothing in the world that you cannot do
When you believe in you
Who are beautiful 
Who are brilliant 
Who are powerful 
Who are resilient
This is a song for
Every girl who
Feels that she is not special
Cause she don't look like a supermodel Coke bottle
The next time the radio tells you
To shake your money-maker
Shake your head and tell them
Tell them you're a leader
Now we're moving from the darkness into the light
This is the defining moment of our lives
Cause you're beautiful
Like a flower
More valuable
Than a diamond
You are powerful
Like a fire
You can heal the world
With your mind and
There is nothing in the world that you cannot do
When you believe in you
Who are beautiful 
Who are brilliant 
Who are powerful 
Who are resilient 
Who are beautiful 
Who are brilliant 
Who are powerful 
Who are resilient 
This song is for you
Yeah you
This song is for you
Yeah you
This song is for you
Yeah you
Yeah you
You are brilliant
