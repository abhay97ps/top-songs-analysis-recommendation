Every kiss I ever kissed you
Darling, came from my heart
But your love was just a play
And the things I heard you say
Were all a part
Of the kissing game
The kissing game
Yeah, the game, baby
Where you just played at love
Oh, you never really loved me
Though you kissed me each night
You were looking for some fun
And I guess just anyone
To hold you tight
In the kissing game
Mmm, the kissing game
Yeah, a game, baby
Where you just played at love
Don't you know you
Shouldn't go with some guy
Just because he looks
Good to the crowd
Use his love for a stepping stone
Baby, don't feel proud
Because some day you're gonna cry
When you meet someone who
Will pour water on your flame
And play the kissing game
Mmm, with you
Don't you know you
Shouldn't go with some guy
Just because he looks
Good to the crowd
Use his love for a stepping stone
Baby, now, don't you feel proud
He'll pour water on your flame
And play the kissing game with you
Ah, the kissing game
The kissing game
Ah, that kissing game
That kissing game
