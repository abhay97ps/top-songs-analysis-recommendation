Well, I a-know there's peace
On the mountain
And that's where I want to go
But I just can't rest
On the mountaintop
Knowin' the trouble down here below
Whoa, trouble down here below
Well, I know how to make it
To the top of the mountain
'Cause I've been there
A time or so
But I cannot rest
On the mountaintop
Knowin' the trouble down here below
Yeah, yeah, trouble down here below
I got a mother, father
Sister, brothers
Cryin' down here
In a world of trouble
Well, there ain't no trouble
On the mountain
But there's trouble down here below
Yeah, yeah, trouble down here below
Now people drinkin' and gamblin'
Rovin' and ramblin'
Fightin' and shootin'
They're a-hatin' and disputin'
No, there ain't no trouble
On the mountain
But there's trouble down here below
Hey, yeah, trouble down here below
There's trouble down here
Trouble down here
My brothers and sisters
Are cryin' in a world of trouble
I can't have no peace
On the mountaintop
'Cause I'm a-worried
And I'm troubled
No, there ain't no trouble
On the mountain
But there's trouble down here below
Whoa, trouble down here below
'Cause there's trouble
Down here below
