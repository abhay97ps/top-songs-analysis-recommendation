Her mouth on my head like bandanas 
She wanna suck it on camera 
These little boys don't want Ana 
I talk to that ho with no manners 
Thick mink on the floor in the Phantom
Had to crawl to the top with no ladder
Got my millions, it don't even matter 
Turbo with me for life, in and after 
You know Wheezy my brother like Tana 
She think she wanna fuck on the camera
She flew from Atlanta, she easy to handle
Was piped when I met her, we swipe like the scammer
Her kid with her nana, hot piss in the Pamper
I'm too geeked up, excuse my grammar
Peel your top back, so smooth, bananas 
We the topic, can't change the channel
Forty thou' for the plain or better 
Copped the Cayenne and painted it yellow
The bank callin' me, I don't go to the teller
They workin' for free, I don't know what to tell 'em
They say it's a jet, but I know it's propellers
I told her twerk for the camera 
She wanna suck it on camera 
I let my shit hang like a banner 
Her mouth on my head like bandanas 
She wanna suck it on camera 
These little boys don't want Ana 
I talk to that ho with no manners 
Thick mink on the floor in the Phantom
She wanna suck it on camera
These little boys don't want Ana
I talk to that ho with no manners
Thick mink on the floor in the Phantom
