She walked through the corn
Leading down to the river
Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
She took all the love
That a poor boy could give her
And left me to die like a fox on the run
Like a fox
 Like the fox
On the run
Everybody knows the reason for the fall
When Woman tempted Man down in paradise's hall
This woman tempted me, oh yes, and took me for a ride
But like the weary fox, I need a place to hide
She walked through the corn
Leading down to the river
Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
She took all the love
That a poor boy could give her
And left me to die like a fox on the run
Like a fox
 Like the fox
On the run
Come take a glass of wine and fortify your soul
We'll talk about the world and friends we used to know
I'll illustrate, a girl who put me on the floor
The game is nearly up, the hounds are at my door
I saw her walk through the corn
Leading down to the river
Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
She took all the love
That a poor boy could give her
And left me to die like a fox on the run
You know she walked through the corn
Leading down to the river
Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
She took all the love
That her poor boy could give her
And left me to die
Like a fox
 Like a fox
On the run
