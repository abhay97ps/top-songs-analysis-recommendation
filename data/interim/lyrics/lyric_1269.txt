Walking along
And I'm singing a song
'Cause I'm so blue
Baby, here without you
Oh, singing
Tra, la, la, la, la
Tra, la, la
Now I love you so
And no, no, no, nobody knows
The way you make me feel
Oh, I get such a thrill
Oh, I keep on singing
Tra, la, la, la, la
Tra, la, la
I feel so bad
I'm here all alone
I'm hoping that you
Hurry back home
Oh, I keep on singing
Tra, la, la, la, la
Tra, la, la
