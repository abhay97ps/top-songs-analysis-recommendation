First day we met, my heart stood still
I never had a man like you, and I doubt I ever will
So tired of playing all these love games
But since you came into my life I changed
That's why I'm so glad I found ya
Wanna build my whole world around ya
Ooh ya, gonna be true, gonna be true
I've got a love for you 
I've got a love for you 
I've got a love for you 
I've got a love for you
I'm gonna be true
When you're lonely, I'll be there for you
I'll hug and kiss you, and make it so much better
No other girl can you make you feel the same
Like the way I do
I've got a thing for you
I can't explain
I'll never ever leave ya
You know I'm here to please ya
Ooh ya, gonna be true, gonna be true
I remember the games that we used to play
And all the hearts we used to break
No one makes me feel the way you do
That's why, baby, I'm gonna be true
