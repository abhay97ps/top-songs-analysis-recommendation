We camped out on the livin' room floor
In our old sleepin' bags
By a make believe fire
In our tent made of covers
We'd talk for hours
My two brothers and me
Keepin' the faith
Racin' with destiny
Chorus
They were angels in waiting
Waiting for wings to fly from this world
Away from their pain
Treasuring time
'Til time came to leave
Leave them behind
Sweet memories
Angels in waiting
Angels in waiting for wings
2nd Verse
They always knew
They'd never grow old
Sometimes the body is weaker than the soul
In their darkest hour
I made a promise
I will always keep
I'll give them life
I'll let them live through me
