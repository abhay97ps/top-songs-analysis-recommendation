Yeah, I saw sparks fly from the corner of my eye
And when I turned, ooh, it was love at first sight
I said, "Please excuse me, I didn't catch your name
Oh, it'd be a shame not to see you again"
And just when I thought
She was comin' to my door
She whispered sweet
And brought me to the floor
She said, "I'm only seventeen 
I'll show you love like you've never seen", oh
She's only seventeen 
Daddy says she's too young
But she's old enough for me
Mm, come to my place, we can talk it over
Oh, everythin' goin' down in your head
She said, "Take it easy, I need some time
Time to work it out, to make you mine"
And just when I thought
She was comin' to my door
She whispered sweet
And brought me to the floor
She said, "I'm only seventeen 
You ain't seen love
Ain't seen nothin' like me"
She's only seventeen, seventeen, yeah, yeah
Yeah, such a bad girl, loves to work me overtime
Feels good dancin' close to the borderline
She's a magic mountain, she's a leather glove
Oh, she's my soul, it must be love
She's only seventeen 
Girl she gives me love like I've never seen
She's only seventeen 
Daddy says she's too young
But she's old enough for me 
She's everything I need 
Daddy says she's too young
But she's old enough, old enough for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
