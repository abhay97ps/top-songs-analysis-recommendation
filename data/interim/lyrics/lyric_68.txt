Christmas always comes this time of the year
Little girls and little boys
Dream of worlds full of toys
This time of the year
When Christmas is near
Evergreens are snowy white
Sleigh bells ring through the night
This time of the year
When Christmas is near
And somewhere near a steeple
People kneel and pray
And choirs sing
Carols of Christmas day
Santa Claus is on his way
Loads of joy, on his sleigh
This time of the year
When Christmas is near
Hear the sleigh bells
Hear the sleigh bells
Hear the sleigh bells, ring
