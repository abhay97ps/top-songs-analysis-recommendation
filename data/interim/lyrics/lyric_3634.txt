I don't know who he is behind that mask
But we need him, & we need him now
He's known as Bruce Wayne by day, wealthy socialite
But incognito in dress, he fights crime by night
Yeah it's Batman & Robin, Boy Wonder at his side
Hey now, Riddler, Penguin, Joker, better go & hide
Sounds of villainous laughter
We need the Batman 
We need the Batman 
Criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot
So my disguise must be able
To strike terror into their hearts
Now as the Bat Signal sweeps across the midnight sky
Gotham City, here they come
Somewhere in Gotham City it'll find the Batman's eye
Gotham City, here they come
There's a crime wave goin' on, but not for very long
'Cause the Batman's gonna teach 'em right from wrong
They call him Batman 
They call him Batman 
Did you see that strange car 
It was shaped like a bat
Sound of Batmobile passing by
So when you see the Batmobile quickly pass you by
Gotham City, here they come
You know they've heard the Batphone & the Commissioner's cry
Gotham City, here they come
Yeah that Dynamic Duo's out to prove crime doesn't pay
And from the Batcave our heroes keep evil at bay
We need the Batman 
We need the Batman 
I must be a creature of the night
Spoken
Black, terrible! Um... um... sounds of bat's call & flapping wings
As if in answer a huge bat flies in the open window!
A bat, that's it, it's an omen; I shall become a bat!
Thus is born this weird figure of the dark, this avenger of evil, the Batman!
Batman Batman
Batman Batman
Batman
Sound of Batmobile passing by
