If the song of the songbird
Could replace my wrong word
Then my dear, that's the song I would borrow
And tonight you would hear
The saddest song of the year
And you'd be mine once again come tomorrow
If the song of the swallow
Could reveal my sorrow
Then my dear, he would sing just for you
And tonight you would hear
The saddest song of the year
And you'd be mine once again come tomorrow
Just tonight, while in flight
On your windowsill daylight
To tell you all of my tears
And tonight you would hear
The saddest song of the year
And you'd be mine once again come tomorrow
If the song of the swallow
Could reveal my sorrow
Then my dear, he would sing just for you
And tonight you would hear
The saddest song of the year
And you'd be mine once again come tomorrow
And tonight you would hear
The saddest song of the year
And you'd be mine once again come tomorrow
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, Mr. Songbird
Come on and sing just one, little swallow
And make her mine once again come tomorrow
