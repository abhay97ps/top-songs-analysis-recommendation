Where is heaven? 
Outside, outside, outside, outside
When the angels looked down, they saw you walk away
They knew you hurt me more and more each day
So don't leave me, leave me, leave me all alone
Leave me, leave me, leave me all alone
Outsi yi yi yi yi yi yide, outside the gates of heaven
Outsi yi yi yi yi yi yide, outside the gates of heaven
When the angels looked down, they knew my fate
They cried and cried and cried when you closed the gate
If you'd only say "Be my, be my baby"
I'd be right there by your side 
Running home  to catch you
The gates will open up wide
Outsi yi yi yi yi yi yide, outside the gates of heaven
Outsi yi yi yi yi yi yide, outside the gates of heaven
Outside, yes I'm outside, oh and all alone
