Papa do ron-de ron-de, do ron-de ron-de
Do ron-de ron-de, ooh
I got it bad for the new girl in school
The guys are flipping but I'm playing it cool
Everybody's passing notes in class
They really dig her now, she's such a gas
Pappa, pappa, pappa
Do ron-de ron-de, do ron-de ron-de
Do ron-de ron-de, do ron-de ron-de
Do ron-de ron-de, ooh, I got a fad, pappa
Do ron-de ron-de, ooh
The chicks are jealous of the new girl in school
They put her down and they treat her so cruel
But the guys are going out of their minds
'Cause she's the cutest chick you'll ever find
A pa pa pa pa do ronde ronde
Do ronde ronde, do ronde ronde
Do ronde ronde, do ronde ronde ooh
I've got a fad for the do ronde ronde ooh
Papa do ronde ronde
Do ronde ronde, do ronde ronde ooh
It won't be long till we're having a ball
We'll walk and talk and we'll hold hands in the hall
Never thought I'd make it through this year
Sure was a drag till she transferred here
Pappa, pappa, pappa
Do ron-de ron-de, do ron-de ronde
Do ron-de ron-de, do ron-de ron-de
Do ron-de ron-de, ooh
I got a fad, pappa, pappa
Do ron-de ron-de, ooh
Little girl, if you want me to
I got a lot going
Little girl, if you want me to
I got it bad, pappa, do ron-de ron-de
