Passion, instant, sweat beads, feel me
Cupid's shot me, my heartbeat's racing
Tempt me , try me , feels so exciting
Thought of highly, it's yours entirely
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than your other
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than enough for you
I'll be, I'll, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, even more under covers
I'll be more, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than enough for you
Midnight grindin', heart rate's climbin'
You go , I go, 'cause we share  pillows 
Chase me, leave me, there's still no separating
Morning massages with new bones in your closet
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than your other
I said I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than enough for you
I'll be more, I'll, I'll be more than a lover 
More than a woman, even more under covers
I'm gonna be more, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than enough for you
I don't think you're ready
For this thing
You're not ready, no, no
This thing, this thing
Constant pleasures, no scale can measure
Secrets, treasures, keeps on getting better 
Do you wanna roll with me?
We can go to foreign lands with your hand in my hand
Do you wanna ride with me?
We can be like Bonnie & Clyde, be by your side
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than your other
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than enough for you
I'll, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, even more under covers
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman, more than enough for you
