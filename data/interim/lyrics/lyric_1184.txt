From a one little kiss and a lotta lovin' you build a big mansion of love
High on a hill of happiness with some-a-one that you've been dreamin' of
You build a wall around with a lotta lovin', all around your mansion of love
Then one day you hear a strange little sound tryin' to tear your mansion down
Whoa oh oh oh chip, chip you tell a little lie
Chip, chip, you make your baby cry
Chip, chip, you cheat a little bit
Chip, chip, you quarrel over it
Oh oh oh one day you're gonna discover
One little wrong leads to another
Chip, chip, a-chippin' away, chippin' at your mansion of love
Ah one little spark when it start to glowin' can warm a big mansion of love
One little wrong brings on the gloom, puts a chill in-a every room
Whoa oh oh oh chip, chip you tell a little lie
Chip, chip, you make your baby cry
Chip, chip, you cheat a little bit
Chip, chip, you quarrel over it
Oh oh oh one day you're gonna discover
One little wrong leads to another
Chip, chip, a-chippin' away, chippin' at your mansion of love
Chip, chip, a-chippin' away, chippin' at your mansion of love
Chip, chip, a-chippin' away
Chippin' at your mansion of love
