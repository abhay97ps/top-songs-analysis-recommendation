That's true , that's right 
She sippin' Moet, and yeah I swear it get her wetter 
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder 
No I'm not a rat, but I'm all about my cheddar 
Just talked to your homie, she said we should be together 
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header 
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her 
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her  
Now you beggin' this a doozy
But beggars cannot be choosy
Been the queen for eight summers
Just tell them to call me Suzy
This that Nicki, this that Uzi
This Hennessy got me woozy
Broke the Internet in 5411's and some Gucci
The blue ribbons eatin' sushi
It's that real good coochie
This that wet as Chattahoochee
Fuck all y'all like a hoochie
Givin' them bars since a teen
I ain't goin' back to juvie
I am Nicki Yamaguchi
'Cause I skate with the ice
I don't say, "What's the price?"
Lookin' like it's a heist
I been winnin' all my life
On a roll, it's a dice
Since that Itty Bitty Piggy
Rep my city like committees
If you fucked it up with Nicki
You feel pretty fuckin' shitty, uh
Anyway, I'm stoppin' bags like the TSA
Listen up you little bitches, it's a PSA
I'm still shadin' all these niggas, yeah the DITA way
You gotta pay me flat bread, yeah the pita way
I know you're sad and tired 
You've got nothin' left to give 
You'll find another life to live 
I know that you'll get over it 
Wish I never ever ever told you things 
I was only, only tryna show you things 
Iced out heart on your neck tried to froze your ring 
I had to get a me a new bitch to hold the pain 
We was in Hawaii lookin' at the ring 
She smilin' happy, but I'm laughin' 'cause her man's a lame
Damn, that just goes to show me money don't attract a thing 
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans
I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it 
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
And I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothin' left to give 
You'll find another life to live 
I know that you'll get over it
See I tied up my Raf, you strapped up your Rick 
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist 
Complement my style 
She don't want me, I'm runnin' wild 
You know I respect her on that level 
She don't want me, then I'ma let her 
Go over there with that broke fella 
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather 
My new chick, I swear that she better 
Want me back, never 
That's true, that's right 
She's sippin' Moet, and yeah I swear it get her wetter 
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder 
No I'm not a rat, but I'm all about my cheddar 
Just talked to your homie, she said we should be together 
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header 
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her 
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her 
I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it 
You'll find another life to live 
I know that you'll get over it 
I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it 
You'll find another life to live 
I know that you'll get over it 
I know it's over
Check out my cold shoulder  
I know it's over
Cry on that hoe shoulder 
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm
We-e used to be-e
Kissin' in the tree-e
'Member it was just you and me-e
Kissin' in the tree-e
'Member it was you was just you and me-e
K-i-s-s-i-n-g
K-i-s-s-i-n-g-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
Uh
