Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
I got in town a month ago
I've seen a lotta girls since then
If I could meet em I can get em, but as yet I haven't met em
Thats how I'm in the state I'm in
Oh, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
Another fella told me
He had a sister who looked just fine
Instead of being my deliverance, she had a strange resemblance
To a cat named Frankenstein
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
It's hard on a fella
When he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey to help me spend my money
I'm gonna have to blow this town
Oh, no, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
I'm in an awful way 
I'm in an awful way, oooh, I'm in an awful way
