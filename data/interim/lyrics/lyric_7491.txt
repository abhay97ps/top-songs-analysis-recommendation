Look around
Times are changing for the better
I would like to say
But I found everything I see when I look round this world today
Seems to say
There must be
Another way
Would you say
That the world is greener now than it was yesterday
If we stay in a world that's been abused in almost every way
How can we go to say
We are free
Where are all the men of learning
Have we lost the chance of learning
History or
???
Tell me where are all men of vision
Some must have made provision for the human race
On the face of the earth
Do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
But it seems that's the way that our children can expect to find shangri-la
If our dreams should all decay and life be wrecked by the motor car
How can we hop to see
Where we are
Where are all the men of learning
Can we find a way of turning
Gas back into air
Blue air
Tell me where are all the men of science
Where are those who preach defiance
When there's work to do
Where are you?
Where am I
Do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
