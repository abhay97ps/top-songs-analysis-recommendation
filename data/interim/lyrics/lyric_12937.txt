There's somethin' I wanna say
Try and understand
There's another in my life
He's my lover, and I'm your wife
You, me and he
What we gonna do, baby?
You, me and he
What we gonna do, baby
I was too blind, blind to see
I never thought, never thought it could happen to me
Then I knew  things had changed
'Cause when we made love, you called out his name
So much tension
'Cause we're livin' a lie by and by
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not to mention
Can we give it a try?
The truth's so, so very hard to say
Ooh baby
This pain I feel grows each day
Can we find a way?
So much tension
'Cause we're livin' a lie by and by
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not to mention
Can we give it a try?
You, me and he
What we gonna do, baby?
You, me and he
What we gonna do, baby?
I don't wanna let you go
No, no, no, no
You, me and he
What we gonna do, baby?
You, me and he
What we gonna do, baby?
