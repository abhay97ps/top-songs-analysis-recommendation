I don't wanna go off, been putting it off for too long
Pissing everyone off
I don't see where this could ever go wrong
Ey, spittin on the mic like an animal
Since I was still drinking danimals
Never been a fan of bull
Always felt like I was fake, wearing a mask like I'm Hannibal
School killin' my time like it is Hannibal Lector
All these teachers tryna give me a lecture
Talkin bout how much harder it was back in their day
But no one wants to listen to a word that they say
Cause this is my lane of the high way
You and your dreams are stuck at subway
But my dreams are here to stay
And they won't ever fade away
Get lost you and you're expectations
I'm not a child this world is raising
I'm like Will another rapper In The Making
The easy path is not what I'm taking yeah
All those times you spent out gettin' faded
I was getting songs out that would go on your playlist
Hear our music and you're bouta get hooked
Been killing these beats last time I looked
You keep saying  I need to get an education
But I don't wanna be in this brain washed nation
Tellin' me you want respect then why are you in my face
Is it really disrespect if there was no respect in the first place
Yo that was fire. Ay RIOT you wanna pick up the pace
Had a chance and I fumbled it, stumblin'
Then I got up again
Nobody wants to win as much as I wanna win
Music is where I find sustenance
Here is my disstrack I hope you can stomach it
Yeah I'm not gonna say your name in these bars
Cause you know exactly who you are
Talk about low life's your life's the lowest
You made a disstrack and you didn't even post it
I could destroy him, even he knows it
The only snake here  is the one who wrote it
I'm rappin about what's real not fake
You think you can do better just take a break
What you think I'm just gonna break
You're career ain't nothing but a mistake
You should try for a remake
Everyone knows the worst thing's a remake
Stop askin for my help
Just do it yourself
Heard all this trash about me
Heard it was started by Andy D
Hey that's funny, isn't that your name
My life isn't apart of your game
All this trash you've said is a big lie
I heard that Drew made you cry
Who knew that a bully
Could be such a baby
Eric remember when you would get mad
And all the good times that we had
When I stole you're girl and made you look dumb
And now you literally work at Walmart
It's good to see you fell hard
You're job is pushing carts
I hope the rich life is treating you good so far
Thanks for talkin bad about me behind my back
Holdin that knife in your hand about to attack
I didn't even do anything wrong
I even wrote you a 5 minute song
You call me names to hide the pain
That is coursing through your veins
Sayin this trash but can't even move on
Don't even bother I'm already gone
Life sucks yeah come on admit it
I get out my mic and guitar and I hit it
Light up the studio yeah I'm committed
Giving up isn't one of my conditions
Yeah I'm not here to fit in
Not here to make amends
I'm not here to smile at you
Or say hello to your friends
The odds of us quitting are next to none
You wanna see us quit cause you'll get outdone
All your songs sound like reruns
Unlike your career mine's just begun
