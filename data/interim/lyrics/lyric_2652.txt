A tear fell when I saw you
In the arms of someone new
A tear fell when you left me
All alone and feeling blue
You know a tear fell when you told me
That your love was not for me
I didn't miss these teardrops
But I missed you constantly
That's why I'm
The teardrops that you stepped on
As you danced across the floor
You know they were crushed like my poor heart was
When you walked out of my door
I said a tear fell when you told me
That the flame in your heart died
Darling, have I lost you
Like these teardrops from my eyes
I've got to be a
But I'm so glad I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
