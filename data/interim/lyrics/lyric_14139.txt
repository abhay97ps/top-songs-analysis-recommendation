The paintworks gleaming
In the rising sun
All our hopes are rising high
Now the battles won
Brothers and sisters gather around
To change some luck
Just can't lose
When the dice go down
Everybody's glory bound
Bowing down in motortown
Spread the news all around
They've got it made in motortown
There's a new age dawning
For a friend of mine
It's a revolution
In the latest style
Nothing left but a desperate trust
Kiss that chrome
Make a wish
Before it turns to rust
Everybody's glory bound
Got it made in motortown
Spread the news all around
Come on down to motortown
The cars roll by
The old steelyard
As the weeds grow high
It's a miracle, a miracle, a miracle...
Business is booming
In a come good zone
The cash may have gone
But there's hope on loan
Everybody's glory bound
Got it made in motortown
Forget what's lost and cheer what's found
Build cheap cars in motortown
Everybody's glory bound
Got it made in motortown
Spread the news all around
They work for pennies in motortown
