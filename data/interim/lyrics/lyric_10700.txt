Woah, oh-oh
I had a one-way love
Woah, oh-oh
It's what I'm thinkin' of
Woah, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh
All that love and affection
I've been giving away
Have found another direction
Because I found out today
My... my baby's baby
My... my baby's baby
Woah, oh-oh
I got no guarantee
Woah, oh-oh
You never notice me
Woah, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh
You should see me now...
When he needs a lover
His baby plays on his mind
He rings that telephone number
And guess who's on the line?
Ahhh, my baby's baby
My... my baby's baby
Ahhh, my baby's baby
I... really love to love
My... my baby's baby
My... my baby's baby
Ahhh, my baby's baby
I... really love to love
My... my baby's baby
My... my baby's baby
Oh my... my baby's baby
I... really love to love
