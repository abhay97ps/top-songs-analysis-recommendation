Hey
Lemme tell you
No
Oooh, baby
Tryna decide, tryna decide
If I really wanna go out tonight
I never used to go out without ya'
Not sure I remember how to
Gonna be late, gonna be late
But all my girls gon' have to wait
'Cause I don't know if I like my outfit
I tried everything in my closet
Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choos
Take 'em all off 'cause I feel a fool
Tryna to dress up when I'm missing you
I'mma step out of this lingerie
Curl up in a ball with something Hanes
In bed I lay with nothing but your t-shirt on 
With nothing but your t-shirt on
Hey, gotta be strong, gotta be strong
But I'm really hurting now that you're gone
I thought maybe I'd do some shopping
But I couldn't get past the door and
Now, I don't know now, I don't know
If I'm ever really gonna let you go
And I couldn't even leave my apartment
I'm stripped down, torn up about it
Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choos
Take 'em all off 'cause I feel a fool
Tryna to dress up when I'm missing you
I'mma step out of this lingerie
Curl up in a ball with something Hanes
In bed I lay with nothing but your t-shirt on 
With nothing but your t-shirt on
With nothing but your t-shirt on 
With nothing but your t-shirt on 
Tryna decide, tryna decide
If I really wanna go out tonight
I couldn't even leave my apartment
I'm stripped down, torn up about it
'Cause nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choos
Take 'em all off 'cause I feel a fool
Tryna to dress up when I'm missing you
I'mma step out of this lingerie
Curl up in a ball with something Hanes
In bed I lay
Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choos
Take 'em all off 'cause I feel a fool
Tryna to dress up when I'm missing you
I'mma step out of this lingerie
Curl up in a ball with something Hanes
In bed I lay with nothing but your t-shirt on
Said with nothing but your t-shirt on
With nothing but your t-shirt on
With nothing but your t-shirt on
Hey
Nothing but your t-shirt on
Lemme tell you now
Nothing but your t-shirt on
