I play
The stereo loud
When i'm away from the maddening crowd
Smokin.. jokin..
Clowns we all are
Sometimes gotta get really ill
When i receive my monthly telephone bill
U say it + ill pay it
Cuz it just helpz me to
Survive.. 
Stay alive
Til i see u again

Can't say where it ends
Clouds lift + there are mountainz below
Been awhile since ive seen any snow
Chillen' so thrillin'
So good to be back
Feels nice
To be home for awhile
Letz sip champaigne til we reckon a smile
Well go dancin ' romancin'
Cuz ur the reason i
Survive.. 
Stay alive
Through the think + the thin
Survive
Stay alive
Where will it all end?
Put my bagz in a pack
Cuz ive got to go back + play
But i know we'll both
Survive.. 
Stay alive
Thru the think + the thin
Survive..
Stay alive
Til it all ends..
Ooh we'll
Survive.. 
Stay alive
When will it all end?
Survive..
Stay alive
'til i see u again
