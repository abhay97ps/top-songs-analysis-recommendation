Y'all niggas stop playin', nigga
Y'all niggas know what the fuck goin' on
Big 4L, big steppers
Big footprints, pussy 
Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy
Pussy, pussy, okay, 21 
Okay, 21, okay, 21 
Okay, 21 
21, 21, 21
Big 4L, I'm a member 
Leave an opp cold, like December 
.45 on me, it's a Kimber 
AK knockin' down trees, like timber
Get your baby mama 'fore we bend her 
Hit the windshield, not the fender 
Givin' out smoke my agenda 
Throw the white flag, they surrender 
All black tux, I'm a businessman 
Millionaire, still shakin' killеrs hand 
Take the plug off and the middlе man 
Spray the whole block, I don't give a damn 
Fuck a nigga bitch, I'm a gentleman 
21, your bitch know I been the man 
Playin' with the rock like I'm Jigga man
Gotta look a nigga in the eyes when you kill a man
Glock in my lap, everywhere I'm strapped
Most these rappers cap, I ain't givin' dap
Glenwood to the flat, used to rob and trap
Money tall, Shaq, choppa bullets, splat
Chuck E. Cheese, rat, we get rodents whacked
Way too many steppers, I can't hold 'em back
Body full of scars, face full of tats
You pray on your knees, I pray to my strap
Say you want smoke, but the fire come with it
Money on your head, nigga, we'll come get it
New Kel-Tec put a hun-dun in it
'Partment so sweet, threw a honey bun in it
Keep it in the street, I ain't doin' no squealin'
I don't never put women in my business
Full-time rapper, I ain't doin' no drillin'
Woah, woah, I can make a M in my sleep 
17 breakin' down a P 
18 start sellin' hard with Lil B
Hundred dollar three-five, a whip from D
Ridin' down Glenwood, tank on E
All about the money, I ain't never smoke weed
Cool young nigga, still take yo' cheese 
Not mine, this bitch for us 
The gang is what I trust 
Don't argue, we don't fuss 
No talkin', he get touched 
I can't smoke my opps 
'Cause all my opps is dust 
He think he the battery, we call him Elon Musk 
Open your mouth when I bust 
Suck me up slow, don't rush 
Havin' threesomes is a must 
Hit it from the back and she cussed 
I put his bitch in the Benz 
She used to ride on the bus 
I walk around with them thigh pads 
But I ain't got no yard rushed
Glock in my lap, everywhere I'm strapped
Most these rappers cap, I ain't givin' dap
Glenwood to the flat, used to rob and trap
Money tall, Shaq, choppa bullets, splat
Chuck E. Cheese, rat, we get rodents whacked
Way too many steppers, I can't hold 'em back
Body full of scars, face full of tats
You pray on your knees, I pray to my strap
