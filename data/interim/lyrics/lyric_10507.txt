Fly unidentified if you want to
But I would really like to know
Will you light the sky on fire?
Will you light tonight like
You did the night before, baby?
You could take me higher
Than the diamonds in the sky
Take me, light in the sky and
We'll vanish without a trace
In a cigar-shaped object
Temples and pyramids they sing
Know all there really is to know
Will you light the sky on fire?
Will you light the sky
On fire again tonight?
You can take me higher
Than the diamonds in the sky
Take me, we'll vanish without a trace
In a cigar-shaped object
On the pyramids is a legend
The great god Kopa Khan who
Came from the stars and vanished
And the legends say he will come
Back again someday
Someday 
Will you light the sky on fire?
Will you light tonight like
You did the night before?
You could take me higher
Than the diamonds in the sky
Take me, light in the sky and
We'll vanish without a trace
In a cigar-shaped object
Yes, I would really like to know
What are they watching us for?
Yes, I would really like to know
Will you light the sky on fire?
Will you light the sky like
You did the night before?
You could take me higher
Than the diamonds in the sky
Take me, we'll vanish without a trace
In a cigar-shaped object
Vanish without a trace
Vanish without a trace
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
Let's vanish without a trace
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
We'll vanish without a trace
