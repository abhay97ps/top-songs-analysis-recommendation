I woke up early this morning with a pounding in my head
I'd been out the night before with all my friends
A little worried, kinda wondering what i did
I said lord please forgive me for my sins
My wife wanted to kill me but she tried to save me first
You're going if i have to drag your butt to church
I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life
I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along
Made it throught the sunday sermon wide awake
We met the family for dinner at our home
Drank some beers, watched the game and cooked some steaks
My little brother had a big fight with his wife
My poor mother sat between them both all night
I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life
We said a prayer for cousin micheal in iraq
We're all aware he may never make it back
We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes
And how he wanted to be a soldier more than most
I laid in bed that night and thought about the day
And how my life was like a rollercoaster ride
The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way
It'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight
You can't really smile until you've shed some tears
I could die today or i might live on for years
I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life
I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life
