Start me up
Start me up
Oh, Tommy used to work on the docks
Union’s been on strike
He’s down on his luck
It’s tough
Oh, so tough
Oh, we gotta 
Ready or not 
You live for the fight when that's 
Start me up
We're halfway there
Oh, woah! Livin' on a prayer
Start me up
We'll make it – I swear
Oh woah! Livin' on a prayer
If you start me up 
Kick on the starter give it all you got
You got it , you got it 
I can’t compete 
With the riders in the other heat
Yeah yeah! 
 I'll make a grown man cry 
I'll make a grown man 
Give it a shot
Start me up
We're halfway there
Oh woah! Livin' on a prayer
Start me up
We'll make it – I swear
Oh woah! Livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer!
Oh we gotta
Hold on, ready or not 
You live for the fight when that's 
Oooooh,  We're halfway there
We're halfway there 
Livin' on a prayer!
Take my hand and we’ll make it I swear 
Oooh! Livin' on a prayer!
Start me up 
I’ll never stop
Livin' on a prayer 
Take my hand and we’ll make it I swear  {Livin' on a prayer}
Livin' on a prayer 
Oh, we're halfway there
Oh woah! Livin' on a prayer 
Take my hand  and we’ll make it I swear
We're almost there 
We're livin' on a prayer
Living on a prayer
You gotta
Start me up
