When I was a little girl
I had a rag doll
Only doll I've ever owned
Now I love you just the way
I loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown
And it gets stronger, in every way
And it gets deeper, let me say
And it gets higher
Day by day
Do I love you, my oh my
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah!
If I lost you would I cry?
Oh, how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby
When you were a young boy
Did you have a puppy
That always followed you around?
Well, I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No, I'll never let you down
And it grows stronger, like a river flows
And it gets bigger baby, and heaven knows
And it gets sweeter baby
As it grows
Do I love you my oh my?
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you would I cry?
Oh, how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby
I love you baby like a flower loves the spring
And I love you baby like the robin loves to sing
And I love you baby like a schoolboy loves his bag
And I love you baby, river deep, mountain high
Oh baby
Oh baby!
Oh woah baby!
Ooh Ooh Ooh!
Ooh Ooh Ooh!
Yeah!
Yeah!
 I love you my oh my, yeah?
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you would I cry?
Oh, how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby
