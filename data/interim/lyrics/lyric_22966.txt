Yeah, I think I’m gonna leave
I’ll just have that one drink
And we’ve all gotta be up early
Boys, we oughta shut her down
Just take it to the house
‘Fore anybody starts getting crazy
I started walking across the floor
Before I got to the door
Aw naw, somebody just bought a
Shot of that Patron, hang on
I just might have to stay hey
Aw naw, look at the time y’all
What happened to coats on, long gone
I should be halfway home but aw naw
Yeah, girl I saw you come in
With all of your girlfriends
Just cutting up and shooting Bacardi
Yeah, I got my boys with me
We’re just blowing off steam
Not looking to pick up anybody
So, I was gonna walk on by
You turned around and we locked eyes
Aw Naw, do you hear that song
Oh one that just came on, c’mon
DJ what you tryin’ to do
Aw Naw, it’ll be so wrong
If we didn’t dance one, show off
Those jeans you painted on
Aw naw, aw naw
No, I didn’t mean to be here this long
And I tried to leave, so it ain’t my fault
No, I didn’t mean to be holding you
But, tell me, what was I supposed to do?
Aw naw, somebody just bought a
Shot of that Patron
Hang on, we’ve been here all night long
Aw Naw, it would be so wrong
If we didn’t dance one more song, show off
Those jeans you painted on, aw naw
Yeah, aw naw
Those jeans you painted on, aw naw
