Fabolous:
Shawty is the sh-sh-sh-sh
Sugar honey iced tea
Prettiest one I see
Little mama icy
They say she a Pisces
I heard they are feisty
You know how to treat her, she’ll be sweeter than a Hi-C
Clean up very nicely, shoes are kinda pricey
Match ‘em up precisely, good jeans nice tee
Like her food spicy
And she is the same
Hotter than a flame, but I do not know her name
Is it Keisha? 
Is it Tisha? 
Maybe Lisa? 
Or Teresa? 
It could be Tia? 
Maybe Aaliyah? 
I guess I’ll find out one day, for now I'mma say 
Shawty fine, Shawty Tight
Shoulda Stayed There All Night
With You  With You
I Missed Ya, Picked Ya
Now It's Time I
Get Back up With YouGirl With You
