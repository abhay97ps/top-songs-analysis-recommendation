Why don't you stop 
And look me over
Am I the same girl
You used to know
Why don't you stop 
And think it over
Am I the same girl
Who knew her soul
I'm the one you want
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one you love
The one you used to meet
Around the corner every day
We would meet and slip away
But we were much too young
To love each other this way
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Why don't you stop 
And look me over
Am I the same girl
You used to know
Why don't you stop 
And think it over
Am I the same girl
Who knew her soul
I'm the one you hurt
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one who cried
I'm the one you used to meet
But you are pretending
You don't care
And the fire is still there
But we were no longer too young
To love each other this way
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
