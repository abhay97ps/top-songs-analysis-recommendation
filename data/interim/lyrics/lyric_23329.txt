Woah! Woah!
Every day is payday
Swipe my card, then I do the Nae Nae
You're talking to a lady
I want a Kanye-ye, not a Ray J
So that's a no-no
I'm a Maybach and you's a Volvo
This convo beat like Dre-e
I already know whatcha tryna say
You say that you a baller and I see you tryna holla
But that ain't how I was brought up, next
Working for the money 'cause that's what my mama taught me
So your ass better show me some respect
Bo$$, Michelle Obama
Purse all heavy, getting Oprah dollars

C-O-N-F-I-D-E-N-T, that's me, I'm confident
Don't want yo compliments, use common sense
I'm on my Michelle Obama 
Shut your mouth
Boy, I think you know who run this house
I ain't thirsting for no bae
'Cause I already know whatcha tryna say
You say that you a baller and I see you tryna holla
But that ain't how I was brought up, next
Working for the money 'cause that's what my mama taught me
So your ass better show me some respect
Bo$$, Michelle Obama
Purse all heavy, getting Oprah dollars

So if you're with us, come on let me hear you say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-huh, hey, hey, uh-huh, hey, hey
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da, I see you
You say that you a baller and I see you tryna holla
But that ain't how I was brought up, next 
Working for the money 'cause that's what my mama taught me
So your ass better show me some respect
Bo$$, Michelle Obama
