Trippin' flippin' this is how we stick it to ya
It's all good in th' hood
This is our life
Mc Shermos, Alabama three oooh
I'm so sick and tired of feelin' sick and tired
I've been wired every night of this week
My troubled mind just can't find no comfort in sleep
I'm on th' wrong side of town, I can't come down
I got holes in my dancin' shoes
Look like a dog house flower
In the midnight hour
In the corner of some bar room
Give me one more minute of danger
Some bad medicine
I'll waste it on an hour in hell tonight
To get to heaven on adrenaline
Feel the rush
So down at heel
Streetlight feels like some narcotic 
I stumble alone
Lookin' for home
An' no door key in my pocket
So I double back
I retrace my tracks to the place where all of this started
My getaway car was stole an you laugh
Cause I forgot to lock it
Give me one more minute of danger
Some bad medicine
I'll waste it on an hour in hell tonight
To get to heaven on adrenaline
Feel the rush
I'm gonna take it any way that I can make it
Run off adrenaline
In my life I had to fake it
Needin' the medicine for everythin'
Dozens of hopes where you don't try to explain all it
Too many brothers skimmin'
I gets the feelin that my deals ain't no way to run
Somebody slip me by the loo having too much fun
Now I'm probably flippin', spendin', chillin', killin' too much time
Leave me the number one before I lose my mind
Can't be fine
Havin' a time of it
Duck in a dive
Keep it alive
Rock in and ride with it
The devil's hit me tryin to win
But can he keep the pace?
I've done it all before
An never lost my faith
Throw me a sign if you find one my sins
Raise your hands if you down an all in
Blaze one up somebody pass me the skins
We're all on the guest list to heaven
I'm gonna fly, yeah
I'm gonna fly so high
I'm gonna fly, yeah
I'm gonna fly so high
And I'm gonna fly so high
Feel the rush
I'm gonna fly
Feel de rush
I'm gonna fly so high
Feel de rush
I'm gonna fly
Feel de rush
