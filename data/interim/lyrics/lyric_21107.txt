Young hearts
I believe if we are not far
From becoming who we truly are
Love is on its way
Dreamers
You see everything in color
While the world is getting darker
Love is on its way
So, hold on another day
Cause love is on its way
You'll find it's gonna be okay
Cause love is on its way
It's alright, you'll find
A brighter day
Cause love it on its way
Leaders
Show us how to love each other
It could help us to recover
Love is on its way
Lonely
I believe if you find me
Then together we will truly see
Love is on its way
Yeah
So, hold on another day
Cause love is on its way
You'll find it's gonna be okay
Cause love is on its way
It's alright, you'll find
A brighter day
Cause love is on its way
Yeah
Hold, on another day
Cause love is on its way
You'll find it's gonna be okay
Cause love is on its way

A brighter day
