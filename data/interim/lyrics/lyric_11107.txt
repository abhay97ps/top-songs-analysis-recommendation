We were walking in the sand
I could feel your heart pound
A man and a woman
Walking in the sundown
Maybe now I'll understand
How you feel the way you do
We all have the same emotion, baby
I can feel it too
It's like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around
I have looked for love before
I was looking all around you
I'm not looking anymore
Now that I've found you
I've found you
When there's something deep inside
That tells me this is real
We're not just going through the motions this time
I know it's love we feel
Just like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around
It's like the rocking of the ocean
Like the rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around
It's like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around
La, la, la, da, la, la, la
La, la, la, da, la
Like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around
It's like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around
