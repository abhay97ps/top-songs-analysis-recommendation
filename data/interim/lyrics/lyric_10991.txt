Tonight of nights you should be far away
A million miles from where you are
You'll hear the rhythm as it sounds across the sky
Above your heads a shooting star
And they'll be dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the strange light
Voices from the bright lights
I wonder who they are
Don't worry 'cause it's only a shooting star
They move in closer with their gleaming eyes
Arrested chariots of fire
Don't make a move for they begin to speak
I do believe they wear a smile
And they'll be dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the strange light
Voices far and friendly
They know just who you are
Don't worry 'cause it's only a shooting star
In the moonlight
