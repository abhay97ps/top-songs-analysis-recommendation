TITLE SEQUENCE
CUT TO: POLLICE STATION
Jessica anxiously sits in an interrogation room, looking at her reflection in a mirror. After a few moments, Detective Clemons comes in holding some documents.
CLEMONS: Just a few more questions, miss Jones.
JESSICA: I'm not sure what else I can tell you.
CLEMONS: I know it's been a long night.
JESSICA: I work odd hours, I'm used to it.
CLEMONS: Seem pretty tense.
JESSICA: Wouldn't you be?
CLEMONS: I don't know what I'd be. Hard to imagine.
JESSICA: Hard to forget.
CLEMONS: How'd the Shlottmans find you?
JESSICA: Referral.
CLEMONS: How did you find their daughter?
JESSICA: Followed the clues. Credit card statements, couple of interviews.
CLEMONS: But at the time of the shooting, you had an overnight bag with you.
JESSICA: Is that a question?
CLEMONS: Where were you going?
JESSICA: Pennsylvania.
CLEMONS: What's in Pennsylvania?
JESSICA: Great antiques.
CLEMONS: I love antiques. You too, huh?
JESSICA: The older the better.
CLEMONS: Did you know Hope was going to kill her parents?
JESSICA: If I did, I would have stopped her.
CLEMONS: Hmm... . So, you assumed she was in her right mind.
JESSICA: Clearly she wasn't, given the bullets in her parents.
CLEMONS: Any idea how a coed from Nebraska gets ahold of a gun?
JESSICA: Walmart?
CLEMONS: It's unregistered.
JESSICA: Maybe some asshole gave it to her.
CLEMONS: . Maybe this asshole?
Clemons pulls out some of Jessica's photos of the man from the bar.
CLEMONS: Hmm?
JESSICA: You went into my office without a search warrant.
CLEMONS: It's a part of the crime scene. How'd the front door get broken?
JESSICA: The door isn't related to the Shlottman case, and neither are these pictures. I want them back. My clients expect discretion. This is bad for business.
CLEMONS: So is a double homicide.
JESSICA: I'm licensed. My paperwork is up to date. The only thing that you can charge me with is trying to make a goddamn living in this goddamn city. So unless you have something else...? . I didn't think so.
She gets up and leaves.
CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE BAR
Jessica gets out of a taxi. She notices a police car waiting outside. She turns around and looks in the bar. Inside, the man is talking to two police officers.
JESSICA: Shit.
The police officers leave the bar. Jessica enters.
MAN: We're not open.
JESSICA: I told them that you had nothing to do with that girl.
MAN: I don't need the police up in my shit.
JESSICA: Just let me explain.
MAN: How about you start with why you took those pictures?
JESSICA: I'm a private investigator.
MAN: That's the answer to a different question.
JESSICA: I was hired.
MAN: By who?
JESSICA: By a man who suspected his wife was cheating on him with you.
MAN: I don't mess with married women. I don't do drama.
JESSICA: Gina.
MAN: You don't know shit.
JESSICA: I know that she takes her ring off before she comes to see you. You can look up the marriage certificate online.
MAN: So that night you came to my place, that was all just part of this job?
JESSICA: I shouldn't have done that.
MAN: Because it's messed up? Or because you got caught?
JESSICA: Both.
MAN: Get out of here, and stay the hell away from me.
JESSICA: I just -
MAN: I'm serious. Go.
He walks away. She leaves the bar.
CUT TO: JESSICA'S APARTMENT
Jessica gets out of the shower.
JESSICA: It's better, being alone. It's safer, with Kilgrave out there.
Jessica notices a cockroach on her wall. She flicks it into her sink.
JESSICA:  He cheated death. How?
CUT TO: POLICE STATION
Jessica walks up some stairs. A police officer lets her into an area where people being held there can meet with people on the outside.
MAN: Sign in please, ma'am.
Jessica signs her name, and is led away. Cut to a private room, where Jessica is interrogating Hope.
JESSICA: Start at the beginning. . Hope, you were the last one to see Kilgrave alive. Did he tell you anything? Where he's been? Why he's back? Was there anything about the way he looked? Where he took you? Was anyone else there? God damn it.
HOPE: Are you a good jumper?
JESSICA: Why?
HOPE: He made me jump. For hours, as high as I could. That was one of my events at school: Long jump. I was number two in the state. He said I was never as good as you. My brother is all alone now. He's twelve.
JESSICA: It's not your fault.
HOPE: I know. It's yours. He said you left him there to die. You should have stayed to make sure.
JESSICA: So he's mad. He wants to make me suffer.
HOPE: Mhm. Like he suffered.
JESSICA: How? How did he suffer? From the accident? Is he injured? Hope, I need to know so I can get him.
HOPE: No! He'll control you, too! He'll make you do things! Terrible things!
JESSICA: Calm down. Hope. I won't let him, okay? I won't let him.
HOPE: You should kill yourself.
JESSICA: Probably.
A police officer unlocks the door.
JESSICA: But I'm the only one that knows you're innocent.
Jessica leaves. A man comes in and give Hope some water. She starts sobbing. He puts some medication down her throat.
CUT TO: HOGARTH'S OFFICE
HOGARTH: She's guilty. She had a gun in her purse. It was premeditated. She aimed it at her parents and pulled the trigger repeatedly.
Hogarth is sitting at her desk drinking water. Jessica is pacing around the room.
JESSICA: She wasn't in control.
HOGARTH: If you kill someone while driving drunk, you're responsible.
JESSICA: She was abducted.
HOGARTH: Patty Hearst was abducted, and she still got convicted.
Pam knocks on the door and opens it.
PAM: Miss Hogarth? Your wife is on line three.
HOGARTH: I'll call back.
JESSICA: Hope Shlottman is not responsible.
HOGARTH: Because she was brainwashed.
JESSICA: Brainwashed, mind-controlled, whatever you can sell.
HOGARTH: There's nothing to sell.
JESSICA: How about the truth?
HOGARTH: Pam, what is it?
PAM: You have to talk to your wife. She's yelling. She's freaking out -
Jessica walks over and slams the door on Pam.
HOGARTH: Hey!
JESSICA: Take Hope's case.
HOGARTH: There is a legal name for cases like hers.
JESSICA: There's precedent?
HOGARTH: They're called losers, and I don't represent losers. I'll let you know if any work comes in for you. Until then, relax! Get a massage. I have a great Filipino woman who will walk all over your back.
JESSICA: Massages make me tense.
HOGARTH: There's nothing you can do for this girl.
JESSICA: I can prove that Kilgrave exists.
HOGARTH: If there really was a man who could influence people like that, I would hire him to do all my jury selection.
JESSICA: Go damn it, this is not a joke!
HOGARTH: . How? How will you prove that this mind-controller is real?
JESSICA: I'm resourceful. But if I can convince you, will you represent her? . I'll owe you a favor.
HOGARTH: Excuse me?
JESSICA: If you do this, I'll owe you a favor.
HOGARTH: All right, convince me.
Jessica leaves. Pam has been waiting outside, and comes in.
PAM: Jeri, talk to your wife. She knows.
Pam leaves. Hogarth sighs, and takes a sip of water.
CUT TO: SIDEWALK
Jessica walks briskly on the sidewalk. Trish is waiting for her in a car.
TRISH: Wait here, I'll be right back.
DRIVER: Yeah, sure.
Trish gets out of the car.
TRISH: I texted you. Six times.
JESSICA: My phone's dead.
TRISH: You were headed out of town.
JESSICA: Something came up.
TRISH: I saw on the news. I'm scared for you.
JESSICA: Don't have feelings, okay?
TRISH: Not okay! You need help.
JESSICA: No, no way.
Jessica begins to walk away.
TRISH: That's it? I give you whatever you need, and you can't even give me a minute?
Jessica turns around.
JESSICA: Okay.
Jessica leads Trish away. Cut to Jessica's apartment.
TRISH: What happened to your door?
JESSICA: Dissatisfied customer.
TRISH: Your place is... it cute.
JESSICA: You think it's a dump.
TRISH: I didn't say that.
JESSICA: I know your voice.
Jessica gives Trish back the envelope of money she had given her. She sits down on her desk. Trish opens the envelope.
TRISH: You're not trying to be insulting, but you're succeeding.
JESSICA: It's not an insult, it's the cash I owe you.
TRISH: So now what? With Kilgrave.
JESSICA: That accident didn't kill him, but he took a hit. I find his weakness, I find him.
TRISH: So, you find him. Then what?
JESSICA: I don't know. I find him, I prove that girl's innocent, he goes away.
TRISH: Or he controls you again.
JESSICA: I'll die before I let that happen.
TRISH: That's what I'm afraid of. Listen, I think... I think you should move in with me again. I have a security system, a doorman. I have an actual lock on my door.
JESSICA: You think I'll be safe there? I'm not safe anywhere. Every corner I turn, I don't know what's on the other side. I don't know who's on the other side. It could be the cabbie who's going to drive me into the East river, okay? It could be the FedEx woman. It could be a talk show host, who was my best friend.
TRISH: 'Was'?
JESSICA: I'm life-threatening, Trish. Steer clear of me.
TRISH: I don't do that.
JESSICA: Please. I can't risk you.
Trish sighs, then gathers her things and starts to leave.
JESSICA: It had the name on it.
TRISH: What?
JESSICA: The door. 'Alias Investigations'. I had it made special.
TRISH: I like it.
Trish leaves. Jessica sighs.
CUT TO: THE BAR
The man is cleaning up the bar. A woman at the bar smiles at him.
WOMAN: Hey, handsome. Got a Long Island Iced Tea for a thirsty working woman?
MAN: All out.
WOMAN: So, we skip the drinking part, go straight upstairs.
MAN: I don't play with liars.
WOMAN: We never talk long enough for me to lie to you. Too busy taking our clothes off.
MAN: You could put your wedding ring back on.
The woman's smile fades.
WOMAN: So, I'm married. I'm just a booty call for you anyway.
MAN: I stay away from complications.
WOMAN: My marriage is over. We don't even do oral anymore.
MAN: I really... I don't wanna hear it.
WOMAN: Trust me, Andre doesn't know or care.
MAN: He cared enough to hire a private investigator.
WOMAN: What?
MAN: Jessica Jones. She's good. I've seen the pictures.
WOMAN: I don't believe you. Andre would never -
MAN: Go home, and ask him.
ANOTHER MAN: Luke.
MAN : Door's right there.
Luke goes to serve the man who called him.
WOMAN: Jesus Christ. Jesus.
The woman hurries out of the bar. Luke shakes his head.
CUT TO: JESSICA'S APARTMENT
Jessica pulls a folder from a shelf. In it are various pictures, newspaper clippings, and documents. One headline reads, 'Fatal Bus Crash Raises Concerns: Hell's Kitchen resident Reva Connors killed in accident.' Another reads, 'Commuters On Alert Following Fatal Bus Accident'. Jessica picks up one that reads, 'Hell's Kitchen Resident Killed In Bus Accident'. Jessica sighs and puts it down, then takes a sip of whiskey. She looks up when she hears her upstairs neighbors arguing. Their arguing gets increasingly more distracting until Jessica finally leaves her apartment. Malcolm is in the hallway.
MALCOLM: Is that real or is it just in my head?
JESSICA: Both.
She walks upstairs. The arguing can be heard more distinctly now.
WOMAN: Did you even wash your hands? Did you wash your hands? We're gonna get salmonella! The whole kitchen's gonna get salmonella, you -
Jessica knocks on the door and the yelling stops.
WOMAN: Just get the door.
MAN: We're not cooking this for anyone else, it's just for us!
The man opens the door.
JESSICA: Shut. Up.
WOMAN: Mind your own business, lush.
JESSICA: Your business is my business when I have to listen to it.
WOMAN: Oh, like we had to listen to glass shattering from your place the other day?
MAN: Hey, why don't we ask her.
WOMAN: Cause she clearly doesn't understand jack about cordon-blue. . It's French, for chicken.
MAN: But she can be the deciding vote.
WOMAN: Zip it, pooh bear.
JESSICA: Everybody just zip it!
WOMAN: Got to hell!
Jessica breaks the door open and grabs the woman, shoving her up against a wall.
JESSICA: You know why I live alone?
MAN: People don't like you?
JESSICA: People distract me. Now, I don't give a bag of dicks what kinky shit you're into. Just be into it quietly.
Jessica releases the woman, who gasps for breath. She begins walking away.
JESSICA: Self-respect! Get some.
WOMAN: Help me up!
The man is in the doorway in his underwear. He helps the woman up while watching Jessica leave.
WOMAN: Come on, get inside. You're naked.
Back in her apartment, Jessica sits down at her desk. She takes out one of the articles and begins to have a flashback to the bus accident. In the flashback, she can be seen walking away from a body with bloody hands.
KILGRAVE: Come back here! Jessica? . Now, Jessica!
A bus honks loudly. Kilgrave and Jessica both turn to look at it. It swerves, hitting the body in the road and sending Kilgrave flying. The flashback ends and we see Jessica at the spot where the accident took place. Jessica walks into a nearby auto shop and addresses one of the mechanics.
JESSICA: Hey, uh, if I get hit by a bus, where's the closest hospital?
MECHANIC: Stay on sidewalk, you don't get hit by bus.
JESSICA: Thanks, I'll find out myself.
MECHANIC: Hey, uh, everyone go to Metro-General. Six blocks that way.
He gestures towards the hospital. Jessica turns and leaves.
MAN: Hey, you're welcome. . Rude girl is lonely girl.
JESSICA: Countin' on it.
CUT TO: HOSPITAL
Jessica sneaks into the authorized personnel only area. She sees how a nurse accesses one of the computer terminals. She then sneaks into a locker room and breaks one of the lockers. She ignores a call from Trish and breaks into another locker.
JESSICA: Jesus.
Cut to Jessica walking down the hall in pink nurse's scrubs which are covered in hearts. She accesses the computer terminal and begins searching. She then addresses a nurse walking by.
JESSICA: Excuse me?
NURSE: Sorry, I got a fecal situation in 602.
JESSICA: This is my first day. I can't mess it up. Dr. Carter already hates me.
NURSE: Dr. Carter?
JESSICA: He's the new Head of Oncology. Please.
NURSE: Ugh, just... make it quick.
JESSICA: It's this computer system. It's nothing like my old hospital.
NURSE: Where're you from?
JESSICA: Seattle Grace.
NURSE: Like... on TV?
JESSICA: I'm looking for emergency room records. You know, people who came through.
NURSE: Why does a cancer doctor need ER records?
JESSICA: I didn't ask.
NURSE: You know, he's probably testing you. They pull that crap sometimes.
JESSICA: Yeah, there was a bus crash a year ago. He wants all the info on a John Doe that came through.
NURSE: Just give me the date.
JESSICA: January twentieth.
The nurse types in some information and some results pop up.
NURSE: Hmm, looks like it was a slow night. One Charles Wallace, 51, cuts and bruises. The driver. One woman, DOA. No John Doe. That's all she wrote on January 20th.
JESSICA: I should probably print the whole file for that accident.
NURSE: Yeah, live your life woman. I gotta go clean up some shit.
The nurse walks away. Jessica continues using the computer terminal. She pulls up a picture of the woman killed in the crash.
CUT TO: JESSICA'S APARTMENT BUILDING
Jessica stands in the elevator, holding a printed copy of the accident file. She folds it up and sighs. Looking up, there is still some blood from the murders the other day. She gets out of the elevator and hears someone in her apartment. She briefly sees a man on the other side of the door. She knocks it open, sending him flying into the wall.
JESSICA: Who sent you?
MAN: My leg! Shit!
Jessica ignores him, instead investigating the rest of her apartment.
JESSICA: Who sent you?
MAN: What the hell? I'm bleeding!
JESSICA: . Who sent you?
MAN: Patricia Walker! She hired me to fix your door. Jesus, lady! You're a lunatic!
JESSICA: Sorry.
MAN: I'm bleeding here.
JESSICA: Here -
MAN: Get away from me! And call a goddamn ambulance.
Jessica sighs and takes out her phone. Cut to the man being taken into an ambulance. She's now talking on the phone with Trish.
JESSICA: What the hell were you thinking? I almost killed him!
TRISH: I left you a message, check your phone.
JESSICA: I could get slapped with an assault charge.
TRISH: Adam won't press charges if I pay for his medical care.
JESSICA: Christ, do you have to control everything?
TRISH: No, of course not! . Not this one, no.
JESSICA: Please Trish, listen to me. Don't call, don't visit, and don't sen strange men to my apartment with power tools.
Some people enter Trish's studio. Zack notices them.
ZACK: You might wanna cover up.
Trish looks up and sees them. She sighs and puts on her coat.
TRISH: Jess, your door needs to lock.
JESSICA: I'll handle it!
TRISH: No, you won't.
JESSICA: You're relentless.
TRISH: Well, I take that as a compliment.
JESSICA: Then you heard it wrong.
TRISH: Okay, try this. 'Thanks Trish, for fixing my door. It was very thoughtful of you, given there's a maniac on the loose.
JESSICA: Back off, all right? God, you're turning into your mother.
TRISH: Wow. Low blow, Jess. Even for you.
Jessica hangs up.
MAN: A lot of guys leave your office on stretchers, huh? Sorry about the noise last night. But you sure calmed Robyn down. Not even our parents could do that.
JESSICA: She's your sister?
MAN: We're twins. Fraternal.
Jessica looks back at the ambulance and notices something. She then looks back at the file for the bus crash.
MAN: You are very strong.
Jessica leaves.
CUT TO: SUBWAY
Jessica sits on a train.
PA: 42nd Street, Port Authority Bus Terminal. Next stop, 50th Street.
Jessica looks around at the various people on the train with her. She begins having flashbacks.
KILGRAVE: Come back here!
Jessica reflexively punches the window of the train, damaging it. The other passengers look at her.
JESSICA: Birch Street. Main Street. Higgins Drive. Cobalt Lane.
CUT TO: SIDEWALK
Jessica approaches a house.
WOMAN: Looking for something?
JESSICA: I'm looking for Jack Denton.
WOMAN: What do you want with him.
JESSICA: Just to talk, is he home?
WOMAN: Who are you?
JESSICA: I'm an investigator from city transit, I'm looking into an accident. A bus crash. Two ambulances were dispatched. Jack was the driver of one of them.
WOMAN: My Jackie's got nothing to say to you people. Turning your backs on him.
JESSICA: I know that Jack went to the accident scene, and then from there, he just drove off with the ambulance. He went AWOL. Never explained why.
WOMAN: You know a lot, huh?
JESSICA: It's my job to know things. I know that Jack was denied worker's comp because he stole the ambulance.
WOMAN: They got it back.
JESSICA: If I could understand what happened, I may be able to pull some strings and reverse the ruling.
WOMAN: Maybe God sent you. Maybe he didn't.
The woman lets Jessica inside. She brings him to Jack, who is immobilized and connected to a massive dialysis machine.
JESSICA: This wasn't in his file.
WOMAN: He had a stroke.
JESSICA: He's too young for a stroke.
WOMAN: They think his body went into shock after the surgery... When he donated his kidneys.
JESSICA: Kidneys, plural? Both of them?
WOMAN: So selfless and brave. After the shenanigans with the ambulance, Jackie disappeared for three weeks. Then I get a call from the hospital. They found him in an alley, half-dead because of his sacrifice. Oh, the Lord is an incredible maker of lives. For years, I prayed he's send Jack back home. I'd lost my son. He was on liquor all the time. So I prayed for his return, and here he is. My prayers were answered. Well, not like I had expected, surely. You can never see God coming. Pray with us.
JESSICA: . I'm just getting over a cold. Is he on that thing all the time? That looks expensive.
WOMAN: I think it is. An anonymous angel sent it to us. Some donor in the city, I don't know. But God bless him.
JESSICA: Could I trouble you for a glass of water?
WOMAN: Oh. Don't you be flirting with my boy. The woman leaves to get Jessica some water. Don't get him excited. I know the girls always liked him.
Jessica takes some pictures of the machine, and then turns to Jack.
JESSICA: God didn't do this. The devil did, and I'm gonna find him.
Jack starts making noises. He reaches for a pen, and Jessica picks up a pad of paper, holding it for him to write. He begins to scrawl the word 'KILL'.
JESSICA: Kilgrave, I know. Do you know where he is?
Jack finished writing, his full message reading 'KILL ME'. He then looks over at the large machine.
JESSICA: I can't.
Jack whimpers.
JESSICA: I can't do that.
WOMAN: You've upset him! It's okay Jackie, I'm here.
JESSICA: . I'm sorry.
WOMAN: God is with us. It's okay.
Jessica leaves.
CUT TO: JESSICA'S APARTMENT BUILDING
JESSICA: . It's a Baxter hemodialysis machine. Serial number's JX376F. Don't you have somebody on call for that in case of emergencies? What kind of service is that? . Fine. What time do you open? Have them give me a call. Yeah, at the number I gave you. Thank you.
The elevator opens. Out come Robyn and her brother. Jessica begins to get on.
MAN: Hi.
ROBYN: Hands off my brother, cougar. You're all alone, so you have to pick away at other people's happiness. You're not all that.
She begins to leave. Her brother doesn't follow her, so she grabs him.
ROBYN: Get over here!
JESSICA: Lady, you're a very perceptive asshole.
Robyn flicks her off. Cut to Jessica entering her apartment. After a few moments, someone knocks on her door. She opens it to reveal Gina.
GINA: Jessica Jones?
JESSICA: Can I help you?
GINA: Solve this, P.I. lady. Since my husband didn't hire you to follow me, who the hell did?
JESSICA: I'm sorry, I don't discuss cases.
GINA: You took pictures.
JESSICA: It's called 'private investigations' for a reason.
GINA: All I can think is you hired yourself to get rid of Luke's women, thin out the competition. You jealous? Some kind of stalker?
JESSICA: I'm not a stalker.
GINA: Luke said Andre knew. Course, he knows now that I asked him about it.
JESSICA: Look, I'm sorry that you screwed up your marriage, but -
GINA: You screwed it up, digging around. And all you've done is get Luke's ass kicked.
JESSICA: How's that?
GINA: You want him? You got him.
Gina turns to leave, but Jessica grabs her.
GINA: Ow!
JESSICA: Don't mess with me, lady.
GINA: Andre plays in a rugby league. He got his team buddies all worked up. Now they're headed to Luke's bar. Happy?
She leaves.
JESSICA: Shit.
CUT TO: LUKE'S BAR
ANDRE: You Luke?
ANDRE'S FRIEND: Andre, that's him.
Jessica arrives at the bar in a taxi. Andre and his friends are surrounding Luke.
LUKE: Guys, I don't want any problems. I just want you to leave the bar.
ANDRE'S FRIEND: You're gonna have to kick us out.
LUKE: Look, I don't want any trouble. Get out of the bar.
ANDRE: If you didn't want any trouble, you shouldn't have slept with my wife!
Andre throws a punch at Luke, who catches it. A fight breaks out. Jessica walks in to find Luke easily holding his own against six men. Jessica throws one of the men across the room, catching Luke's attention. The two of them effortlessly incapacitate the men.
ANDRE'S FRIEND: Psycho bitch!
Jessica throws him across the bar. Luke looks up in shock. Suddenly, Andre runs up to Luke and attempts to stab him in the neck with a glass shard, but it doesn't break Luke's skin.
ANDRE: It didn't cut...
Luke twists his arm and pushes his face into the bar.
LUKE: You're drunk. Your mind's not right. Go home to your wife.
ANDRE: You ruined my life.
LUKE: I'll do worse, I see your face again. Sleep it off, forget you were here. I'll do the same.
Luke lets him go. Andre and his friends leave the bar.
LUKE: What the hell was that?
JESSICA: Team work?
LUKE: . Free shots for everybody! . Get out of here. Shit's bad for business.
After a moment, Jessica leaves.
CUT TO: JESSICA'S APARTMENT
Jessica is asleep in bed. Her phone rings. She picks it up.
JESSICA: What? . Hi, yes. Yes, I did call about the kidney machine. Um, it's not... dialysizing. Yeah, I need to reach the person who leases the machine, so he can authorize the service. Yeah, hang on, just one second. Okay, Dr. David Kurata. Okay, thank you.
Jessica gets out of bed.
CUT TO: LECTURE HALL
Dr. David Kurata is teaching a class. Jessica enters.
KURATA: The average score of the multiple choice section was a staggering sixty two percent. So, if you don't know the difference between an allele and a chromosome by now, there's nothing I can do for you.
Kurata notices Jessica.
KURATA: The, uhh... Um... The short essay questions were worth five points each, um... but because there are six questions that account for twenty five percent...
Kurata suddenly bursts out of the room through the back exit. Jessica jumps up to chase him. He leads her through another classroom, a hallway in the school, down some stairs, and into a dark basement. Eventually she loses him.
JESSICA: Dr. Kurata? Look, you obviously think I'm going to do something to you. I'm not. You don't even know me. Okay, I'll start. You were the best transplant surgeon in the Tri-State Area, and now you're dissecting frogs with undergrads. You're hiding. Why?
KURATA: Is he here?
JESSICA: Who, Kilgrave? He's dead, according to the death certificate that you forged.
KURATA: Is he with you?
JESSICA: Why would he be with me?
KURATA: He had pictures of you. He was obsessed.
JESSICA: He's not here.
Kurata comes out of the shadows.
JESSICA: You did a surgery on the EMT, Jack Denton.
KURATA: He made me.
JESSICA: I know. Why? What shape was Kilgrave in? How badly hurt?
KURATA: One of his kidneys had been destroyed in an accident. The other one started to break down. It's known as crush syndrome.
JESSICA: So he grabbed you.
KURATA: The EMT did. I told Kilgrave that he could survive with one kidney, but he wanted to be made whole again.
JESSICA: Jack happened to be a match?
KURATA: Any kidney can work temporarily. He'll have to maim someone else in a couple years.
JESSICA: No other weaknesses, injuries?
KURATA: I've never seen such strong will. Ten hours of surgery, Kilgrave watched me the entire time.
JESSICA: He was awake? No anesthesia?
KURATA: He did the whole thing with an epidural. He refused to be put under.
JESSICA: He's a lot of things, and a masochist isn't one of them. He didn't want to be unconscious. But he sleeps.
KURATA: It's different. Surgical anesthesia, like Propofol or Sufentanil, it shuts down different functions.
JESSICA: That's it. That's his weakness.
Jessica takes out her phone and calls Hogarth's office.
JESSICA: Jeri Hogarth, please. . She's an attorney. You're gonna tell her what happened.
KURATA: No!
JESSICA: Yes! What exactly do you have left to lose?
KURATA: My mind.
HOGARTH: Hello.
JESSICA: I'm sorry, but this is happening. You're gonna help people again, starting with me. Hogarth, meet Dr. Kurata. . Start at the beginning.
CUT TO: PRISON
Hogarth walks down a hallway with an officer. He leads her to a room where Hope sits.
HOGARTH: I'm your new attorney. You should be more excited. You stick with the public defender that they've assigned you and you'll end up spending your next two lifetimes behind bars. Jessica Jones sent me. There is a possibility that your claims might be corroborated by another victim. Looks like you're a mascot for a macabre club.
HOPE: There are others? Besides Jessica?
HOGARTH: . Why don't you walk me through it, yeah?
CUT TO: JESSICA'S APARTMENT
Jessica cleans up her files on Kilgrave. She notices a large, brown, paper package. She puts it on her desk. She opens it, revealing a new window for her door. She pulls out her phone and calls Trish.
JESSICA: The font logo is different on the window.
TRISH: Well, I didn't see the old one.
JESSICA: It was different.
TRISH: The one I chose is better. I don't need your protection anymore.
JESSICA: I wasn't protecting you.
TRISH: You're cutting me out so you don't have to worry about me.
JESSICA: That's... not...
TRISH: Yeah, it is, and I'm telling you, don't. I don't need it. I don't want it.
JESSICA: Okay, well, in that case, do you wanna, you know, grab a drink or something?
Trish's nose begins to bleed into her water.
TRISH: Uhh, I left my trainer waiting. I'm exercising.
JESSICA: Yoga's not exercising, it's stretching.
TRISH: We'll grab lunch later this week, okay? I'll call you.
JESSICA: Okay.
TRISH: And I'm nothing like my mother.
JESSICA: You have her cheekbones.
TRISH: Nope. Nothing.
JESSICA: Look in the mirror.
TRISH: All right, so I'm a little like her.
JESSICA: Namaste.
Trish hangs up. She walks in another room, where her trainer is waiting.
TRISH: Let's do it again. I didn't get it right.
TRAINER: No, you had enough.
TRISH: No, I want to go again.
Her trainer pulls out a gun and pretends to mug her. Trish fights back, knocking him to the ground.
TRAINER: Nice, that was good.
TRISH: No, I heard it click, I would have died. Come on. Again.
They play out the same scenario again.
TRAINER: Nice, better.
CUT TO: APARTMENT BUILDING
Kilgrave approaches an apartment and knocks on the door. A man answers.
MAN: Yes?
KILGRAVE: You'd like to invite me in.
MAN: Absolutely.
Kilgrave walks in.
WOMAN: Honey, who's this?
KILGRAVE: I'm gonna be your guest here, indefinitely. You'll be delighted.
WOMAN: Great. Enjoy the view.
KILGRAVE: I intend to.
A child is playing with a toy car. Kilgrave crushes it under his foot.
SON: That's my car.
KILGRAVE: Children should be seen and not heard. Or better still, not seen and not heard. Get into that closet. . You too.
DAUGHTER: I have to go to the bathroom.
KILGRAVE: Go in the closet, it'll be fine.
Both kids get in the closet. Kilgrave closes the door, turning off the light.
WOMAN: What are you doing?
KILGRAVE: They'll be fine.
WOMAN: They'll be fine.
The girl in the closet can be heard whimpering as her pee leaks out from underneath.
KILGRAVE: What's for dinner?
MAN: Leg of lamb.
WOMAN: It's his specialty.
KILGRAVE: Let me decide that.
Kilgrave grabs a napkin while the woman pours him a glass of wine. He picks up and cleans a knife.
KILGRAVE: Be warned, I have a very particular palate.
CUT TO: JESSICA'S APARTMENT
Jessica brushes her teeth.
JESSICA:  My greatest weakness? Occasionally, I give a damn. And Kilgrave knows it.
A cockroach comes out of her sink.
JESSICA:  But now I know his.
She crushes the cockroach with her thumb.
JESSICA:  Game on.
Jessica walks into her office. Luke startles her.
LUKE: I saw you.
JESSICA: Well that's what happens when you break into someone's apartment when they're getting dressed.
LUKE: You tossed a man twice your size across the bar with one had.
JESSICA: Adrenaline kicked in.
LUKE: I saw you. And you saw me.
JESSICA: I don't know what I saw.
LUKE You know. You've known for a while.
JESSICA: You're wrong. That's not... I just went there to fix things.
Luke picks up a power saw. Jessica steps backwards. He turns it on, and then turns it on himself. Rather than cutting him, the saw breaks. Jessica walks over and feels where he put the saw on his abs.
LUKE: You can't fix me. I'm unbreakable.
