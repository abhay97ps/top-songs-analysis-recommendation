Over the mountain
Across the sea
There's a girl, she's waiting for me
Cross over the river, beyond every cloud
She's passed the wind that's blowing loud
Over the mountain, a girl waits for me
Tell all the sands and every blade of grass
Please tell the wind to let my love pass
Over the mountain, a girl waits for me
Tell the moon up in the sky
Tell the birds that fly by
That over and over and over the mountain
My love waits for me
Into each dark and starry night
Oh, what a mystery that's sealed so tight
Over the mountain, a girl waits for me
