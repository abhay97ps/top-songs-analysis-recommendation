THE GROOVIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD
Fun-n-Games
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la hey
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
There she was standing over by the telephone
Oh what a beautiful girl
Standing in the phone booth
Giving me a sweet look
Makes me want to give her a whirl
Hey little Judy in disguise
Lucy in the sky
Come fly with me in my balloon
Cause you're the grooviest girl in the world
You're a feminine portait of grace
You're the grooviest girl in the world
And I'm a guy with impeccable taste
Ah-yeah!
Walking such a long way
Talking to her all day
Sipping on a strawberry fizz
Playing with her long hair
Saying how much I care
Telling her how groovy she is
Hey little Judy in disguise
Lucy in the sky
Come fly with me in my balloon
Cause you're the grooviest girl in the world
You're a feminine portrait of grace
You're the grooviest girl in the world
And I'm a guy with impeccable taste
Ah-yeah!
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la hey
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Cause you're the grooviest girl in the world
You're a feminine portrait of grace
You're the grooviest girl in the world
And I'm a guy with impeccable taste
