Boy of my life, love of my own
Trust in me and you'll not be alone
Let it be sure there is a heaven
So let it be, I shall always love you
And if ever I seek out another
And you cry to me that my vows were untrue
Then may my heart be cast into stone
And may the world go blank when I moan
And if I come to you beggin' your help
And forgiveness that I looked on, may I walk alone
Here in your arms, kiss after kiss
I shall live just for moments like this
And the more I said, "Be in pleasure"
Forever mine, baby, only for you
And if someday the voice of a stranger
Comes beckoning and I say, "We are through"
Then may my heart be cast into stone
And may the world go blank when I moan
And may I walk down the dark street of sorrow
Without you to take me home, may I walk alone
If the end of the earth comes tomorrow
And we've only a moment or two
If you spend them alone and in sorrow
'Cause I am afraid to die loving you
Then may my heart be cast into stone
And may the world go blank when I moan
And may I walk down the dark street of sorrow
Without you to take me home, may I walk alone
Then may my heart be cast into stone
And may the world go blank when I moan
And may I walk down the dark street of sorrow
