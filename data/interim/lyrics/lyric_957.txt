Look in my eyes,and tell me you love me
Tell me you love me, or darling I'll be gone
Look in my eyes,and tell me that you're the
One for me, and that our love will always be
Or darling I'll be gone 
You said it that time
So glad you're all mine
What's it to be? Do you wanna be?
And let me know,a little more time
Have that love to be ,or darling set me free
Look in my eyes,and tell me you love me
Tell me you love me or darling all be gone
Do-oooo di,di,di,di,di
Do-oooo di,di,di,di,di
