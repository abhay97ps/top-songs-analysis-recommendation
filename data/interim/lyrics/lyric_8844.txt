When I was a child
I thought as a child
I spoke as a child
I didn't know better, better
But now I'm a man
I look like a man
I'm old as a man
And I should know better, better
Got my head in the sky
And my mind knows what it wants
But my body just drags me down
And my world is something you can't see
But it's still very real to me
You can find it in the hole where I keep my soul
There it is - way down inside me
There's a real man
Forget about my body and be a real man
I see with my heart
I hear with my heart
I feel with my heart
Sometimes it works better, better
And some so-called friends put me down
And they pity me for trying
Bad emotions push me around
But the vision shines on and on
It will shine when we all are gone
And I'd like to add a little sparkle while I'm here
Light it up - way down inside me
There's a real man, a real man
Forget about bad feelings and be a real man
Some men's world is only hate and money
Afraid of everything and they laugh at nothing
And they only live to criticize
You can laugh at me now 
But the time comes to everybody
When you must decide
When that day finally comes along
You might wish you'd been a little more strong
Then you'll wake up in the morning cryin' "Oh my God"
There it is - way down inside me
It's a real man
You got to grow up sometime
Be a real man, a real man
Suffer them slings and arrows
Be a real man
Now be a real man
Don't sell yourself for nothing
Be a real man, be a real man
Don't take no crap from no one
Be a real man, be a real man
Get your trip together
Be a real man, be a real man
