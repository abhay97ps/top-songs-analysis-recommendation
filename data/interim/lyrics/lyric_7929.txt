I looked around my town this mornin'
I took a walk through my neighborhood
Well it, it came without a warnin'
Mmmm, I just started feelin' good
I went walkin' in the bright sunshine
It was bringin' in a brand new day
The breeze was blowin' so sweet and so fine
It was blowin' all my troubles away
Well it's a little bit like magic
You're as free as you want to be
It's a little bit like magic
Take a look around, I think you'll see
Well now my walks each day can take me out of the shadows
Leave behind a shade of grey
What happened yesterday, well it really don't matter
What I'm trying to say: you can find a way
Get out on your way, living the magic today
Well it's a little bit like magic
Take a look around
I think you'll see
Yeah it's a little bit like magic
You're just as free as you want to be
Yeah it's a little bit like magic
Take a look around
I think you'll see, yeah
Yeah it's a little bit like magic
You're as free as you want to be
It's a little bit like magic
It's just a little bit like magic
Mmmm, a little bit like magic
It's a little bit like magic
