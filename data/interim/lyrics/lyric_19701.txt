It was just another story printed on the second page, underneath the Tiger's football score
It said he was only eighteen, a boy about my age
They found him face down on his bedroom floor
There'll be services on Friday at the Lawrence Funeral Home, then out on Mooresville Highway, they'll lay him 'neath a stone
How do you get that lonely?
How do you hurt that bad to make you
Make the call that having no life at all is better than the life that you had?
How do you feel so empty you want to let it all go?
How do you get that lonely and nobody know?
Did his girlfriend break up with him?
Did he buy or steal that gun?
Did his mom and daddy forget to say "I love you, son?"
Did no one see the writing on the wall?
I'm not blamin' anybody
We all do the best we can
I know hindsight's 20/20
But I still don't understand
How do you get that lonely?
How do you hurt that bad to make you
Make the call that having no life at all was better than the life that you had?
How do you feel so empty you want to let it all go?
How do you get that lonely and nobody know?
