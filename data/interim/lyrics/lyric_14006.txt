So long ago
Certain place
Certain time
You touched my hand
On the way
On the way down to Emmeline
But if our paths never cross
Well, you know I'm sorry, but
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's edge
So it's hard to find
Someone with that kind of intensity
You touched my hand, I played it cool
And you reached out your hand to me
But if our paths never cross
Well, no, I'm not sorry, but
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's edge
So long ago
It's a certain time
It's a certain place
You touched my hand and you smiled
All the way back you held out your hand
If I hope and if I pray
Ooh, it might work out someday
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
If I live to see the seven wonders 
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end 
I'll never live to match the beauty again 
If I live to see the seven wonders 
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
If I live to see the seven wonders
