L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna?
I see you coming and I don’t wanna know your name
I see you coming and you’re gonna have to change the game
Would you like to try? Give me a reason why
Give me all that you got
Maybe you’ll do fine as long as you don’t lie to me
And pretend to be what you’re not
Don’t play the stupid game
'Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Give me all your love today
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Let’s forget about time, and dance our lives away
L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna?
Keep trying, don’t give up, that’s if you want it bad enough
It’s right in front of you, now tell me what you're thinking of
In another place, at a different time
You can be my lucky star
We can drink some wine, Burgundy is fine
Let’s drink the bottle every drop
Don’t play the stupid game
'Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Give me all your love today
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Let’s forget about time, and dance our lives away
Give me all your love, boy
You can be my boy, you can be my boy toy
In the nick of time, I can say a sicker rhyme
'Cause it's time for change, like a nickel or a dime
Ugh, I'm Roman, I'm a barbarian, I'm Conan
You was sleeping on me, you were dozin'
Now move, I'm goin' in
You have all the L-U-V
I gave you everything you need 
Now it’s up to Y-O-U
Are you the one? Shall we proceed?
Move, it! Licks
I’m some swag shit, no one gives you this
It’s supersonic, bionic, uranium hit
So I break ‘em off tricks, let’s pray that it sticks
I'mma say this once, yeah, I don't give a shit
Don’t play the stupid game
'Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Gimme all your love today
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Let’s forget about time, and dance our lives away
