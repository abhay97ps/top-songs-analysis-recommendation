Was born in a funk factory, born in a funk factory
Workin' hard like a slave, y'all, comin' up short on my pay, y'all
Some men are stockers, came on the go, yeah
But all I will see in my lifetime, y'all
Was a bass, a drum, my funky home
Born in a funk factory, workin' like a slave
Comin' up short on my pay
Somebody tell me what's goin' on wrong
All I've known to do in my lifetime
Was to scream, gripe, grump & groan
Some men are stockers, came on the go, yeah
But all I will see in my lifetime, y'all
Was a bass, a drum, my funky home
Oh I'm gonna tell you
I'm satisfied, y'all, I'm satisfied, y'all
