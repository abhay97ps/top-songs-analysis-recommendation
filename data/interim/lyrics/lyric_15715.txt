There's a shadow on my window
Visions in my head
I wonder why
I wonder
Feel your spirit on my skin
Hands across my heart
Love begins
In splendor
Sayonara dreams
Sayonara dreams
Hey hey hey hey
Sometimes I feel it's a natural thing
Sometimes I feel it's a spiritual thing
Sometimes I feel it's physical
Sometimes I feel it's a mystical thing
Sometimes I feel it's a visible thing
Sometimes I feel like
I'm kissing the wind
Under the influence
Of R.E.M. again
A never ending journey for my soul
Sayonara dreams
Sayonara dreams
Hey hey hey hey
Sometimes I feel it's a natural thing
Sometimes I feel it's a spiritual thing
Sometimes I feel it's physical
Sometimes I feel it's a mystical thing
Sometimes I feel it's a visible thing
Sometimes I feel like
I'm kissing the wind
Only you can save my soul tonight
Take me on this timeless flight
Only you can lead me
To the purest light
It abounds in you
It abounds in me
Hey hey hey hey
Sometimes I feel it's a natural thing
Sometimes I feel it's a spiritual thing
Sometimes I feel it's physical
Sometimes I feel it's a mystical thing
Sometimes I feel it's a visible thing
Sometimes I feel like
I'm kissing the wind
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Kissing the wind
