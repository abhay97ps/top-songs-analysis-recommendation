I'll be expecting you to get a haircut by Friday
Forget it dad, that won't change anything
Forget, nothing, you'll do as I say as long as you are living in my house!
He knows I'm not feeling well
And yet he doesn't take out one second out to help his mother
His only concern is for himself
Come on ma, what do you want from me?
Don't argue with your mother, just shut up and listen!
But mom, all my friends will be there
I said no, you can't go
But why?
I don't want you in that neighborhood?
Why, what's wrong with that neighborhood?
I don't like the kind of people living there
What's wrong with them?
Never mind, some day you will thank me
Are you sure no one kept you company tonight while you were baby sitting?
What's that supposed to mean?
Just curious
Admit it mom, you don't trust me
Where are you going now
To my friend's house
Don't you have things to do in the house?
Don't you have any homework?
Why don't you sit down and read a book?
Oh ma
Don't 'oh ma' me
You're wasting your life away with foolish things
What are you talking about?
How about your bridge club and your ladies groups?
And your parties and your daytime programs?
How about all that?
That's different
Ma, I'll be home at 11
You better be home at 10 or don't bother to come home at all
When I was your age, I was working 12 hours a day
6 days a week helping to pay for the food and the rent
I don't understand, what's that got to do with me?
If you can't figure that out for yourself, you're stupid!
Hey dad, did you see my new guitar, I joined a group
Son, there's a little bit more to life than joining a group and playing a guitar
Yeah dad, what is there to life 
Mr Cook?
Yes
Do you have a son named Robin, Robin Cook aged 17?
Yes
I'm sorry Mr Cook, you better come down to the station house
Your son is dead
Dead? How?
He died of a overdose
Oh my god
