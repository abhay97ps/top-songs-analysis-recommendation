She said, I never thought I'd see you here
Hangin' on this side of town
What's it been, about a year?
Yeah, boy, look at you now
I heard you got a new job
Things are takin' off
Just like I thought they would
I said it's all good
But you should see the other guy that's missin' you
Late at night, he's wishin' you would come back home
Girl, he can't move on
And his heart still takes a beatin'
Just livin' with your leavin'
Yeah, it might look like I'm doin' alright
But you should see the other guy
As far as anyone can see
Things are lookin' up these days
Only let 'em see this side of me
The one that's got it made
Doin' everything I know to do
To keep thе truth
From runnin' through my mind
Yeah, I'm doin' fine
But you should see the othеr guy that's missin' you
Late at night, he's wishin' you would come back home
Girl, he can't move on
And his heart still takes a beatin'
Just livin' with your leavin'
Yeah, it might look like I'm doin' alright
But you should see the other guy
But you should see the other guy that's missin' you
Late at night, he's wishin' you would come back home
Girl, he can't move on
And his heart still takes a beatin'
Just livin' with your leavin'
Yeah, it might look like I'm doin' alright
It might look like I'm doin' alright
But you should see the other guy
Oh, you should see the other guy
