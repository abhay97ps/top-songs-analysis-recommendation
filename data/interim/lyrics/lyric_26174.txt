White churches, black churches
Different people, same hearses
It's kinda hard to fight with each other
Layin' down in the ground six under
At every show I see my people
They ain't the same, but they're all equal
One love, one God, one family
You're missing every color if you're only seeing black and white
Tell me how you're gonna change your mind if your heart's unmovable
We ain't that different from each other, from one to another
I look around and see worldwide beautiful
Thank God, thank God, thank God
Thank God, thank God, thank God
Oh, thank God, thank God, thank God
Thank God, thank God, thank God
Coast to coast, city to city
Reach out your hands if you're with me
Still got some work but we still got a dream
Every shade, every heart, come together and sing
Oh, thank God, thank God, thank God
Thank God, thank God, thank God 
You're missing every color if you're only seeing black and white
Tell me how you're gonna change your mind if your heart's unmovable
We ain't that different from each other, from one to another
I look around and see worldwide beautiful
One love, one God, one family 
One love, one God, one family
One love, one God, one family 
One love, one God, one family 
You're missing every color if you're only seeing black and white
Tell me how you're gonna change your mind if your heart's unmovable 
We ain't that different from each other from one to another, I
Look around and see worldwide beautiful
Look around and see worldwide beautiful 
Look around and see worldwide beautiful
Worldwide beautiful 
Look around and see worldwide beautiful
