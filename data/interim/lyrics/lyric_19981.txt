Don't waste your time looking over your shoulder
Those loves from the past aren’t getting no closer
When I look in my future you're all I can see
Don't go loving on nobody but me
Nobody but me going to love you like you ought to be loved on
Nobody but me going to cry if you up and leave
You can do what you want to
But I'm asking pretty please  don’t go loving on nobody but me
I took my time to tell you how I feel
Just because I took so long don't mean that it isn't real
I ain't got no diamond, but I'm down on my knees
Don't go loving on nobody but me
Nobody but me going to love you like you ought to be loved on
Nobody but me going to cry if you up and leave
You can do what you want to
But I'm asking pretty please  don’t go loving on nobody but me
Nobody but me going to love you like you ought to be loved on
Nobody but me going to cry if you up and leave
You can do what you want to
But I'm asking pretty please  don’t go loving on nobody but me
Don't go loving on nobody but me
