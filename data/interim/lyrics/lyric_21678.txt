Any way you want it, that's the way you need it
Any way you want it 
She loves to laugh, she loves to sing, she does everything
She loves to move, she loves to groove, she loves the lovin' things
It won't be long, yeah, 'til you're alone
When your lover , oh, he hasn't come home 
'Cause he's lovin' , he's touchin' 
Any way you want it, that's the way you need it
Any way you want it 
He said, any way you want it, that's the way you need it
Any way you want it 
Na na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na
I was alone, I never knew what good love could do
Then we touched, then we sang about the lovely things
'Cause he's lovin' , he's touchin' 
He's squeezin' another 
Any way you want it, that's the way you need it
Any way you want it 
He said, any way you want it, that's the way you need it
Any way you want it 
Na na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na
Any way you want it, that's the way you need it
Any way you want it 
He said, any way you want it, that's the way you need it
Any way you want it 
Any way you want it, that's the way you need it
Any way you want it...
Na na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na...
Any way you want it, that's the way you need it!
