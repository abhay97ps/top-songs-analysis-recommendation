Nick Wiz ft. Native Assassins - “Hardcore”
Hardcore?!?  Hardcore?!?
Hardcore?!?  Hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?
Hardcore?!?  Hardcore?!?
Hardcore?!?  Hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?
Hardcore?!?   hardcore!  
Hardcore!   hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?
Hardcore?!?   hardcore!  
Hardcore!   hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?
Where is
The ones who bit my style to the final crumbs?!?  I’m burning brothers
By the bags and snatch the breath from your lungs!  Niggas be
Talking ‘bout their guns and whatnot, couldn’t starе in my
Bloodshot eyes and tell thosе lies, so just stop, kid!
I got ‘nough spots to blow up!  Emcees self-destruct
When they duplicate the product—what?!?  The madness
Is drastic, bastards!  Niggas are wishing
They stayed inside their father’s prophylactic!  My style
Unorthodox when I hold the reefer, and the litters couldn’t compete
With where my cold stone blacker than Jesus’ skin!  On the real
I dare you bring a mortal in!  I’ll rip him from the seams
And watch his dreams shatter like porcelain!  Word to the black
Heart beating in my chest, I’m kind of vexed at the
Pseudo-rebels going pop like blood vessels
I thought you knew!  You had to get burnt to learn the rule
Enter my zone, I’m fucking up your dome like Catholic schools
I don’t be bullshitting, I’m real like AIDS for always
So turn the page and watch the phrase jump through like gamma rays
Keeping out of TECs/text, verbally, we duel to death
Your soul is laid to rest like two lyrical shots up in your chest
Hardcore?!?   hardcore!  
Hardcore!   hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?
Hardcore?!?   hardcore!  
Hardcore!   hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?
Third Reich is steaming, my blood is reaching its boiling point
My eyes turn red as vessels steadily burst in my head
I despise hearing all of these lies.  You might as well be
A reporter for that Inquiring Mind.  This real
Shit sticks in your brain like Jesus’s thorns.  Your mother’s
Heart is torn from all the bullshit that you’ve sworn
Emcees fall off the shelf like Barbie dolls at Toy “R” Us, I pick them up
I lace the blunt, now I’m smoking ‘em like angel dust
Ain’t gotta trust the truth’ll set you free.  Emcees are shackled
Like slaves to their lies—don’t ever try to run from me
You’ve been caught out there like a fag in drag.  Now emcees
Skip, tag, play Hot Peas and Butter, and let their pants sag
Taking your own life on the microphone?  Please stay home
It’s not right to commit suicide in the public’s eye
Real emcees are rarely spotted like the Bigfoot
Tourist attraction like the Loch Ness Monster in my neighborhood
Hardcore?!?   hardcore!  
Hardcore!   hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?
Hardcore?!?   hardcore!  
Hardcore!   hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?
I inject
Terror in bloodstreams like heroine, go the full nine
Keep peddling, severing any heads involved in meddling
Deep internal affairs, press guys I never cleared
Imitators false as breast implants: beware!
Chairs break fan, thoughts like atmosphere polluted
Where’s the gat?!?  Here’s the gat—now shoot it!
I dare you, punk!  I dare you front with a straight face
Bite the bullet, hide the taste of full clips, boots they lace
To step on bullshit
Looking in the toilet at another trash emcee
I’m vexed, living like 
Mass hysteria air-raids your area 
Bow down and praise the immortal warlord descended
From the Heavens, bringing Armageddon, nuclear war
Aftermath, wackness is burnt in the backdraft
So get your vaccination for the plague—I’m like the flu
Hardcore?!?   hardcore!  
Hardcore!   hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?
Hardcore?!?   hardcore!  
Hardcore!   hardcore?!?  Are you sure?!?
