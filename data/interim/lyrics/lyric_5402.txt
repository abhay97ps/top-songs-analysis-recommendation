Hmm, closer
I wanna be closer to you
Closer
Like to be close to you, baby
(I like to get close
To the one I love)
Oh, baby
I like to get close
To the one I love
So I slow drag
My girl, she asked me
How come I don't do the boogaloo
I told her, baby
'Cause I can't get close
Enough to you
I told her
That's the only dance
That I like to do
It's a dance
I can hold her yet
Steal a little kiss or two
Oh, baby
I like to get close
To the one I love
So I slow drag
And I want to slow down
With you, baby
I like to close
To the one I love
So I slow drag
My girl
She asked me out to the party
Her friends told her
That I was a drag 
Just because I don't do the dance
The way they want me to
Can't they see
That I'm in a different bag
Oh, baby
I like to get close
To the one I love
So I slow drag
And I want to slow down
With you, baby
I like to close
To the one I love
So I slow drag
Ooh, hold me close
Hold me closer to you
And all you got to do
Is squeeze me, baby
And hold me closer to you
Oh, baby
I like to get close
To the one I love
So I slow drag
And I want to slow down
With you, baby
I like to close
To the one I love
So I slow drag
I like to close
To the one I love
So I slow drag
I like to close
To the one I love
So I slow drag
I like to close
To the one I love
So I slow drag
