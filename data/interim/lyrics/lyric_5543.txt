There's a young man that I know, his age is twenty-one
Comes from down in southern Colorado
Just out of the service and he's looking for his fun
Someday soon, going with him someday soon
My parents cannot stand him cause he rides the rodeo
My father says that he will leave me cryin'
I would follow him right down the toughest road I know
Someday soon, going with him someday soon
And when he comes to call
My pa ain't got a good word to say
Guess it's cause he's just as wild in his younger days
So blow, you old blue northern, blow my love to me
He's driving in tonight from California
He loves his damned old rodeo as much as he loves me
Someday soon, going with him someday soon
When he comes to call, my pa ain't got a word to say
Guess it's cause he's just as wild in his younger days
Blow, you old blue northern, blow my love to me
He's driving in tonight from California
He loves his damned old rodeo as much as he loves me
Someday soon, going with him someday soon
Someday soon, going with him ... someday soon
