This is where I wanna be boy

This is where I wanna be boy
This is where I wanna be boy
I wanna take a moment to talk to you
'Cause I'm about to turn away and give up on our thing
But you remain a sweet reminder of where I wanna be boy
In the arms of a man that's strong and wants to give it to me
Boy I'm really trying but givin' up's so hard to do
Listening to my friends tell me I'm a fool for you
You're the type of guy that dreams are made of
I wanna be what you want when you want and whenever you need me baby
This is where I wanna be boy
This is where I wanna be boy
This is where I wanna be boy
This is where I wanna be boy
Where I want to be
I'm right here and you're with me
Yeah, yeah, come on, come on
I'm lookin for a reason and I already know the deal
Time and time again I try to ask myself
"Is my baby for real?"
Please won't you level with me?
Because I want to let you know that
I finally made up my mind
And it's where I wanna be
Right here by your side
Giving you the friend you need
You know I try
I do all I can just to make you happy
Won't make no demands on your time
And once you get it, boy
I'm sure that you will find that this is
I want to be right here in your arms
You and me, I want to stay here
Come on, come on
You know what I'm talking about
'Cause it's where I wanna boy
Are you where you want to be boy?
Are y'all where you want to be, y'all?
Are we where we want to be, y'all?
Come on, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing it, sing it with me...
