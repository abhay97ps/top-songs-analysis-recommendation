I just lay here at night
Toss and I turn
Lovin' you so
How my heart yearns
You're the reason
I don't sleep at night 
Walkin' the floor
Feelin' so blue
Smoke cigarettes
Drink coffee, too
You're the reason
I don't sleep at night 
I'm bettin'
You're not losin' sleep over me
But if I'm wrong
Don't fail to call
You can keep me company 
Sometimes I go for a walk
Take a look at the moon
Strum my guitar
Sing a love tune
Honey, you're the reason
I don't sleep at night 
I'm bettin'
You're not losin' sleep over me
But if I'm wrong
Don't fail to call
You can keep me company 
Sometimes I go for a walk
Take a look at the moon
Strum my guitar
And sing a love tune
Honey, you're the reason
I don't sleep at night 
You're the reason
You're the reason
You're the reason
You're the reason
You're the reason
