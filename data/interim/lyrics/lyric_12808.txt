I know what you're doing
You don't want to put the hurt on someone
You've been trying to convince yourself
You're better off if you just turn and run
But I'm gonna hold on tight
I've got a feeling
You'll only happen once to me
And no one, not even you
Is ever gonna make you wrong for me
Don't Walk Away
Or are you looking for a price to pay
Is that your master plan
Don't Walk Away
I'll do everything to make you stay
I've got to make a stand
Don't Walk Away
I'm not afraid
Don't Walk Away
I don't know where you're going
But I know what you've got on your mind
And I think your fear is showing
You don't leave things like fear behind
And I hate to be the one
To break it to you that
We're only human after all
I can mend a broken wing
I'll give you everything I have
Don't Walk Away
Or are you looking for a price to pay
Is that your master plan
Don't Walk Away
I'll do everything to make you stay
I've got to make a stand
Don't Walk Away
I'm not afraid
Don't Walk Away
You used to be the one
Who used to be so strong
What happened to your rationale
Your heart is on the line
It happens all the time
Don't Walk Away
Don't Walk Away
Don't Walk Away
Or are you looking for a price to pay
Is that your master plan
Don't Walk Away
I'll do everything to make you stay
I've got to make a stand
Don't Walk Away
I'm not afraid
Don't Walk Away
