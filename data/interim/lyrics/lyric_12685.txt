Your love's  so good 
Deserves an encore 
Your love's  so good 
You deserve an encore 
Your love's  so good 
Deserves an encore 
Your love's  so good 
You deserve an encore 
Going to a show tonight
After working hard 9 to 5
Not talking 'bout a movie, no
Or a Broadway play, this show is live
And I know it's you I want to see tonight
I'll buy my ticket at the door if it's  alright
Your love's  so good 
Deserves an encore 
Your love's  so good 
You deserve an encore 
Your love's  so good 
Deserves an encore 
Your love's  so good 
You deserve an encore 
And I know it's you I want to see tonight
I'll buy my ticket at the door if it's  alright
I can give you rave reviews
'Cause you sold out my heart with love
And every time that I'm with you
Boy, you take control, I'm your captive audience
And I know it's you I want to see tonight
I'll buy my ticket at the door if it's  alright
Your love's  so good 
Deserves an encore 
Your love's  so good 
You deserve an encore 
Your love's  so good 
Deserves an encore 
Your love's  so good 
You deserve an encore 
Can't get enough, ooh
Of your gentle loving touch
I can't get enough
So intense, it drives me nuts
Makes me want to break it down now
Feels so good, feels so good
It deserves an encore
