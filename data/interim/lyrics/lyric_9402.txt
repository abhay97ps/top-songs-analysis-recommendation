There's a church house, gin house
Schoolhouse, outhouse
On US 19
Hey, the people keep the city clean
They call it Nutbush
Ah, Nutbush

Up in

No whiskey for sale
Can't find a female
Salt pork and molasses
All you gonna get if you end in jail

Say it again!
Little old town, oh, down in Tennessee:
A quiet little ol' community
A real quiet, real southern community
Nothing much ever happens in Nutbush
You can hear the corn grow
You got to watch out for the police
You're driving through Nutbush
You better watch out for the police
If you're driving through Nutbush
You got to watch out for the police
Eye for the police
Keep an eye for the police
Keep an eye for the police
Eye for the police!
Oh!
Nutbush city limits!
Nutbush city limits!
Nutbush city limits!
Stay alive!
