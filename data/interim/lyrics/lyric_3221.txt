Yes, I'm sitting right here
Waiting for a-you my dear
Wondering if a-you ever
Gonna show up
I don't know if you gonna show
My darling I got to go
But never-the-less, I said
You got-a me waitin'
Sitting here on the bench
With my back against the fence
Wonderin' if I have any sense
Somethin' tells me I'm a fool
To let you treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, I say again
You got-a me waiting
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Oh why, oh why?
Won't you tell me why?
Oh, my darling I said-a right now
Good girl
I wanna know why?
Why?
Sitting here on the bench
With my back against the fence
Wondering if I have any sense
Somethin' tells me I'm a fool
Let you treat me so cruel
Never-the-less, I said
You got-a me waiting
Hope I'm not gonna wait
I am tired of waiting
No longer gonna wait, girl
Any longer
I'm tired of waiting
Oh Lord, I'm not a-gonna wait
No
No longer gonna wait, child
