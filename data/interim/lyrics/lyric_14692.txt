 Girl, words can't express the way I feel for you
 The way you hold me, the way you touch me
 Girl, everything you do to me, you know I like it
 Don't stop now
 Ooh, hey
 Oh, oh, oh 
 Ooh, hey
 Oh, oh, oh 
My dreams are now reality
Each and every time you are here with me
The touch you give me with your hands
When you caress my skin, I'm under your command
Girl, you hypnotize me with your eyes
It took me some time , but now I realize
It's you to whom which I belong
I love it, the feeling's getting strong
 The things you do to me
 It brings out ecstasy
 It really turns me on 
 The feeling's getting strong 
Oh, girl, you are my lover
When I'm with you, there is no other
A spell you got me under
Please don't you leave, I'm on my hands and knees
Words can't express the way I feel
Emotions for you are so real 
Girl, you love me over and over again
Don't stop, please don't let it end
 The things you do to me
 It brings out ecstasy
 It really turns me on 
 The feeling's getting strong 
You know I love it
Hey, girl, you know I care
Sugar, you know I love it, baby
Ooh, woah 
Oh, oh, oh
Baby, I like it
 Sugar, I love you

 I like it 
 Infatuation turns to like, like turns to love
 Oh, baby, you keep me safe and warm 
 I like it, hey, baby, I like it, oh, sugar 
 I like it, pretty baby, baby, come and give it to me 
 Oh, oh, oh, ooh 
 I like it 
 I like it, hey, baby, I like it, oh, baby 
 I like it 
 I like the way you wear your hair 
 I like the stylish clothes you wear 
 The way you kiss me, how you moan 
 Give me all your love, girl, all night long 
 I like it, hey, baby, I like it, oh, sugar
