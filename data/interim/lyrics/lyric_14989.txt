Every time I close my eyes
I can clearly see the image of your smile
Shine through my darkest dreams
I never thought that I'd find myself this close, this close
To you, my dear, tell me what it means
I can feel your sweet caress wash away all the loneliness
That I once felt inside my heart
Boy, if you could read my mind I'm sure that you would find
What you've been searching for, what you've been searching for
Free me from despair , there's so much to share
If you surrender to me
Whisper in my ears words I long to hear
Woo ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh
Boy, I got to have your love
You know, you know, you know I need your love
Boy, I got to have your love
You know, you know, you know I need your love, ooh
You're like an angel in disguise
I feel like I'm in heaven when you walk my way
You're such a mystery 
The butterflies I feel inside must be , must be 
A sign of love, no one can disagree
My desire for your love is like a new horizon
Only lovers see like you and I, I
Sacred love will be the start to sacred nights, our hearts
I'll love you 'til my dying day, until my dying day
Free me from despair , there's so much to share
If you surrender to me 
Whisper in my ears words I long to hear
Oh oh whoa whoa oh
Boy, I got to have your love
You know, you know, you know I need your love
Boy, I got to have your love
You know, you know, you know I need your love
Boy, I got to have your love
You know, you know I need your love
Boy, I got to have your love
You know, you know, you know I need your love
Free me  from despair
I want your love, got to have your love
Whisper  in my ears
Got to find a way to get into your heart
Tell me  that you are mine
Boy, I've got to have your love
Free me from despair, yeah
There's so much to share
Whisper in my ear
