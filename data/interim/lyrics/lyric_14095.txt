There was the time
We thought our dream was over
When you and I
Had surely reached the end
Still here we are
The flame as strong as ever
All because we both kept holding on
We know we can weather any storm
Baby, that's what love is all about
Two hearts, that find a way, somehow
To keep the fire burning
It's something we could never live without
If it takes forever we can work it out
Beyound a shadow of a doubt
Baby, that's what love is all about
As time goes by we've learnd to rediscover
The reason why this dream of our survives
Through thick and thin we're destined for each other
Knowing we can reach the other side
Far beyound the mountains of our pride
Baby, that's what love is all about
Two hearts, that find a way, somehow
To keep the fire burning
It's something we could never live without
If it takes forever we can work it out
Beyound a shadow of a doubt
Baby, that's what love is all about
Ooh ridin' the good times is easy
The hard times can tear you apart
There'll be times in your heart
When the feelin' is gone
But you keep on believing
And you keep holdin' on
Baby, that's what love is all about
Two hearts that find a way, somehow
To keep the dream from dying
It's something we could never live without
If it takes forever we can, we can work it out
Beyound a shadow of a doubt
Baby, that's what love is all about
