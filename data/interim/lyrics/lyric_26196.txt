I need a fuckin'
This shit not smokin'
Alright, yeah
Top ten, if you don't agree, I'm on your ass , uh
R.I.P to 24, now my foot on the gas , yeah
This shit was given to me, I ain't choose it
Tried to make life and somehow I made a movie
The only rapper who can go on the road and don't fuck with no groupies
If it don't make sense or dollars
I ain't got no time, can't holla
I just got off the plane from Ghana
And my airport clothes, they Prada
I work harder than all the rest
And I'm wishin' you all the best
I got bags from all the stress
Now, all my bags belong on jets, yes
So many war wounds, I had to make more tunes
Gotta cancel these niggas, they cancers
Couldn't even enjoy June
But I'm a livin' walkin' fun guy
Even though I had some tough times
Made my bed on the frontline
One time for the
One time for the one time
I fought the fight 
Rolled up the dice 
Bet on my life 
Paid the price
Take no advice 
I've been in the field and I know my wrongs
I know my rights 
I fought the fight 
Rolled up the dice 
Bet on my life 
Paid the price 
Take no advice 
I've been in the field and I know my wrongs
I know my rights 
Top five, if you don't agree
Go check the numbers, too many can't run with me
I'm makin' moves that's gon' take care of my family
She did me dirty and fucked up my sanity
Bitches can't handle me, I'm like an animal
Eat it like Hannibal, she got the stamina
She clean the mess up, I keep the checks up
We gon' get checkups, gotta stay healthy
Already rich, now I'm tryna get wealthy
I didn't reply back, but they get the message
Not sayin' I'm the best, but I go like the vest
Seen these chains on my neck, AP water, baguette
I'm ahead of the feds, keep my head on my neck
Put my foot in your ass, I done ran out of passes to give
This shit get passive for real
I keep on passin' on deals, one day I'ma chill
One day, I'ma get me a spot in the Hills
But until, I'm servin' these packs
Keep on murderin' tracks, keep on rollin' the dice
Got my life in this shit, I'ma ride
I can't switch, I'll die for this shit
Bust down both of my wrists
At 11:11, make both us some riches
Yeah, we both will get rich
And we never could split
Now I look up, we the GOATs of this shit
I fought the fight 
Rolled up the dice 
Bet on my life 
Paid the price 
Take no advice 
I've been in the field and I know my wrongs
I know my rights 
I fought the fight 
Rolled up the dice 
Bet on my life 
Paid the price 
Take no advice 
I've been in the field and I know my wrongs
I know my rights
