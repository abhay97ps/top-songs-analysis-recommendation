On the dance floor , no panties in the way 
I take my time with it , bring you close to me 
Don't want no young dumb shit

I was tryna lay low , takin' it slow 
When I'm fuckin' again 
Gotta celebrate, do you man look good? Better put him away
If you can't sweat the weave out, you shouldn't even be out
Dinner reservations like the pussy, you gon' eat out

Titties out like blaka 
Broke bitches watch out now

Tonight and after that
