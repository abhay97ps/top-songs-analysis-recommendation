Oh! Ho! Ho!
When we kiss, pretty miss, pretty miss, I'm in ecstasy
Cat-er-eeen- a
Oh! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
But when we kiss, pretty miss, pretty miss, are you thinking of me?
Cat-er-eeen-a
Ah! Ha! Ha!
Just how long is the list, is the list, of the lips you've kissed?
Oh how happy my heart would be
If I knew that you loved just me
Say it's true
Say you do
