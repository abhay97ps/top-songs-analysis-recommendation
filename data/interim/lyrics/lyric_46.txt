Now when I see you walking by with a wiggle walk
You know you look mighty good oowee
And baby you can talk the kind of talk
That does funny things to me
Now when you tell me that you love me so
It thrills my heart uh honey don't ya know
That when you're in my arms oohoo
It feels mighty good to me
Do I love to love you?
Awww honey yes indeed
Cuz anything that you're missing
Believe me honey you don't need
Well everytime I get to kiss your tender lips
You know they taste mighty good oowee
When you're in my arms my heart just flips
Ooohoo what you're doin' to me
Now the kind of love that you inspire
Fills my heart with a warm desire
And when you set my lips on fire
It feels mighty good to me
Do I love to love you?
Awww honey yes indeed
Cuz anything that you're missing
Believe me honey you don't need
Well everytime I get to kiss your tender lips
You know they taste mighty good oowee
When you're in my arms my heart just flips
Ooohoo what you're doin' to me
Now the kind of love that you inspire
Fills my heart with a warm desire
And when you set my lips on fire
It feels mighty good to me
