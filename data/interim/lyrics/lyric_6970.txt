Freedom
Keep walking
Keep on your toes and
Don't stop talking 'bout
Freedom
Get going
Lots to be learned
And lots to be knowing 'bout
People
Gotta reach 'em
Sit 'em right down and then
You gotta teach 'em 'bout
Freedom
Gotta win it
Gotta put yourself smack-dab in it
Hey, tomorrow
Hey, don't you go away
Cause freedom
Just might come your way
Freedom
Keep trying
People stay alive
And people keep dying for
Freedom
So don't lose it
You gotta understand
You just can't abuse it
Freedom
Get moving
Never gonna stop
'Til everybody's grooving on
Love for one another
Calling some friend
And calling some brother
Hey, tomorrow
You're not so far away
Mother freedom
We'll know you well someday
