My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
My first love
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make
And I
I...
I want to share all my love with you
No one else will do
And your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes
They tell me how much you care
Ohhh yes, you will always be
My endless love
Two hearts, two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
Forever
Oooh...
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charm
And love
Oh, love
I'll be a fool for you
I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh, you know I don't mind
'Cause you, you mean the world to me
Ohh... I know I've found in you
My endless love
Bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom
Oooh, and love
I'll be that fool for you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh you know I don't mind
And yes, you'll be the only one
'Cause no one can deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love
My love, my love
My endless love
