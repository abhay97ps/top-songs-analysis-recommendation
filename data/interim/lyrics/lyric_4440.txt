Time, time
Rolls the hills along
Makes the stars go round
To the sky's bright song
Time, time
Stirs the endless sea
Maybe time will bring
You back to me
The summer was golden
Their love young and new
His bold arms
Her rendezvous
But now leaves have fallen
And tears fill her eyes
His warm lips a memory
As she sighs
Time, time
Rolls the hills along
Makes the stars go round
To the sky's bright song
Time, time
Stirs the endless sea
Maybe time will bring
You back to me
The snow's come
And gone now
And still, they're apart
How empty her yearning heart
But spring brings it's promise
And old memories burn
While she dreams
With summer, he'll return
Time, time
Rolls the hills along
Makes the stars go round
To the sky's bright song
Time, time
Stirs the endless sea
Maybe time will bring
You back to me
Maybe time will bring
You back to me
