I've given every moment I had
Still I can never seem to keep up with you
You're done with one mile and on to another one thousand
Still I can never seem to keep up with you
I know you'll be better off without me when I'm gone
You know you're, you're beautiful, you're beautiful
Shine on, you were made to, shine on
And you know I love you
And even if we can or can't be friends
I'll be with you until the very end
So shine on
You were made to
It's keepin' me awake every night
But I can never seem to give up on you
I send up a prayer then I'm on to another one thousand
But I can never seem to give up on you
I know you'll be better off without me when I'm gone
You know you're, you're beautiful, you're beautiful
Shine on, you were made to, shine on
And you know I love you
And even if we can or can't be friends
I'll be with you until the very end
So shine on
Yeah
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right
Keep movin' on
Shine on, yeah, you were made to shine on
Shine on, you were made to
Shine on
And you know I love you
And even if we can or can't be friends
You're gonna be brighter than you've ever been
So, shine on
You're gonna be just fine
Ooh, you're gonna be alright love
You're gonna be just fine
Ooh, you're gonna be alright love
