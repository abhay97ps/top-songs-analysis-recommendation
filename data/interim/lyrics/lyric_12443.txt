You somehow knew we'd meet again
Now I understand
If I look surprised, don't be alarmed
I've got you in my arms
I can almost taste it, and when I can
Just a lick away
But baby there's one thing I know
My heart speaks but the words play
On the tip of my tongue
And no matter what my lips say
You are still the only one
Never been too cunning
I'm no linguist
But I can tell you this
Ever since I left you I've been lost
I'm walking in a fog
We can lick this problem
We can work it out
Don't be impatient
And don't you run
'Cause I want you on the tip of my
My heart speaks but the words play
On the tip of my tongue
And no matter what my lips say
You are still the only one
I can't find the words
My lips are on their own
And my speech is slurred
Can't even talk on the telephone
I'll take a tip from you
You say my French is pretty good
So that's what I'll use
If I could
My heart speaks but the words play
On the tip of my tongue
And no matter what my lips say
You are still the only one
