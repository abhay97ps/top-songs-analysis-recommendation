You tell me that I should not cry...
You tell me all good things must die...
You ask me why I get upset...
You tell me that I will forget....
Tell me why...
You say I can't be blue for long...
You say I'll find new love that's strong...
You tell me she was not for me...
It's just the way love has to be...
Tell me why...
Why I cannot see her...
She won't let me see her...
Te-ell...
Te-ell...
Tell me why...
You tell me that I will find my way...
Tomorrow won't be like today...
You tell me life was meant to be...
One-third good, two-thirds misery...
Tell me why...
