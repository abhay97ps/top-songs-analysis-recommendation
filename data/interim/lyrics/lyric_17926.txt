Yeah, yeah, yeah
Darling, here we are again
Right about now
There is a need to tell you what I'm feeling
I'm so grateful to have a man like you
Who knows what to do
And makes me feel like a woman should
Oh, yeah
When I close my eyes
I break down and cry
It's somethin' 'bout the way you love me
The thought of your kiss
My heart can't resist
It's all about the way you love me
Never thought that I would find
So much peace of mind
In every moment that I share with you
Some sometimes
I don't know why we fell so deep in love
But then it all comes back to me because
When I'm
 with you
I feel so good
No one loves me like you do
When I close my eyes 
I break down and cry
It's something 'bout the way you love me
The thought of your kiss 
My heart can't resist
It's all about the way you love me
When I close my eyes 
I break down and cry 
It's something 'bout the way you love me
(It's something 'bout the way
The thought of your kiss 
My heart can't resist 
It's all about the way you love me
When I close my eyes 
I break down and cry
It's something 'bout the way you love me
The thought of your kiss 
My heart can't resist 
It's all about the way you love me
