My baby's always dancing
And it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no loving
And that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco
Went to every kind of disco
From that night I kissed
Our love goodbye
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie
That nasty boogie bugs me
But somehow it has drugged me
That spellbound rhythm gets me
Off my feet
It's changed my life completely
I've seen the lightning leave me
My baby just can't take
Her eyes off me
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control my feet
Sunshine
Moonlight
Good times
Boogie
Sunshine
Moonlight
Good times
Boogie
This magic music moves me
That dirty rhythm fools me
The devil's gotten to me
Through this dance
I'm full of funky fever
You stole my soul 
That Boogie's got me in a
Super trance
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't you blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie
Sunshine
Moonlight
Good times
Boogie
Sunshine
Moonlight
Good times
Boogie
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good time
Blame it on the boogie
Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good time
Blame it on the boogie
Sunshine
Dont blame it on the moonlight
Dont blame it on the good time
Blame it on the boogie
Sunshine
Moonlight

Watch out now
Sunshine
Moonlight
Good time
Talking about that boogie
