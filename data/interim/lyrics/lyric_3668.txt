OW! OW!
When you and your baby are tight
And everything you say or do is mellow
She keeps everything all right
And you know that you're the only fellow
Ain't that a groove
Ain't that a groove, ha
Ain't that groove, OW
Ain't that a groove
Now, look here, fellas
Girls like to be in a mood
Whenever they think their man is yellow - hit me, band!
You'll fight real hard
To make things right 'cause he's the only fellow
Now, ain't that a groove
Ain't that a groove - do you hear me, people?
Ain't that a groove, OW
Ain't that a groove
Looka here, I wanna know, do you love me? 
One more time, do you love me? 
Do you love me, baby? 
I just gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta know
OW! Hit me band
One more 'gain
Looka here
I got to tell you, dig this
This will kill you
A little piece of money and plenty of love
Will keep everything together - come on, band
Well, forget about the money
Plenty of love and ain't that mellow, ha ha
Now, ain't that a groove 
Ain't that a groove 
Ain't that a groove 
Hey, OW, ain't that a groove
Looka here, I'm not gonna talk all day
But I, I want you to get the feeling
One more time
