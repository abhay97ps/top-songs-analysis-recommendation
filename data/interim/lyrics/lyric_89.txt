Tender love and care
Makes a life worth living
Tender love and care
That's what I'll be giving
Every day, every night with you
When you're wrong, when you're right, when you're blue
I'll give tender love and care to you
I'll give tender love and care 
Tender love and care 
I will give you always 
Tender love and care 
Both in big and small ways 
When you need me you'll find me there
At your side anytime anywhere
Giving tender love and care to you
Giving tender love and care 
Gentle sweet and kind 
I will always treat you 
Gentle sweet and kind 
Every time I need you 
I will cheer you if you are low
I will chase all your cares and woe
Giving tender love and care to you 
Giving tender love and care 
Tender love and care
