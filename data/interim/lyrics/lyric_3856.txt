I don't know why she won't love me
Lord, please tell me why
Maybe it's that she don't love me
Don't count on it please, she's shy
If she's shy then I'll understand
I'll make the first move and hold her hand
But if I'm wrong then I'll be mad
La-da-da-da-da
I've been tryin' oh so hard
But she don't seem to notice
I sit next to her in class
But she can't see my motive
Do you think she has a boy
If she has then I'm done
'Cause if he catches me with her
I think I'll have to run
If she's passive she'll understand
I'll value my love but not in her hands
But if I'm wrong then I'll be mad
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
