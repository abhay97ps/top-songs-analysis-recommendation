Met this girl walking in the ghetto
Looking good but looking down
Said she needed inspiration
I said, 'Get yo shit cause we're goin uptown'
I could tell she was feelin better
When she got inside the car
She was a dark-skinned girl with pretty cornrows
She was doin her best to try to hide her scars
I don't really care
About that there, just get involved
Boy you, makin me feel, uh oh so real
Just get involved
Everytime I take you around friends
I catch them looking at you love
You know it never ever bothered me
Because I know that I'm the one you're thinking of
I don't really care
About that there, just get involved
Boy you, makin me feel, uh oh so real
Just get involved
Word up, word up, word up yo
Raphael just stopped in his tracks
Get involved and make it into the pack
You know the way that you present your thing
We in the belly so we might as well cling
The way you shine shorty you da shit
The princess in the pauper pit
We may be poor but we rich in soul
Just get involved and get in control
Just get involved and get in control
You know the way we do it, yo we roll
Oh, oh, oh, oh
