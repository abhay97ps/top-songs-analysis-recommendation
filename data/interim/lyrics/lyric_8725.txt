You followed me to Texas
You followed me to Utah
We didn't find it there
So we moved on
You went with me to Alabam
And things looked good in Birmingham
We didn't find it there
So, we moved on
I know you're tired of following
My elusive dreams and schemes!
For they're only fleeting things'
My elusive dreams
You had my child in Memphis
Then I heard of work in Nashville
But we didn't find it there
So we moved on'
To a small farm in Nebraska'
To a gold mine in Alaska'
We didn't find it there
So we moved on
Now we've left Alaska
'cause there was no gold there
But this time
Only two of us moved on
Now all we have is each other
And a little memory to cling to
Still you won't let me go'
Go on alone
I know you're tired of following
My elusive dreams and schemes!
For they're only fleeting things'
My elusive dreams
