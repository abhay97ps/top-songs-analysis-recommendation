Yeah
They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
Shiny 'til it wasn't
Feels good 'til it doesn't
It was her first real lover
His too 'til he had another
Oh, God, when she found out
Trust levels went way down
Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet 
Took a few years to soak up the tears
But look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Wow, look at her now
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Wow, look at her now
Wow, look at her now
Fast nights that got him
That new life was his problem
Not saying she was perfect
Still regrets that moment
Like that night
Wasn't wrong, wasn't right, yeah
What a thing to be human 
Made her more of a woman 
Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet 
Took a few years to soak up the tears
But look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Wow, look at her now 
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Wow, look at her now
Wow, look at her now 
Wow, look at her now
She knows she'll find love 
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love 
She knows she'll find love 
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love 
On the up from the way down
Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm, look at her now, mm-mm 
She knows she'll find love 
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love
Look at her now, yeah 
She knows she'll find love 
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love
Wow, look at her now
