I was born on a levee
A little bit south of Montgom'ry
Mama worked in the big house
And Daddy he worked for the county
I never had no learnin'
Until I turned 16
When Joe Henry come up the river, y'all
Lord, made a woman outta me 
Lord, he made a woman outta me 
I used to tease Joe Henry
I guess it served me right
Wasn't long 'til he left me
Cryin' out in the night
Joe Henry had his say
He went and set me free
I need tell everybody
That the man made a woman outta me
Lord, he made a woman outta me 
When I think back to that day so long ago
I-I-I get a little feelin' on my mind
Although it hurt me there's one thing I know
When he left, he left him a woman behind 
When I meet another young man
Wantin' to love and run 
My mind goes back to Joe Henry James
And the heck of a job he done 
Ain't no other man let me down
You see I've been set free
Ever since way back yonder
When Joe made a woman outta me 
Lord, he made a woman outta me 
Made a woman outta me 
Joe made a woman outta me 
Lord, he made a woman outta me 
Joe made a woman outta me 
Lord, he made a woman outta me
