I could ride around the world in an old oxcart
And never let another girl thrill my heart
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you so?
I could meet a hundred girls and have loads of fun
My hugging and my kissing belong to just one
If you gave me nine lives like an alley cat
I'd give them all to you and never take one back
I'm putting on my Sunday suit and I'm going downtown
But I'll be kissing your lips before the sun goes down
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you so?
