Lights out, sucker punch, striked out
Called it love, we wrote it then I wiped out
Two ships just passin' in the night now
Offshore, lookin' for a lighthouse
Green pill, you said that it was painless
Down and out, drownin' in a sea of my anguish
Funny, you always said hope floats
Comprehended but I can't cope
So I...
Gotta find my way back, way back
To you, baby
Tryin' to find my way back, way back
To you, baby
Gotta find my way back, way back
To you, to us, to love, love
Man down, my heart's in your hands now
Hid your love, another 'X' in the sand now
No clue, no map, damn
So I'm diggin' 'til I end up in Japan now
Green pill, you said that it was painless
Down and out, drownin' in a sea of my anguish
Funny, you always said hope floats
Comprehended but I can't cope
So I gotta...
Gotta find my way back, way back
To you, baby
Tryin' to find my way back, way back
To you, baby
Gotta find my way back, way back
To you, to us, to love, love
We got lost, lines got crossed
And the light turned to static, babe
And then I jumped ship, got caught up in the current
And it carried both of us away
We were so much better
When we were together, baby
And I just can't let you slip away
Gotta find my way back, way back
To you, baby
Tryin' to find my way back, way back
To you, baby
Gotta find my way back, way back
To you, to us, to love, love
