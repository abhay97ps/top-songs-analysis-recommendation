It's out with the old and in with the new
Goodbye clouds of grey, hello skies of blue
A dip in the pool, a trip to the spa
Endless days in my chaise
The whole world according to moi!
Iced tea imported from England
Lifeguards imported from Spain
Towels imported from Turkey
And turkey imported from Maine
We're gonna relax and renew
I want
Fabulous!
That is my simple request
All things fabulous
Bigger and better and best!
I need something inpiring to
Help me get along
I need a little fabulous
Is that so wrong?
Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops
Where is my pink Prada tote?
I need my Tiffany hairband
And then i can go for a float!
A summer like never before!
She wants fabulous!
That is her simple request
All things fabulous
Bigger and better and best
She needs something inpiring to
Help her get along
She needs a little fabulous
Is that so wrong?
Fabulous pool, fabulous splash!
Fabulous parties, even fabulous trash!
Fabulous fashion, fabulous bling!
She's got to have fabulous everything!
Nothing to discuss;
Everything's got to be perfect
She wants
Fabulous!
That is her simple request
All things fabulous
Bigger and better and best
She needs somethig inspiring to
Help her get along
She needs a little fabulous
Is that so wrong?
This won't do
That's a bore
That's insulting
I need more
I need, I need
I need, I need
I need, I need!
I need fabulous!
Fabulous hair, fabulous style!
Fabulous eyes, and that fabulous smile!
Oh, I like what I see
I like it a lot
Is this absolutely fabulous?
Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous?
