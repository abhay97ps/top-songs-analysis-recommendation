My friends all tell me
Go to him, run to him
Say sweet lovely things to him
And tell him, he's the one
Deep in my heart I know it
But it's so hard to show it
Cause it's easier, easier said than done
My buddies tell me
Fly to him, sigh to him
Tell him I would die for him
And tell him, he's the one
Although he gives me a feeling
That sets my heart a-reeling
Yet it's easier, easier said than done
Well, I know that I love him so
I'm afraid that he'll never know
Because I  I get so timid and shy
Each time that I look him in the eye
They all tell me
Sing to him, swing with him
And just do anything for him
And tell him, he's the one
I got a love so true
But I'm sad and blue
Cause it's easier, easier said than done
Well, I know that I love him so
I'm afraid that he'll never know
Because I  I get so timid and shy
Each time that I look him in the eye
They all tell me
Sing to him, swing with him
And just do anything for him
And tell him, he's the one
I got a love so true
But I'm sad and blue
Cause it's easier, easier said than done
Easier-er-er-er, said than done
