Girl 
If you hear me calling
Girl 
No need of acting
Like you don't know
The guy that you hurt so
Hey, girl 
Why do you ignore me
Girl 
With us, was it so sad
Give me the truth
Was I that bad
What made you change
And act so strange
As though you don't know me
I found out this morning
You put me down
You put me down
Got another man in your arms
Don't want me around
Don't want me around
Realized, I know
What you've done
You put a hurt on me
And now, you don't
Even know me
You don't know me
You don't know
Realized, I know
What you've done
You put a hurt on me
And now, you don't
Even know me
You don't know me
You don't know
You don't know me
You don't know
