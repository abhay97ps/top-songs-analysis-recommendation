Sweet baby, our sex has meaning 
Know this time you'll stay 'til the morning 
Duvet days and vanilla ice cream 
More than just one night together exclusively 
Baby, let me be your man
So I can love you 
And if you let me be your man
Then I'll take care of you, you
For the rest of my life, for the rest of yours
For the rest of my life, for the rest of yours
For the rest of ours
We're drinkin' the finest label 
Dirty dancing on top of the table 
Long walks on the beach in April 
Yeah, I promise, darling, that I'll be faithful 
Baby, let me be your man 
So I can love you 
And if you let me be your man 
Then I'll take care of you 
For the rest of my life, for the rest of yours
For the rest of my life, for the rest of yours
For the rest of ours
Give me your body and let me love you like I do
Come a little closer and let me do those things to you
This feelin' will last forever, baby, that's the truth
Let me be your man so I can love you
Baby, let me be your man 
So I can love you 
And if you let me be your man 
Then I'll take care of you 
For the rest of my life 
For the rest of yours 
For the rest of my life 
For the rest of yours 
For the rest of ours
