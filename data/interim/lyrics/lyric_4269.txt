And you're Daddy's Little Girl
You're the end of the rainbow
My Pot of Gold
You're Daddy's Little Girl to have and hold
A precious gem is what you are
You're Mommy's Bright and shining star
You're the spirit of Christmas
My star on the tree
You're the Easter Bunny to Mommy and me
You're sugar
You're spice
You're everything nice
And you're Daddy's Little Girl
You're the end of the rainbow
My Pot of Gold
You're Daddy's Little Girl to have and hold
A precious gem is what you are
You're Mommy's Bright and shining star
You're the spirit of Christmas
My star on the tree
You're the Easter Bunny to Mommy and me
You're sugar
You're spice
You're everything nice
And you're Daddy's Little Girl
