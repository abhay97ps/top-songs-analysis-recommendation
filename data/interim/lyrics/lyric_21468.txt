Halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
You were always hard to hold
So letting go ain't easy
I'm hanging on but growing cold
While my mind is leaving
Talk, talk is cheap
Give me your word you can keep
Because I'm halfway gone, and I'm on my way
And I'm feeling, feeling, feeling this way
Because you're halfway in, but don't take too long
Because I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
Halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
You got one foot out the door
And choking on the other
Always think there's something more
Is just around the corner
Talk, talk is cheap
Give me your word you can keep
Because I'm halfway gone, and I'm on my way
And I'm feeling, feeling, feeling this way
Because you're halfway in, but don't take too long
Because I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
Halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
If you want me out, then I'm on my way
And I'm feeling, feeling, I'm feeling this way
Because you're halfway in, but don't take too long
Because I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
Now I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
Don't take too long, don't take too long
Because I'm on my way, if you take too long
Because I'm halfway gone, and I'm on way
And I'm feeling, feeling, I'm feeling this way
Because you're halfway in, but don't take too long
Because I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
If you want me out, then I'm on my way
And I'm feeling, feeling, I'm feeling this way
Because you're halfway in, but don't take too long
Because I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
