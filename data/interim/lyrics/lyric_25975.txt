Flippin' through all of these magazines
Tellin' me who I'm supposed to be
Way too good at camouflage
Can't see what I am, I just see what I'm not
I'm guilty 'bout everything that I eat 
Feelin' myself is a felony
Jedi level sabotage
Voices in my head make up my entourage
'Cause I'm a black belt when I'm beating up on myself
But I'm an expert at giving love to somebody else
I, me, myself and I don't see eye to eye
Me, myself and I
Oh, why do I compare myself to everyone?
And I always got my finger on the self-destruct
I wonder when I love me is enough 
I wonder when I love me is enough 
Why am I always looking for a ride or die?
'Cause mine's the only heart I'm gonna have for life
After all the times I went and fucked it up 
I wonder when I love me is enough, mmm 
 I wonder when I love me is enough
 I wonder when I love me is enough
Haters that live on the internet 
Live in my head, should be paying rent
I'm way too good at listening 
All these comments fucking up my energy 
'Cause I'm a black belt when I'm beating up on myself 
But I'm an expert at giving love to somebody else 
I, me, myself and I don't see eye to eye
Me, myself and I 
Oh, why do I compare myself to everyone?
And I always got my finger on the self-destruct
I wonder when I love me is enough 
I wonder when I love me is enough 
Why am I always looking for a ride or die?
'Cause mine's the only heart I'm gonna have for life
After all the times I went and fucked it up 
I wonder when I love me is enough 
Is enough 
 Yeah
 I wonder when I love me is enough
 I wonder when I love me is enough
I'm my own worst critic, talk a whole lot of shit
But I'm a ten out of ten even when I forget
I, I, I, I, I 
I'm my own worst critic, talk a whole lot of shit
But I'm a ten out of ten, even when I forget 
I, I, I, I, I 
Yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah
 I wonder when I love me is enough
 I wonder when I love me is enough
 I wonder when I love me is enough
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
