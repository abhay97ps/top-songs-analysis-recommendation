 love me
 mm now, love me
Everywhere I turn I find
You are always on my mind
Everything I seem to say
Ends up in the same old way
 oh now, love me
 I want you to love me
What I feel, I can't explain
What is spring without the rain?
Missing that would be shame
Only you are left to blame
Oh, no
All I know is yours if you would take it
Make believe it's ours and we can make it
Now give a little, understand
Reach out for a lonely hand
'Cause this could be our only chance
Oh
 mm now, love me
 please, please love me
Give me all you have to share
Without you I couldn't care
Make me happy when I'm down
When I'm gone, don't play around
Ah
Oh
 mm now, love me
 please love me
Everywhere I turn I find
You are always on my mind
Everything I seem to say
Ends up in the same old way
 mm-hmm, love me
 darling, love me
What I feel, I can't explain
What is spring without the rain?
Missing that would be shame
Only you are left to blame
Sure to blame, yeah
Do you understand?
