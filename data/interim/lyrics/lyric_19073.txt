Don't worry about who that is, it ain't you
You got somebody else over there?
Don't worry about it, Keith. If you was over here taking care of business, you wouldn't have to
Ask me no questions like that
Oh girl, please
Oh girl, please, my ass! Who that is over there?
Are you mocking me now?
Uh, boy, ain't nobody gotta mock you

But it's nothin' that I heard
Wait a minute, just hear me out

See, you're wrong there, I busted you coming out some girl's house
And what's that 'posed to mean?
Nothin' 'til you kissed her in her mouth
Boy, let's stop wasting time
It's pretty clear that you's a lie
Tired of sitting around hearing all your phony alibis
Soap, powder, bleach, towels
Fabric softener, dollars, change
Pants, socks, dirty drawers
I'm headed to the laundromat
And let's not forget the food stains, dirt spots
Head sets, chips, pop
Pay phones, clean house
Boy, I'm headed to the laundromat, yeah
So, baby, what you saying?
Baby, read between the lines
Do I have to spell it out to you? I'm saying goodbye
Oh girl, quit playing, I'm the only thing you got
You're the only thing I got?
Well then I must not have a lot
Girl, you can't be serious; in fact, I think you're gaming
Look, just call my manager and he will make the arrangements
So you really gon' go through with this?
Hell yes 'cause I'm fed up with this
Girl, how you just gon' leave like this?
Because you weren't true to this
Soap, powder, bleach, towels

What is there to talk about?
You done hurt me time again, brought me up and break me down
Well, baby girl, I'm sorry
Well, sorry's not gon' do it

Oh baby, I just don't know what I would do if i was to lose you
Hello? Are you there?
