Eli's comin'
Eli's comin' 
Well, you better hide your heart
Your loving heart
Eli's a-comin', and the cards say
A broken heart
Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl
Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl 
You better, better hide your heart
Eli's comin', better walk
Walk but you'll never get away
No, you'll never get away from the burnin' a-heartache
I walked to Apollo by the bay
Everywhere I go, though
Eli's a-comin' 
Eli's a-comin' 
Eli's a-comin', and he's comin' to get ya 
Get down on your knees 
Eli's comin' 
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl 
You better, better hide your heart
Eli's comin', better walk
Walk but you'll never get away
No, you'll never get away from the burnin' a-heartache
I walked to Apollo by the bay
Everywhere I go, though
Eli's a-comin' 
Eli's a-comin' 
Eli's a-comin', and he's comin' to get ya 
Get down on your knees 
Get down on your knees
No-no, no-no
Lord, I said no-no, no-no, no-no
 She can
 Hide it
 You better
 Somebody
 You got to
 Oh, my
 Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
