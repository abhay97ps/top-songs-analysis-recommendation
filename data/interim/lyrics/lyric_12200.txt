Dad’s got Steve Miller Band jamming out in his garage
Every early morning I’d be kicked up across the yard
With the sugar so sweet in a juice box her favorite wild cherry
You know me just waiting on Mary
She weren’t like the other kids hanging in the neighborhood
She wanted to see the world and so she said we should
Sneak off down Hampton Drive with all the candy we could carry
You know me chasing after Mary
Chorus
My first taste of life before I learned to live it
My first taste of love before I learned to give it
I’ll still be dreaming about that girl when I’m dead and buried
You know me just waiting on Mary
I had a swing in my backyard but Mary wouldn’t swing with me
She’d run up the hill with her dogs wanting me to play family
I was a man and it was my job bringing home blackberries
You know me taking care of Mary
We couldn’t grow up fast enough and Mary got herself a car
Friday nights in the backseat taking things a little too far
Test-driving her kisses on me a little thrilling, a little scary
You know me cruising with Mary
My first taste of life before I learned to live it
My first taste of love before I learned to give it
I’ll still be dreaming about that girl when I’m dead and buried
You know me waiting on Mary
Blew that town to turn into the somebody she said I’d be
But I’m still looking for that girl in every face I see
Something’s missing simple and true sweet as wild cherry
You know me just waiting on Mary
My first taste of life before I learned to live it
My first taste of love before I learned to give it
I’ll still be dreaming about that girl when I’m dead and buried
You know me oh you know me just waiting on Mary
Yeah waiting on Mary
Waiting on Mary, waiting on Mary, waiting on Mary
