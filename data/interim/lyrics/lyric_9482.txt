And when God gave out rythm
He sure was good to you
You can add, subtract, multiply and divide...
By two
I know today's your birthday
And I did not buy no rose
But I wrote this song instead and I call it
"Popsicle Toes"
Popsicle toes
Popsicle toes are always froze
Popsicle toes
You're so brave to expose all those popsicle toes
You must have been Miss Pennsylvania
With all this pulchritude
How come you always load your Pentax
When I'm in the nude?
We oughta have a birthday party
And you can wear you birthday clothes
We can hit the floor
And go explore those
Popsicle toes
You got the nicest North America
This sailor ever saw
I'd like to feel your warm Brazil
And touch your Panama
But Your Tierra del Fuegos
Are nearly always froze
We gotta see saw
Until we unthaw those
Popsicle toes
Popsicle toes
Popsicle toes are always froze
Popsicle toes
You're so brave to expose all those popsicle toes
