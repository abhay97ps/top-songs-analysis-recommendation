Could have been the whiskey
Might have been the gin
Could have been the three or four six-packs
I don't know, but look at the mess I'm in
My head's like a football
I think I'm going to die
Tell me, me-oh, me-oh-my
Wasn't that a party
Someone took a grapefruit
Wore it like a hat
I saw someone under my kitchen table
Talking to my old tom cat
They were talking about hockey
The cat was talking back
Along about then everything went black
Wasn't that a party
I'm sure it's just my memory
Playing tricks on me
But I think I saw my buddy
Cutting down my neighbour's tree
Could have been the whiskey
Might have been the gin
Could have been the three or four six-packs
I don't know, but look at the mess I'm in
My head's like a football
I think I'm going to die
Tell me, me-oh, me-oh-my
Wasn't that a party
Billy, Joe and Tommy
Well, they went a little far
They were sitting in my backyard
Blowing on a sireen from somebody's police car
So you see, Your Honour
It was all in fun
That little bitty track meet down on main street
Was just to see if the cops could run
Well, they run us in to see you
In an alcoholic haze
I sure can use those thirty days
To recover from the party
Could have been the whiskey
Might have been the gin
Could have been the three or four six-packs
I don't know, but look at the mess I'm in
My head's like a football
I think I'm going to die
Tell me, me-oh, me-oh-my
Wasn't that a party
Could have been the whiskey
Might have been the gin
Could have been the three or four six-packs
I don't know, but look at the mess I'm in
My head's like a football
I think I'm going to die
Tell me, me-oh, me-oh-my
Wasn't that a party
Wasn't that a party
Wasn't that a party
Wasn't that a party
Wasn't that a party
Oh, what a party
