Each night as I go wandering
Down the street of tears
I think about the love we shared
Throughout our teenage years
Believe me, ooooooh, wah oooooooooh
Wah oooooooooh, believe me
Just because you said goodbye
Do you think that I will die
Just because you broke my heart
Now you thinking you're so smart
All the kids in town will know
They will know you hurt me so
Did you have to tell them all
That I still love you
I love you so
Can't let you go
If you return
Love's flame will burn
Just because you said goodbye
Do you think that I will die
Just because you broke my heart
Now you thinking you're so smart
All the kids in town will know
They will know you hurt me so
Did you have to tell them all
That I still love you-ooooooooooou
Oooooooooh wah ooooooooooh
Oooooooooh wah ooooooooooh
Oooooooooh wah ooooooooooh
Oooooooooh wah ooooooooooh
