Pain, I done got numb from the pain 
All of these girls is the same
Who is the one to blame?
Nowadays it's not the same
I flood my wrist out today
I hit your girl in my Wraith
I hit your girl in my Wraith
In a spaceship, outer—
Pain, I done got numb from the pain 
All of these girls is the same
Who is the one to blame?
Nowadays it's not the same
I flood my wrist out today
I hit your girl in my Wraith
I hit your girl in my Wraith
In a spaceship, outer—
Super geeked up, walking on a tightrope 
She think she in love, but just want my dough 
I'm numb from the pain, all these girls are psycho 
Drivin' in the Lam', swervin' 'round the potholes 
Know I got my gun everywhere that I go 
Tatted up my face, I look like a psycho 
She think she in love, but just want my dough 
I'm numb from the pain, all these girls are psycho 
Rockin' my suit like a mobster, rockin' my suit like a model 
None of these girls are my problem, none of these girls are my problem 
Call that girl, suck, chew, and swallow, call that girl, suck, chew, and swallow 
Numb to the pain 'cause I'm honest, only worried 'bout the dollar, yeah
Pain, I done got numb from the pain 
All of these girls is the same
Who is the one to blame? 
Nowadays it's not the same
I flood my wrist out today 
I hit your girl in my Wraith 
I hit your girl in my Wraith 
In a spaceship, outer space 
Geekin' on Mars yesterday
Now I'm on Pluto today 
I look the moon in its face 
I look the moon in its face 
Me and the moon relate
Me and the moon relate 
Me and the moon relate 
Me and the moon relate
I gotta stack up my cake
Gettin' them chips like it's Lay's 
Man, my dough nuts like it's glazed 
Man, my dough nuts like it's glazed 
You know she told me you lame
Me and you, boy, not the same 
Don't give a fuck what you bang
1600 what I claim 
Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot
Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot
Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot
Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot
Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot
Doot-doot-doot
My niggas, they bring the pain
Nowadays, these niggas do anything just for the fame 
You got a stick, I got a chopper, these bitches don't hit the same 
Don't hit the same, like, no, they do not hit the same 
What is you sayin'? Like, turned to a fool with the K 
Turned to a fool with the K 
Get that girl out of my face 
Drivin' so fast like we race 
Pain, I done got numb from the pain 
All of these girls is the same
Who is the one to blame? 
Nowadays it's not the same
I flood my wrist out today 
I hit your girl in my Wraith 
I hit your girl in my Wraith 
In a spaceship, outer space 
Geekin' on Mars yesterday
Now I'm on Pluto today 
I look the moon in its face 
I look the moon in its face
Me and the moon relate
Me and the moon relate 
Me and the moon relate 
Me and the moon relate
