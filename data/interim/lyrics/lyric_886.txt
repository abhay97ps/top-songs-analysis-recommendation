I got home last night
At 10 past 2
My floks turned blue
Their tempers flew
I got to be in bed
At quarter to 10
There go those rules again
*Too many rules
Too many rules
Folks are just fools
Making too many rules
I pray the stars above
I haven't lost your love
Coz there are too many rules
When you call me on the telephone
It's not my own
They've made it known
So you must call me only now and then
There go those rules again
*Repeat
