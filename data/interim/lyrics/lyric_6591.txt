I left Louisiana, I had me big plans
To go out and take me all over this land
To see me the world, I left my sweet girl
And gave it a whirl, but now here I stand
Alongside the road with holes in my soul and my shoes
And beaucoups of blues
Oh, sweet magnolia
Breath carried over the marsh by a breeze from the gulf
I'm coming home 
I've had me enough
Oh, where are the things I saw in my dreams?
Where's the happy that freedom should bring?
I see me today and know yesterday
That I threw away my most precious things
I see me a man who's lonely, wants only to lose
Beaucoups of blues
Oh, sweet magnolia
Breath carried over the marsh by a breeze from the gulf
I'm coming home 
I've had me enough
I'm coming home 
I've had me enough
