If tonight should be our last night together I'm not sorry that we fell in love at all
If tomorrow sun should find me hurtin' for you I know
That the price for loving you would still be small
For I'd never know the thrill of your sweet lips
And the chills I get just knowing that you're mine
Cause I've spent my life not knowing what real love is oh no
Though I'd be hurtin' I'm still certain
That I'd rather love and lose you than never know your love at all
For I'd never know the thrill...
Yes I'd rather love and lose you than never know your love at all
