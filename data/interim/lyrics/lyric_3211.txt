You kiss me off to work in the morning
But it doesn't mean that's where I'm going
And 'cause my meals are cooked when I return, baby
I want you to know, it doesn't mean that's all you been doing
'Cause I could be in the street playing the game
And you could be at home doing the same darn thing
'Cause when you cheat on a love that's true
Oh, tell me now, who's cheating who
My nights out with the boys
Don't have to be with the boys at all
And when you go to visit your mother, baby
Oh, yes, I know, her name could easily change to Paul
When someone gives you love it's like money in the bank
But if you take another return you've got to come up blank
'Cause when you cheat on a love that's true
Oh, tell me now, who's cheating who
If you give up the good for what's good maybe
If you steal the bread that feeds your baby
If you ignore your alarm and sleep right home
You gain more sleep but your job might be gone
Oh, my nights out with the boys
Don't have to be with the boys at all
And when you go to visit your mother, baby
I just wanna let you know
I know her name could easily change to Paul
When someone gives you love it's like money in the bank
But if you take another return you've got to come up blank
'Cause when you cheat on a love that's true
Oh, baby, now, who's cheating who
I want you tell me now, baby
Who's cheating you, oh, yeah
I wonder if you know what I'm talking about now
You just don't cheat on some girls
