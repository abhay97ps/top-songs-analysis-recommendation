Gee but it's great to be back home
Home is where I want to be
I've been on the road so long my friend
And if you came along
I know you couldn't disagree
Chorus
It's the same old story
Everywhere I go
I get slandered
Libeled
I hear words I never heard
In the bible
And I'm on step ahead of the shoe shine
Two steps away from the county line
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied
Satisfied
Deputy sheriff said to me
Tell me what you come here for, boy
You better get your bags and flee
You're in trouble boy
And you're heading into more
Chorus
