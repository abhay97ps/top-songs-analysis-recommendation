I was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest 
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good
I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? 
Can we still be friends? 
Doesn't have to end 
And if it ends, can we be friends? 
Can we be friends? 
Can we be friends?
Wonderin' if you got a body
To hold you tighter since I left 
Wonderin' if you think about me 
Actually, don't answer that 
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good
I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? 
Can we still be friends? 
Doesn't have to end 
And if it ends, can we be friends? 
Can we be friends? 
Can we be friends?
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good
I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? 
Can we still be friends? 
Doesn't have to end 
And if it ends, can we be friends?
