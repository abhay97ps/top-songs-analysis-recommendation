Your lips are cherry pink
Your eyes are apple green
You are picture pretty
As a movie queen
Oh, my darling
You're such a treat
Mmm, best of all
Your love is candy sweet
Your heart is diamond precious
Pure and orchid red
Soft as baby tender
Warm as summer air
Oh, my darling
You can't be beat
Mmm, best of all
Your love is candy sweet
Every kiss you give me
Thrills me through and through
Well, I just want to hold and
Squeeze all your love from me
You're so lovey dovey
You're my hearts delight
I just want to love you
Every day and night
Oh, my darling
You're such a treat
Mmm, best of all
Your love is candy sweet
Mmm, best of all
Your love is candy sweet
Mmm, best of all
Your love is candy sweet
