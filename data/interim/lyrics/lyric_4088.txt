If I could write a symphony for Susan
I would write a melody
That would tell her
Create a spell for her
Ring a bell for her
And let her know
How much I fell for her
If I could write a symphony for Susan
I'd compose some harmonies
That would let her know
How much my love could grow
How it's warmth would glow
What better way is there
To tell her so?
I would try to invent new rhythms
That would let her know
All the thrills I feel
When her lips touch mine
Later on
There would be a strain
So full of tenderness
That she must confess
That she knows
That I love her so
If I could write a symphony for Susan
There would be so many ways
I could let her know
How much my love could grow
How it's warmth would glow
What better way is there
To tell her so?
There would be so many ways
I could let her know
How much my love could grow
How it's warmth would glow
What better way is there
To tell her so?
