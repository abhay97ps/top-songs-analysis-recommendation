Everybody knows you came with him
But another girl caught his eye , oh
Now you're sitting there all alone
Watching them dance by 
And I know you're wondering
What you'll do if he doesn't come back to you
But don't worry, I'll take you home
So, little girl, don't you be blue
Now I know that you wore
That pretty red dress just for him to see , oh
But I wanna tell ya
That red dress looks good to me 
Whoa, I know you feel like you wanna die
But try pretending that I'm your guy
And don't worry, I'll take you home
So, little girl, now don't you cry
I'll take you home when the last dance is over
I'll take you home, just wait and see
You're gonna dance the last dance with me
Let me tell you now
I know the way that you feel
I can understand 
'Cause I had a date just like you
When the dance began 
But the girl I came with just wasn't true
She's the girl who took him from you
So you see now, I'll take you home
'Cause, little girl, I'm lonely, too
Oh, let me tell you now
I know the way that you feel
I can understand 
'Cause I had a date just like you
When the dance began 
But the girl I came with just wasn't true
She's the girl who took him from you
So you see now, I'll take you home
'Cause, little girl, I'm lonely, too, woah
I'll take you home
'Cause, little girl, I'm lonely, too
Whoa, I'll take you home
'Cause, little girl, I'm lonely, too...
