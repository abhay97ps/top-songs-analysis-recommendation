Dad sold every record he ever owned
Floyd and Zeppelin, Beatles, Stones
A lifetime of music gone just to get me through
Momma always had her a second job
Gone with the sun until six o’clock
Whatever it took to get by she was gonna do
Didn’t dawn on me back then but now I see
Without them, I wouldn’t be me
When I’m up here on this stage
The spotlight’s on my face
But I see you
Sure it’s me behind this mic stand
It’s me strumming this Gibson
It’s me they love to give the credit to
But me don’t mean a thing without you
You make sacrifices every night and day
Never hear the crowd scream your name
But there’s a smile and a hand to hold when the show is through
I’d give it all up just to keep your love
But you wouldn’t let me because you care too much
About watching me watch my dreams all come true
When I’m up here on this stage
The spotlight’s on my face
But I see you
Sure it’s me behind this mic stand
It’s me strumming this Gibson
It’s me they love to give the credit to
But me don’t mean a thing without you
You worked overtime to buy those tickets
The gas, the beer and the babysitters
Just to spend one night with your baby at a country show
Paid twenty damn dollars for a place to park
Got in line early to grab your spot
So you deserve every word, every line of your favorite tune
When I’m up here on this stage
The spotlight’s on my face
But I see you
Sure it’s me behind this mic stand
It’s me strumming this Gibson
It’s me they love to give the credit to
I’m just trying to give the credit where credit’s due
Because me don’t mean a thing without you
Without you
