All you cool people, you better leave now
'Cause it's about to happen
Friday night and I'm ridin' solo 
When I touch down, keep it on the low-low 
I don't mess with your energy , no photos 
So antisocial, but I don't care 
Don't give a damn, I'm gonna smoke here 
Got a bottle in my hand, bring more though 
Got my hat low, don't talk to me 
I've been down, give me some space
You don't know what's in my brain
Music loud, easin' my pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night 
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night, yeah
I need room, I need room
Where you standin' way too close
You might catch fumes, might catch fumes
When I zoom , when I zoom
Pass out, wake up by myself right past noon
Right past noon, then I'm doomed
Occupied and movin' dolo 
Hennessy's drownin' all of my issues 
Right before I leave, she give me more than just a "miss you" 
That thing got more back, just like my engine, I can hit it
 Seen a vision in the boy, then we committed 
I've been lost out inner space
You left me right in my place
I put you down on my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night 
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night
Don't touch me, yeah
