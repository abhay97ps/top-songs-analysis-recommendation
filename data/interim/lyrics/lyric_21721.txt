Ugh
Ugh
We blowing money fast on this side, nigga
Catch up, nigga
I think I'm Big Meech , Larry Hoover
Whippin' work, hallelujah
One nation under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start
I think I'm Big Meech , Larry Hoover 
Gettin' work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start
My Rolls Royce triple-black, I'm Geechee, ho
Ballin' in the club, bottles like I'm Meechie, ho
Rozayâ€”that's my nickname
Cocaine runnin' in my big veins
Self-made, you just affiliated
I build it ground-up, you bought it renovated
Talkin' plenty capers, nothing's been authenticated
Funny, you claimin' the same bitch that I'm penetrating
Hold the bottles up, where my comrades?
Where the fuckin' felons? Where my dogs at?
 I got that Archie Bunker
And it's so white, I just might charge you double
I think I'm Big Meech , Larry Hoover
Whippin' work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start
I think I'm Big Meech , Larry Hoover 
Gettin' work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start
These motherfuckers mad that I'm icy! 
Stunt so hard, make them come indict me 
I think I'm Big Meech, look at my timepiece
It's an Audem-eer, hundred racks, at least
Look at yourself, now look at me 
You can't see a nigga, I'm what you used to be 
Look at it this way , you niggas sideways 
Always gettin' money, my nigga, crime pays 
So fuck a nigga , I'm self-made 
You a sucker nigga , I'm self-paid 
This for my broke niggas , this for my rich niggas 
Got a hundred on a head of a snitch nigga 
I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Whippin' work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start
I think I'm Big Meech , Larry Hoover 
Gettin' work, hallelujah 
One nation, under God 
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start 
Them thirty-six holes leave you bleedin', family 
Word to them thirty-six O's in a kilogram 
Blunt tip orange like caviar
Wildin' out, fishtailin', Subaru, rally car 
Out the passenger, lettin' the automatty off 
A eighth of that girl'll knock your mommy and your daddy off 
Fuck around and knock the emblem on the Caddy off 
Four shooters buggin' out, blickin' at your Caddy doors 
And did I mention: guns from Red Dead Redemption? 
Nine-mils, fifty-clip extensions 
Coke is like a mattress in the hood, I'm flippin' on it 
And the money's like a chair, I'm sittin' on it 
I think I'm Big Meech , Larry Hoover
Whippin' work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start
I think I'm Big Meech , Larry Hoover 
Gettin' work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start
