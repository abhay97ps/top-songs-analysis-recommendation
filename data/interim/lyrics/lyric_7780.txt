I miss you
How I long to kiss you, baby
Without you, can't go on
Without you, baby
I got a hot wire from my baby
Ooh, what a sweet little telegram
She wrote, darling, I love you
There's no one above you
I wish you were home
You been gone so long
Sincerely
I'm a tell, y'all
Every, every day now
 please
What'd she say
She wrote, love be with you
And every day, I'll miss you
I wish you were home so bad
 so bad
You been gone so long, oh
Sing the song children now
 can't make it
Play your part right here
Come on
She wrote, baby, I love you
My heart and soul is with you
I wish you were home
You been gone so long
Sincerely
Baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Without you, I can't make it
Take it just a bit higher, y'all
Look 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna kiss you more and more
 baby
Don't even have a possible chance
But I wanna say it one more
Come on
 oh, baby
Every, every day, y'all
 yeah
Just a little higher, y'all...
