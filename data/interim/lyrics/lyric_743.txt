Throughout history mankind has been plagued with triangles
A there's the eternal triangle
The isosceles triangle
And the schrons flippus 
However this song is about a friend of mine
Who bought an automobile
Dollar down and a dollar a week
And everytime he turned the wheel
Dollar down and a dollar a week
He got a credit card for that new machine
Dollar down and a dollar a week
And he kept it full of gasoline
Dollar down and a dollar a week
Just a dollar down and a dollar a week
You can get all the things you seek
For a dollar down and a dollar a week
Well he went speeding on down the road
And kissing his gal upon her cheek
They took him to jail but he put up bail
Dollar down and a dollar a week
The judge did fine him fifty bucks
And asked if he would like to speak
He said, 'Judge if I may, I'd like to pay’
Dollar down and a dollar a week
Just a dollar down and a dollar a week
You can get all the things you seek
For a dollar down and a dollar a week
When he got out, he married that gal
Dollar down and a dollar a week
He bought a wedding ring that was pretty cheap
Dollar down and a dollar a week
Refridgerator and a washing machine
Dollar down and a dollar a week
And the food stayed cold and the clothes stayed clean
Dollar down and a dollar a week
Just a dollar down and a dollar a week
You can get all the things you seek
For a dollar down and a dollar a week
They got themselves a little home
Dollar down and a dollar a week
With a second mortgage and a pretty good loan
Dollar down and a dollar a week
He said to his wife, 'It's a pretty good life'
Dollar down and a dollar a week
And she said, 'Honey we don't need much money'
Dollar down and a dollar a week
Just a dollar down and a dollar a week
You can get all the things you seek
For a dollar down and a dollar a week
But six little kids did soon arrive
Dollar down and a dollar a week
He had so many worries that he could not sleep
Dollar down and a dollar a week
As their debts began to mount
They added them up apon a sheet
They said with tears, 'We’ll take a thousand years at a’
Dollar down and a dollar a week
Just a dollar down and a dollar a week
You can get all the things you seek
For a dollar down
And a dollar a week
