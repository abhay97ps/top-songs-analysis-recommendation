Do you want me to slow it down? 
Do you want me to speed it up? 
Do you want me to slow it down? 
Do you want me to speed it up? 
You ain't never heard a slow jam like this
You ain't never had a remix like this
You ain't never been freaky like this
Rollin' on 24's like this
Never had a pool party like this
Never sipped on Cris' much as this
Never been to an island like this
Make one wish, and I'll give you all this
Girl you remind me of my Jeep and my S5
First I was on top of you, now you sayin', "Let's ride"
Freakin' your body so good, I give you wet thighs
When we get together, you know we make the sex live
Take you to paradise while massaging you down
Feelin' better than twins m√©nagin' you down
Make you explode and now I'm calming you down
So good that you don't want me to bother you now
Now listen here, come and kick it with the players
Ghetto majors and the thumper sprayers
And we never got no room for no haters
When we pull up on them 24 Omegas
While I'm smoking on a Garcia Vega
You by my side, we be on one when we hangin
What Earthquake say? "It's more than a relationship"
We a corporation, let's take over the nation
Let me get up with you girl, don't be trippin' on your guy
He gon' be up when the heat come out
Cause you could rub the lamp three times
And still won't a motherfucker like me come out
You ain't never heard a slow jam like this 
You ain't never had a remix like this 
You ain't never been freaky like this 
Rollin' on 24's like this 
Never had a pool party like this 
Never sipped on Cris' much as this 
Never been to an island like this 
Make one wish and I'll give you all this 
You ain't never had a playa like me to take you shoppin'
Take you to the crib and sex you nonstop and
Bone Thugs, top droppin'
V.I.P with the bottles poppin'
So clean, we gotta take a picture
So sexy, I wanna get with you
Girl I'll be singing Thriller
While you be squeezing pillows
And we can take a shower together
Get cozy in stormy weather
And if you ever going through something
I promise to make it better
You just keep on lovin' a thug
Massage and some sex when I tell you it's time
You ain't never gotta want for nothing
As long as you down and you ready to ride
I wanna give you them butterflies
Have your head all off up in the sky
And we be going 
You ain't never heard a slow jam like this 
You ain't never had a remix like this 
You ain't never been freaky like this 
Rollin' on 24's like this 
Never had a pool party like this 
Never sipped on Cris' much as this 
Never been to an island like this 
Make one wish and I'll give you all this 
You ain't never rode in a Bentley lookin like this
You ain't never got up with a thug nigga like this
Or got with a baller that spit to the rhythm like this
Or kick it with a platinum plus nigga like this
Well looky here now, come look at how the playa T drop the top
Rollin' through flickin', my music bumpin so the trunk wane
Kelly and Twista, peep how we rock the block
Platinum Ferrari, it's nothing shorty, it was chump change
Or pull up in the 7-4 to the fend 
Won't you get in?
While I'm steady blowin smoke in the wind 
Hoping to win
Now speakin' words to my head in the bed
Then after we work, then we can do it that one way
Lookin thick as a loaf of bread by the legs
And you get at shakin the way the Twista make the tongue play
And this is for the love and the ladies
The fine women that be rollin Mercedes
Getting freaky and
And we be going 
You ain't never heard a slow jam like this 
You ain't never had a remix like this 
You ain't never been freaky like this 
Rollin' on 24's like this 
Never had a pool party like this 
Never sipped on Cris' much as this 
Never been to an island like this 
Make one wish and I'll give you all this 
Do you want me to slow it down? 
Do you want me to speed it up? 
Do you want me to slow it down? 
Do you want me to speed it up? 
Do you want me to slow it down? 
Do you want me to speed it up? 
Do you want me to slow it down?
And we be going
