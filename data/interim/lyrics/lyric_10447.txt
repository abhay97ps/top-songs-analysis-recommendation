There was a time, not too far gone
When I was changed by just a song
On the radio, in the car
The pounding electric guitars
Then the time came to make a stand
We started up a four-piece band
And the heat felt like spotlights
In the heart of a hot summer night, yeah
Hot summer nights
Hot summer nights
Return with me to when times were best
We were friends who could pass any test
We shared our hopes, our dreams, and our goals
And the Fundamental Roll
As we sang in the hot, dark rooms
Happy just to play our tunes
It felt good when we did it right
It felt good on a hot summer night, yeah
Hot summer nights
Hot summer nights, yeah
And so it lives, and it always will
The songs we've sung are in us still
Ringing out with all their might
In the heart of a hot summer night, yeah
Hot summer nights
Hot summer nights, yeah
