Everything ain't what it seems
In this world of broken dreams
And the things they try to teach you
Sure ain't what you've seen
But you make it all seem right
When you whisper in the night
Won't you wrap those calming arms around me?
Hold me tight
Hold me near through the years
Through the fears, through the tears
Well it makes you want to shout
With the crap they're dishin' out
You're the only one it seems
To make it all work out
And you're always by my side
Puttin' up with foolish pride
When the day to day fiascoes
Only multiply
You're the heart, you're the soul
When the world takes its toll
The load is getting lighter
When I'm in your arms
Just squeeze a little tighter
When I'm in your arms
In your arms
In your arms
With my back against the wall
When you keep standing tall
When I stumble, you are
Always there to break my fall
When I'm far away from home
I can call you on the phone
When I hear your voice
Then certainly I'm not alone
All the words that you say
Make the miles drift away
The load is getting lighter
When I'm in your arms
Just squeeze a little tighter
When I'm in your arms
?Cause it all seems so easy
When I'm in your arms
Just hold me tight and squeeze me
When I'm in your arms
In your arms
You take me far away from there
When you hold me in your arms right away, yeah!
Solo
Everything ain't what it seems
In this world of broken dreams
And the things they try to teach you
Sure ain't what you've seen
In the dark, in the night
In your arms, it's all right
You're the heart, you're the soul
When the world takes its toll
The load is getting lighter
When I'm in your arms
Just squeeze a little tighter
When I'm in your arms
?Cause it all seems so easy
When I'm in your arms
Just hold me tight and squeeze me
When I'm in your arms
The load is getting lighter
When I'm in your arms
Just squeeze a little tighter
When I'm in your arms
Cause it all seems so easy
When I'm in your arms
Just hold me tight and squeeze me
When I'm in your arms
In your arms
In your arms
In your arms
In your arms
Everything ain't what it seems
