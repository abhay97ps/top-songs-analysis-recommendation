Uh huh uh, geah
Roc-A-Fella y'all
Jigga, Rell, '98 edition
This is Roc-A-Fella for life, this is Roc-A-Fella for life
Uhh, this is Roc-A-Fella for life, this is Roc-A-Fella for life
I play my parts with the honies hard
It's gotten even worse now that the money's washed
Like a letter y'all, the nine-eight find me straight
Good health, can't complain about my financial state
What else? I guess tomorrow knows
I run through chicks like borrowed clothes
I'm the type of nigga your father oppose, never test Jay
You follow the code, ese, on my best day
I'm like God with the flow, bless me
Baby, why are you chasing that man?
Knowing that he can't, love you like I can
I guess you'd rather chase, instead of feeling what's real inside
I got to thinking, and I hope you realize
All this love for free
Better come and get it soon 
Please, don't take too long 
Before it's all gone, I just wanna put you on
The apple of my eye, sweet cherry surprise
Let me up inside, of your body tonight
There's so much that we can do, me
And I'll do you, know how much I wanna
Taste your loving, so good
All this love for free
Better come and get it soon 
Please, don't take too long 
Before it's all gone, I just wanna put you on
Hurry hurry hurry, hurry baby 'cause I can't wait
Hurry hurry hurry, 'cause later on might be too late 
Hurry hurry hurry, tell me whatcha gonna do
Hurry hurry hurry, there's too many dimes for me to choose
Baby you got me 
Going round in circles 
And I can't explain why 
Can't get enough of your love
Yeah yeah yeah
In the SL with Rell, music at a high decimal
Mami fronting, touching buttons like she spec-ial
'Cause she sex well, and the best tail, Roc-A-Fella cartel
Excel-ing like Hyundai, Sunday to Sunday
It's for the nachos, come out the clothes
And baby girl if it's Hammer time then hide your toes
The game cold like, five below, but once inside the show
We tore it down; about that money, we throw it around
So when the ice hit the sun rays, run for shade
Game's over, we didn't come to play
The fuck y'all thinking?
Round and round in circles
 I can't explain why
 Can't get enough of your love
Baby I've got all this love 
 Baby baby baby
 I want your love babe
Can you feel me growing baby
Let me keep it going...
