Woo!
Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now
Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home
Never thought that I would hurt so bad
And ever since the day that I met you
All alone I sit 'cause I'm so sad
Don't you know this heart, it grieves for you?
There you were, holding back your love
Trying to make me feel real bad
'Cause your love I never had
I pray to her. 
I needed her 
I told her that 
I want her back 
Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now
Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now
All alone, don't you want to have some fun?
Don't you know, baby, I'm the one?
Just come with me and I'll make you feel
Don't you know, babe, this love is real?
There you were, holding back your love
All alone, you looking sad
But I know you want it bad
Deceiving me 
What is the key? 
Do you believe in me? 
It's a disgrace, you see. 
Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now
Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now
Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now
Girl, I want your body
You know I love your body
Girl, I need your body
Why don't you come home with me now
