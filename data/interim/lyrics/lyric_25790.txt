Take me 'round the world and back again
As I'm searching for my soul out there
Oh, there's something that I'm wondering 
Where I'm going when my story ends
Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older 
Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older 
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me
Get these thoughts that keep me up all night
Keeps me
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me
Get these thoughts that keep me up all night
Keeps me
So I'ma light it up, I'm gettin high 
Ask me how I am, I'm getting by 
But I'm thankful that I'm still alive 
'Cause there's so much more I'm left to find
Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older 
Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older 
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me
Get these thoughts that keep me up all night
Keeps me up 
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me 
Get these thoughts that keep me up all night
Keeps me up 
On my mind all the time
Keepin' me up all night
On my mind all the time
Keepin' me up all night
On my mind all the time, ah
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me
