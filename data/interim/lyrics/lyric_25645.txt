Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Woah, woah, woah
I'll totally come and shoot your shit up, know what I'm sayin'?
No cap, woah
Young SEX
Fuck it, buy a pink Mercedes 
I made Forbes every year, lil' baby 
I don't like no long nails on my lady 
Is it you that can't reveal that I'm shady?
White toes in her heels, she the latest 
She got plastic Cartiers, think she made it 
Sucked it in the car and then my kids met the pavement
Extended pumps and F&Ns like The Matrix 
Diamonds on me wetter than a tub
Shoppin' every day 'cause we used to be fucked up
Keep a yellow Cinderella on the tuck
YYB's on, ain't no way I'm givin' up
Different color diamonds on me, bitch, I'm dead wrong
And my bitch in Saudi Arabia, but her redbone 
I got money, niggas doubted, now I'm mad on 
Ayy, I got Rollie-Pollies, I'm on two tone 
These tenderoni can't get off me, I see 
My slime brothers Pluto, Savage, and YB 
Quavo , Takeoff , Offset , Uzi 
Lil Durk , Meek Mill , Drizzy 
More names , plenty 
Fuck it, buy a pink Mercedes 
I made Forbes every year, lil' baby 
I don't like no long nails on my lady 
Is it you that can't reveal that I'm shady?
White toes in her heels, she the latest 
She got plastic Cartiers, think she made it 
Sucked it in the car and then my kids met the pavement
Extended pumps and F&Ns like The Matrix 
I keep exotic drinks and juices by the crates 
She put my cum in her cup like it was shake
I'll never fuck this bitch again, it was a mistake
I'm Teletubby, diamonds green, blue, white, and grape
I can afford these black diamonds like a spade 
I maneuver through the city with a maid
I got riches and I guard 'em like the Navy
Pin it up and let me drink it like you're naked 
It don't matter the ho call like mine baby 
Got a lil' money to leave your head on the pavement
Flawless carats got these niggas stand in they places
AR'd up before I come and issue statements 
Fuck it, buy a pink Mercedes 
I made Forbes every year, lil' baby 
I don't like no long nails on my lady 
Is it you that can't reveal that I'm shady?
White toes in her heels, she the latest 
She got plastic Cartiers, think she made it 
Sucked it in the car and then my kids met the pavement
Extended pumps and F&Ns like The Matrix
Drippin', drippin' gold , wipe a nigga nose 
This year I'm goin' back thirty-two goals 
This year I seen thirty-two mil' 
Last year I popped thirty-five thousand pills 
Bigger X pill like a ferris wheel 
I go Juntao, blond hair, yeah
Long living like a motherfuckin' wrestler
If I ask, I know she'll let me live like I'm a bachelor
Mercedes

My mama hate it
Reveal I'm shady
Ladies
