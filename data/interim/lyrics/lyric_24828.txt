Young nigga, rich nigga, I'm a bad bitch getter
Fuck nigga, ho nigga, I don't fuck with broke niggas
Always held my own since I jumped up off the porch, nigga
You ain't know, now you know, nigga, Hi-Tech pour a four, nigga
Bitch run me my sack before I come in
80,000 dollars plus a jet on a backend
20 twin twins finna get plucked like a chicken
Brother locked up, he spent much time in the kitchen
We ain't really with none of that pretendin' and shit 
I got six Catholic hoes in here sinnin' and shit 
Pour that shit up, bust it down 
Bought a new crib, it got several amenities 
You gon' get shot like the Kennedys 
Fuckin' with Lil Boat and YB 
Carbine it sound like a dump truck 
Soon as I up, he gon' back up 
She wanna fuck, I'ma smash her 
He want a verse, I'ma tax him 
Say you want smoke, it ain't 'bout nothing
I know that nigga ain't 'bout nothing 
Bring out the boat when the flood coming
Strapped with a TEC when you pull up on me
I'm with the .38 baby, my neck see more water than the Navy 
I was finna fuck your bitch, my nigga then I got lazy 
I saw your new watch, that shit cool but my shit crazy
Canary yellow diamonds in my mouth like I bit a daisy 
I'm with Lil Baby yeah, keep a .380, yeah 
I'm with big Slime, yeah you know we goin' brazy, yeah

Lotta money, know they hate me, yeah
One on four, they try to play me, yeah
Shoot his ass right up in here 
Diamonds, they shine like a headlight 
I keep that lil' bitch if her head right
I'ma lay up and fuck on her every night 
When I'm leavin' I'm headin' straight to the flight 
Got a tiger but no I'm not Mike Tyson 
Scuff in the club like Fight Night 
I make that lil' ho act right 
I tell that bitch fuck up my sack right 
Put that lil' bitch on a Spirit flight 
Return her next to me one night 
We running and ducking from squad lights 
I got 32 shots in the gun fight
These niggas sweet like a honey bun 
Don't worry 'bout where my money from
At the crib, on the couch, we got huntin' guns 
Dissect his hand from his other arm 
Young nigga, rich nigga, I'm a big bag getter 
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, never met a real nigga 
Never had six figures, my bitch do tricks nigga
I go by Lil Boat and I'm coolin' with some real hittas 
Whip on the wrist, that's a brick on the fist, nigga
No light needed for this chain, it's gon' glist nigga 
VS, one stone, that shit not far from flawless
Fuck a pretty bitch, nigga, my money gorgeous, bitch
