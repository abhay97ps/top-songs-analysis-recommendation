The time is now or never
To fit the missing piece
To take this on together
You make me feel complete
We fall into the future
And through the looking glass
The light shines over our heads
And so it comes to pass
To go beyond the surface
To reach into your soul
This love is not demanding
My heart has told me so
I hold onto my hero 
With faith enough to fly
The power to imagine
Will keep this love alive
Let's make the headlines loud and true
I wanna tell the world I'm giving it all to you
Let's make the headlines loud and clear
The best things suddenly happen when you are here
If I lost my way you'd carry me home
Take me all the way to Heaven
Never leave me alone 
And it's just like everything matters when you are near 
And it feels so good
Every bell's gonna ring
Your love is alive and it's makin' me sing
I could fly, wanna cry
Want the whole world to know
We are together
Come on baby, lets go
And words yet to be spoken
Will fall upon the page
Spelling out true devotion
Is all we need to say
Let's make the headlines loud and true 
I wanna tell the world I'm giving it all to you 
Let's make the headlines loud and clear 
The best things suddenly happen when you are here 
If I lost my way you'd carry me home
Take me all the way to heaven
Never leave me alone 
And it's just like everything matters when you are near  
Let's make the headlines true this time 
There's no hiding from this magical state of mind 
If I lost my way you'd carry me home 
Take me all the way to heaven never leave me alone 
And it's just like everything matters when you are near  
Let's make the headlines loud and true 
Let's make the headlines
'Cause I'm giving it all
Yeah, I'm giving it all to you
