Verse 1:
Faded photographs
Covered now with lines and creases
Tickets torn in half
Memories in bits and pieces
Chorus 1:
Traces of love long ago
That didn't work out right
Traces of love
Verse 2:
Ribbons from her hair
Souvenirs of days together
The ring she used to wear
Pages from an old love letter
Chorus 2:
Traces of love long ago
That didn't work out right
Traces of love with me tonight
Bridge:
I close my eyes
And say a prayer
That in her heart she'll find
A trace of love still there
Somewhere
Chorus 3:
Traces of hope in the night
That she'll come back and dry
These traces of tears
From my eyes
