The sky in Cheyenne, Wyoming
Is just about as blue as it gets
And if you ain't seen a Santa Fe sunset
You ain't seen red
Texas sunflower yellow
Can take your breath away
I've seen it all, from the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer but my favorite color is
Neon, the light they always leave on
A weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on
The buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is neon
The sun can do the job in the daytime
But the moon ain't quite bright enough
To light up the way to playtime
For people like us
Just like a beach side beacon
Callin' all the ships back home
A few thousand volts to cut through the smoke
The windows are tinted that's why they invented
Neon, the light they always leave on
A weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on
It's the buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is always neon
You know I've seen it all
From the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer
But my favorite color is
Neon, the light they always leave on
Put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is neon
