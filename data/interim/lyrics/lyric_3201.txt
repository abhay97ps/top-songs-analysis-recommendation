Happy summer sounds
The summer sounds I love
Listen to the music of the carousel
The tinglelingle, lingle of the icecream bell
Splishing and a splashing and a moonlight swim
Roaring up the waves when you're surfing in
June, July and August play a symphony
Under starry skies above
Happy summer sounds
The summer sounds I love
The paddle on a steamboat on a Sunday cruise
The sizzle of the hotdogs at a barbecue
The shrieking of a rollercoaster way up high
The whistles on the beach when a peach goes by
Summer time is here
Wake up and come alive
Put away scarf and blouse
Here come summer sounds
The summer sounds I love
Summer time is here
Wake up and come alive
Put away scarf and blouse
All together now
Here come summer sounds
Summer sounds, summer sounds
Here come summer sounds
The summer sounds I love
