Tonight we're gonna hang out
Me and my girls gonna hit a party
Gonna wild out
Manicure
Pedicure
So we look tight
And there's just enough money for the night out
So now it's time
We go hop up in the 6-4
Drop top down
Headed for the disco
Maybe we might catch some guys' eyes
If we don't
We don't care
'Cuz we still gonna have a good time
It's Friday night
Got visions in my head
But nothing on my mind
So let the music play
So let me hear you say
Aaa, ohh, aaa, ohh
We gonna have some fun
Aaa, ohh, aaa, ohh
Party all night
Aaa, ohh, aaa, ohh
That's all we think about
Aaa, ohh, aaa, ohh
No matta what's going down
Ayo, ayo
No matta what's going down
Ayo, ayo
We gonna do this anyhow
Ayo, ayo
No matta what's going down
Ayo, ayo
We gonna do this anyhow
We pull up in the valet
We turning heads like a Hummer on the freeway
We grace through the crowd
Eyes on us
People st-st-stuttering
Saying "Hey, who are they?"
Wall to wall
Back to back
Packed so tight
But VIP is where we kick it for the whole night
I be watching these guys peeping us out
But they faking
And they scared
We don't care
We're gonna have a good time
It's Friday night
Got visions in my head
But nothing on my mind
So let the music play
So let me hear you say
