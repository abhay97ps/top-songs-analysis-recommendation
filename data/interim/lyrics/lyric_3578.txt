I love you, just you, it's true 
But how much more do you need to be satisfied
Than I can give, the way you live 
You cheat all over, the rover you are
Makes me tell you
Oh, girl 
You know you're gonna hurt yourself 
You know you're gonna hurt yourself
When you're broke and worn out
When your heart is torn out
Don't call me
Don't call me late, don't wait, 'til it's too late 
If you want my love, take my love, but don't go shoppin'
Round town 'til you have found 
The guy you needed was me all along
Baby, baby, oh, girl 
You know you're gonna hurt yourself 
You know you're gonna hurt yourself
When you're broke and worn out
When your heart is torn out
Don't call me
I love you
Girl 
You know you're gonna hurt yourself 
You know you're gonna hurt yourself
When you're broke and worn out
When your heart is torn out
Oh, call me
I love you
Girl, don't hurt yourself
Girl, come on now girl
You know you're gonna hurt yourself
Come on, girl
