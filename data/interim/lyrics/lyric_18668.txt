My baby knows me better than I do
Funny how a woman has that over a man
I can do anything with her here beside me
Leaning on her is where I make my stand
Where would we be without the love of a woman
Standing behind her man even when he's wrong
The true pure undying love of a woman
Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone
My daddy was a wild one when he was younger
Everybody told my mama he'd be hard to tame
Full of himself he said 'sir' to nobody
But you oughta see him come a runnin' when mama calls his name
Where would we be without the love of a woman
Standing behind her man even when he's wrong
The true pure undying love of a woman
Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone
A man goes crazy trying to catch his feelings
Too much pride or maybe the words come out wrong
But that's okay 'cause he's still her hero
Steady as a rock, her love keeps rolling along
Where would we be without the love of a woman
Standing behind her man even when he's wrong
The true pure undying love of a woman
Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone
Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone
