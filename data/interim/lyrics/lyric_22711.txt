Hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
Ooh
I'm the kind of girl who doesn't say a word
Who sits at the curb and waits for the world
But I'm about to break out, about to break out
I'm like a crook tonight
I caught you staring at me, and I was thinking clearly
And now I'm like a bee and I'm hunting for the honey
And I'm kinda shy, but you're super fly, yeah
I could be your kryptonite, like
Light my heart up, baby, like a matchstick
And hit the gas quick
Ready or not, here I come
Where you at? The night is young
In the crowd, the music's loud
But I will find you
Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
And I'll find you
Ready or not 
Ready or not 
Hello, my name is , nice to meet you
I think you're famous, where have I seen you?
You'll be my William, I'll be your Kate
Living like a fairy tale
We could have a palace right next to Oprah
Thirty-seven cars and a yacht down in Boca
Take me away, wherever you say
Yeah, we could be setting sail, like
Light my heart up, baby, like a matchstick
And hit the gas quick
Ready or not, here I come
Where you at? The night is young
In the crowd , the music's loud
But I will find you
Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song? 
Just sing it, la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
And I'll find you
Ready or not 
Ready or not 
Not, no, woah, oh, woah, oh!
Ready or not, here I come, here I come
You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs
You made me dance from the night to the dawn
Ready or not, here I come boy, it's on
Ready or not, here I come, here I come
You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs
You made me dance from the night to the dawn
Ready or not, here I come boy, it's on
Ready or not, here I come
Where you at? The night is young 
In the crowd, the music's loud
But I will find you 
Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it, la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
And I'll find you
Ready or not  
Ready or not  
Oh! Ready or not 
Ready or not 
Ready or not
