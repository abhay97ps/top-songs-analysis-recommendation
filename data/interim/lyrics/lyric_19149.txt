I liked having hurt
So send the pain below, where I need it
You used to beg me to take care of things
And smile at the thought of me failing
But long before having hurt
I'd send the pain below
I'd send the pain below
Much like suffocating
Much like suffocating
Much like suffocating
Much like suffocating
You used to run me away
All while laughing
Then cry about that fact
'Til I returned
But long before having hurt
I'd send the pain below
I'd send the pain below
Much like suffocating
Much like suffocating
Much like suffocating
Much like suffocating
Much like suffocating
I can't feel my chest
Need more
Drop down
Closing in
I can't feel my chest
Drop down
I liked having hurt
So send the pain below
So send the pain below
I liked
So send the pain below
Having hurt
So send the pain below
So send the pain below
So send the pain below
