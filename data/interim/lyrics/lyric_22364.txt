Oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh
She, she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But baby, is that really what you want?
Bless your soul, you got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you, and boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it, she ain't got your love anymore
Rumour has it, oooh-ooh
Rumour has it, oooh-ooh
Rumour has it, oooh-ooh
Rumour has it, oooh-ooh
Don't forget me, I beg 
I remember you said 
I heard that you settled down 
That you've found a girl and you're married now 
I heard that your dreams came true 
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you 
Woah, rumour has it 
Yeah, baby 
 Don't forget me
 I beg
 I remember you said
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me, and boy, you're bringin' me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving her for
 Yeah...
 Yeah...
 Don't forget me
 I beg
 I remember you said
 Hey heeeey, yeah
 Rumour has it
 Don't forget me
 I beg
 I remember you said
Never mind, I'll find someone like you 
I wish nothing but the best for you, too 
Don't forget me, I beg 
I remember you said 
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
