As if this world had only just begun...
We'd give back all the things we had but one...
Only one...
One simple thing kept between you and me
Will build a wall no one else can see
One simple thing is all we really need
To make it all complete
Here - within this changing place
We run the longest race
Keeping the better pace
Here - we manufacture dreams
Even the greatest needs
Are satisfied with ease
One simple thing kept between you and me
Will build a wall no one else can see
One simple thing is all we really need
To make it all complete
Here - within this changing mind
Where anything untried
Is never far behind
Here - within this open heart
Life begins to spark
And this is where you are
One simple thing kept between you and me
Will build a wall no one else can see
One simple thing is all we really need
To make it all complete
