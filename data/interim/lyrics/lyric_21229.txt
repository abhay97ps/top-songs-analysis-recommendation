A lot of people called it prison when I was growin' up
But these are my roots and this is what I love
'Cause everybody knows me and I know them
And I believe that's the way we were supposed to live
I wouldn't trade one single day here in small town USA
Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
A little Hank Jr. and a six-pack of light
Old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday mornin' that's full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Here in small town USA
Around here we break our backs just to earn a buck
We never get ahead but we have enough
I watch people leave and then come right back
I never wanted any part of that
I'm proud to say that I love this place
Good ol' small town USA
Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
David Allen Coe and a six pack of light
Old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday mornin' that full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Here in small town USA
Oh yeah
I wouldn't trade one single day
I'm proud to say I love this place
Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
Sweet Home Alabama and a six-pack of light
Old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday mornin' that full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Yeah I'll be okay
Here in small town USA
Oh yeah small town USA
