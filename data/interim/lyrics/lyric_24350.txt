Anytime I'm alone, I can't help thinking about you
All I want, all I need, all I see is just me and you
He giving me that good shit
That make me not quit, that good shit
He giving me that good shit
That make me not quit, that good shit
Oh, he give it to me
Every day, every day, every day, every
He give it to me
Every day, every day, every day, every
Oh, he give it to me
Every day, every day, every day, every
He give it to me
Every day, every day, every day, every
Anytime, anywhere, baby boy, I can misbehave
Breathe me in, breathe me out, feel me, I'm
Running through your veins
He giving me that good shit
That make me not quit, that good shit
He giving me that good shit
That make me not quit, that good shit
Oh, he give it to me
Every day, every day, every day, every
He give it to me
Every day, every day, every day, every
Oh, he give it to me
Every day, every day, every day, every
He give it to me
Every day, every day, every day, every
He make me go....
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Every day, every
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Every day, every
I put that work on you every day
When the night fall 'til the sun come up 
You done fell in love with a bad guy 
I don't compromise my passion 
You know what you do for me, I'm doing the same for you
I don't be trippin' or makin' mistakes
I made too many in my past 
I fight for the things you believe in
I got your body and put it in drive, baby
Like I got keys in 
We 'bout to take us a vacation
I'm 'bout to put all this vintage lovin' on you
Baby, like it was the late 80s
When you ride on me, baby, rotate it
He giving me that good shit 
That make me not quit, that good shit 
Oh, he give it to me
Every day, every day, every day, every
He give it to me
Every day, every day, every day, every
Oh, he give it to me 
Every day, every day, every day, every
He give it to me 
Every day, every day, every day, every
He make me go....
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Every day, every
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Every day, every
Give it to me, to me
Oh, he give it to me every day
