Hoo...hoo...
A sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
I call you cotton candy
You're my cotton candy
I've got a sweet tooth
That's hard to satisfy
When I'm short on sugar
You've got a full supply 
Girl, don't be stingy
Gimme, gimme some
Girl, I can't live forever
On a diet of your love
You are my 
Sweeter than apple pie, ooh 
You came straight from Mother Nature's oven
Bringin' me that red hot lovin'
Shooby doo wop

Shooby doo wop
Shooby doo wop
Shooby doo wop shoo bop bop shoo bop
Girl, when I'm near you
I'm like a honey bee
You know I want your honey
But you keep on teasin' me 
Girl, don't make me suffer
I'm starvin' for your love
You give me just a little
But woo, it's just not enough , ooh
I can't get enough, get enough of your 
Woo, sweeter than apple pie, baby 
All the recipes are good, I know
But next to yours they don't come close
I've tried apples, peaches, pumpkin pie
They're all right
But when I kiss my baby
I lick my fingers, smack my lips
Do you know her I call these things
'Cause she's a sweet
Oh, so sweet
I call you cotton candy
Baby, you're my cotton candy
Sweeter than apple pie, baby 
I can't get enough, I can't get enough of your sugar 
Sweeter than apple pie, woo, baby 
I can't get enough 
Of your sweet, sweet, sweet cotton candy
