Not one to polemicize
But If I'm the paragon..
Who do I idolize?
Was your last resort before you implored to me
I'm your last chances possibility
No coordinates to any noumenon
I'm living off of what I'm living on
Like Beethoven I'm losing my hearing
But I can't lose site of the visions reappearing
Even if my album flops
I'll milk it till' the very last drops
It's gonna be alright
Is it gonna be alright?
It's gonna be alright
Is it gonna be alright?
I almost masturbated for 10 consecutive hours but..
You had to walk in before I could get my nut
I've been holding it in for so long I just needed some relief
You just stood there in disbelief
Ahhhhhh... here comes the cluster fucking headache
I can't stand the shit that I make
I feel like I've been comatose since birth
And when I finally woke up I was like what on earth?
Why am I unable to identify ..anything..
I've got no conception of my cognition
And I'm not even getting the deserved recognition
I can't do this anymore
Finding the truth didn't set me free
Go ahead and edit it in my discography 
Now they're begging for an encore
Stagnate in inherita cause' I feel into aphasia
Never had the output cause' I never had a chakra
But I have the goosebumps
