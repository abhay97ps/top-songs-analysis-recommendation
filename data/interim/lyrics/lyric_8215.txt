You gave your love completely
And warmed my life, so cold
But she stills lives between us
And our story must be told
Today, she thinks I love her
But tomorrow, we'll be through
And somewhere between love and tomorrow
She'll have to know about you
We vowed to love forever
And never be untrue
But time can change and rearrange
Your world from green to blue
But then you came to love me
And you made the sun shine through
And somewhere between love and tomorrow
She'll have to know about you
It's sad for love to die now
After all that we've been through
But somewhere between love and tomorrow
I fell in love with you
