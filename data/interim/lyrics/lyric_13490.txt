They say our love was never meant to be
That time would make it just a memory
But they don't know, how can they understand?
We didn't build no castles in the sand
And all the king's horses
All the king's men
Couldn't storm this tower
Of love, my friend
Of love, my friend
They say our life was just a fairy tale
No matter how we try, we must surely fail
But where are they now? And could they ever understand?
This ivory tower was built on rock, not sand
And all the king's horses, baby
All the king's men
Couldn't storm this tower
Of love, my friend
Of love, my friend
All the king's horses
And all the king's men
Couldn't storm this tower
Of love, my friend, yeah
All the king's horses, yeah yeah
All the king's men
Couldn't storm this tower
Of love, my friend
All , all the king's horses
All , all the king's men
Yeah, yeah, yeah
