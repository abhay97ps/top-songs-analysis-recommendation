Get it on they own, they don't have to ask you bitches 
Postin' pictures on the 'gram and @ your bitches 
Secure the bag, lifestyle real expensive 
All these bad bitches lookin' for attention 
That ain't bad, fake bad, she pretendin' 
If you pay to get in your bag then you winnin' 
All these Jones soldier, fuck it, they call me Quincy
Popped that seal , close that deal 
We in the field , spread them bills 
Lean spill , on that Lear 
Maybach seat with the sheers , AP shiftin' gears 
AP on me, iced out, tennis chains, iced out

We in the field with sticks like this Arcadia 
Flippin' the game and you niggas gon' meet your maker 
Uh, Goyard, havin' them racks and no regard 
Uh, Walkin' around with a bad bitch, she a barbie 
Uh, I started my engine, I’m nowhere, where the car is? 
Uh, Hopped in the Wraith and she asked me, “What the stars is?” 
Every month on the third we get to Narcs in 
Dogs barkin' then kick the door, no narcs in 
Livin' the wild life, think I am Tarzan

Hold up, where the bad bitches? Look at all the sad bitches 
Say a hundred, do two hundred on the dash, smash nigga 
Who want it? 'Cause we run it, ain't no question, ask niggas 
Better punt it on the fourth, 'cause ain't no runnin' past niggas 
Man, we done it, that's important, who you trust to blast with you? 
Make it spaz, that's a quarter cash in the caterpillar 
Porsche tags on the nigga ass, I'm a cop killer 
Reggie Miller, shoot 'em, bill up, say 'Phillipe' while you say, 'Philip'
Double cup, codeine killer, Houston Texas, now who trilla?
Bad bitches in the mirror, told her take the team with her 
Bet she bring the team with her, bring the blue and green, lookin' at my
