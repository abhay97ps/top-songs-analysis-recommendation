I'll bet you never thought
There'd ever come a day you'd hear me say
I'm leavin' you
I've loved you all these many years
And though my eyes are filled with tears
I'm leavin' you
There was a time not long ago
When I forgave you even though
Harsh words were spoken
And my heart was broken
Honey, I can't take no more
I just can't let my poor heart break no more, no more
So here's my cab and I'm all packed
I'd like to say that I'll be back
But that's not true
I've made my mind up all the way
And though it tears me up to say
I'm leavin' you
I've got to walk right out that door
And not look back at you no more
'Cause if I did, I know what I would do
I'd break right down, I'm just that way
I'd never have the heart to say
I'm leavin' you
I've got to walk right out that door
And not look back at you no more
'Cause if I did, I know what I would do
I'd break right down, I'm just that way
I'd never have the heart to say
I'm leavin' you
You know I would
I'd break right down, I'm just that way
I'd never have the heart to say
I'm leavin' you
I'm leavin' you
