Uh huh, alright...
This time going to do my best to make it right
Can't go on without you by my side, hold on
Shelter come and rescue me out of this storm
And out of this cold, I need someone
Oh why oh why why why...
Tell her this for me
All I need is...
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
Searching for that one who's going to make me whole
Help me make these mysteries unfold, hold on
Lightning about to strike and rain only on me
Hurt so bad sometimes it's hard to breathe
Oh why why
Tell her this from me
All I need is...
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
And I would walk around this world to find her
And I don't care what it takes no, why
I'd sail the seven seas to be near her
And if you happen to see her
See, tell her this from me
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
