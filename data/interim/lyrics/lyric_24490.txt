Can we get a little up close and personal?
Somewhere alone, somewhere alone
Ain't nobody else in my peripheral
You got it all, you got it all
I've got a feeling
We could be golden
Yeah, we got nothing to lose...
My money's on you
For the rest of the night...
You could be the highlight
Come bet on me too
If you want a good time...
I could be the highlight
My money's on you... You...

Thought you couldn't make me sweat the way you do
You dangerous, you ain't your best self
God no can't shake this bae like me and you
Ain't hard to tell, you do it well
I've got a feeling, we could be golden
Yeah, we got nothing to lose...
My money's on you
For the rest of the night...
You could be the highlight
Come bet on me too
If you want a good time...
I could be the highlight
My money's on you... You...
My money's on you... You...
Hey baby, you could be the highlight
Hey baby, you could be the highlight
Hey baby, you could be the highlight
Highlight
My money's on you
For the rest of the night...
You could be the highlight
Come bet on me too
If you want a good time...
I could be the highlight
My money's on you... You...
