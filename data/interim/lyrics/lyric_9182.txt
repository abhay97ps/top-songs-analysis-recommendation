When you have tried to give your all
You try to stand and then you fall
There is no crutch for love that's lame
When you find out, it's all a game
Behind all the pretty trimmings
But with you there ain't no limit
So love or leave
Get yourself together, baby
You may never get another chance
Oh babe
Love me or leave me, baby
That's what it's all about
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Love has it's ways of breaking through
You must decide if I'm for you
Then when the way began to die
Keep walking fast, don't break your stride
When darkness has come
We're laying in a daydream
And you give your partner everything
Get it, get it together, girl
You may never get another chance
I gotta find out
Oh babe
Our love won't have a doubt, no, no, no
Just love me, baby, love me
Baby, if you stay, here's what I'll do
Try my best to make you my girl
Try to pass on you
Hey, baby, wanna talk to you, girl
There's no limit to what I'll do
I got to work out, I got to work out
We can be happy, baby
All you got to do, hey, hey
All you got to do is love me, baby
Stay by my side
That's all it takes to keep us satisfied
Did I hear you say you don't believe me?
Try to do what a good man should
Hey, Lord, I know I did not 
I tried to build you up when you were sinking down
Turned your life around, I put a smile on your face
Where there was a frown
Let's get it together
Let's see if you and I
Can turn the world around with love
Why don't you stay, baby?
Better get yourself together
If you need me, if you want me
Working, working on my heart, baby
I got my heart on
Saying I'm in love with you
Here you come trying to do
Some things you do
Gon', gon', gonna get it
I don't care, I done my best
Say you gonna stay
Then we gotta do it my way
Baby, sit down
Let me talk to you, baby
Hey, you better have to do your thang
Baby, hey, baby
Tell me, why don't you stay
Stay for a brighter day
Why don't you hang around?
While we get back down
