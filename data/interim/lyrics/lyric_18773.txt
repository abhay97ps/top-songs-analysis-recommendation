Looking back now, well it makes me laugh
We were growing our hair, we were cutting class
Knew it all already, there was nothing to learn
We were striking matches just to watch them burn
Listen to our music just a little too loud
We were hanging in there with the outcast crowd
Heading to the rapids with some discount beer
It was a long train tussle but we had no fear
Man I don't know, where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that
We were want to be rebels who didn't have a clue
With our Rock n roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, and we were mostly
Young
Talked a good game when we were out with the guys
But in the back seat we were awkward and shy
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain
And I guess there are some things that are never going to change
Man I don't know, where the time goes
But It sure goes fast, just like that
We were want to be rebels who didn't have a clue
With our Rock n roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young
Young, Young, Yeah Wishing we were older
Young, Hey I wish it wasn't over
Man I don't know, where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that
We were want to be rebels who didn't have a clue
With our Rock n roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, and we were mostly
Young
