All of you bitches is food
If you the opps, you gon' be singin' the blues
Feelin' like Bishop in Juice
Word to my dude, this Jimmy Choo on my shoes
All of my niggas is makks
This is a fact, this ain't no cap app
All of my bitches is bad, word to my dad
They know we get to the bag
Move my hips, okay
Tell him to go, then I tell him to stay, hey
Baby, it's okay
I have been havin' one hell of a day, yay
Saint Laurent all on my shades
Then I pull up in a cherry Mercedes, yay
Strawberry shortcake hair
Chinese bangs with my two braids, ayy
Straight from outta Queens, headed to Harlem now
I got the panda mink on and it's growlin' now
Already bodied "Plain Jane" and we mobbin' now
That's 'cause all these fake niggas try to rob my style
Yo, these bitches really be slow, tell 'em I'm Billy the G.O.A.T.
I'm gettin' that dough, my neck and my wrist really glow
My model bitch all up in Vogue
All up in Vogue, pardon my Versace robe
Streak in my hair like I'm Rogue
Nigga, you know, you better not tip on your toes
They grippin' the 40 below 
Move your hips, okay

Move your hips, okay
