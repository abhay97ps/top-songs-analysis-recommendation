Every time I look around this room
My eyes they tend to fall on you and I confess
Nothing but you makes sense
Memories fill my heart and I can barely keep my tears
From fallin', oh I want your love
Do you ever think of us?
Is it too late, too late, to open up?
I'm dyin' to say, oh how I love you
You're workin' towards me now
What am I gonna say?
Push my pride aside
When I close my eyes
It's just you and I
Here under the mistletoe
Magic fills the air
Standin' over there
Santa hear my prayer
Hеre under the mistlеtoe
All I want, hey, yeah
All I want, hey-hey, yeah
All I want, hey, yeah
Is under the mistletoe
Oh everything I try to keep you from gettin' inside
Works until I see your face
I linger hopin' you might stay
Wrapped up in your arms, is where
I wanna spend my nights so hard, how much I want you
Do you think of us?
How I want your love
Is it too late, too late
To let you know, I can't quite escape
How much I need you
You're workin' towards me now
What am I gonna say?
Push my pride aside
When I close my eyes
It's just you and I
Here under the mistletoe
Magic fills the air
Standin' over there
Santa hear my prayer
Here under the mistletoe
All I want, hey, yeah 
All I want, hey-hey, yeah 
All I want, hey, yeah 
Is under the mistletoe
You're walkin' towards me now
Won't you read my mind somehow 
Meet me in the middle, underneath a little bit of mistletoe
And indecision take a breath as I
Push my pride aside
When I close my eyes
It's just you and I
Here under the mistletoe
Magic fills the air
Standin' over there 
Santa hear my prayer
Here under the mistletoe
'Cause all I want, hey, yeah 
All I want, hey-hey, yeah 
All I want, hey, yeah 
Is under the mistletoe 
All I want, hey, yeah 
All I want, hey-hey, yeah 
All I want, hey, yeah 
Is under the mistletoe 
Push my pride aside, aside, aside
It's just you and I 
All I want , all I want 
Is you , is you
Oh, oh, oh, oh woah
