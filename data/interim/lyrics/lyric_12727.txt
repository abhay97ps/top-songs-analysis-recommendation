Two hearts together
We're a harmony so right
Two sparks united
We're a fire burning bright
For that you're always brand new
Right from the jump we had a hunch
That we had everything
Perfect combination
Lovers you and me
A perfect combination
We couldn't ask for any better
Perfect combination
We fit to a tee
A perfect combination
We know what takes to last forever
Together
So deep
Inside we share a feeling that's so rare
So sweet
Just knowing that we are a special pair
We're right on time
We're two of a kind
And heaven knows this love will grow
Stronger every day
Perfect combination
Lovers you and me
Perfect combination
We couldn't ask for any better
Perfect combination
We fit to a tee
A perfect combination
We know what takes to last forever
Together
We can conquer any mountain
Just as long as we're together
'Cause as one we are an endless fountain
Overflowing with love
Perfect love
Perfect combination
Lovers you and me
A perfect combination
We couldn't ask for any better
Oh, no
Perfect combination
We fit to a tee
A perfect combination
We know what takes to last forever
Oh, oh
Perfect combination
Lovers you and me
A perfect combination
We couldn't ask for any better
No, no
Baby, yeah
Ooh...
Baby
Perfect combination
Lovers you and me
A perfect combination
We couldn't ask for any better
