To make you laugh, I would be a fool for you
Although the people turn and stare
I really don't care
I would give my everything to keep you, boy
It breaks my heart when you're not there
I will stage a ballet on a tabletop
Command performance finger size
And although I ain't got no tune
My show ain't gonna fly
I will find the music there in your eyes
Oh me, oh my, I'm a fool for you baby 
 Oh me oh my 
I am crazy baby 
Oh me, oh my 
Yeah I'm a fool for ya baby
Common let your love light shine on me
We'll blow a genie from a cigarette
And then we'll take a magic carpet ride
Yes we will
And we'll tell our smokey friend, hey don't you forget
Because you've got to keep us side by side, yeah
Oh me, oh my 
I am a fool for ya baby 
Oh me, oh my, 
You know that I am  crazy baby
 yes you do 
Oh me, oh my 
Whoa-oh I'm a fool  for ya baby
Come on let your love light shine on me
Would you do that? 
Come on let your love light shine
Just a little bit  right on me
Oh lover let your love light
Shine on me 
Oh hear me now!
Oh me, me oh my
I'm a fool oh! for ya baby 
Oh me oh my 
You know that I'm crazy baby
Oh me, oh my
