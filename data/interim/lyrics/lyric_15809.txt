Bad bad boys aha
Yeah ah ha, yeah ah ha, ah ha 
Bad bad boys, come with me, come with me
I feel positive
This time, I wan't to go away ah ha
Bad bad boys, come with me, come with me, yeah
Hi it's me, if you know what I mean
I said it's me, my name is Efti and I wan't you to see
That positive people live longer
Don't be negative 
Just be positive 
Chorus
You keep on asking me
Why can't we be together
I thought we had forever
I thought we love eachother
Some other day strong, now I feel alone
I'll know someway and I'll know someday
Chorus
I like it like it is
And I like it like it was
But I'm not so sure anymore, anymore
Chorus
