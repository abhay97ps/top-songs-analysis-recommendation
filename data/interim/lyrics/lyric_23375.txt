What?
I said you already know, nigga, Young gotta flow
Before rap, Young really got dough 
Before rap, Young really seen snow 
In the kitchen, 'bout to make some magic
Then blow it all in Magic 
Pull up on my partner in traffic
Gave it to him, it was all in plastic 
All I know, I ainâ€™t tryna go to jail 
Heard that shit closest thing to hell 
When it's stepped on, make it hard to sell 
When you been where I been, make it hard to fail 
'Cause I'm the realest nigga in this, y'all know it 
First nigga hittin' Magic in that 6-45 
Valet say, "Jizzle, nigga, stay in new shit
But everybody 'Bach back cause that nigga can't drive" 
Doors open up, I emerge with ten chains 
Even back then, they was calling me Ten Chains 
Ask me what I spent, I tell 'em, "It's no thing"
If I had it added up, it'd cost me like ten things 
We used to take a little show money just to throw money 
If it's on the floor, nigga, it's the floor money
If you brought it out to blow when you got it from the blow
Then that's why the fuck they call that shit "blow money" 
Still the realest nigga in this, y'all know it
Kept it one hunnid since the day I came through
My nigga hit me up, say he goin' out of town
So I threw him fifty thou', told him, "Bring me back two" 
Not only had my fingers crossed, I prayed 
Called this little piece up, got laid 
Then he walked in, threw 'em both on the table
Said, "Fuck that shit, young nigga, get paid" 
Then I whipped the Benzo on Lorenzo 
Stay down, nigga, yeah, I'm talkin' ten toes 
Hoes see me in this big pretty motherfucker
Bet I leave the parkin' lot with about ten hoes
I done seen it all, yay stacked seven feet tall 
Swear it look white like a wall 
What ya know about thumbin' through the hunnids, twenties and the fifties
Spendin' tens and the fives at the mall? 
I done seen it all, 20/20 Pyrex vision 
Catch a contact standin' next to my kitchen 
Hear the twenties, fifties, hunnids, the money machine clickin' 
And my Rollie ain't tickin', I ball
I done seen it all
Uncle died on the spot
Pop killed the family with heroin shots 
Gave my life to the block
Figured, I get shot, 'least I die on top 
I came alive in the drop
Big body all white, shit looked like a yacht, ugh 
I got 'em five grand a pop
Had a plug in Saint Thomas on a trillion watts, ugh 
Flew 'em back to the States
Parked ninety-two bricks in front of 560 State
Now the Nets a stone throw from where I used to throw bricks
So it's only right I'm still tossin' 'round Knicks, ugh
Probably brought your auntie a couple bags
I probably front your uncle a couple halves
Was in the S-Class, you was just in class
You know I was finna blow like a meth lab
Expanded the operation out in Maryland
Me and Emory Jones in the caravan
Took the show on the road out in VA
Dropped a couple off with Rolla in the PA 
Plug got shot, we started slowin' up
Took a trip down to see how he was holdin' up
The war's on, now, he got shot again
This time he was gone for good, then we got it in
Emory got knocked, we was down ten
The whole team hot, walls closin' in
Niggas can't tell me shit about this dope game
'Bout this cocaine, man...
I done seen it all, yay stacked seven feet tall 
Swear it look white like a wall 
What ya know about thumbin' through the hunnids, twenties and the fifties
Spendin' tens and the fives at the mall? 
I done seen it all, 20/20 Pyrex vision 
Catch a contact standin' next to my kitchen 
Hear the twenties, fifties, hunnids, the money machine clickin' 
And my Rollie ain't tickin', I ball
I done seen it all
