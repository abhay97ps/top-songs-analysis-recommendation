Time and time again
I keep trying to
Put you out of my mind
I can't concentrate
You're the only feeling
I can find
And it's taking over
Rolling me over
Seems like it won't stop
And I've lost control
Of my heart and soul
Cause when I see your eyes
Then I know I want you
When I hear your voice
That's when I know I want you
Losing all my defenses
You're slipping back
Inside of my head
It's getting so I can't
Exist without the thought
Of us together again
And it's taking over
Rolling me over
Seems like it won't stop
And I've lost control
Of my heart and soul
Cause when I see your eyes
Then I know I want you
When I hear your voice
That's when I know I want you
When I feel your touch
Then I know I want you
Then I know I want you
I want you
In my life
It's been so uncertain
Ties were broken
And it left me hurting
Maybe now I can
Trust again with you
And it's taking over
Rolling me over
Seems like it won't stop
And I've lost control
Of my heart and soul
Cause when I see your eyes
Then I know I want you
When I hear your voice
That's when I know I want you
When I feel your touch
Then I know I want you
Then I know I want you
I want you
Cause when I see your eyes
Then I know I want you
When I hear your voice
That's when I know I want you
When I feel your touch
Then I know I want you
Then I know I want you...
