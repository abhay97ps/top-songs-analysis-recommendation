Goodbye Joe, me gotta go down the Bayou
Me gotta go, pool the pirogue down the Bayou
My Yvonne, sweetest one, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we gonna have big fun on the Bayou
Thibodaux, Fontaineaux, the place is buzzin'
The kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Well, and-a dress in style, go hog wild an' be gay-o
Son of a gun, we gonna have big fun on the Bayou
Jambalaya, crawfish pie, an' a fil'e gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Well, a pick guitar, fill fruit jar an' be gay-o
Son of a gun, we gonna have a big fun on the Bayou
