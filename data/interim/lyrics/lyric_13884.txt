Dance
Dance
Dance
Dance, dance, dance
Slip and slide, take a ride
You want the best of both worlds
Caviar, it's hard to find
You're not a big city girl
You have dreams to make it big
Right off the Greyhound bus
Roses come from everyone
You're gonna have yourself some fun
When it's all done
You bite your tongue
You're feelin' so young
No cover-ups
You're never alone
If you hear the call
It's all for one
And one for all
Baby we can dance, dance, dance
Feel the heat of the rhythm
Feel the heat of my hand
Dance, dance, dance
I see the way that you're movin'
You need a little romance
You have pride, just try and fight
You'll take on anyone
Stupid pans and fans, no more laughs
It's only ten to one
It's gettin' late to worry 'bout a date
Still you have no one
Twist of fate, you know it's too late
You turn on everyone
When it's all done
You bite your tongue
You're feelin' so young
No cover-ups
You're never alone
If you hear the call
It's all for one
And one for all
Baby we can dance, dance, dance
Feel the heat of the rhythm
Feel the heat of my hand
Dance, dance, dance
I see the way that you're movin'
I think we have a chance
When it's all done
You bite your tongue
You're feelin' so young
No cover-ups
You're never alone
If you hear the call
It's all for one
And one for all
Dance
Dance
Dance
D-d-d-dance
Dance, dance, dance
Feel the heat of the rhythm
Feel the heat of my hand
Dance, dance, dance
I see the way that you're movin'
You need a little romance
Dance, dance, dance
Feel the heat of the rhythm
Feel the beat of the band
Dance, dance, dance
I see the way that you're movin'
I think we have a chance, chance
Dance, dance
We'll dance, dance, dance
We'll dance, dance, dance
