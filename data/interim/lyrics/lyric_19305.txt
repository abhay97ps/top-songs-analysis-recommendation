You complete me
Like air and water boy, I need thee
And when I'm in your arms, I feel free
Fallen
My head’s up in the clouds in love
I'm proud to say it loud
Like an accident it happened
Outta nowhere, it just happened
And I ain’t mad at all
Because I’ve…
Fallen
Head over heels, I've fallen
In love with you, I've fallen
And I can't get up
Don't wanna get up, because of love 
Fallen
Head over heels, I've fallen
In love with you, I've fallen
And I can't get up
Don't wanna get up, because of love
Baby
To let you get away is crazy
So I'm doin' what it takes
To make you pledge your love to me
You see, 'cause I'm tryna be your lady
For ever and ever, baby
The picture wouldn't be the same
If you weren't standin' next to me
Can't you see I've fallen?
Fallen
Head over heels, I've fallen 
In love with you, I've fallen 
And I can't get up
Don't wanna get up, because of love 
Fallen
Head over heels, I've fallen
In love with you, I've fallen
And I can't get up
Don't wanna get up, because of love
You complement me, not an accessory
You're necessary
You there with me, yeah? 
Are you here with me?
You’re my happiness, my joy 
And it’s all because of you, boy
I look forward to the time I spend with you
Whatever it is we do
'Cause I've fallen for you, boy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fallen, I've fallen for you 
Head over heels for you
So in love with you 
So in love, love
For you
Touch me 
Hold me 
Love me 
Kiss me 
Talk to me 
Caress me 
Play with me 
Explore me
