Every week's the same
Stuck in school, so lame
My parents say that I'm lazy
Gettin' up at 8AM's crazy
Tired of bein' told what to do
So unfair, so uncool
The day's too long
And I'm holding on
'Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's time when we're gonna
Breakout, let the party start
We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go, oh, oh 
Hanging out's just something we like to do
My friends, and the mess we get into
These are the lessons that we choose
Not a book full of things we'll never use
The day's too long
And I'm holding on
'Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's time when we're gonna
Breakout, let the party start
We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go, oh, oh 
Wish it would never end
Spendin' time with my friends
Oh, with my friends
Breakout, let the party start
We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go
Breakout, let the party start
We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go, oh, oh
