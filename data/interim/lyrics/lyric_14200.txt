Innocence, no answer to your breaking heart
If the situation sometimes falls apart
Then in this ecstasy, your charms are frozen
No emotion falling through your arms
Morning daydream, time still growing shorter
Take me over, lead me to the water
To the rhythm of love
To the rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
Why should I escort you to your secret needs?
Climbing up your ladder, I keep falling down
Anyway will do, anyone will do when you dance to your darkest tune
Surrounded, as you crawl around the room
Night time fever, burning 'til you're higher
Take me over, lead me through the fire
The rhythm of love
To the rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
To the rhythm of love
Morning daydream 
Midnight fever
Morning daydream
Midnight fever
Inhibitions keep you from your point of view
In this situation I have found you in
To the rhythm of-
Morning daydream
Midnight fever 
Morning daydream
Midnight fever 
The rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
To the rhythm of love
Rhythm of love
