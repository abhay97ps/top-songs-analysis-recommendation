When I awaken, feelin' no pain
Visibly shaken, waitin' to touch you again
My temperature's risin, but I'm fallin' a bit behind
And that ain't so surprising, were gonna take our own sweet time
Baby we can take our own sweet time
And spend it when we want to 'cus it's yours and mine
Let our love come easy and we find
We can make it and we'll take our own sweet time
I know when I hold you, it's a feelin' I can't explain
But I never told you, I couldn't take it again
But now I'm ready, I am ready to make you mine
So I'm holdin steady, and we're gonna take our own sweet time
Baby we can take our own sweet time
And spend it when we want to 'cus it's yours and mine
Let our love come easy and we find
We can make it and we'll take our own sweet time
