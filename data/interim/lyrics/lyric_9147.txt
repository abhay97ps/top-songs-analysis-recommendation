It's such a beautiful day that
The sky seems to say, "Good Morning"
Missed the dust off your shoes
Throw away ally our blues and start smiling
Take a good look around
There's no clouds looking down
Upon your way
So, won't you decide
To come back alive
It's a new day
Sunday sunrise shining
Through my windowpane
Chasing away my cares
With all the pouring rain
Sunday sunrise
Unfolding like a smile
Making me feel just like
A newborn baby child
Well, I'm feeling so good
I keep knocking on wood
I'm not grieving
I hear birds everywhere
Singing songs in the air
With a meaning
Saying it's time to wake up
Get a whole new outlook
From your view
Come on out
Where it's warm
It won't do any harm
If you want to
Sunday sunrise shining
Through my windowpane
Chasing away my cares
With all the pouring rain
Sunday sunrise
Unfolding like a smile
Making me feel just like
A newborn baby child
Sunday sunrise shining
Through my windowpane
Chasing away my cares
With all the pouring rain
Sunday sunrise
Unfolding like a smile
Making me feel just like
A newborn baby child
