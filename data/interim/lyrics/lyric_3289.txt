Yoka mata huba bakwa Juju Hand
Oooowwww! We got it now!
I've got an alligator claw and some booby dust
So you better do what you know you must
I got a lock of your hair and a bullfrog's eye
And if you break my heart you better say "Goodbye"
I got a yoka mata huba bakwa Juju Hand
This yoka mata huba bakwa Juju Hand sure is grand
Makes your eyes turn red and your tongue turn green
It's the strongest mess that you've ever seen
Mojo hand used to be real strong
It kept you straight when you did me wrong
As time went by you just got so mean
But the yoka mata huba bakwa is the thing
I've got a yoka mata huba bakwa Juju Hand
This yoka mata huba bakwa sure is grand
Makes your eyes look red and your tongue turn green
The yoka mata huba bakwa makes you scream:
Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Oooowwww!
Huba bakwa Huba bakwa
Mojo hand used to be real strong
It kept you straight when you did me wrong
As time went by you just got so mean
But the yoka mata huba bakwa is the thing
I've got a yoka mata huba bakwa Juju Hand
This yoka mata huba bakwa sure is grand
Makes your eyes look red and your tongue turn green
Its the strongest mess that you've ever seen
Oooowwww!
