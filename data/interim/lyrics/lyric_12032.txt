Never been strangers but we never met
Once I get some, I want all I can get
What could I say now? You already know
It starts with a feeling, it grows and it grows
The cafe is crowded, room full of noise
Music is loud and you don't have a choice
Used to be songs about people I knew
But somehow they all seem to be about you
Now every love song 
Every love song 
Every love song 
Is going to be for us tonight, girl
Every love song 
Every love song 
Every love song 
Is going to be for us tonight, yeah
In a crowd, we're all alone
The music's playing but it's all wrong
You know the words and you know the tune
But it always seems to end too soon
You got me turning around and around
The people are talking, I don't hear a sound
I search the sky and I wonder why
I can't relax and I can't get high
Every love song 
Every love song 
Every love song 
Is going to be for us tonight, girl
Every love song 
Every love song 
Every love song 
Is going to be for us tonight, yeah 
Love is what you have
What you need, mmm
Love is what you have
Mmm, it's what you need
Love songs
Every love song 
Oh, every love song 
Oh, every love song 
Is going to be for us tonight, girl
Every love song 
Every love song 
Every love song 
Is going to be for us tonight, yeah
Come on, baby
