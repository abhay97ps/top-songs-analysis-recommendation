Have you ever reached a rainbow's end
And did you find your pot of gold
Ever catch a shooting star
And tell me how high did you soar
Ever felt like you were dreaming
Just to find that you're awake
And the magic that surrounds you
Can lift you up and guide you on your way
I can see it in the stars across the sky
Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before
Now I finally realize
You see I've waited all my life for this moment to arrive
And finally, I believe
When you look out in the distance
You see it never was that far
Oh no
Heaven knows your existence
And leads you to be everything you are
Oh
There's a time for every soul to fly
It's in the eyes of every child
It's the hope, the love that saves the world
And, ohhh, we should never let it go
I can see it in the stars across the sky
Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before
Now I finally realize
You see I've waited all my life for this moment to arrive
And finally
I believe in the impossible
If I reach deep within my heart
Overcome any obstacle
Won't let this dream fall apart
See, I strive to be the very best
Shine my light for all to see
Cause anything is possible
When you believe, yeah
I can see it in the stars across the sky
Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before
Now I finally realize
You see I've waited all my life for this moment to arrive
And finally
Love keeps lifting me higher
Lifting me higher
Love keeps liftin me higher
I said love keeps lifting
Love keeps lifting me
I said love keeps lifting
Love keeps lifting me higher
Said love keeps lifting me higher
I said love keeps lifting me high
