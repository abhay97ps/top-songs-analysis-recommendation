Traffic crawls
Cell phone calls
Talk radio screams at me
Through my tinted window I see
A little girl
A rust red minivan
She's got chocolate on her face
Got little hands
And she waves at me
Yeah, she smiles at me
Well, hello world, how ya been?
Good to see you my old friend
Sometimes I feel, cold as steel
Broken like I'm never gonna heal
I see a light, a little hope, in a little girl
Well, hello world
Every day I drive by
A little white church
It's got these little white crosses
Like angels in the yard
Maybe I should stop on in
Say a prayer
Maybe talk to God
Like he is there
Ooh, I know he's there
Yeah, I know he's there
Well, hello world, how ya been?
Good to see you my old friend
Sometimes I feel, as cold as steel
And broken like I'm never gonna heal
I see a light, a little grace, a little faith unfurl
Well, hello world
Sometimes I forget what living's for
And I hear my life through my front door
And I'll be there, oh, I'm home again
I see my wife, my little boy, little girl
Hello world
Hello world
All the empty disappears
I remember why I'm here
Just surrender and believe
I fall down on my knees
Oh, hello world
Hello world
Hello world
