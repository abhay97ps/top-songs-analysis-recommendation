Iffy, can't decide which one I want
All the girls at the party, come along, it's a party we started 
Mixin' drinks, how much? Who knows
I pour one out for dead homies , the dearly departed, baby 
Ain't missin' the moment, ain't no spillin' 
Dude, I been livin', illin', tryna find it then I'm peelin'
You feel it?  All's good until I hit the ceilin'
Good riddance, I figured I'd be straight, just need a minute, just a second 
How it's been on overload in my zone, gone
Nothing else can fix the problem but this herb grown, grown
Yes, that there, it got mе on one 
Ain't no tweakin', I'm professional
Bеtter give a nigga room, I be back, round two
It's the soldier in me , let them fuckers envy 
Goin' 7th Heaven-bound, who goin' trippin with C? 
The rager from the dark 
Day fades and the sun goes away 
Same old nigga and the same old pain 
Ain't much change in me, y'all 
Seem like ain't nothin' change in me, y'all
Thank God I saw another day 
But I can't go escape what I have made, nah
Ain't much change in me, y'all 
Seem like ain't nothin' change in me, y'all 
Drop it , had me at "Hello", we in the spot
Can not stop it , ragin' with familiar, lames think they got it, not 
And you see me twistin' on the low, there he go
Yeah, baby, there he go, yeah, really, really 
Won't be out there lookin' crazy, hazy, ho 
And it's like I surf the waves forming in my dome
We keep floatin', hopin', coastin'
Ragin' through the day, sexy baby, turn me on-on 
Hear me out, hear me, hear me
Come on, ready or not, nigga comin' with it
Come on with the team, hear me, hear me
Oh no, hit 'em up and I'm rippin', rippin', isn't he? 
And I'm comin' full-blown to the tombstone 
How I'm livin', gotta push it, gotta set the tone 
It ain't nothin' to me, baby, say I'm livin' wrong 
 Day fades and the sun goes away 
Same old nigga and the same old pain 
Ain't much change in me, y'all 
Seem like ain't nothin' change in me, y'all
Thank God I saw another day 
But I can't go escape what I have made, nah
Ain't much change in me, y'all 
Seem like ain't nothin' change in me, y'all 
Hey, oh, hey, oh
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm-mm
Tell me where you're going
Tell me where you're headed
