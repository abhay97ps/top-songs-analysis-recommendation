Yeah, yeah, man you know what I'm sayin'
Makers
Young Gunna, Gunna, you know what I'm sayin', yeah
Run that back, Turbo
When I made my first million 
I ain't panic 
I only drank out the seal
Now I'm done with Xannies 
I bought my mama a crib, I'm outstanding 
I'm pressin' my cousin appeal 
'Til it's granted 
I bought her Sheneneh heels, I'm a Chanel bandit 
I still got vintage garments old as my granny 
Got my interior almond and outside candy 
I put your bitch in Balmain because she pretty 
Hey, hey, hey, freaky, I'm fuckin' her face 
Her ass is not comin' to waste 
I'm not patient, I don't wanna wait 
I eat goat, and I am what I ate 
I fill up a Backwood with a eighth 
Ain't no shame that I hang with some snakes 
Hey, hey, cashed out on a foreign today 
I hop in that 'Rari and race 
I never get tired of the hate 
Climb up to the top like a gate 
You lil' niggas copy and paste 
Got gold like a bottle of Ace 
A Coke Cola bottle her shape 
Hey, I had a ball today 
She drinkin' Chardonnay 
Went to court and didn't have to debate 
Jewish lawyer that handle the case 
The codeine got a hell of a taste 
Put the penthouse in all of your states 
Stack that money, that's all I can say
When I made my first million 
I ain't panic 
I only drank out the seal
Now I'm done with Xannies 
I bought my mama a crib, I'm outstanding 
I'm pressin' my cousin appeal 
'Til it's granted 
I bought her Sheneneh heels, I'm a Chanel bandit 
I still got vintage garments old as my granny 
Got my interior almond and outside candy 
I put your bitch in Balmain because she pretty 
Hey, hey, fuck her whenever I want 
I cash out, get whenever I want 
Knock some fours on that cat like a donk
Fly the jet in the sky like a hawk 
I geek up and I get in the zone 
I put all them racks in a vault 
Hey, hey, we rich and above the law 
I made my brother a boss 
And she keep that dick in her jaw 
Keep receipts to the shit that I bought 
Cuban link to my wrist when I floss 
Carats stuck in my teeth when I talk 
You gon' notice the C's when I walk 
Hey, this a pent, it is not a loft 
We got the Jeep, that is not a Trackhawk
If I put on white, then it's gotta be Off 
She don't say a word, but her body can talk
Sexy girl turnin' me on
You wanna know what that Cartier cost? 
Put a Rolex on her arm
When I made my first million 
I ain't panic 
I only drank out the seal
Now I'm done with Xannies 
I bought my mama a crib, I'm outstanding 
I'm pressin' my cousin appeal 
'Til it's granted
