Welcome

The new world
I'd like to make a small dedication tonight to the bitches of the world
Now to make this understood, I'm gonna explain somethin' to you
Check this out
Bitch!
To be a bitch, you don't necessarily have to have a pussy in your pants
In fact
Most, if not all, of the bitches I know 
Have little peckers, little dicks
And that's what they are you dig?
A bitch ain't nothin'
But a muthafucka that wanna come up
From another muthafucka 
Hard work
Don't make no sense to these muthafuckas
 dumbass muthafuckas
To make it really really clear to I'mma explain it to ya in a story form
Like this here
Check this out
I remember the way it started
Once upon a time
When a nigga named Dre came, Diggy got signed
Ruthless nigga, everything was all good
In the shit, cause you rollin' wit' some Boyz N the Hood
No One Can Do it Better, see, cause I'm an MD
And when I fuck it up, you give me 25 G's
Eazy-E said, "Yeah, oh yeah!"
So I took it
Forget the paperwork
The money made me overlook it
I rose up quick from the pit I was in
450 0300 Benz
Nothin' but ends, money bought friends
Got me in a cross
Now everything's lost 
This is when I found out
"Look at this shit!"
You was slippin'
You ain't gonna tip for what that nigga did
"My shit fucked up, Dre, you need to look"
"I ain't trippin', yo, I think your little homie, he a crook"
The spot got shook, it was hell below
Is that the future shock?
Hell, no, it's Death Row
I was all in because of the begin
Then they would say
Yo, we all gon' win
So "The Chronic" was upon us, the music awards
But I was still broke at the crib when they toured
The album soared and I got bored
With niggas talking shit, they came up on a lick
Ain't that a bitch?
I coulda been the star dude
Or maybe I shoulda stab out like Ice Cube
But what about your Dogg?
Who? Snoop? we was tight
I hung around, we'd get together when he'd write
In the pound that's the way it come together
When it's goin' down, niggas is in whatever
I went outside for a minute and came back
Niggas was talkin' crazy like they wanted me to rap
So I did somethin' from the old LP
"Damn! That's that shit!"
"That's what a nigga want to see"
Visit the Windy City and light keys
Rock over 17,000 G's
I recognized game
The shit was kinda funny
Fucked-up voice shit, nigga make money
He came back and here comes the glory
And this is the way I'm gonna end this story
I was only 19
Lookin' for a dream
From what I put out
I never got a fuckin' thing
This and the wreck was the fucked-up part
It's just a little somethin' about some real heart
From Ruthless to Death Row do we all part
Bitches, see ya
Trick-ass, trick-ass bitch
Bitch
Trick
Trick-ass
La-la-la....
 The Doc is
] The Doc is

To all the peoples in the house, po' I'mma let 'em know
