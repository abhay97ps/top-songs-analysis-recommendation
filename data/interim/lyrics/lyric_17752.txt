If I had the chance
To make love to you again
I'd hold you in my arms
And I'd never let it end
I'm feeling so afraid
A love I have betrayed
Alone I cried and thought
About the big mistake I've made
I wish I could explain
I'm the only one to blame
I've hurt enough of both of us
And time will ease the pain
And how I regret that day
And now that you've gone away
I'd give anything to bring you back home to me
If I had the chance
To make love to you again
I'd hold you in my arms
And I'd never let it end
If I had the chance
Just to be with you once more
I'd give the kind of love
That you'd never had before
I've learned my lesson well
My life's an empty shell
Without you, without you
There's no story left to tell
I believe
I believe you and me can find the love we had
And you'd see that we can make it better
'Cause together we were once so strong
But now you've gone
And how I regret that day
And now that you've gone away
I'd give anything to bring you back home to me
If I had the chance
