There's a little black spot
On the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday
There's a black hat
Caught in a high tree top
There's a flag pole rag
And the wind won't stop
I have stood here before
Inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles
Running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping
That you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny
To be the king of pain
There's a little black spot
On the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday
There's a black hat
Caught in a high treetop
There's a flag pole rag
And the wind won't stop
I have stood here before
Inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles
Running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping
That you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny
To be the king of pain
There's a fossil that's trapped
In a high cliff wall
There's a dead salmon
Frozen in a waterfall
There's a blue whale beached
By a spring tide's ebb
There's a butterfly trapped
In a spider's web
I have stood here before
Inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles
Running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping
That you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny
To be the king of pain
There's a king on a throne
With his eyes torn out
There's a blind man looking
For a shadow of doubt
There's a rich man
Sleeping on a golden bed
There's a skeleton
Choking on a crust of bread
King of pain
There's a red fox torn
By a huntsman's pack
There's a black-winged gull
With a broken back
There's a little black spot
On the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday
I have stood here before
Inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles
Running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping
That you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny
To be the king of pain
King of pain, king of pain
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain
