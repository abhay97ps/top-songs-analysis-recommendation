You've been
Missing
Out on all the chances you've been given
Is it something
Within
Holding you back instead of living?
Your day is coming though it seems far
Things will be clear when you love who you are
Nothing can stop you as long as you listen to your heart
Lift your head to the sky and keep tryin'
Believe in you, and it will take you higher
Lift your head to the sky and keep tryin'
Believe in you, and it will take you higher
You have
Sorrows
Everywhere you turn they seem to follow
If you
Let go
Happiness will come to you tomorrow
Your day is coming though it seems far
Things will be clear when you love who you are
Nothing can stop you as long as you listen to your heart
Lift your head to the sky and keep tryin'
Believe in you, and it will take you higher
Lift your head to the sky and keep tryin'
Believe in you, and it will take you higher
Oh
Yeah
Yeah, baby
Oh, ho-oh-oh
Oh
You can make it if you try, you can make it
Lift your head to the sky and keep tryin'
Believe in you, and it will take you higher
Lift your head to the sky and keep tryin'
Believe in you, and it will take you higher
Lift your head to the sky and keep tryin'
Believe in you, and it will take you higher
Lift your head to the sky and keep tryin'
Believe in you, and it will take you higher
Lift your head to the sky and keep tryin'
Believe in you, and it will take you higher
Lift your head to the sky and keep tryin'
Believe in you, and it will take you higher
