Don't ride your bike off a ramp that's more than three bricks high
Don't take that candy from the store if you ain't got the dime
Don't pick a fight with a little guy that doesn't talk that much
Don't pick up a cherrybomb thinkin' it's a dud
And don't sneak out of a 2 story house usin' bed sheets for a rope
Don't ask me how I know
Sell your truck while it's still runnin', save the Jesus off the dash
Say a prayer when you feel like cussin', save your money pay with cash
Forget your pride, buy the roses, if you're sorry tell her so
Don't drink the water in Mexico
Don't ask me how I know
Don't quit your high school football team halfway through the season
Don't bust your buddy in the nose when you know he didn't mean it
Don't lose a girl you love at home for a night in Panama City
Don't rush off the phone when your Mama calls you ain't that busy
Ya oughta make that drive to say goodbye to your grampa â€˜fore he goes
Don't ask me how I know
Forget your pride buy the roses, if you love her tell her so
Don't go to Vegas with your heart broke
Don't bum your cousin for that first smoke
I'm tellin' ya, don't drink the water in Mexico
Don't ask me how I know
Don't ask me how I know
I just know
Sell your truck while it's still runnin', say a prayer when you feel like cussin'
I know
