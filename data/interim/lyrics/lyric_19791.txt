Yo, now I'm an eastside resider
Keep niggas liver than hotter
Stanking like clam chowder
If they thinking that they wilder 
Every since I can remember
I been toting that tember
Keep the block hotter than July in the middle of December 
Niggas better know my M-O 
From Houston down to the NO 
Came a long ways from Lindberg's flying
The back of a remo 
You can catch Nukey posted up
Right off Exit 65
With some real ass niggas 
Who ain't selling bean pies 
Just to get them green guys
Baby momas we hide 
Catch them hoes by surprise
Froze with they mouth wide
Even tough guys get duck taped and hog tied
Cause me, Jody, Jeezy and Gee gone always ride

Five in the morning on the corner clockin' 
Yeah we wrong but dare a nigga try to stop us 
And you can get it, anywhere anybody
