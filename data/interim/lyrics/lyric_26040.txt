You can tell I've been here before

Made her fall in love, then beg for distance

She leavin' and she's never comin' back
This won't be the first time
Ayy, movin' like a thief in the night, yeah

Guess I'll just re-roll the dice 
This won't be the first time
He played some games, then he died
I'm sorry if I brought that pain to your life 
She left without saying goodbye
