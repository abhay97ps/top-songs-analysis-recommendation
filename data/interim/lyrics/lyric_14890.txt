Backstreet fightin' is looking for trouble
If you open your mouth, you're bound to rumble
Johnny looks tough, he's frozen the ice
He keeps his mouth shut, he don't tell no lies
Johnny went out last night, got in a barroom fight
Embarrassed a jealous man in front of his cheatin' wife
The man said, "Tonight you won, but I'll tell you, son
This one's far from over", Johnny said
Big talk is just talk unless
Unless you're backin' it up
Big talk is cheap talk, it's
Only words unless you're backin' it up
I don't know why so many lay down and die
Don't they believe in what they're sayin'?
You should get on your feet, believe you can't be beat
Remember, talk is only playin'
Big talk is just talk unless
Unless you're backin' it up
Big talk is cheap talk, it's
Only words unless you're backin' it up
I remember what my old man used to say
Never give up and run
Don't let the talkin' breeze blow you away
Always remember, stick to your guns
Big talk is lookin' for trouble
If you open your mouth
You better be ready to rumble
Big talk is just talk unless
Unless you're backin' it up
Big talk is cheap talk, it's
Only words unless you're backin' it up, I said
Big talk is just talk unless
Unless you're backin' it up
Big talk is cheap talk, it's
Only words unless you're backin' it up
We all say
Big talk is just talk unless
Unless you're backin' it up
Oh, we're backin' it up
We're backin' it up, yeah
