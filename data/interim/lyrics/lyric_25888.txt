Yeah
I just left your viewing at the Staples Center 
Obama wrote you a letter, yeah, you made it, nigga 
I even heard you had some plans to come to Vegas with us
And them suckers could never kill you, it only made you bigger 
And every time I see some fire, I see blue
And every time I close my eyes, see Snupe and I see you
When I be on the Westside , you know how we do 
Hustle and motivate, turning one into a two 
Two into four, hurt my heart, I seen you on the floor
Do it for the hood, man, I don't even wanna do it no more
When these niggas you do it for, they'll shoot you and all
Only thing I can say is you with Allah, blessings 
And I ain't finna sit here, act like I'm your main homie 
But when we lost you, it really put some pain on me 
Got me scared to go outside without that flame on me 
And when them niggas went against me, you ain't change on me 
Told me it was wrong or right, some of my longest nights 
You made me cry, nigga , and I don't cry, nigga 
You the first one made me feel like I could die, nigga 
'Cause real niggas never die, you know the vibes, nigga , yeah
Couple days ago, was chilling with my youngins
Seen your kids on the 'Gram, it made me sicker to my stomach 
And as the marathon continue, we keep running 
But I'm like, damn, I wish you seen that pussy coming, for real
I wish I knew when the storm came 
How many tears did you cry when you lost someone?
We did this shit all for the gutter, woah, w-woah, woah
Did this shit for my lil' brother, woah, w-woah, woah 
Had to stare through these tears, 'cause I see you every time my eyes close 
Asking myself why you had to go, but only God knows 
I was in Miami when I lost you, I ain't talk about it 
I remember I bawled out in tears when I saw your body 
And the flight back home, had cold days in LA 
Had to turn off my phone, throw on the shades, and meditate
What you know 'bout wishing goin' blind to hide your tears?
Had a lot of murder on my mind, but in God, I fear
Took Yompton and Crenshaw around the globe in a year 
'Member ridin' solo, now it's Escalades in my rear 
I just hustle, motivate, be prolific, hold down the state
My big brother Hussle the great, I know Cobby Supreme relate
I know J Roc, Hoggy relate
Blacc Sam, Adam relate, Key to J Stone relate
Lauren, Pacman, it's love, I wanna see you do great
I wish I knew when the storm came 
How many tears did you cry when you lost someone?
We did this shit all for the gutter, woah, w-woah, woah
Did this shit for my lil' brother, woah, w-woah, woah 
Had to stare through these tears, 'cause I see you every time my eyes close 
Asking myself why you had to go, but only God knows
