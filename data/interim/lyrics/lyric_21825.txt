As I lay me down
Heaven hear me now
I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all
Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to?
I look to you
I look to you
After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong
I look to you
I look to you
Yeah
And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song
I look to you
You
About to lose my breath
There's no more fighting left
Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door
And every road that I've taken
Mmm
Led to my regret
And I don't know if I'm goin' make it
Nothing to do but lift my head
I look to you
I look to you
Yeah
And when all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong
I look to you
I look to you
Ohh
And when melodies are gone
Yeah
In you I hear a song
I look to you 
Levees are broken 
Yeah
Wall come down 
Coming down on me 
Rain is falling 
'feat is calling 
Need you to set me free
Take me far away from the battle
I need you
Shine on me
I look to you
I look to you
After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong
I look to you 
I look to you, ohhh, ooooh 
And when melodies are gone 
In you I hear a song
I look to you
Yeah
I look to you
Ooooh
I look to you
