Where do all the hippest meet? 
Where the dancin' is elite 
Side by side we're loose and neat
When we're stompin' down the street
Hurry down, baby she's the hippest street in town!
Meet me, on South Street, oh yeah, hurry on down
Come on now, meet me on South Street
The hippest street in town
Well you take West Street, East Street, North Avenue
 South Street's the best street
To have a ball with you
Do you hear that groovy beat? 
Don't it make you move your feet? 
Everybody gathers round
Cause they dig that crazy sound
Now hurry down, baby she's the hippest street in town
 Meet me on South Street,  oh yeah, hurry on down
Come on now, meet me on South Street, the hippest street in town
 West Street, East Street, North Avenue
 South Street's the best street
To have a ball with you
 Meet me on South Street,  oh yeah, hurry on down
Come on now, meet me on South Street, the hippest street in town
 West Street, East Street, North Avenue
 South Street's the best street
To have a ball with you
