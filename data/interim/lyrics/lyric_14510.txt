I've been here too long
There's a big world out there
I wanna know how it feels
South American, begin
To the rhythm of the street
When I catch his eye
Under Brazilian sky
Body and soul will meet
We will be lovers, imagine
Dancing under a Latin moon
We will be lovers, imagine
Dancing under a Latin moon
I'm gonna be there soon
Under a Latin moon
New York winter streets
Your dream is real
Dream boy's far from here
Wanna know how it feels
Wanna sweep in town
See the sights and sounds
In the tropical night heat
Fire lights the sky
As I obey my eyes
Body and soul will meet
We will be lovers, imagine
Dancing under a Latin moon
We will be lovers, imagine
Dancing under a Latin moon
I'm gonna be there soon
Under a Latin moon
South American, begin
To the rhythm of the street
Fire lights the sky
As I obey my eyes
Body and soul will meet
Lovers, imagine
Dancing under a Latin moon
We will be lovers, imagine
Dancing under a Latin moon
I'm gonna be there soon
Under a Latin moon
Lovers, imagine
Dancing under a Latin moon
We will be lovers, imagine
Dancing under a Latin moon
We will be lovers, imagine
Dancing under a Latin moon
We will be lovers, imagine
Dancing under a Latin moon
