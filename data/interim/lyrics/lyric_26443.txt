Yeah, woo
We was in the trenches tryna get it out the mud
Lookin' up to killers tryna figure who I was
Sold the Richard Porter, I just wanna feel the love
I feel like a Crip 'cause I can't even trust my blood 
Loyalty , I say, "Spoil me"
You ain't my dawg, you fallin' out about no lawyer fee 
You had a brick and I ain't even have a quarter key
You never seen my hand out, I knew it was more to me
It's more than us to see our sons and all our daughters eat
'Cause I got cops tryna lock me, opps out tryna slaughter me
But I stay prayed up, loadin' all these K's up
'Cause I ain't get advicе from all them nights back when I stayed up
Don't hit mе 'bout no show if you ain't come to set the stage up
We God body, threw a thousand shots, they barely grazed us
And I can't let 'em make my grave up
I just hope this money take the pain away
And I've been tryna save my money for a rainy day
But I just bought that Rolls truck to take the pain away
And all these diamonds give me confidence
Don't judge my pain if you don't know the shit that I'm against, ayy
The Percocet'll take your pain away 
One nigga tellin' will take the gang away 
Washin' blood with bleach don't wash the stain away 
Seen my brother die, he died the strangest way 
Hangin' with the real, won't hang with lames today 
Bein' counted out, I had to make a way 
Snaked by one of my dawgs, I had to stay away 
Millions dollar cash put up for a rainy day 
For a rainy
Durkio, I'm different with it 
I praise the trenches like I ain't lose none of my niggas in it 
I pray my daughter don't go through what I go with different women 
And I'm talking 'bout all the different niggas 
And I don't get these niggas 
Why these niggas tryna hang like they ain't lynchin' niggas? 
The opposition be sayin' my name, tryna get attention with it 
I know an opp, he was suspect, now he a victim with it 
I just hope this money take the pain away
And I've been tryna save my money for a rainy day
But I just bought the Rolls truck to take the pain away
And all these diamonds give me confidence
Don't judge my pain if you don't know the shit that I'm against, ayy
