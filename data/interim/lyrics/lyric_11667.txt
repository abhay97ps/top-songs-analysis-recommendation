She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
Her body measurements are perfect in every dimension
She's got a figure
That's sure enough paying attention
She's poetry in motion
A beautiful sight to see
I get so excited viewing her anatomy
She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like
She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
Looks like she's poured into the gold
She's bad
The essence of beauty
Ooh, such lovely hair
She's foxy, classy
Oh, sexy, sassy
She's heavenly
A treat for the eye to see
She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like
She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
Whoo, whoo!
La la la la
La la la la la la

Whoo, whoo!
La la la la
La la la la la la
La la
Whoo, whoo!
