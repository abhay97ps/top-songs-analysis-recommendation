You know my woman told me, she said
"Bo Diddley, I love you, but I'm leavin'"
I said, "What?"
She said, "I love you but I'm leavin' you"
And I said, "Baby?"
And she kept sayin', "Whoa baby, I love you"
What you say, girl?
Ooh, I love you
Ooow! Somethin' wrong here someplace
Wait a minute!
She said, "Here's the key to all of your locks
Take my name off of your mailbox
Here's the key to your Cadillac
I got my own parked right out back"
I said, "What?"
There somethin' wrong here
And she kept talkin' 'bout

Wow! Woo, somethin' wrong

Wait a minute!
Let me tell you what else she told me
She said, "You know one thing, Diddley

In the middle of the dining room floor
I'm all packed and ready to go"
I said, "But baby, whoa baby

I said
"Woo you ain't

She kept talkin' 'bout
"Ooh baby,
