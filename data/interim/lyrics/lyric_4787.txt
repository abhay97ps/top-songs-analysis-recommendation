Mama, I'm telling you
As sure as I am standing here
She's my girl, and that's the way
I'm keeping it, now mama dear
No good will it do you
To stand there and frown at me
The girl's got my heart
And my love's comin' down on me
My love's comin' down since I
Got a taste of wild honey
You know she's got the sweetness of a honey bee
Wild honey
She got it on and stung me good, yes siree
With all the other stud bees
Buzzin' all around her hive
She singled me out
Single-handed took me alive
Can you dig I'm gonna take my life
Eatin' up her wild honey?
Oh mama, she's sweeter
And sweeter
Sweeter, sweeter 
Sweet wild honey
Let me tell you how she really got to my soul
It ain't funny
The way she makes me wanna sing a little rock and roll
There's nothing quite as sweet
As a kiss of wild honey
I break my back workin'
Just to save me some money
So I can spend my life with her
Sock it to me, wild honey
Wild honey, she's mine
Oh, wild honey, she's mine
