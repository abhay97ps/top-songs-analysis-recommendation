Good morning starshine
The earth says "hello" 
You twinkle above us 
We twinkle below 
Good morning starshine
You lead us along
My love and me as we sing
Our early morning singin' song
Gliddy glub gloopy, nibby nabby noopy
La la la lo lo
Sabba sibby sabba, nooby abba nabba
Le le lo lo
Tooby ooby walla, nooby abba nabba
Early morning singin' song
Good morning starshine
The earth says "hello" 
You twinkle above us 
We twinkle below 
Good morning starshine
You lead us along
My love and me as we sing
Our early morning singin' song
Singin' a song, lovin' a song
Singin' a song
Lovin' a song, laughin' a song
Singin' a song
Sing a song, song a-singing
Song song song sing
