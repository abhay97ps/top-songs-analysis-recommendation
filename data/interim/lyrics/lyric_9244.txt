Well, it's six a.m
I'm out on the job
Working like a fool
For my pay
A big man walks by
With a smile
Says you got to go
On strike today
Hey, hey, Mr. union man
How am I gonna pay my dues
Or the landlord or the doctor
How am I getting new shoes
Well, I know I need
To help to get that raise
There's one thing I don't like
Tell me how can I
Feed my hungry family
I you say I'm going on strike
Hey, hey, Mr. union man
How am I gonna pay my dues
Owe more money than I can pay
Looks like I'm bound to lose
Well, I don't see how
I'm going to get ahead
Seem like there ain't no way
Well, said don't worry
Cause I understand
Won't you try to
See things my way
Hey, hey, Mr. union man
Thank you for the helping hand
Hey, hey, Mr. union man
So glad you understand
Hey, hey, Mr. union man
So glad that you understand
Hey, hey, Mr. union man
Thank you for the helping hand
Hey, hey, Mr. union man
So glad that you understand
