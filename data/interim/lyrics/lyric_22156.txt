Check this out baby girl, I want you to check out a nigga
Cattttt Dadddyyyyy!
Man I go to work, true winner
Jeans skinny, like Squidward
Lookin' for your girl, just missed her
Did my cat daddy and I took her down, timber
Wrist cold, mamma call it winter
Swisher full of nuggets, daddy calls it Denver
Baby got ass chelsea calls its thinnest, UPS checks get it we deliver
Cat daddy when I dougie, cat daddy when I member
 Rockin' skinnies, they for Rej3ctz, I remember
Competition see the Creez, they surrender
Smokin' Wyclef kush, Now I'm gone till November
Move your arms like your wheel chair stunt'n
Drop low grab your shoulder like yo fuckin'
Tell Power 106 to bang this shit
Big up to my bro Sam, he the king of this shit

Stackin' Krabby Patties

You heard of Too Short?
I'm too long
I'm in the club all black goin' Akon
Like headlights
I'm too on
Do my cat daddy and I'm going nuts, acorn
I'mma muthafuckin' fool for this
When it come to the yard, I'm the coolest kid
I'm in my prime barbecue rib
And these milfs like pubes all around my dick
I block a hater like a goalie
Pockets guacamole
Checks in effect ashy neck like a rollie
Did it with your chick she hate the Cat Daddy lonely
Give her jungle fever I'm Lamar and she's Khloe
Yea I'm crackin' like a newborn rooster
Take your chick in the mall, yea we call that booster
Dont get mad, it's your chick, she's choosing
Cat Daddy haters screamin' "What the fuck you doin'?"
Tell them all Cat Daddy â€˜fore I 
Big Chain, costs a couple stacks, man
Thick chain cost a couple grand
Jhawk slap them in the track, Do the dance
You gon' wanna learn it for yourself
Yea I'm up in the range rover, Parked like Yosemite
Blow like a champ, dog. Smokin' like a chimney
Study of matter, The energy is chemistry
Haters don't matter, Bitches drink my energy
I'm fitted in the front, I Cat Daddy
Then come up swing my arms, Cat Daddy
Baby I'm thuggin'
Every weekend I'm clubin'
Niggas show me love-in, the fade it's nothin'
Green on me, every day St. Patricks
Ever since the day I was born I been a star, Patrick
Cat Daddy, Cat, Cat Daddy,
