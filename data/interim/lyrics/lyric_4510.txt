He's out there tripping in the streets
The sidewalk floats beneath his feet
He's shaking ever body's hand
But he's not disclosing that he's
He's chasing every body
Displacing every body
He's doing every one he can
Plastic man
He's on the t.v. selling cars
He interrupts old movie stars
And he can sell like any plan
But he's not disclosing that he's
He's chasing every body
Displacing every body
He's doing every one he can
Plastic man
This man is working day and night
He's hip to psychedelic light
He even does the puk-a-lu
But he's not disclosing
He's recruiting you
He's chasing every body
Displacing every body
He's doing every one he can
Plastic man
