Zombie up, let em see the full drip
Boy you ain't, no you ain't, all the way
No you ain't got it, 50 clip poppin
Leave em slump in the cockpit these bullets moshpit
All this drip be flooding on the floor you gotta mop it
Niggas ain't just coming new they coming out the closet
We poppin again we gon' zombie your friends
I might hop out a Bentley, go slide in a Benz
Slip on my Fendi go shop with your bitch
Bought a Glock with your rent, told her just top the tip a little
You a bop but you low key got sense a little
Do your job baby come and get that work work till you paid
Get a purse get that bag
When you squirt do it spray, can you twerk while I bang it
Swerving in the latest, niggas nervous on them papers
Yeah I heard them allegations ain't no words to be exchanging
I only cheat on my bitch for the bankroll that shit ain't cheating it bring home a bankroll
Zombie up
We outside where its lit up at
Make your bitch a housewife you don't get a bag
Hey, Tryna find out where they do that it
All these phones identifying where the shooter at
I don't know what you see if you can't see me on motherfucking top 
We just can see who you are we can see who the fuck you are not 
I know your lane this ain't the same
This ain't your lane we ain't the same
I know your language ain't the same
This ain't your lane we ain't the same
So solid, drip on broke faucet
Your bitch outta pocket like a rich trick wallet
Can't be buying fools gold from a false profit
Who think they the hottest, cuz they being melodic
They hit his shit and throw it up like its making a vomit
White bitch heaven in a hellcat speeding demonic
You gotta nigga cool beans you don't follow up
I been unbothered gotta pop it for a profit don't stop it
Ice baby zero Fahrenheit very very slight, woah, diamonds on berry white
OT hit the tree with the vacuum sealer
We never see your notes like a back-up singer
No roof just air where the ceiling at
Make your housewife a hoe 
We in the back of the club no gang just shorty
Lamar Jackson ain't check me for the 40 duh
We outside where its lit up at
Make your bitch a housewife you don't get a bag
Hey, Tryna find out where they do that it
All these phones identifying where the shooter at
I don't know what you see if you can't see me on motherfucking top 
We just can see who you are we can see who the fuck you are not 
I know your lane this ain't the same
This ain't your lane we ain't the same
I know your language ain't the same
This ain't your lane we ain't the same
