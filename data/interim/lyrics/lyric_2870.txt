I walk along the city streets
You used to walk along with me
And every step I take recalls
How much in love we used to be!
Oh, how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me!
I was born to love you
And I will never be free –
You'll always be a part of me!
Awho-ooo-ohhh-oh
When shadows fall
I pass the small cafe
Where we would dance at night
And I can't help
Recalling how it felt
To kiss and hold you tight!
Oh, how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me!
I was born to love you
And I will never be free –
You'll always be a part of me!
Awho-ooo-ohhh-oh
Whoa-oh-ooo-ohhh
If you should find you miss
The sweet and tender love
We used to share
Just come back to the places
Where we used to go
And I'll be there!
Oh, how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me!
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
When there is always something there to remind me!
Always something there to remind me!
Always something there to remind me .
