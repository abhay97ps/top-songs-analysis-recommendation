Monday's so good
Tuesday's so cruel
One day you're so happy now
The next day, you're in tears
So you take it while you find it
Or leave it like it is
That's the way it's always been
That's the way love is
Wednesday's alright
But Thursday's all wrong
One day you're all with it, baby
The next day it's all gone
So you take it while you find it
Or you can leave it like it is
That's the way it's always been
That's the way love is
Friday, you'll beg her
Saturday, she'll plead
One day she says, she loves you
The next she might leave
So you take it while you find it
Or you can leave it like it is
That's the way it's always been
That's the way love is
It seems so fair sometimes
But that's the way love is
It makes you wanna cry
But that's the way love is
I know, you don't know
What I'm talkin' about, baby
'Cause I don't believe, you ever been in love
But that's the way love is
