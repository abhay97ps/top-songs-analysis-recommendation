Oh, oh, yeah
Ooh my mercy
Ooh, how I remember daddy
He was strong and had a built in tan, yeah
And though he only stood about five feet seven
My daddy was a heck of a man, yes he was, y'all
He loved us all and we knew it, yeah
Though he showed it in a very funny way
For most of the time he was a-cussin' and fussin'
When he said what he had to say
Now, now, now
Daddy couldn't read
Daddy couldn't write
But one thing daddy sure could do right
He could swear
Oh, Lord, I declare
Yes, he could, y'all
Daddy could swear
I declare, oh mercy
I still remember seein' him in the backyard
Just a-pickin' and a-paintin' away 
Ooh, my brothers and sisters
Still talk about how
Daddy lost his temper that day 
You see, he built a picket fence
From the garage to the house
Well, tell me what I say
The same day the garbage man
Backed into the fence
And the whole darn thing gave way
You should have been there
Daddy couldn't read 
Daddy couldn't write 
One thing daddy sure could do right
He could swear
Oh, Lord, I declare
Yes, he could, y'all
Daddy could swear
Oh, Lord, I declare
Yes, he could, y'all
Tell 'em about
Tell about your daddy
My daddy was a 
"What you say? Watch your mouth"
My daddy was a 
"What you say? Watch your mouth"
My daddy was a 
"What you say? Watch your mouth
Ooh, no
My, my, my, my, my daddy wasn't no scholar, no
No, he didn't have a PhD 
Hah, but in my eyes and down in my heart
My daddy means the world to me 
He'll probably go out 
Cursin', just a-fussin'
And a-bein' mad
But I hope the Good Lord will understand 
That my daddy's is just bein' my dad
Now, now, now, now
Daddy couldn't read
Daddy couldn't write
But one thing daddy sure could do right
He could swear
Oh, Lord, I declare
Ooh y'all, yes he could
He could swear 
I declare, ooh my mercy
Mercy, that's my daddy 
He could swear y'all 
Talkin' 'bout daddy 
I declare y'all 
That's my daddy 
Ooh lord 
Talking 'bout daddy 
I declare y'all 
That's my daddy 
He could swear y'all 
Talking about daddy
