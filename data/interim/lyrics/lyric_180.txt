Knock, knock, knock, knock
Knock, knock, knock, knock
Crazy little mama come knocking
Knocking at my front door
Crazy little mama come knocking
Knocking at my front door
Crazy little mama come
Knock, knock, knocking
Just like she did before
If you got a little mama
And you want to keep her neat
Keep your mama off my street
Same thing will happen
Like it did before
She'll come knock, knock
Knocking at my door
Crazy little mama come
Knock, knocking
Just like she did before
If you got a little mama
And you want to keep her neat
Keep your mama off my street
Same thing will happen
Like it did before
She'll come knock, knock
Knocking at my door
Crazy little mama come knocking
Knocking at my front door
Oh, oh, she come knocking
That crazy little mama
She comes back knocking
Knocking at my front door
If you got a little mama
And you want to keep her neat
Keep your mama off my street
Same thing will happen
Like it did before
She'll come knock, knock
Knocking at my door
Crazy little mama come knocking
Knocking at my back door
If you got a little mama
And you want to keep her neat
Keep your mama off my street
Same thing will happen
Like it did before
She'll come knock, knock
Knocking at my door
Crazy little mama come knocking
Knocking at my front door
