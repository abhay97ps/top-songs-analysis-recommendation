Uh, hit me
Don't explain, you never change
Same old thang, same old game
Say ya want to be wit' me
But show me my ring, baby, let me think
I been in the cold
The story untold about to unfold
How do you expect me
To ever believe you want be wit' me
Why you all in my grill? 
Can you pay my bills? 
Let me know if you will 
'Cause a chick gotta live 
Talk is talk, and talk is cheap
Tell it to her, don't say it to me
'Cause I know I'm in control
See, Trix are for kids, and boo I'm too old
Go 'head with your games
Don't ever come back to me again
Where you go, remember me
I'm the best thing in history
Why you all in my grill? 
Can you pay my bills 
Let me know if you will 
'Cause a chick gotta live
Third time 
I moved you in, took you back
In my life 
I don't know what's wrong with me
Third time 
I moved you in, took you back in my life 
Why you all in my grill? 
Can you pay my bills? 
Let me know if you will 
'Cause a chick gotta live 
Why you all in my grill?
Can you pay my bills? 
Let me know if you will 
'Cause a chick gotta live 
If you want me, where's my dough?
Give me money, buy me clothes
No need for talking, have my dough
Where's my money? Where's my clothes?
If you want me, where's my dough?
Give me money, buy me clothes
No need for talking, have my dough? 
Where's my money? Where's my clothes?
Why you all in my grill?
I'm thinkin' it's time to chill
Yeah, but you wanna drill, though
I couldn't even step out the baby blue Bonneville
Cuz you be tryin' to kill my ho, my girlfriend
And people around me is tellin' me that you's a stalker
Like Darth Vader takes a Skywalker
I told you I was the street talker
It ain't my fault you gave me your Victoria's Secret's
And your Frederick's
You wanted the Waldorf Astoria
But instead I took you to Cedric's, to entertain you
To give you to the "G", and never claim you
Me and Missy, we gettin' straight pissy
And oh yeah, we puffin' on one of them thangs too
You blamin' who? You namin' who?
I know you ain't bringin' that lame crew
Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sax
G pretty D, are they same, boo
But I'm backed by the Dungeon Family
So you can go 'head wit' all that stabbin' me
Cuz I will jab thee, and slam thee
And Bobby Boucher yo' ass, G
Yeah, yeah, huh
