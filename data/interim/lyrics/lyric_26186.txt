Yeah, I swear this gon' fuck the summer up
Niggas hatin' on me 'cause I'm comin' up
Fuck you all night, we ain't gon' stop until the sun is up
Make you mine for a little
You should let me break your spine just a little
Got your shawty on my pistol, made her empty out the clip
I swear I'm too official, I could never stress a bitch
I done lost a couple soldiers, every day I reminisce
And I could've took his bitch, but her pussy smelled like fish
Me and all my niggas on the ship like marijuana
Only time a nigga hit my phone is when there's drama
Niggas feel a type of way 'cause I do what I wanna
While you was scared of sharks, I was posted with piranhas
I heard that you freaky, maybe you should teach me
I'm afraid to tell you how these other bitches treat me
Don't gotta worry, I'ma pull up when you need me
How my bitch bad is what I wonder like I'm Stevie
I know it's been way too long
I know niggas did you wrong
I said you could call my phone
When you need me, hit me when you need me
I swear to God you better never try to leave me
I want you to myself, I swear to God I'm greedy
I gotta move a type of way, no, it ain't easy
'Cause at the light is where these niggas tryna leave me
I gotta be cautious, these niggas like to talk shit
I remember when I pulled up on your shorty and she lost it
I was in the trenches, I was moving with them bosses
You was on the benches, you was dwelling over losses
I know it's been way too long
I know niggas did you wrong
I said you could call my phone
When you need me, hit me when you need me
I know it's been way too long
I know niggas did you wrong
I said you could call my phone
When you need me, hit me when you need me
Let me hold you
Girl, don't stress nobody
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on
Let me hold you
Girl, don't stress nobody
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on
I know it's been way too long
I know niggas did you wrong
I said you could call my phone
When you need me, hit me when you need me
I know it's been way too long
I know niggas did you wrong
I said you could call my phone
When you need me, hit me when you need me
