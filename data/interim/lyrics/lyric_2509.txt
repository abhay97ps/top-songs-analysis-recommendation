Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
What's the matter with you, baby, what's the matter?
What did I do wrong?
Do you really want to know?
I want to know, what's the matter with you, baby?
You know that you done me wrong
Sorry, didn't mean no harm
Oh baby, let me take you out tonight
Make every little thing all right
You know you told me there would never be another
And you know you lied
When you lied, you hurt me, baby
When I left and I went away
I didn't know how much I loved you until today
Oh baby, leaving me wasn't right
And now you want to take me out tonight
Mary, won't you let me get on your good side?
If I did that, Marvin, it would hurt my pride
Hey, let me make it up to you if I can
I can't do it, don't you understand?
What's the matter with you, baby, what's the matter?
I told you that you done me wrong
Well, can you forgive me, Mary, please forgive me?
I'll try, but it'll take some time
Hurry up, hurry up, before I lose my mind
I've got a feeling everything is going to work all right
But you can't take me out tonight
Whoa, whoa, whoa
