Hey you!
What?
Get up out your seat!
I got a soulful treat with a disco beat
For the young and old that like to roll their feet
So take some time while you're truckin' on down
And listen, and listen, and listen, and listen
And listen to the best MCs in town
Well I'm Bas, I'm Rick, kings on the mic
So get on the floor and do what you like
We got a rock and roll boogie from the promiseland
And when it start to rock, you just clap your hands
I wanna tell you all somethin' that's really hip
So just put on your skates and don't you dare slip
If skating is your thing you gotta do it with skill
'Cause if you don't, ha ha, you're gonna miss the thrill
And when you get on the floor, be sure to please
And then you skate around the rink with the greatest of ease
Now Willie was a country friend of mine
He was slick and so divine
He wasn't really happy in his country town
So he said to himself it's time to get down
He said to his women I gotta leave this place
I gotta go the city, gotta show my face
She said 'Please Willie, please' don't go away', just
Bounce
Rock Skate
Roll Bounce
Rock Skate
Roll
She said 'Please Willie, please don't leave me alone
This place in the country is where you belong'
He said 'Bye-bye, baby', I got the groove
It's the city life, baby, and I got to move'
Willie's women cried out but he didn't care
He caught the next plane and was in the air
And when his plane landed on solid ground
He went to a party which was way uptown
The party was def and there was major turnout
They was skating real good without no doubt
Willie said to himself 'I gotta try this out'
So he brought in some skates and started to style
At first, country fella didn't do so well
So he slipped, bang, then he fell
Willie said to himself 'What's wrong with me?'
I gotta try to catch on to this skating beat
A women came by and shot his nerve
Put a dent in his hip with a with a vicious curve
'Come on, come on and get down'
She winked her eye and then she started to skate
So Willie went to her and asked her for a date
Slippin' and a-slidin' he caught her fast
And right about then he made his pass
She told him he could skate without no slack
And you can even skate back to back
'Who me?' 'Yes you!' A new talent is born
His name is Willie Wheels from this day on
So you put on your skates and stand at ease
You point your toes and then you bend your knees
And then you give a little twist from side to side
Then you're doin', then you're doin'
You're doin', you're doin'
You're doin', huh, The Willie Glide
The Willie Glide, Willie Glide, Willie
Willie Glide, Willie Glide, Willie
The Willie Glide, Willie Glide, Willie
Just clap your hands, everybody come on
And everybody clap your hands, 'Why?'
'Cause we are the entertainers
And we want you to be our fans
Now if you got a pair of skates that are on the go
Scream it out and say 'ho'
'Ho!'
And ya don't stop
Come on Disco Rick and give it what you got
And if the people in the crowd have no debate
Somebody say 'Let's roller skate!'
'Let's roller skate!' You don't quit
And come on, Basic, into the ultimate
You know my name is Bas, I got a master's degree
Studied on the basis of Astrology
And if you would like to be much more please
My sign, ha-ha, is a pisces
My  is , my color is green
I am an independent, with the likes to succeed
Money to me is just a little thing
So come on, Disco Rick, give the crowd a little sting
I'm the capital D-I-S-K-O
With the R-I-K and we're 'bout to go
Don't gimme no ketchup or no salt 
'Cause if you don't get a freak it ain't my fault 
If don't get a freak you shouldn't really care 
The sounds that you hear is deaf to your ear 
With the style, finesse and the debonaire 
So all you fly, fine females has got to beware 
Because the boy Disco Rick is in the atmosphere
