Girl Of My Best Friend
Ral Donner
Peaked at # 19 in 1961
Ral's voice sounded so much like Elvis's, he was used as a narrator of the 1981
Docudrama "This Is Elvis."
 The way she walks
 The way she talks
 How long can I pretend?
Oh, I can't help it, I'm in love with the girl of my best friend
 Her lovely hair
 Her skin so fair
 This could go on and never end
Oh, I can't help it, I'm in love with the girl of my best friend 
I long to tell her how I love her so
And hold her in my arms, but then 
What if she got real mad and told him so?
I could never face either one again 
Ah, hah, umm
The way they kiss 
Their happiness 
Will my aching heart ever mend?
Or will I always be in love with the girl of my best friend?
 Please make it end
 Oh, let it end
 Why won't it end?
FADE
