She got me in a rush yea
I’m just smoking black leaf, in the back seat of a Honda
She give me head rush and now I’m back right to the start
Little bitch got the munchies, edibles, ran through em’ all
She keep mumbling, “I’m a funny kid”
Quiet in person, yea she on the funny shit
New carbon the sheets, all white interior
Bentley the four seater
I’m flooding my wrist, diamonds got water
Change like the 4 seasons
Got wet like the ocean, diamonds not solid
A young nigga gotta get older gotta get toxic
She flooding the scene, as if she want the attention off of me
She tell me it’s cold outside stop cuddling on my chain
’The Winter Piece’
I don’t got no ties
‘Self Made’ is all I chant till I’m deceased
I cut a bitch off can tell she sorry, hell its been like quite a min
That nigga fell off, ain’t got a good punchline
Can tell that I’m the shit, I’m stunting with Ralph and Murakami on me
Summertime ‘86
I’m boutta go off ain't even gotta do much
I’m fucking her in her uvula
Right side and it’s too tucked
6 out of 9 on my ruger 
Goodbye hoe, I’m stashing, I flip up my check, no government files
The white, that shit all on my teeth no efferdent in my hoe
Said he can’t drop the location, sent that nigga right home
He admit ain’t got nothing on me baby, said that he want my goals
Take it back when we went to the day when cade said he gone ride the ghost 
Said Im hot, she put that on her family
Why she gone sit here doing the most
Put me on pedestal Ima shine, First Place or nothing at all
Ima pass her the keys to my home
I got a victory, I’m boutta make history
She never been in a foreign, we takin it back to the old days
She said I make her glow keep in mind this your hoe
“Oh it’s nothing at all she’s just doing her job”
She said I make her cold
Know something I don’t know
Check what I’ve been told
Just check what I’ve been told
Ima pass her the keys to my home
She boujee she want go to Saks every week and hour
Take all the shit don’t want it back, just wanted me for my dough
I leave with no strings attached that’s why I’m saying “Bye hoe”
I’m stashing, I flip up my check, no government files
The white, that shit all on my teeth no efferdent in my hoe
Said he can’t drop the location, sent that nigga right home
He admit ain’t got nothing on me baby, said that he want my goals
Take it back when we went to the day when cade said he gone ride the ghost
Said I’m hot, she put that on her family
Skrt, the lamborghini white chrome
All I gotta do is text your baby, and she is my hoe
I been overdue at bout like three venues, get the cash and I’m gone
No diff between me N’ the broke boys round me
I still wear the same clothes
I been stacking cheese I gotta move it vaguely
Tom be wrecking my motives
I said Tom be wrecking my motives
I’m doing the deed but niggas can never find nothing on me
She begging and pleading, “better stop talking and you better show me”
No government files, you can never find nothing on me
World Ethernet, it’s time that me and my niggas take over
