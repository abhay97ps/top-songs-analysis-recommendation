A penny for you thoughts
I've got to know where I stand
I just got to know where I am with you
So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Walkin' holdin' hands, you say you're mine all mine
Then soon another face steals your eyes away
It's just a guessing game, and I can't help feelin' used
Love shouldn't be so darn confused
So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
People love to talk, they say you're usin' me
Though face to face you swear I'm the only one
If I had a crystal ball I would gaze into your mind
See what you were thinkin', if my ship was sinkin'
If you're leavin' me behind
So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Girl, it should be so darn easy to do
If you love me like I love you
Girl, if I had a crystal ball 
I would gaze into your mind
See what you were thinkin', if my ship was sinkin'
If you're leavin' me behind
So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Girl, it should be so darn easy to do
If you love me like I love you
So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss 
A dime if you tell me that you love me 
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts , a nickel for a kiss
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
