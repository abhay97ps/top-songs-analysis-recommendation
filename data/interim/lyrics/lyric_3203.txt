I've always had the upper hand where our love was concerned
But now you've upped and left me and I think it's time you learned
If you're not back here in my arms by the time I count to ten
Well, I'll wait just a little while, then I'll count again
When you were mine I had you like a puppet on a string
So now you'd better listen 'cause I'll tell you one more thing
If your lips aren't next to mine by the time I count to ten
Well, I'll wait just a little while, then I'll count again
I'll count the lonely hours I spent 'cause I was blind
I'll count the things I'll do to make you change your mind
I'll give you love and kindness and I'll buy you presents too
I'll try so hard to always make you happy when you're blue
So if you're not back here in my arms by the time I count to ten
Well, I'll wait just a little while, then I'll count again
Yes, I'll wait just a little while, then I'll count again
