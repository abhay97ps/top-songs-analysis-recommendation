You don't understand what it is
That makes me tick, but you wish you did
You always second guess, wonder if I'll say yes
But you just lose out every time
If you only knew what I talked about
When I'm with my friends, just hanging out
Then you'd have the inside scoop on what to say, what to do
That way, when you play the game, baby, you could never lose
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall?
A creepy little, sneaky little fly on the wall
All my precious secrets, yeah, you know them all
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall?
You'd love to know the things I do
When I'm with my friends, and not with you
You always second guess, wonder if there's other guys Iâ€™m flirting with
You should know by now
If you were my boyfriend, I'd be true to you
If I make a promise, I'm coming through
Don't you wish that you could see me every second of the day?
That way you would have no doubt that, baby, I would never stray
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall?
A creepy little, sneaky little fly on the wall
All my precious secrets, yeah, you know them all
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall?
A little communication
Well, that'll go a long way
You're getting misinformation
Too much hearsay, hearsay
And what I say is
Come a little closer
And what I'm gonna say is
Don't ya?
Don't ya?
Don't ya?
Don't ya wish you were a...
Hey!
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall?
A creepy little, sneaky little fly on the wall
All my precious secrets, yeah, you know them all
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall?
