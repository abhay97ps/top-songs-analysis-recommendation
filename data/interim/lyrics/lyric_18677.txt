Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah
It's over and done, but the heartache lives on inside
And who is the one you're clinging to instead of me tonight?
And where are you now?
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go, go
Cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart, it's just emotions taking me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song
But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin'
Don't you know, there's no—
And don't you know, there's no—
Kiss goodnight
I'm there at your side, apart of all the things you are
But you gotta find some one else
You gotta go find your shining star
And where are you now?
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go, go
Cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart, it's just emotions taking me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song 
But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin'
Don't you know, there's no—
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Nobody left in this world
Goodnight
And where are you now?
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go
Cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart, it's just emotions taking me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song
But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin'
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight
