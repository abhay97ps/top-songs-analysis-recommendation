Tears keep on falling
For the fool that you see
Tears keep on falling
For your loves not for me
The love I discarded
Has left me broken hearted
Love came too late for me
You weren't there to wait and see
Love was a fun thing
Just a game to be played
Love was a fun thing
But the arrow ricocheted
So I'll always love you
And hope someday you'll find
That this fool you can't keep out of your mind
Love was a fun thing
Just a game to be played
Love was a fun thing
But the arrow ricocheted
So I'll always love you
And hope someday you'll find
That this fool you can't keep out of your mind
