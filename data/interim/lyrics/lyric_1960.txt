Two girls for every boy
I bought a '30 Ford wagon and we call it a woodie
You know it's not very cherry, it's an oldie but a goody
Well, it ain't got a back seat or a rear window
But it still gets me where I wanna go
And we're goin' to Surf City, cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun
Ya, we're goin' to Surf City, cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun, now
Two girls for every boy
You see they never roll the streets up cause there's always somethin' goin'
You know they're either out surfin' or they got a party growin'
Well, with two swingin' honeys for every guy
And all you gotta do is just wink your eye
Ya, we're goin' to Surf City, cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun
Ya, we're goin' to Surf City, cause it's two to one
Ya, we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun, now
Two girls for every boy
And if my woody breaks down on me somewhere on the surf route
I'll strap my board to my back and hitch a ride in my wetsuit
And when I get to Surf City I'll be shootin' the curl
And checkin' out the parties for a surfer girl
And we're goin' to Surf City, cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun
Ya, we're goin' to Surf City, cause it's two to one
Ya, we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun, now
Two girls for every
