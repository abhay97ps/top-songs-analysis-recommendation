I always thought I was doing fine
Spreading myself around another good time
Then it hit me from out of the blue
I was falling in love with you
But now everything's been changed
My hopes, my dreams
Are rearranged, it's true
And it's all because of you, my baby
I'll be loving you all my life
'Til my dying day is through
I'll be loving you forever
I'll be loving you all my life
'Til my dying day is through
I'll be loving you forever
Every night I wonder if you know
No matter what they say, I won't let go
Don't ask yourself if I'll always be there
'Cause forever's how long I'll care
As time goes by and the feeling gets stronger
To be in your arms, can't wait any longer
Look in my eyes and you'll see it's true
Day and night, all my thoughts are of you
I'll be loving you all my life
'Til my dying day is through
I'll be loving you forever
I'll be loving you all my life
'Til my dying day is through
I'll be loving you forever
I'll be loving you all my life
'Til my dying day is through
I'll be loving you forever
I'll be loving you all my life
'Til my dying day is through
I'll be loving you forever
