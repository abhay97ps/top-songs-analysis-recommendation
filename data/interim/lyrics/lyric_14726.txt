Lately, I have noticed the change in me
I'm not as restless as I used to be
And theres so many things I want to do
But only with you
Cause now that I found what i'm searching for
Theres no need to look for love anymore
And this feeling I have is so deep inside
I know it can only be right
Chorus:
That you, you're the one that I adore
Your the one my heart beats for
And theres no place i'd rather be
Cause you are the one for me
Where ever I go
And whatever I may do
I'm overcome with all these thoughts of you
And I just love the way your making me feel
I know this is real
Cause now you've become such a part of me
Not a hope or a dream but reality
And I won't try to hide, i'll just let it show
I think that its time you should know
Chorus
You're my one and only desire
You're the one who takes me higher
And theres no doubt you hold the key
Cause you are the one for me
Cause now that I found what i'm searching for
Theres no need to look for love anymore
And this feeling I have is so deep inside
I know it can only be right
Chorus
You're my one and only desire
You're the one who takes me higher
And theres no doubt you hold the key
Cause you are the one for me
Chorus
