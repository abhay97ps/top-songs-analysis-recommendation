I'm just a gigolo and everywhere I go
People know the part I'm playing
Paid for every dance, selling each romance
Ooh, what they say
There will come a day when youth will pass away
What will they say about me?
When the end comes, I know
It was just a gigolo
Life goes on without me
I'm just a gigolo and everywhere I go
People know the part Dave's playing
Paid for every dance, selling each romance
Ooh, what to say
There will come a day when youth will pass away
What will they say about me?
When the end comes, I know
It was just a gigolo
Life goes on without me, 'cause
I ain't got nobody
Nobody cares for me, nobody
Nobody cares for me
I'm so sad and lonely
Sad and lonely, sad and lonely
Won't some sweet mama come and take a chance with me?
'Cause I ain't so bad
Better love me, babe
Sad and lonesome, all of the time
Even on the beat, on the, on the, on the beat
Bop, boze-de-boze-de-bop, se-de-bop
I ain't got nobody
Nobody cares for me, nobody
Nobody, hey, say
Feelin' so sad and lonesome
Ain't got nobody
Woohoo, sad and lonesome
Need love
Humala bebuhla zeebuhla boobuhla
Humala bebuhla zeebuhla bop
I ain't got nobody
Nobody, nobody cares for me, nobody, nobody
I'm so sad and lonely
Sad and lonely, sad and lonely
Won't some sweet mama come and take a chance with me?
'Cause I ain't so bad
Been a lonely soul
Been lonesome all of the time
Even on the beat
Johnny, Johnny on the beat
Need a long tall darling, mama
David said he got nobody I loves
Ain't got nobody , nobody 
Nobody , nobody 
No one , no one 
Loop-de-loop 
Darling, darling 
Getting serious 
Got to see the walls 
Over there 
Nobody , not no one 
Nobody , nobody 
Nobody , nobody 
Nobody 
Nobody cares for me
