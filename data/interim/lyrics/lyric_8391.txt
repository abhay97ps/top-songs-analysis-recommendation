After midnight we're gonna let it all hang out
After midnight we're gonna chug-a-lug and shout
We're gonna cause talk and suspicion
Give 'em an exhibition
Find out what it is all about
After midnight we're gonna let it all hang out
After midnight gonna shake your tambourine
After midnight gonna be peaches and cream
We're gonna loose our inhibitions
Start a new superstition
Find out what it's all about
After midnight we're gonna let it all hang out
Cause talk and suspicion
Give 'em an exhibition
Find out what it is all about
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang out
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang out
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang out
