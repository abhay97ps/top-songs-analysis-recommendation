You've been good company, always by my side
Appreciate your revelry, and all your southern pride
It's time for me to holler back and leave you with this now
Oh, it's time for a revolution
Oh, it's time for a revolution
Yea so rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Oppression in a southern nation, but don't let it get you down
The rebel soul seeks salvation, take it from the ground
Tired words of a soldier who leaves his world behind
Oh, it's time for a revolution
Oh, it's time for a revolution
Yea so rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
So sing a song to yesterday, take me back in time
Back when lyrics meant something, efore the music died
Skynyrd, Marshall Tucker Band, Allman Brothers and the CDB
Oh, it's time for a revolution
Oh, it's time for a revolution
Yea so rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
