Yeah, uh, FA-BO-LO-US, uh Desert Storm
Uh, uh, yo, You just don't know all I got is you
You wanna pick up the phone the only one that call the spot is you
Only one that ever withdraw out the knot is you
You walk from spring to fall in the hottest shoe
It's just two-way tag and batin
Sittin in the jag debatin
Whether to go mags or datons
Sometimes relationships get aggravatin
Know now it's real
And J know how it feel, uh Couzier
I wanna tell y'all about my old lady
Sometimes I think she's really crazy
She blacks out at the drop of a dime
But she's still my baby
She likes to get into confrontations
With me testing my patients to see how far she can go before
I loose my head
Sometimes I love her, sometimes I love her not
I ain't letting her go cause she's all I got
Although she nags me and complains a lot I ain't letting her go
No, no, no
The next minute she could be sweet
As ever minute from ear to ear that's why were together what
Could make her change so fast, it's very confusing
Many times I felt like up and leaving oh girl
But I'm way too deep in love with her, as crazy as she
Is I want her to have my kids
With her I have grown
With her home is home 
I would never turn my back
On my baby I can't do that
Uh, If you heard what the F I did
You woulda left my house on Fire like left eye did
I done stuck through the naggin
And pushed from sedan to the coupe to the truck to the wagon
You gotta have faith and some patience
Stop trippin mama you could get the safe combination
It's nothin but love
Make sure you put nothin above
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S, uh
