Sometimes I feel like
There's no use in trying
Why can't I face the fact
We've lost, we'll never get back
I don't know where
Where did we go wrong
I say I'm leaving but
My feelings are too strong
And, baby, you know, I'm in love, baby
So in love with you, darling
And I'll never be leaving
No, I'm just make believing
I'm in love, darling
So in love with you, baby
When I say I'm leaving
Girl, I'm just make-believing
Mmm hmm, I ain't going nowhere
No, baby, I ain't going nowhere
Oh, darling, talk to me
My, my, my, my, my
Girl, you're the
Habit I can't break
I'd fall apart if you
Weren't there when I awake
I've said I'm leaving
But I don't have the heart
I can't picture you, baby
You and I being apart
If I say goodbye
It doesn't mean I'm going
And if I say there ain't no love
You may still see it showing
Ooh, ooh, baby
Why can't we be lovers
Oh, darling, from loving you
I'll never recover
If I say goodbye
It doesn't mean I'm going
And if I say there ain't no love
You may still see it showing
Ooh, ooh, baby
Why can't we be lovers
Oh, darling, from loving you
I'll never recover
Baby
Why can't we be lovers
Oh, darling, hey, from loving you
I'll never recover
Cause I'm in love
So in love
And I'll never be leaving
I'm just make-believing
I'm in love
So in love
And I'm make-believing
When I say I'm leaving
I'm in love, baby 
 so in love with you, darling
And I'll never be leaving
Girl, I'm just make-believing
I'm in love
Ooh, so in love
And I'll never be leaving
Just make believing
Just make-believing
I'll never be leaving
Just make-believing
I'll never be leaving
I ain't going nowhere
