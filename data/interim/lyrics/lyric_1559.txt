Hey, now you better listen to me, everyone of you
We got a lotta, lotta, lotta, lotta work to do
Forget about your woman and that water can
Today we're workin' for the man
Well, pick up your feet, we've got a deadline to meet
I'm gonna see you make it on time
Don't relax, I want elbows and backs
I wanna see everybody from behind
'Cause you're workin' for the man
Workin' for the man
You gotta make him a hand
A-workin' for the man
So I'm pickin' 'em up and I'm layin' 'em down
I believe he's gonna work me into the ground
I pull to the left, I heave to the right
I wanna kill him, but it wouldn't be right
'Cause I'm workin' for the man
Workin' for the man
Gotta make him a hand
A-workin' for the man
Well, the boss man's daughter sneaks me water
Every time her daddy's down the line
She says, "Meet me tonight, love-a me right"
And everything is gonna be fine
So I slave all day without much pay
'Cause I'm just a-bidin' my time
'Cause the company and the daughter, you see
They're both gonna be all mine
Yeah, I'm gonna be the man
I'm gonna be the man
Gotta make him a hand
If I'm gonna be the man
A-workin' for the man
A-workin' for the man
I gotta make him a hand
Workin' for the man
