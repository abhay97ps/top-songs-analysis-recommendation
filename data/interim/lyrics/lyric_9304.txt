I've got a feeling
That we'll be seeing
Each other again
I've got a feeling
That we'll be seeing
Each other again
Let's not say goodbye
Let's just say so long
It didn't work out this time, girl
Chances are that we'll get it on
Cause I've got a world of faith
That we're gonna make it someday
Some other time and situation
I know we can form a
Stronger relation
Cause I've got a feeling
That we'll be seeing
Each other again
Someday, someway, girl
I've got a feeling
That we'll be seeing
Each other again
The short time I've known you
I have truly found that you
Are the kind of the lady
I love to be around
But your hangups
As well as mine
Wouldn't know how it
To happen this time
But I'm the kind
Who truly believes it
And try it again, if you
First you don't succeed
I've got a feeling
That we'll be seeing
Each other again
Someday, someway, girl
I've got a feeling
That we'll be seeing
Each other again
Now, baby, listen to me
I've got the feeling
And I'm missing you
I've got the feeling
That you miss me too
I've got the feeling
That I'll be with you
Oh, girl, miss you, too
I've got a feeling
That we'll be seeing
Each other again
Someday, someway, girl
I've got a feeling
That we'll be seeing
Each other again
Believe me
Cause I love you
I've got a feeling
That we'll be seeing
Each other again
Can't you see it
One more time, girl
