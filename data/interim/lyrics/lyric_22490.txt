You know my old car needs washing
And the front yard needs a trim
And the telephone keeps ringing
And the bossman knows I know its him
And the bills aren't going to pay themselves
Don't matter anyway
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
There's nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole
And the smell of early spring
Sit down in a fold-up easy chair
On a quiet shady river bank
Let the world go on without me
Wouldn't have it any other way
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
Ain't in no hurry
I'd be a fool now to worry
About all those things I can't change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait until tomorrow
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
When I must return
To the cold cold ground
Have them take their time
When they lay this sinner down
Heaven knows that I ain't perfect
I've raised a little cain
And I plan to raise a whole lot more
Before I hear those angels sing
But there'll be hell to pay
But I'm in no hurry
Ain't in no hurry
I'd be a fool now to worry
About all those things I can't change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait until tomorrow
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
Ain't in no hurry
Ain't in no hurry today
