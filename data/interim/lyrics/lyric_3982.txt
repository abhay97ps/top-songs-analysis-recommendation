It's so hard loving you
But I don't wanna let you go
Little darling I need you 
Little darling I love you 
Little darling I want you 
Little darling I've got to have you 
And if it means giving up my life
I'm going to give it up  give it up
There's always one who loves more than the other
But I don't mind, I don't mind
I'm willing to pay the price
Have your love at any sacrifice
Little darling I need you 
Little darling I love you 
Little darling I want you 
Little darling I've got to have you 
I know there's two or three in your life
You like as well as me
So if I have to be your #1 fool
Before you care, care about me
I'm willing to pay the price
Be your #1 fool, make that sacrifice
Ooo hoo, only my finger knows how many tears I've cried, baby
Only my heart knows the awful hurt I feel inside, baby
My life is so lonely, waiting for you to love me only
I'm willing to pay the price
Be your #1 fool, at any sacrifice
Little darling I need you 
Little darling I love you 
Little darling I want you 
Little darling I've got to have you
