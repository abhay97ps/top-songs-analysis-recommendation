I remember setting out just to see what I could see
Streetcars rolling by and airplanes flying high they all meant nothing to me
No one ever looked my way or knew that I was there
I kept walking and the rain kept raining
Until all the streets were bare
Oo feeling fine mama
Painted ladies and a bottle of wine mama
Oo Feeling good mama
They took my money like I knew they would
La la la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la
City lights were shining on me through my window pane
I kept thinking bout the day when Id be home again
Rocking chairs and summer fairs and swimming in the sea
I kept drinking, sinking till there was nothing left of me
Oo feeling fine mama
Painted ladies and a bottle of wine mama
Oo Feeling good mama
They took my money like I knew they would
La la la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la
