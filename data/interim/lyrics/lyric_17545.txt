I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back
Here's another one
Uh 
I remember being on that nigga's shit hard 
Back in the days in the projects 
Chasing after him, a lil' young chick 
Seeing him made me go back in my lab and write this lil' shit like this, check it out 
Here's how it goes, used to see you when I went to the store
Always watch you play ball from my bedroom window
And the places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with
The spot in the grass where you kept your stash
Used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes
If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive
Tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs
With hopes to get close to you
Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep
Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets 
Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we'd meet
Used to pray every day for the day that we'd meet
Used to hang with your sis, if she only knew 
I only hung with that bitch to get closer to you 
Wasn't no limit to the things I would do
To give all my love to you, my God 
Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
You are my shining star
My guiding light, my love fantasy 
There's not a minute, hour 
Day or night I don't love you 
You're at the top of my list
'Cause I'm always thinking of you 
All my love 
A thousand kisses from you 
And it wasn't enough 
I just don't wanna stop, too much, never too much 
Never too much, never too much 
Stopped being by yourself, now you hung with a crew
I took the bangs out my hair over the summer, I grew
Me and my friends, all virgins, all learning
How to throw that shit, how to blow that shit
Talked about that sex like I was used to it
Lied about how many you used to kiss
In the hallways, all day, 'til it was real
In the staircase, lights out, gettin' our feels 
Wrote your name in my notebook, we all did that
Lined our names up with numbers to see if they matched 
Scared to death 'bout the first time, I knew it would hurt
In your house, on your mother's couch, she was at work
Dead wrong, but headstrong, ya had me sprung
The only one I ever loved ever since I was young
Once in a while I even cut school
To give all my love to you, my God 
Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
You are my shining star
My guiding light, my love fantasy 
There's not a minute, hour
Day or night I don't love you 
You're at the top of my list
'Cause I'm always thinking of you 
All my love 
A thousand kisses from you 
And it wasn't enough
I just don't wanna stop, too much, never too much
Never too much, never too much 
Yeah, dedicated to the first love 
Uh, you know who you are 
From the hood, it's all good , yeah
We gon' bounce to this, uh
We make moves with this 'cause all my love's to you
Now bounce
