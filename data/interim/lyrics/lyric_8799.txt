Harbors open their doors to the young searching foreigner
Come to live in the light of the big L of liberty
Plains and open skies, bill boards would advertise
Was it anything like that when you arrived?
Dream boats carried the future to the heart of America
People were waiting in line for a place by the river
It was time when strangers were welcome here
Music would play
They tell me the days were sweet and clear
It was a sweeter tune, and there was so much room
That people could come from everywhere
Now he arrives with hopes, and his heart set on miracles
Come to marry his fortune with a hand full of promises
To find they've closed the door, they don't want him anymore
There isn't any more to go around
Turning away, he remembers he once heard a legend
That spoke of a mystical, magical land called America
