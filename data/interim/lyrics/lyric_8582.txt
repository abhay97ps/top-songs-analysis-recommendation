In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with colonel jackson down the mighty mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we fought the bloody british in the town of new orleans
We fired our guns and the british kept a comin'
There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico
Oh we looked down the river and we seen the british come
There must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on a drum
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring
We stood behind our cotton bales and didn¹t say a thing
Old hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
If we didn¹t fire our muskets till we looked 'em in the eyes
We held our fire till we seen their faces well
Then we opened up our squirrel guns and gave 'em a little...well....we...
....fired our guns and the british kept a comin'
There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico
We fired our cannons till the barrels melted down
Then we grabbed an alligator and we fired another round
We filled his head with cannonballs and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind
We fired our guns and the british kept a comin'
There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico
We fired our guns and the british kept a comin'
There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico
