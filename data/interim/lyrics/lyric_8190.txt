If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine
Got laid off down at the factory
And their timing is not the greatest in the world
Heaven knows I've been working hard
So Christmas could be right for Daddy's girl
I don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be the happy time of year
But my little girl don't understand
Why Daddy can't afford no Christmas gear
If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine
