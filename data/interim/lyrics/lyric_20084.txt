Telling you, "I miss you"
Baby, am I doing too much? 
Why you tryna diss me, when I just wanna kiss you
Baby, am I doing too much? 
Tell me, what's the issue?
Who I give these lips to?
Baby, am I doing too much? 
This is turnin' into
Something I ain't hip to
Baby, am I doing too much? 
See, you got me all alone
Waiting right here by the phone
For you to call me, just to hear your voice tone
I keep on wonderin' if you was even feelin' me
I keep on wonderin' if this was even meant to be
Tell me, am I wasting time?
Boy, you're showing me no signs
Is it 'cause you on your grind?
'Cause you always on my mind
I keep on wonderin' if everything you said was true
I keep on wonderin' if you were really comin' through
Now here I go again, blowin' you up
And my girlfriends keep telling me, I'm doin' too much
Now here I go again, blowin' you up
And my girlfriends keep telling me, I'm doin' too much

I'm out with my girls
Tryna have a good time 
And you know I'm looking fly
Tryna meet some other guys
But it gets hard sometimes, 'cause there ain't no one just like you 
I try my best, but I can't shake this feel you got me through
All I can picture is the color of your eyes 
And the way you make me smile, I ain't felt this in a while
But I came to a conclusion
That this is pure illusion
Chaos and confusion
But I'm not gon' let it ruin
The way I feel about myself, 'cause I got self-esteem 
Sometimes I wonder if I'm just chasin' a fantasy
The way I feel about myself, 'cause I got self-esteem 
Sometimes I wonder if I'm just chasin' a fantasy

Just leave your name and number
And I'ma holla at ya
Just leave your name and number
And I'ma holla at ya
Just leave your name and number

Just leave your name and number

Ronnie Ray, all day
Women in the hallway
Erryday
Losin' track, of the people tryna call me
Don't take this the wrong way
I been havin' long days
Doin' it, movin' 'round the town
Wherever I'm gettin' my song played 
Now here I go again, blowin' you up 
And my girlfriends keep telling me, I'm doin' too much 
Now here I go again, blowin' you up

Ohh, whoa
