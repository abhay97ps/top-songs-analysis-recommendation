Ladies!
Everybody, everybody...
New York, New York
This is the place to be
Turn up the sounds, turn on your ears
'Cause this is Spyder-D
New York is just a great big stage
Where everyone has a part to play
You'll find everything you might need
From one to ten, from A to Z
And from side to side, from place to place
New York is full of every race
And if you got big cash you can buy the world
From automatic guns to pretty girls
It's got skyscrapers and sites to see
It's got everybody wantin' to be an MC
And you might see if there's anything
Like a bank getting robbed or a pocketbook sting
But don't get me wrong, it's not all bad
'Cause you can have more fun than you ever had
We got the Yankees and the Knicks
42nd street and the Times Square tricks
Young ladies, go see a play
'Cause there's acts galore on old Broadway
And all of you from another land
Come check New York out if you can
But hold on to your credit cards
And if you got it like that, bring bodyguards
Because the Apple has learned to act tough
And sometimes it can get a little rough
But you'll be okay if you play it cool
Don't act like a punk nor a fool
Just chill on out and have some fun

The national rappin' anthem theme
For those in the club of a def MC
From the first jam play to the early light
An MC's job is to rock it right
Rock it right and rock it well
Just move your mouth like Howard Cosell
From park to park, from place to place
You gotta rock the house at a steady pace
So rap it right and rap it good
Rap it so your rhymes are understood
