I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't stop dancin'
There's a place I eat lunch every day
Soon as I get there, the jukebox starts to play
I can't even eat my lunch in peace
'Cause music makes me get out of my seat
I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't stop dancin'
Music has a strange effect on me
It doesn't matter wherever I may be
Whenever I hear a drummer play that funky beat
I drop everything and get out of my seat
I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't stop dancin'
Let me put this hamburger down
I don't want no malt
I wanna dance, oh yeah
Sho' nuff groovin' now, y'all, look at me
Huh-huh, oh yeah
I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't stop dancin'
I just can't stop dancin'
