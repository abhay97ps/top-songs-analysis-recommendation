How many tears can you cry when you're sad and lonely?
And how many tears can you cry when someone makes you blue?
That's a question I'm still unable to answer
'Cause I can't stop my cryin' over you
How many lies can you can you count when you just can't sleep at
Night?
And how many lies can you count before your heart is free?
That's a question I'm still unable to answer
'Cause I'm still countin' the lies you told to me
There's just no end to all the broken promises that I recall
I was a fool to fall for you
It hurts to know you played a game and went and had yourself a ball
And through it all made me blue
How many tears can you cry when it all is over?
And how many tears can you cry when you want someone new?
That's a question I'm still unable to answer
'Cause I can't stop my love for you
That's a question I'm still unable to answer
'Cause I can't stop my love for you
