There's a dead man's hand floating in the sky
Big nose people passing by
Crusin' around on a mountain of air
Crusin' around till they can land somewhere
Won't someone take away these blues
It's a shame but when I lose, I lose
I can't survive too much spider jive
I'm just about hanging on
Oh, Lord, don't make a poor boy run
It ain't easy living under a gun
Insanity's keeping me company
Insanity's on the loose
Yes, insanity's on the loose
There's an angel of madness and she's bringing me down
She won't rest until I'm in the ground
I'll keep sеarching everywherе I go
Find the answers that no one knows
Won't someone take away these blues
It's a shame but when I lose, I lose
I can't survive too much spider jive
I'm just about hanging on
Oh, Lord, don't make a poor boy run
It ain't easy living under a gun
Insanity's keeping me company
Insanity's on the loose
Yes, insanity's on the loose
You can't paint pictures on a scarecrow's hat
'Cause everybody's nobody and that's a fact
Rich man, poor man, no one is safe
Try all you want, but you can't escape
Won't someone take away these blues
It's a shame but when I lose, I lose
I can't survive too much spider jive
I'm just about hanging on
Oh, Lord, don't make a poor boy run
It ain't easy living under a gun
Insanity's keeping me company
Insanity's on the loose
Yes, insanity's on the loose
