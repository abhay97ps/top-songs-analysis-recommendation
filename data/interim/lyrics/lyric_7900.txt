I've been watching you
I've been watching you
You're a married woman
And I'm married, too
I should be at home
I'm out there, watching you
I'm jealous of you
I want you for myself
Baby, baby, oh baby
Use my love
Yeah, baby, use some love
I've been watching you
I, I've been watching you
I watched you last night
From behind a big old tree
What you did to him?
I sure wish it was me
I've been watching you
For a long, long time
Oh, I wish, how I wish
I wish you were mine
Oh baby, you're so fine
Ohh, there it is
Hmm, hmm, there it is
I've been watching you
I, I see everything you do
I'm going to get to you
Some way, somehow
Every time I see you
My imagination runs wild
I need you, baby
I need you, baby
I want you for myself
Your  baby
Use some love
Baby, oh baby
Use some love
Hey mama, use some love
You're fine, so fine
Use some love
You're a big love, woman
Use some love
You're mine, mine, mine
Use some love
