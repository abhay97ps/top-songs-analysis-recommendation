Mmmm, when the midnight ravens appear in your eyes
Oh! and the mystery holdin' your soul is realized
Shadows of night, faces in the fire, like visions in a dream, takin' me higher
You got the magic thrillin' me, you got the magic chillin' me
You got the magic, shine your spell on me
Whoa, when the hoodoo children of night gather near
Ah! when the whirlwind whispers your name, I can hear
Wind in the willows, scratchin' in the sand
And the whole universe is at your command there
You got the magic thrillin' me, you got the magic chillin' me
You got the magic, shine your spell on me
Yeah
You got the magic thrillin' me, you got the magic chillin' me, oooh!
You got the magic thrillin' me, you got the magic chillin' me, oooh!
You got the magic, shine your spell on me
You got the magic thrillin' me, you got the magic chillin' me
You got the magic, shine your spell on me
You got the magic thrillin' me, you got the magic chillin' me
You got the magic, shine your spell on me
