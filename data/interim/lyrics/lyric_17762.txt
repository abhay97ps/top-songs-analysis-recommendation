Ooh, oh oh yeah
I owe it all to you
Anything for you
So many times I've been let down
To the point where love made no sound
Then you came and love moved back in
Now it's my turn to give back again
I want you to know that
I'm here for you
When you need someone too
'Cause you were always there for me
So let me return the favor, please
So many people wasted my time
Too bad I couldn't see behind their smiles
Are you an angel in disguise?
'Cause you made me realize
You will always be my best friend
'Cause you gave me the strength to go on again
I want you to know that
I'm here for you
When you need someone too
'Cause you were always there for me
So let me return the favor, please
I owe it all 
To you 
Baby love, what can I do?
I owe it all 
To you 
And I'll do anything for you
I said if loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
No, not tonight
Never wanna fight
Baby, only you can make it right
Me say, fans them follow me
Boys them bother me
Girls them watch me
Kids adore me
Still I put God before me
Me say, Arista love me
Number one company
Big up to me family
'Cause only you have spoiled me
I'm here for you
When you need someone too
Always there for me 
So let me return the favor, please
I'm here for you
Need someone too
Always there for me
So let me return the favor, please
I'm here for you
When you need someone too
Always there for me
So let me return the favor, please
I'm here for you
When you need someone too
'Cause you were always there for me
So let me return the favor, please
