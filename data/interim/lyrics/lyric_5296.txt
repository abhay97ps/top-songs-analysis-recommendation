Everywhere I hear the sound of marching, charging feet, boy
'Cause summer's here, and the time is right for fighting in the street, boy
Well, what can a poor boy do except to sing for a rock and roll band?
'Cause in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no
Hey! Think the time is right for a palace revolution
'Cause where I live the game to play is compromise solution
Well, then what can a poor boy do except to sing for a rock and roll band?
'Cause in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no
Get down
Hey! Said my name is called Disturbance
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants
Well, then what can a poor boy do except to sing for a rock and roll band?
Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no
Get down
