Come on, girl, follow me
To the Penny Arcade
Holding hands, walking free
Through the Penny Arcade
There's carousels going up and down
Wishing wells for wishing round
At the Penny Arcade
And there's a clown at the Penny Arcade
In the tunnel of love, we'll kiss and hide
Come out of the other side
And we'll have it made 'cause there's no guide
At the Penny Arcade
I'll treat you good
Bring you with all of good
Then we can fly
Red balloons up in the sky
Come on, girl, follow me
To the Penny Arcade
Holding hands, walking free
Through the Penny Arcade
The Penny Arcade
There's a magic stand with a gypsy there
When he reads your hand, you'll know I care
At the Penny Arcade
And there's a bear at the Penny Arcade
Then a laughing place I'll take you to
Where funny faces look at you
There's lemonade to cool you too
At the Penny Arcade
I'll treat you good
Bring you with all of good
Then we can fly
Red balloons up in the sky
Come on, girl, follow me
To the Penny Arcade
Holding hands, walking free
Through the Penny Arcade
The Penny Arcade
I'll treat you good
Bring you with all of good
Then we can fly
Red balloons up in the sky
Come on, girl, follow me
To the Penny Arcade
Holding hands, walking free
Through the Penny Arcade
The Penny Arcade, Penny Arcade
