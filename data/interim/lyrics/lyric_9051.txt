I try to be patient, I try not to moan
But it's driving me crazy, tryin' to live here alone
My conversation gets nowhere
When I talk to myself
I've lost my sense of humour
Somewhere here on the shelf
The moon is wasting its shine, shining on me
Until I see you again
I won't be out in the moonlight
Well I'll be sleeping by ten
The birds are wasting their songs, singin' to me
Until I'm wakin' with you
Until you're back in my arms, dear
The birds will have to find something better to do
A shoulder to cry on would make me feel fine
But it's not much comfort when I'm cryin' all night
Friends and relations
Are running out of patience with me
I keep myself to myself but I'm no company
The moon is wastin' its shine, shinin' on me
Until I see you again
I won't be out in the moonlight
Well I'll be sleepin' by ten
The birds are wastin' their song, singin' to me
Until I'm wakin' with you
Until you're back in my arms, dear
The birds will have to find something better to do
The birds will have to find something better to do
