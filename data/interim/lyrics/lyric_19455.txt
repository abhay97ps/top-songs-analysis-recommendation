Fast lane
High speed
On the grind
24/7
No time
Always running here and there
Chasing the money
So much jibber jabber's
Clogging up our soul
Where are we running
We need some time to clear our heads
Where are we running
Keep on working until we're dead
Where are we running
Oo wee oo wee oo
Where are we running now
In style
Profile
Got to buy
The new Cavalli
Keep the skin tight
And the booty in the air
Don't stop the party
The road is paved but narrow
I hope we all get home
Where you running girl
I see you up there
Oh you up on that stage
You up there
I saw you
