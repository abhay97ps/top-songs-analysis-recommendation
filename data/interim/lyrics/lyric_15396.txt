Driving past your house again I feel the same way I did then
I get weak, just thinking about you
It all began so easily a look from you a glance from me
Then our eyes met like thunder and lightning
You and I
Strangers lost in a moment
Eye to eye
We were caught unaware by this passion inside us
Love at first sight, I know that this can't be happening
No, not to someone like me
Love at first sight, so rare, and so exciting
Only hope this love we found can last
I'm not a man who acts this way but lately I can't concentrate
And I don't sleep, just dreaming about you
I try to reach you on the phone but voices there say you're not home
My heart aches, just thinking I've lost you
One more time
Seeing your face in the moonlight
One more chance
To be caught unaware of this passion inside us
Love at first sight, I know that this can't be happening
No, not to someone like me
Love at first sight, it's hard to keep your balance
Moving past the point of no return
If you need some time
To understand your feelings
If you need some time away
I'll be waiting for you with open arms my love
All that night
We made love in the moonlight
Eye to eye
We were so unaware of this passion inside us
Love at first sight, I know that this can't be happening
No, not to someone like me
Love at first sight, it's rare, and so exciting
I only hope this love we found can last
Oh I only hope this love can last, can last
