Hey, Jack, you better get right
Or Jill won't be impressed
Hey, Jill, you better get right
'Cause Jack expects the best
The temperature is risin' and exitement's in the air
Girls buy new bikinis and beauticians dye their hair
Health clubs are overcrowded with young men
Concerned and unhappy with conditions that they're in
So hey, Jack, you better get right
Or Jill won't be impressed
Hey, Jill, you better get right
'Cause Jack expects the best
Sports cars, hot rods, Cadillacs and Jeeps
Pretty girls sittin' on the beach admiring men's physiques
Bands of motorcyclists are riding through the parks
Diggin' girls in miniskirts, and tryin’ to win their hearts
So hey, Jack, you better get right
Or Jill won't be impressed
Hey, Jill, you better get right
'Cause Jack expects the best
Summer nights and city lights create an atmosphere
Girls and boys begin to dance to the music that they hear
Jack, you better look your best 'cause competition's tough
Jill, you better wear a miniskirt that's short enough
So hey, Jack, you better get right
Or Jill won't be impressed
Hey, Jill, you better get right
'Cause Jack expects the best
Hey, Jack, you better get right
Or Jill won't be impressed
Hey, Jill, you better get right
‘Cause Jack expects the best
