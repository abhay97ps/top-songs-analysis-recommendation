Summer fun, work is over
Let your hair down, invade the beach town
Crystal Lake where we like to play
Me and my baby, oh, our private getaway
One on one, rockin' in the sun
Relaxation, our vacation
Smiling faces when the children play
Well it's so wonderful to have a holiday
Ooh, those holidays
We'll be dancin', lovin', romancin'
Time to celebrate those holidays
All it needs, cool breezes
Night is falling, romance is calling
Winter snow, tender season
Fire's burning, spiritual learning
Top of the year, we all give a cheer
Horns blowing, tears are flowing
Spring fever, love is here to stay
And it's so wonderful to have a holiday
Ooh, those holidays
We'll be dancin'
Lovin', romancin'
Time to celebrate those holidays
Holiday, time to play
Holiday fun
Holiday, let's celebrate
Holiday fun
Time flies when you're having lots of fun
Before you know it, you're back on the run
So let's rejoice and let's give a cheer
This holiday, whoo, whoo, whoo!
Holiday, time to play
Holiday fun
Holiday, let's celebrate
Holiday fun
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Holiday
Holiday
Holiday, holiday
Holiday, holiday
Holiday, time to play
Holiday fun
Holiday, let's celebrate
Holiday fun...
