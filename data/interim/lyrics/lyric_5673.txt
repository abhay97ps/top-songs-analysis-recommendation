I've been hurt, hurt, hurt
Yes I've been hurt
I've been hurt like I've never been hurt before
Cause you lied, you lied to me
So leave me alone
Cause I've been hurt
Baby you lied
Darling, what happened, what happened
What happened, what happened last night
I saw you with another guy
Was holding you tight
I've been hurt
Baby you cheated, mistreated
You cheated, cheated on me
And you told me, you told me
You told a whole lot of lies
Darling, what happened, what happened
What happened, what happened last night
Well, I saw you with another guy
He was holding you tight
