Baby, we're good together
Yes, we're so good together
I know it happening but I can't believe it
I just love this feeling that's going through me
When you hold me, baby
I'm all on fire
It's a kind of magic what you're doing to me
I just want to tell you
How good you make me feel
If you got a life time to spare, baby I will
If I could only put myself inside you
You could see thru my eyes and feel what I'm feeling
Then you might just start to understand
Why my head is flying and my head is reeling
I just want to tell you
How good you make me feel
If you got a life time to spare, baby I will
Baby, we're good together
Yes, we're so good together
So if you got a life time to spare
Woo come on baby
Na na na na na
Come on baby
Na na na na na
I just want to tell you
How good you make me feel
If you got a life time to spare
Oh baby I will
Baby we're good together
Yeah, yeah
Yes we're so good together
