For your applause my mental problem out for revenge every autumn
Stimulate to get down them all innovators fend em off
And lock me up nightly go psycho when you don't like me
What's in my hands? Ain't my ID
At gunpoint make you recite me
I see some demons that might be trying to fuck me or fight me
Because I wasn't wrapped tightly at Heaven's Gate in black Nikes
I'm in that house like a home invasion because your family need a renovation
Say ho don't say Amen say 6-7-8-9 Satan
I'm a trapped ghost in a iPod and the batteries have been died off
Evil in me no antidote its boring shooting cantaloupe and I'm about what killers do so much they start to kill in school
Heroes hang with villains too
Death is here I'm feeling cruel
Burnt flesh that's brand loyal
Bullet holes your guts boil
King of nothing, Fuck royal
There will be blood, I struck oil
What I'm Freddy Kruger, Lex Luthor, Chad Kroeger
The dick in Nickleback who tickle fat nipples on cougars
Sippin' Boocha, your boo fuck with me
'Cause I'm super fly, I splash her neden Jimmy Snuka
I'll slap you, spin your face 'round to the back of your head
You'll have to chop a hole through your wig or suffocate dead
I'll make the sunshine bright at midnight or black out at noon
Put so much heart in this every beat kicks as a sonic boom
I blow hurricanes, spit monsoons and stomp earthquakes
And me and my Ruby known to bust and murder snakes
I'll snatch right up in your earhole put your brain in your hand
You'll still be trying to comprehend when you end 
The hatchet been chopping for years
I'll flex on all of my peers
So high I be poppin' your ears
You rockin' a toilet career
You bust to a brush in a mirror
You flush and your fans disappear
Your stacks are like flat as a beer
Left out in the sun for a year
Trained in Shaolin, red moon howlin'
Decades deep, stomach still growlin'
Elbow to eyeball I'm foulin'
'Til your Momma threw the towel in
But I caught it, she fought it and brought it, I applauded
But my rocket kick out it clocked out I sock it and she bought it
With that shing-shing-shing-shing walla-walla bing bing
Zoo Ju-Jitsu Joe Bruce ying yang
Six Six Fivin' big dicks diving
Up in you bitch it's a ICP thing
ICP THANG
ICP THANG
