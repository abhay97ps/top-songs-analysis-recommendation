Well I knew someday, Ruby would be leaving
That she wasn't happy living quietly, quietly
Ð¡ause she would get the bedroom look each morning
And I felt Ruby pull away from me
Yeah, so go downtown at nine o'clock this evening
Walk under that red light and down the hall, down the hall
Look for the highest flying girl, that's Ruby
And if you wait your turn you'll see Ruby fall
Don't let her know that you even know me
She'll be trying to forget it all
And don't tell me how it was tonight, tomorrow
Cause I don't want to see Ruby fall
I didn't hold her back, when she got restless
One man is not enough when she wants it all
Yeah, I let her go when I saw what she wanted
Cause I don't care to see Ruby fall
