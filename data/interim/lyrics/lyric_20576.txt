DJ Khaled, we the best

The Runners, I represent the ghetto across the world
And you represent the hood, two hands in the sky
I'm so 
Listen!
Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
Cause you and yo' man is plannin to hate
I'm so hood! And I got these golds up in my mouth
If you get closer to my house then you'll know what I'm talkin 'bout
I'm out the hood! And if you feel me put your hands up
Hoo-ood! My hood niggas, can you stand up?
I'm so hood! If you not from here you can walk it out 
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin 'bout
E'rybody wanna motherfuckin know why, I, dress so fly, sit so high
Bitch, I do it for the hood, bitch-ass niggas I do it cause I could
Heavy starch in my jeans please, fo' X in my white tees
Livin life like a G, that's why these bitch-ass niggas wanna fight me
But I ain't gon' play wit 'em,  - I'd rather let the AK hit 'em
Tough niggas get fucked up and put on ice for the rest of they life
I'm straight out the hood bruh, see that's what I do it for
And my low class ghetto ass, just renewed my ghetto pass
I'm so hood!
Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
Cause you and yo' man is plannin to hate
I'm so hood! And I got these golds up in my mouth
If you get closer to my house then you'll know what I'm talkin 'bout
I'm out the hood! And if you feel me put your hands up
Hoo-ood! My hood niggas, can you stand up?
I'm so hood! If you not from here you can walk it out
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin 'bout

Niggas keep droppin like flies  snitchin ain't goin cut no time

Rob you for your last, the North comin mad
 Mo' money, mo' mayo, the llello in millions I made 'em
My Maybach is mine, my city is mine, I made it

I like bust-it babies, I ont want that bougie bitch
I never buy a Phantom, 28's can't fit
They say I'm Fed bound, they call me high risk
