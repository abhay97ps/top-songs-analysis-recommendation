Takes so long for
The day to go by
Whenever you're away
Can't hardly wait
Till I see you tonight
Let's watch this clock
Speed up the hand of time
Baby, maybe
Some things will change
But this one remains the same
And I know it will cause it's
The way I feel about you
Every time I think a happy thought
I think of you and your la la love
It's because I'm in love with you
Anytime I want the best in love
I think of sharing your la la love
It's because I'm in love with you
Things ain't quite the same
Without the sparkle of your eyes
Tonight, a lonely night
I promise you that we'll be together
Girl, believe in me
I would never let you down
Baby, maybe
Some things will change
But this one remains the same
And I know it will cause it's
The way I feel about you
Every time I think a happy thought
I think of you and your la la love
It's because I'm in love with you
Anytime I want the best in love
I think of sharing your la la love
It's because I'm in love with you
Every time I think a happy thought
I think of you and your la la love
It's because I'm in love with you
Anytime I want the best in love
I think of sharing your la la love
It's because I'm in love with you
Girl, you know you drive me crazy
Don't move
Only time will tell
Oh, baby, maybe
Some things will change
But this one remains the same
And I know it will cause it's
The way I feel about you
Every time I think a happy thought
I think of you and your la la love
It's because I'm in love with you
Anytime I want the best in love
I think of sharing your la la love
It's because I'm in love with you
Let's share our la la love
Sing it
Yeah, just you and me
So good to me, baby
You're so sexy
Now's the time
We can share our la la la la la
Every time I think a happy thought
I think of you and your la la love
It's because I'm in love with you
Anytime I want the best in love
I think of sharing your la la love
It's because I'm in love with you
Every time I think a happy thought
I think of you and your la la love
It's because I'm in love with you
Anytime I want the best in love
I think of sharing your la la love
It's because I'm in love with you
