I was in love the moment that I saw you
I followed you through the crowd and I almost lost you
I was dying to tell ya, but scared of your reaction
But I can't hold back because I'm rushed with this thing called passion
You've got me knocked out
Turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out
Baby, there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet
I walked your way, hoping that maybe you noticed
I don't wanna move so fast, I don't wanna blow it
Never did I think love could be so amazing
But the things that you're making me do, it's driving me crazy
You've got me knocked out
Turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out
Baby, there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet
You've got me knocked out
Turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out
Baby, there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet
I want us to be closer
Boy, I wanna be startin' something with you, baby
My heart is steady knockin'
Boy, you've got my body rockin'
Caught blow-by-blow, love TKO
You've got me knocked out
Turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out
Baby, there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet
You've got me knocked out
Turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out
Baby, there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet
You've got me knocked out
Turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out
Baby, there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet
