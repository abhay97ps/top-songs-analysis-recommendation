You feel like summertime
You took this heart of mine
You'll be my valentine in the summer, in the summer
You are my only one
Just dancin'; having fun
Out in the shinin' sun of the summer, of the summer
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do 
I love you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do 
Put no one else above you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do 
I need you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do 
Oh!
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
I love you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
Put no one else above you
Do love me, do love me, do 
Do love me, do love me, do
I need you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
Hoo, oh!
Is it summertime magic
That makes me wanna dance all night long?
It's your summertime magic
Make me feel this way
Got me boo'd up
Girl, oh you're my world 
Baby girl  my whole world, hoo, oh!
You feel like summertime 
You took this heart of mine 
You'll be my Valentine 
In the summer 
In the summer
I love you
Put no one else above you
Your style, your braids, your eyes
So summertime
All I wanna do is let you shine
I love you
Put no one else above you
It's your summertime
It's your summertime magic
