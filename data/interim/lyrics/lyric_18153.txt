Darkchild '99
Say my name, say my name if no one is around you
Say, “Baby, I love you,” if you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name, you actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me "baby," why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name if no one is around you
Say, “Baby, I love you,” if you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name, you actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me "baby," better say my name
Any other day, I would call, you would say 
"Baby, how's your day?" But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is, "Uh-huh , yeah, okay" 
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady? 
If you took it there, first of all, let me say 
I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me, if I'm the girl that you claim 
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday? 
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
Where you're sayin' everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who
Say my name, say my name  if no one is around you
Say, “Baby, I love you,” if you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name, you actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me "baby," why the sudden change? 
Say my name, say my name if no one is around you 
Say, “Baby, I love you,” if you ain't runnin' game 
Say my name, say my name, you actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me "baby," better say my name
What is up with this? Tell the truth, who you with? 
How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
Don't try to change it now, sayin' you gotta bounce 
When two seconds ago, said you just got in the house 
It's hard to believe that you are at home by yourself 
When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else
Just this question, why do you feel  you gotta lie? 
Gettin' caught up in your game, when you cannot say my name 
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
Where you're sayin' everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who
Say my name, say my name if no one is around you
Say, “Baby, I love you,” if you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name, you actin' kinda shady 
Ain't callin' me "baby," why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name if no one is around you 
Say, “Baby, I love you,” if you ain't runnin' game 
Say my name, say my name, you actin' kinda shady 
Ain't callin' me "baby," better say my name 
Where my ladies at?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Oh-ooh, whoa-whoa
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
Where you're sayin' everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who
Say my name, say my name if no one is around you
Say, “Baby, I love you,” if you ain't runnin' game

Say my name, say my name if no one is around you
Say, “Baby, I love you,” 
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name 
You actin' kinda shady 
Ain't callin' me "baby"
Why the sudden change? 
Say my name, say my name 
If no one is around you

Better say my name
Thou shalt know she can't love you
