This morning is Monday
Where are you now?
Teasin' my memory
Teaching me how
To lay low
When I don't want to
Your love is elusive
This I know now
It's making me crazy
Leaving me out
In the open
When I don't want to
I don't know why
You do that to me
The moments of pleasures
Never do last
Are gone like a suitcase
Full of your past
Long gone, and in a hurry
CHORUS:
Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down
More than I've already been
Just like a wild fire
You're running all over town
As much as you burn me, baby
I should be ashes by now
The second street beggars
Alone in their life
Drunk on a sidewalk
To hide from the night
Like I am
They're just like I am
Just like a wild fire
You're running all over town
And as much as you burn me, baby
I should be ashes by now
Aaaaaahh
Aaaaaahh
Should be ashes by now
Aaaaaahh
