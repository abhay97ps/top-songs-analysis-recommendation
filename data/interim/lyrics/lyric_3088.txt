Got a feeling inside 
It's a certain kind 
I feel hot and cold 
Yeah, down in my soul, yeah 
I said ... 
I'm feeling good now, yeah, but 
Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling blue
The things you've said, well, maybe they're true
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means, but â€¦
Can't explain
I think it's love
Try to say it to you
When I feel blue
But I can't explain 
Yeah, hear what I'm saying, girl 
Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling bad
The things you've said have got me real mad
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means but
But I can't explain 
Forgive me one more time, now 
I said I can't explain, yeah
You drive me out of my mind
Yeah, I'm the worrying kind, babe
I said I can't explain
