Couldn't wait to turn 16 and drive all the boys around
Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel was all I could think about
A little rust in the bed of that truck and a four speed on the floor
Five-hundred dollars it was mine, all mine and I never wanted nothing more
I took Katie down by the river with a six dollar bottle of wine
Just a fool trying' to play it cool hoping' she'd let me cross the line
I was praying that she couldn't tell I never been that far before
The first time's a one time feeling and I never wanted nothing more
No I never wanted nothing more..
Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need
My buddies all tried to change my mind
But I told them that I'd thought it through
Katie laughed and my mama cried when they heard me say "I do"
Her little ring is a little thing, but its all I could afford
Now she's mine, all mine till the day I die, and I never wanted nothing more
Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need
One Sunday I listened to the preacher and I knew he was preaching to me
I couldn't help it I walked up front and I got down on my knees
Right then and there, I swear I changed when I found the Lord
Glory Hallelujah, good God almighty I never wanted nothing more
Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need
Never wanted nothing more
And I never wanted nothing more
