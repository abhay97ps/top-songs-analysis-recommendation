A fight for king or country
Can liven any heart
To sleep beneath the open skies
A love affair can start
Echoes in the valley
As embers cross red skies
I'm calling from the mountains
Echoes of no reply
CHORUS:
I will be there
Oh, when you call my name
I will be there
Oh, if you call my name
I will be there
Listen to the silence
As shadows dance with me
A ticking clock of endless time
Clouds my memory
I'm calling from the mountains 
Echoes cry for me
I will be there
Oh, when you call my name 
I will be there
Oh, just call my name 
I will be there
SOLO
Yeah! 
I will be there
Oh, when you call my name 
I will be there
Oh, just call my name 
I will be there
Oh 
I will be there
I will be there
OUTRO SOLO
