Seven lonely nights I cried for you
All week long
Seven lonely nights I cried I died inside for you baby
We swore on that holy book to cherish and obey
And stuck right by my promise until to that very day now
But you weren't happy that's for certain
Now I'm throwing that final curtain on your girl
Hear me baby
And begging won't  your rescue
Seven lonely nights I cried for you
Tears are falling
Seven lonely nights I cried I died inside for you baby
By myself I'm going crazy
I ate humble pie
While you were out having a good time
Keeping yourself satisfied
Cigarettes and coffee mama
Just a pillow to hold on tightly to
Hear me baby
It's your turn to cry the hurting's on you girl
Seven lonely nights I cried for you
All week long baby
Seven lonely nights I cried and I died inside for you baby
All week long your man ate and slept in
Early this morning you came creeping crying oh baby
Because you blew it this time
I ain't lying
Seven lonely nights I cried for you
All night long baby
Seven lonely nights I cried and I cried and I sighed inside for you baby
Seven lonely nights I cried for you
All night long girl
Seven lonely nights I cried and I cried and I sighed for you baby
