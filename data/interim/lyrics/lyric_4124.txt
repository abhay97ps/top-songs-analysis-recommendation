You can't laugh
You can't cry
You're acting kinda funny and you don't know why
Cause your heart keeps beating like a big, bass drum
And the beat's getting stronger and it's so much fun
And you keep on singing but the words are wrong
And you can't stop laughing, baby, what's going on?
It's only love trying to get through
It's only love trying to get through
It's only love trying to get through
You can't run
You can't hide
No matter what you do you're on a ten-cent ride
Going up, down, baby, and it's so much fun
And your heart keeps beating like a big, bass drum
And the beat's getting stronger and it just won't quit
Better hold on, baby, cause you know that it's
It's only love trying to get through
It's only love trying to get through
It's only love trying to get through
It's only love trying to get through
It's only love trying to get through
It's only love trying to get through
It's only love trying to get through
It's only love trying to get through
It's only love trying to get through
It's only love trying to get through
It's only love trying to get through
It's only love trying to get through
It's only love trying to get through
