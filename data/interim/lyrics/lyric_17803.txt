We really shouldn't be doing this
And we both know why
Just bein' close enough to think like this
Enough to make you need to lie
This kinda talk will lead us to somewhere
We're gettin' way too close to goin' there
The farther off, the better to resist
We really shouldn't be doin' this
Only an isolated incident
But the acquaintance left me stunned
The first attraction was the hardest hit
I thought I'd ever overcome
This kinda situation has to pass
This chance encounter has to be the last
To take it further, we would be remiss
We really shouldn't be doin' this
We'd each be hurtin' somebody else
If we don't say our goodbyes real fast
Won't even think about a farewell kiss
We really shouldn't be doin' this
Well
We really shouldn't be doin' this
And we both know why
Just bein' close enough to think like this
Enough to make you need to lie
This kinda talk will lead us to somewhere
We're gettin' way too close to goin' there
The farther off, the better to resist
We really shouldn't be doin' this
This kinda situation has to pass
This chance encounter has to be the last
To take it further, we would be remiss
We really shouldn't be doin' this
Won't even think about a goodbye kiss
We really shouldn't be doin' this
