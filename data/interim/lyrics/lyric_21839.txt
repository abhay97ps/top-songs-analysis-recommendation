'Bout twenty years ago way down in New Orleans
A group of fellers found a new kind of music
And they decided to call it Jazz
No other sound has what this music has
Before they knew it, it was whizzing 'round the world
The world was ready for a blue kind of music
And now they play it from Steamboat Springs to La Paz
Oh baby
Won't you play me Le Jazz Hot
Maybe, and don't ever let it end
I tell ya friend, it's really somethin' to hear
I can't sit still when there's that rhythm near me
Also, baby, Le Jazz Hot
Maybe, what's holdin' my soul together
Don't know whether it's mornin' or night
Only know it's soundin' right
So come on in
And play me Le Jazz Hot
Baby, cause I love my jazz hot
Before they knew it, it was whizzing 'round the world
The world was ready for a blue kind of music
And now they play it from Steamboat Springs to La Paz
When you play me Le Jazz Hot
Baby, you're holdin' my soul together
Don't know whether it's mornin' or night
Only know it's soundin' right
So come on in and play me Le Jazz Hot
Baby, cause I love my jazz hot
Le Jazz Hot
Le Jazz Hot
