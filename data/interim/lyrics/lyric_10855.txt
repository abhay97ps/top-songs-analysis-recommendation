So you wanna be a rock and roll star
Well, times have changed, that's all I say
You still need an electric guitar
But most of all you need that radio radio play
All day, all day, play and play and play
So you think that your music's an art
And every song has something to say
I'll tell you now that your learning will start
When you listen real hard to that radio radio play
All day, all day, play and play and play
You gotta write one killer cut, the song is a pearl
You gotta write one killer cut to turn on the world
So you wanna be a rock and roll star
Well, times have changed, that's all I say
You still need an electric guitar
But most of all you need that radio radio play
All day, all day, play and play and play
You gotta write one killer cut, the song is a pearl
You gotta write one killer cut to turn on the world
The short road to fame 
Is to steal the best bits from those top forty hits
Just keep it real short, and when the records are bought
You're a star
All the company men will remind you again and again
If you get things just right, it's success over night
If you listen and learn you'll have money to burn
You're a star
You gotta write one killer cut, the song is a pearl
You gotta write one killer cut to turn on the world
