I keep telling myself this is the right thing to do
I was wasting her time, waiting on dreams that just weren't coming true
And this old highway seems to understand
Leading me on to somewhere that no one knows my name
I got the window rolled down, I got the radio up
I'm doing all that I can to get my mind off us
What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on, and on, and on
Eighty-seven more miles gets me into Baton Rogue
There's a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that I can do
Or maybe head up north to Knoxville, Tennessee
I know my baby sister, has got a couch where I can sleep
Now the sun's going down on my broken heart
Lord, I got to get back before I get too far
What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on
Yes I drive on, and on, and on
Knowing what I need to do
Girl, I'm coming home to you
Knowing what I need to do
Girl I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you
Knowing what I need to do
