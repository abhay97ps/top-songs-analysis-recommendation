If I didn't care
More than words can say
If I didn't care
Would I feel this way?
If this isn't love
Then why do I thrill?
And what makes my head go round and round
While my heart stands still
If I didn't care
Would it still be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end
With just, just your name?
And would I be sure
That this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true
If I didn't care
For you?
