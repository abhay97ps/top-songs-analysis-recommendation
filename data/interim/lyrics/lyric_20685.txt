Life is good, I can't complain
I mean, I could, but no one's listening
Your image overwhelms my brain
And it feels good 
Now I'm rollin' my window down
I love the wind, but I hate the sound
You're like a tattoo that I can't remove
And it feels good
It feels good, it feels good
Like a rollercoaster ride
Holdin' on, white knuckles like whoa, whoa
 Whoa, whoa
Up and down and side to side
Every inch of me is like whoa, whoa
 Whoa, whoa
In the morning, it begins again
Feels like I'm fallin', better strap me in
I think I'm running out of oxygen
And it feels good
It feels good, it feels good 
Like a rollercoaster ride
Holdin' on, white knuckles like whoa, whoa
 Whoa, whoa
Up and down and side to side
Every inch of me is like whoa, whoa
 Whoa, whoa
My inhibitions are beginning to let go
In this situation, I can't help but lose control
You're an affliction that I cannot seem to break
It feels good, it feels good
I'm holdin' on
Holdin', holdin', holdin', holdin'
Holdin', holdin', holdin', holdin'
I'm holdin' on
Like a roller coaster ride
Like I'm runnin' a red light
Like a rocketship in flight
There's nothin' else that makes me feel like whoa
Please keep your hands and feet in the ride at all times
Thank you
Like a rollercoaster, whoa
Holdin' on, white knuckles, whoa
Once you let your love in, whoa
Every inch of me is like whoa 
Got me feelin' like
