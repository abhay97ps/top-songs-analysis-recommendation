I've got a surprise
Especially for you
Somethin' that both of us
Have always wanted to do
We've waited so long
Waited so long
We've waited so long
We've waited so long
I'm gonna take you on a trip
So far from here
I've got two tickets in my pocket, now baby
We're gonna disappear
We've waited so long
We've waited so long
We've waited so long
We've waited so long
I've got two tickets to paradise
Won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight
I've got two tickets to paradise
I've got two tickets to paradise
1:31 - 2:27
Oh oh oh woh oh woh oh woh oh woh oh ohh
Woh oh oh woh oh woh oh woh oh woh oh ohh
I'm gonna take you on a trip
So far from here
I've got two tickets in my pocket, baby
We'll disappear
Know why?
We've waited so long
Waited so long
We've waited so long
We've waited so long
I've got two tickets to paradise
Won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight
I've got two tickets to paradise
