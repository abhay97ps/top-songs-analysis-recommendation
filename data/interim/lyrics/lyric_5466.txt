Say man, they tell me you think you're pretty good
Don't you know you're in my neighbourhood
They tell me you're pretty fast on your feet
So I want you to meet me at the dance hall
On Market Street, you hear
There's gonna be a showdown
There's gonna be a showdown, showdown, oh yeah
I've got ten notches on my shoes
When it comes to dancin'
I just can't lose
They call me the top cat in this man's town
So I want you to meet me before the sun goes down
There's gonna be a showdown
There's gonna be a showdown, showdown, oh yeah
All the girls are losin' faith in me
Don't seem like top cat's great
As he used to be
I know I'm good
So you better be better
When you get out on the floor
You better have your steps together
There's gonna be a showdown
There's gonna be a showdown, showdown, oh yeah
Now my reputation has been one of the fastest men alive
So I'm gonna see how good you are when I count to five
 oh man, you better stop
 You can do better than that
 Man will you move aside
 And let me get out here and do my jive
There's gonna be a showdown
There's gonna be a showdown, showdown, oh yeah
