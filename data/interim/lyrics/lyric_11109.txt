I'm singing this song
For the men in your prisons and jails
The junkies and juicers
And every good man that fails
And for every outlaw
Who's got no place left to go
The Good Lord Loves You
The Good Lord Loves You
The Good Lord
He loves you so
And I'm singing this song
For the leaders of every land
For every political
And every military man
And for every mother and child
In their kingdoms below
The Good Lord Loves You
The Good Lord Loves You
The Good Lord
He loves you so
Ain't it sad that we're doing so bad
I'm singing this song
With a feeling that's deep in my heart
And I wish that I could tear down
The walls that keep us apart
And I wish I could tear down
The walls so the feelings could grow
The Good Lord Loves You
The Good Lord Loves You
The Good Lord
He loves you so
The Good Lord Loves You
The Good Lord Loves You
The Good Lord Loves You
The Good Lord Loves You
The Good Lord Loves You
The Good Lord Loves You
The Good Lord Loves You
The Good Lord
He loves you so
Ain't it sad that we're doing so bad
