Well, hello there
My it's been a long long time
How am I doin'?
You really want to know?
Oh I guess I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now
Since I've seen you
But it seems like yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips right on away
Ooh, how's your new love
Oh, I guess she's doing fine
I heard you told her
That you were gonna love her 'til the end of time
Well that's the same thing that you told me
And it seems like yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips right on away
Ooh, gotta go now
Oh I guess I'll see you somewhere around
I don't know when though
I'll never know when I'm back in town
But please remember what I told you
In time you are gonna say
Ain't it funny how time slips right on away
Yeah, yeah
Ain't it funny, ain't it funny, yeah, slips right on away
