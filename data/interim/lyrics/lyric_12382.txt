Maybe someday
Saved by zero
I'll be more together
Stretched by fewer
Thoughts that leave me
Chasing after
My dreams disown me
Loaded with danger
So, maybe I'll win 
Maybe I'll win 
Holding on to
Words that teach me
I will conquer
Space around me
So, maybe I'll win 
Maybe I'll win 
Maybe I'll win 
Maybe I'll win 
So, maybe I'll win 
Maybe I'll win 
Maybe I'll win 
Who needs to win 
Saved by zero
