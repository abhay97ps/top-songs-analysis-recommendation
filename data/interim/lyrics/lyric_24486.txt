Huncho, Quavo
Yo, yo
You know I've been taking some time
And I've been keeping to myself 
I had my eyes up on the prize
Ain't watching anybody else
But your love, it hit me hard, girl
Yeah, you're bad for my health
I love the cards that I've been dealt
Do you feel the same as well?
You know I used to be in 1D 
People want me for one thing 
I'm not changing the way that I 
I just wanna have fun and 
One Coke and Bacardi 
When I walk inside the party 
F1 type Ferrari 
Girl, I love it when your body 
Oh yeah, oh
You know I love it when the music's loud
But come on, strip that down for me, baby
Now there's a lot of people in the crowd
But only you can dance with me
So put your hands on my body
And swing that round for me, baby 
You know I love it when the music's loud
But come on, strip that down for me 
Oh, strip that down, girl
Love when you hit the ground, girl 
Oh, strip that down, girl
Love when you hit the ground
You know that since the day I met you
Yeah, you swept me off my feet
You know that I don't need no money
When your love is beside me
Yeah, you opened up my heart
And then you threw away the key
Girl, now it's just you and me
And you don't care 'bout where I've been
You know I used to be in 1D 
People want me for one thing 
I'm not changing the way that I 
I just wanna have fun and 
One Coke and Bacardi 
When I walk inside the party 
F1 type Ferrari 
Girl, I love it when your body 
Ooh
You know I love it when the music's loud
But come on, strip that down for me, baby
Now there's a lot of people in the crowd
But only you can dance with me
So put your hands on my body
And swing that round for me, baby 
You know I love it when the music's loud
But come on, strip that down for me 
Oh, strip that down, girl 
Love when you hit the ground, girl 
Oh, strip that down, girl 
Love when you hit the ground 
Oh, strip that down, girl 
Love when you hit the ground, girl 
Oh, strip that down, girl 
Love when you hit the ground 
She gon' strip it down for a thug, yeah 
Word around town she got the buzz, yeah 
Five shots in, she in love now 
I promise, when we pull up, shut the club down 
I took her from her man, don't nobody know 
If you popped the seal, better drive slow 
She know how to make me feel with my eyes closed 
Anything goes down with the Huncho 
You know I love it when the music's loud
But come on, strip that down for me,baby
Now there's a lot of people in the crowd
But only you can dance with me
So put your hands on my body
