Oh if someone writes a song with a simple rhyme
Just a song where his feeling show
And if someone feels the same about the simple song
Oh sometimes you can hear them say
Music gives you happiness or sadness
But it also, it also heals your soul
Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music give you the power
To move any mountain
Oh If someone plays piano with some simple chords
So melodic and endearing, too
And oh if someone plays guitar with the old piano
And maybe you can hear them sing
Music gives you happiness or sadness
But it also, it also heals your soul
Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music give you the power
To move any mountain 
Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music heal your soul 
Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
