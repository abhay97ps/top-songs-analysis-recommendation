Hit it!
It was thirty days around the horn
The captain says it's a thirty-five more
The moon looks mean and the crew ain't staying
"There's gonna be some blood" is what they're all saying
It's a shakedown cruise 
And I was just another fool 
There ain't no easy way out 
They're gonna shake you 'til you shout, hey, hey 
They treat you like a dog, but you're only human
You miss your home, Lord, you miss that woman
The captain laughs, he says, "You boys want some sex?
You can squeeze the sails, you can lick the decks"
It was a shakedown cruise 
I guess I just was born to lose 
They tell you life is going cheap 
I got myself in pretty deep 
 And it feels all right
 And it feels all right
I guess it feels all right
The fever's hot, the winds are blowin' cold
The captain's crazy eye puts the fear in your soul
I heard somebody cryin', "Lord, let this end
You know I'll never go to sea again"
It was a shakedown cruise 
And now we're sendin' out the news 
There ain't no victory at sea 
Unless it's mutiny 
Now if I don't get off alive, it's just as well
I'll be waking up in heaven, 'cause I've been through hell
On this shakedown cruise
They call it a shakedown cruise
Aw, shake me down, boy
It was a shakedown cruise
It got me shakin' in my shoes
And now I'm feelin' kinda blue
Whoo!
Shakedown cruise
I said, shake me down, boys
Whoo!
