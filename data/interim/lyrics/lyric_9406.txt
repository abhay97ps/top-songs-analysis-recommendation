She was born in L.A
In a lonely room
Hardly knew her mama
And her daddy left too soon
She never seemed to fit in with the other kids around
Late at night
She took out her pen
And this is what she wrote down:
Norma Jean wants to be a movie star
She wants to shine
Hear people say
"We know who you are"
Norma Jean wants to see her name in lights
She wants to dance
She wants to live the good life
By the time she turned sixteen
She was twenty-one
Knew every name on the silver screen
And everything they'd done
But when it came time to lay herself down to dream
It wasn't them she saw up there
It was "Norma Jean"
Norma Jean wants to be a movie star
She wants to shine
Hear people say
"We know who you are"
Norma Jean wants to see her name in lights
She wants to dance
She wants to live the good life
Before too long
She had her fortune and fame
But it wasn't Norma Jean
Marilyn was her name
She died in L.A. in a lonely room
Nobody knew her
But they knew she died too soon
By the time it was too late
Lord, we began to care
If you can hear me now
This is my prayer
Norma Jean wants to be a movie star
She wants to shine
Hear people say
"We know who you are"
Norma Jean wants to see her name in lights
She wants to dance
She wants to live the good life
