I've been thinkin' 'bout you
The way I feel about you
I had you on my mind
Way we met, it all happened so fast
There was love in your eyes
When we touched there was love, so let's make it last
Sometimes you can't tell if love is real
There ain't no doubt about the way I feel
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
The way I feel about you
There just ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
I woke up late last night
Visions of you, real they seem
Needed you by my side
Now with you in my life, I can live in this dream
Sometimes you can't tell if love is real
There ain't no doubt about the way I feel
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
The way I feel about you
There just ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
I'm in love 
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, love, love
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
The way I feel about you
I'm in love 
I'm in love 
I've been thinkin' 'bout you 
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
The way I feel about you 
There just ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
I'm in love 
I'm in love 
I've been thinkin' 'bout you 
Ooh, and there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
The way I feel about you
I'm in love
