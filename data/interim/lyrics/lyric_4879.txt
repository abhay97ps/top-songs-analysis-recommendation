The lesson
Vikki Carr
This is the lesson taught to me
A long time ago at my mother's knee
She said, someday someone who loves you
Will make you cry
Though he loves you he'll hurt you
Till you feel you could die
But if he says forgive me
Forgive if you can
For you are his woman
And he is your man
When you're looking for roses
There are thorns you will meet
And remember my child
Without any thorns the rose can't be sweet
Well it's finally happened
Now it's my turn to cry
Oh my darling you've hurt me
Till I feel I could die
But you're saying forgive me
And I understand
For I am your woman
And you are my man
Don't tell me about heartache
I've cried my share of tears
I've had my share of rain
But after the storm
No rain will appear
I just know when you hold me
My whole world is complete
And the lesson is clear
Without any thorns the rose can't be sweet
And the lesson is clear
Without any thorns the rose can't be sweet
