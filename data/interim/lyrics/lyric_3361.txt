Go!
Sun sun sun sun
Sun sun sun sun
I live for the sun 
Because it makes fun 
Pretty girls with their guys
Such a love you can't buy
Baby, We all live for the sun
Go!
Sun sun sun sun
Sun sun sun sun
My girl, my girl and me 
We will stay right by the sea 
Livin' and lovin' this way
We're with the sun every day
We, we all live for the sun
Go!
Sun sun sun sun
Sun sun sun sun
Sunsets are for lovers
And dads and mothers
Whoa and little girls
And their brothers
They all live for the sun
Go!
Sun sun sun sun
Sun sun sun sun
Listen, ah listen 'cause 
Don't be, don't be a dud 
Take your girl by the hand
Walk with her in the sand
And always, yes always
We got to live for the...
Sun sun sun sun
Sun sun sun sun
Go!
Sun sun sun sun
Sun sun sun sun
Go!
Sun sun sun sun
Sun sun sun sun
