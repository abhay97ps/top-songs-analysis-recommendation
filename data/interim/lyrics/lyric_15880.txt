Yeah, turn it up
Yeah, turn it up
Yeah, turn it up...
T-turn it up, t-turn it up
T-turn it up, t-turn it up
Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance no more
Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance no more
It's the swing time
To bring forth the rhyme
That's designed to put you
In a hip-hop state of mind
Intro, I'll disperse the verse
That'll make you move
To a C and C groove
True indeed
Some believe the brothers
Can you swing it hard core
Strictly for the dance floor
Not the stereo type
Get the crowd hype
It's 1992
And hard core is the type
And a rum-a-num-a-num
Take a seat as I take my stand
And fasten your seat belt
Cause I'm about to crash land
Into a dope rhyme
Not the type of style
That I be flexing on a regular
Kicks the rap amplified
Category executor
Mentally, physically
Lyrically, it's gotta be
Stunning, I'll make you move
So what you wanna do is
Hip-hop non-stop
Take it the the top
 on and on
Keep it going til the break of dawn
Hip-hop non-stop
Pump it up
 on and on
Keep it going til the break of dawn
Feel the fury of a one of a kind
Any rhyme I say, A-okay
That was a dope rhyme 
Change the pace of the flow
Yo, be smooth is the rhythm
This is what you get
This is what I'm giving up, down
Get down to the funky sound
 yo
Rhyming off beat is too unique
Snatching up your girlfriend
Cause I dip her sweet soul
Shake, shake, shake
Your groove thing
As I pick up the mike
And make the crowd swing
Well, waddaya know
Kids want total control
Hey, yo, leggo my Eggo
Keep it coming 
Keep it coming, y'all 
Dance til you can't dance
Til you can't dance no more
Keep it coming 
Keep it coming, y'all 
Dance til you just can't dance
Keep it coming
Keep it coming, y'all
Dance til you can't dance
Til you can't dance no more
Keep it coming 
Keep it coming, y'all 
Dance til you just can't dance
Hip-hop non-stop 
Take it the the top
 on and on
Keep it going til the break of dawn
Hip-hop non-stop
Pump it up
 on and on
Keep it going til the break of dawn
? slam, in case you didn't
See me, here I am
Trash it, industry
Nothing like a jackal
? I have my tackle
A snap, a crackle, a pop
Cause the note
You know it's mine
Rate, rate, overweight
Come back another day, nuff said
Here I go, here I go, here I go
Grab me up, I'm gonna flow
I'm gonna flow
Do you need me for the beat
Like a float with no delaying
Rocking the microphone
From the P.M. til the A.M
Libbitty-dibbitty-dee
Did you catch what I was saying
Me neither, I just wanted
To catch a quick breather
Well, closing, kaput
Completed, finito
I'm coming so, yo
Keep it coming
Keep it coming 
Keep it coming, y'all 
Dance til you can't dance
Til you can't dance no more
Keep it coming 
Keep it coming, y'all 
Dance til you just can't dance
Keep it coming 
Keep it coming, y'all 
Dance til you can't dance
Til you can't dance no more
Keep it coming 
Keep it coming, y'all 
Dance til you just can't dance
Hip-hop non-stop
Take it the the top
 on and on
Keep it going til the break of dawn
Hip-hop non-stop
Pump it up
 on and on
Keep it going til the break of dawn
Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance no more
Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance no more
Dance til you can't dance
Til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance
Til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance
Til you can't dance...
Dance til you can't dance no more
