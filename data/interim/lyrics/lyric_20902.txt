What do I do?
Stop? Go?
Fail? Succeed?
Live or die?
I just gotta believe
Believe, it's worth saving
And to get lost, lost in a daydream
So why hesitate? Take me to another place
So far, far away, so I can get out of the dark
High speed, like I'm racing
Just like lighting, the sky is blazing
But you've lost your way, you've been lead astray
Are there better days for my fallen dreamer?
Calling a dreamer, a dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
Calling a dreamer, a dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
You don't sleep no more, you don't even sleep no more
Dream no more, you don't even dream no more
Dreamer, dreamer
Why don't you just dream again?
Believe in you
You've got something to prove
You're a star, watch you shine bright
On your way to the limelight, finish line
The sweat and tears
You can channel all of your fears
Open your eyes, your eyes
And it will be alright
Calling a dreamer, a dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
Calling a dreamer, a dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
You don't sleep no more, you don't even sleep no more
Dream no more, you don't even dream no more
Dreamer, dreamer
Why don't you just dream again?
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer 
Calling a dreamer, a dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer 
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
Calling a dreamer, a dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
You don't sleep no more, you don't even sleep no more
Dream no more, you don't even dream no more
Dreamer, dreamer
Why don't you just dream again?
