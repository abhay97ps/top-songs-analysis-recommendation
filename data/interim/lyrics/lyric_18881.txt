Baby light a couple candles, lock the bedroom door
Put on some sweet soul music, throw a blanket on the floor
Surrender to my patient hands
All week I've been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man
It hit me just this morning, when I passed you in the hall
I swear I caught you lookin, like you dont know me at all
Let me show you who I am
All week I've been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man
And I'll always be, your cover when your cold
And when the world winds up against you, im the safe place you can go
But now and then, we need to find some time to be in love, just be in love
Now the whole worlds in bed sleepin, I think were finally alone
And if the telephone starts ringin, we'll pretend like were not home
Cause any fool would understand
That all week ive been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man
Mhhmh, mmhmmmhm
So let me show you who I am
All week ive been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man
Just forget about that old wedding band
All week I've been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man
Mmmhmm
