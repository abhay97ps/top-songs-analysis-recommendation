You are mine, haven't I told you so?
You are mine, even the angels know
I thought you knew, it's only you, yes, you are mine
I loved you the first time that we met
Then I knew that I could not forget
All that we share, how much I care for you
Now I may not be a poet
Who can tell his love with words
But I'm sure my heart will show it
That I am asking you to be my wife
Love me eternally and be my life
Please be a part of me then I'll possess
Life's happiness when you are mine
Be my wife
Love me eternally and be my life
Please be a part of me then I'll possess
Life's happiness when you are mine
When you are mine
