The nights have been so lonely since you went away
I could not get to sleep, try as I may
But now you're back and you're here to stay
Still it looks like another sleepless night
Oh, but darling, that's alright
Just as long as you are holding me tight
Making love 'til the early morning light
Only whets our appetite
This will be another sleepless night
Hold me
While the moon shines in through the window
Let your love flow
Hold me
We can orchestrate love's scenario with the radio
And it looks like another sleepless night
Oh, but darling, that's alright
Just as long as you are holding me tight
Hold me
While the moon shines in through the window
Let your love flow
Hold me
We can orchestrate love's scenario with the radio
And it looks like another sleepless night
Oh, but darling, that's alright
Just as long as you are holding me tight
Making love 'til the early morning light
Only whets our appetite
This will be another sleepless night
