With a song in my heart
And a chance to be yours forever
I couldn't feel more secure
I know I couldn't feel any better
Oh Lord, Heaven knows
How much I love you and
How much it shows
Oh Lord, Heaven
Heaven knows
Every time we're together
Your love is movin' like lightnin' through me
It's such a beautiful feelin'
Never hearin' goodbye said to me
Oh Lord, Heaven knows
How much I love you and
How much it shows
Oh Lord, Heaven
Heaven knows
I was livin' without you
Tryin' to make it alone
But there's somethin' about you
Now your heart is my home
With a song in my heart
And a chance to be yours forever
I couldn't feel more secure
I know I couldn't feel any better
Oh Lord, Heaven knows
How much I love you and
How much it shows
Oh Lord, Heaven
Heaven knows
Oh Lord, Heaven knows
How much I love you and
How much it shows
Oh Lord, Heaven
Heaven knows
Lord, Heaven knows
How much I love you and
How much it shows
Oh Lord, Heaven
Heaven knows
Lord
