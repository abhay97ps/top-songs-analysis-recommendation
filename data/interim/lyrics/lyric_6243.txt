As a young girl she ran wild
Freely gave herself to men who understood
She lay naked in the sun
Giving birth to what was clear and strong and good
Oh lord to hear her laugh
Was to know the joy that drove her soul insane
And she'd lead you down a path
Through her river valleys etched in summer rain
Do you miss America
Miss America
Miss America
I know I do
She was offered jewels and fame
And she wore the furs of souls who once she loved
She was driven to the site
Of a marble grave where lay a dying dove
Rage exploded cross her face
And makeup melted on the cemetery lawn
And she cried for an embrace
And she wrapped her fingers round the deep rose dawn
Do you miss America
Miss America
Miss America
I know I do
I've seen her in the forest
And she's singing peaceful songs for you and me
And I've heard her in the hills
And I'm glad to say she's still alive and free
Oh lord her loving eyes
Casted ripples 'neath the sun without a sound
And she mirrors a clearing sky
As her children dance along the rain washed ground
Do you miss America
Miss America
Miss America
I know I do
Do you miss America
Miss America
Miss America
I know I do
Do you miss America
Miss America
Miss America
I know I do
