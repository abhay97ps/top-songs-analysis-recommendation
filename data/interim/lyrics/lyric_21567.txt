My daddy spent his life looking up at the sky
He'd cuss, kick the dust, saying son it's way too dry
It clouds up in the city, the weather man complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing
Arenâ€™t nothing like a kiss out back in the barn
Ringing out our soaking clothes, riding out a thunderstorm
When tin roof gets to talking, that's the best love we made
Yeah where I come from, rain is a good thing
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing
Farmer Johnson does a little dance
Creeks on the rise, roll up your pants
Country girls, they want to cuddle
Kids out playing in a big mud puddle
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
