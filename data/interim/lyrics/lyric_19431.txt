Ooh, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ah-ah
Every day I age, I just want my life to change
I done been around, put away my childish things
Like my attitude, it ain't good to be so rude
I wanna be in love, it's my right to
And every year, I seem to make some really bad mistakes
And I'm ready now, I don't wanna be this way
I'm finding out, what it's all about, yeah
I wanna be in love
What's it like to be in love? 
It's all I'm really thinkin' of 
And I was just wondering
Will love ever know me? 
'Cause my heart is open, and I've been hopin'
To find what it is everybody keep on talkin' 'bout
What's it like to be in love? 
It's all I'm really thinkin' of
And I was just wonderin' 
Will love ever know me? 
'Cause my heart is open 
And I've been hopin' 
Somebody show me, what's it like to be in love?
My life has changed, somehow it's still so much the same
Got a bank account, I'm still broken down
I need to know , where does this road go?
Hopefully someone for me 
Family , that's so much to ask thee
Beggin' please, feel like I'm goin' mad
And I'd trade all I have 
Just to know
What's it like to be in love?
It's all I'm really thinkin' of 
And I was just wondering 
Will love ever know me?
'Cause my heart is open 
And I've been hopin' 
To find what it is everybody keep on talkin' 'bout
What's it like to be in love? 
It's all I'm really thinkin' of 
And I was just wonderin' 
Will love ever know me? 
'Cause my heart is open, and I've been hopin' 
Somebody show me , what's it like to be in love? 
I know love ain't somethin' that you can go out and buy 
When you're lookin', always seems like it's the wrong time 
Well, I hope one day, I'll give away this heart of mine 
Girl, I think I'm ready, I wanna know love
What's it like to be in love? 
It's all I'm really thinkin' of
And I was just wondering , will love ever know me? 
'Cause my heart is open 
And I've been hopin' 
To find what it is everybody keep on talkin' 'bout 
What's it like to be in love?
