Since you've been gone
I shut my eyes
And I fantasize that you're here with me
Will you ever return?
I won't be satisfied
'Til you're by my side
Don't wait any longer
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Come back
And stay for good this time
Come back
And stay for good this time
When you said goodbye
I was trying to hide
What I felt inside
Until you passed me by
You said you'd return
You said that you'd be mine
'Til the end of time
But don't wait any longer
Since you've been gone
I opened my eyes
And I realize
What we had together
Will you ever return?
Or have you changed your mind
If you won't stay mine
Just love me forever
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Just come back
And stay for good this time
Come back
And stay for good this time
Come back
And stay for good this time
Come back
And stay for good this time
