It ain't wrong to say
I can't start the day
Without a shot of
What makes it right
'Cause baby if I miss
Just one little kiss
I'll be jonesin' 'til tonight
I'm a slave to the habit
Slave to the habit
Chained to the way you do that thing you do
Im a stone cold addict
You know I gots to have it
I'm a slave to the habit of loving you
There was a day I remember
Last November
I decided I could leave you alone
But my heart started aching
My hands started shaking
My feet brought me straight back home
I'm a slave to the habit
Slave to the habit
Chained to the way you do that thing you do
Im a stone cold addict
You know I gots to have it
I'm a slave to the habit of loving you
Oh no! Ain't no way to help it
Girl you got me hooked on your love
Oh no! How can I quit it?
When I can't ever never get enough
I'm a slave to the habit
Slave to the habit
Chained to the way you do that thing you do
Im a stone cold addict
You know I gots to have it
I'm a slave to the habit of loving you
