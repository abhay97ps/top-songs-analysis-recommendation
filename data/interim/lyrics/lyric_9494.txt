Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
I want you-and you want me
So why don't we-
Get together after the dance
When I first saw you
Lookin' good on the Soul Train
So good
I cannot get you sharp and right
Dancin' good-spinnin' everywhere
I thought to myself
You were so fine
The ways you move
So fine
She's movin' so real, I need her
What you need is me
I want you-and you want me
So why don't we-
Get together after the dance
While we danced
Let's break this baby
You were so fine
The way you moved me
Your eyes
Told me of warm things
Oh baby, ??? between you and me
Got to live in my sweet lovin', baby
Nobody else's got, nobody's got my love
??? if I were you
I want you to take me with you
What'cha gonna do
I want you-and you want me
So why don't we-
Get together after the dance
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
I want you-and you want me
So why don't we-
