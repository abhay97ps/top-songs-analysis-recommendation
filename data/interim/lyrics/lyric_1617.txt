I wish I had a magic wand
I would touch your arms so they could hold me
Fairy tales don't come true
Oh, how I wish I had you
Shooby-dooby-wa
I wish I had a magic wand
I would touch your lips and you would kiss me
You would give me your heart
We could never, ever part
Ahh
I wish I had the powers of a lover
No rabbit's foot, no tea leaves for me
I would throw away my four leaf clover
I would leave it up to destiny
I wish I had a magic wand
You would be the first one that I run to
You would love me like I love you
If I had a magic wand
Ooh
