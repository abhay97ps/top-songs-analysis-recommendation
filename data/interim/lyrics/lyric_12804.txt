Hopes dashed to the floor
Like shattered teenage dreams
Boys living next door
Are never what they seem ooooh
A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are staring and following me
This is my only escape from it all
Watching a film or a face on the wall
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian 
Robert De Niro's waiting
I don't want a boy
I've got a man of steel
Don't come any closer
I don't wanna feel, ooh
Your breathing, your touching
But nothing's for free
I never want this to happen to me
Don't try to change me you're wasting your time
Now I've got something much better in mind
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian 
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talk-talk-talk-talk-talk
Talking OOH!
Talk-talk-talk-talk-talk
Talking
A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are staring and following me
This is my only escape from it all
Watching a film or a face on the wall
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian 
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian 
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian 
Robert De Niro's waiting 
Talking italian
Talking Italian
