You with the sad eyes, don't be discouraged
Oh, I realize it's hard to take courage
In a world full of people, you can lose sight of it all
And darkness still inside you make you feel so small
But I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show, your true colors
True colors are beautiful like a rainbow
Show me a smile then, don't be unhappy
Can't remember when I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy and you've taken all you can bear
You can call me up, because you know I'll be there
And I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show, your true colors
True colors are beautiful like a rainbow
I can't remember when I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy, you've taken all you can bear
You call me up, because you know I'll be there
And I'll see your true colors shining through 
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you 
So don't be afraid to let them show 
Your true colors, true colors
I see your true colors shining through 
I'll see your true colors, and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show, your true colors 
True colors are beautiful, like a rainbow
