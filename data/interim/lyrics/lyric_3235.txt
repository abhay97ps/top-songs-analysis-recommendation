I don't want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every room
All I wantâ€™s the love you promised
Beneath the halo'd moon
But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrow
While you play your cheating games
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I cannot drown my sorrow
In the warm glow of your wine
But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrow
While you play your cheating game
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I cannot drown my sorrow
In the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love with money
For I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
