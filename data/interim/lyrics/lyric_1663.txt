Last night we had a quarrel
And I lost my head
How silly of me to say
The things I said
Let's kiss and make up
Why should we break up
Say it's not too late yet
To forgive and forget
Funny but it doesn't matter now
Who was wrong or right
Darling all that matters now
Is that I miss you tonight
Let's kiss and make up
Why should we break up
Say it's not too late yet
To forgive and forget
'Cause I'd do anything
To be with you again
Let's kiss and make up
Why should we break up
Say it's not too late yet
To forgive and forget
