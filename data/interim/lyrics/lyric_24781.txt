Set up shop , fuck the cops 
We ain't worried 
Diamonds  on my wrist look like McFlurry's  
And these, thotties ain't got manners, slurpin' 
Ice out the gang , make an Emoji a chain 
Ice out the gang , make an Emoji a chain

Niggas out here ain't got stain 
Makin' this money, been ballin' on niggas 
They think I signed to Tulane 
Pull up and "What the fuck," nigga, that's strange 
Uh, yeah, water on my wrist and my neck 
Look at this fluid 
200 sit on my dash, smash, 12, I'ma lose 'em 
Hot commodity, the dope on hot commodity  the trap is on fire 
I'm at the top and I took your slot, you niggas ain't hot 
Go to the lot and drop , I want the drop, robot 
Niggas gon' talk and pop , you get shot out your socks 
What do you want lil' mama? Go 'head and fuck on my partner 
Come for your head like a lineup,  these diamonds albino 
Wrap up the brick like a gyro, Migo gang Cinco De Mayo 
Shh, stuffin' them bricks in the Tahoe, boardin' the jet up to Cabo 
I, I, count the guap

Flippin' the bird 
I put a brick in her purse 
These niggas evil and cursed 
I pray and I send 'em to church 
I'ma pull up on your turf 
I'm with the smokin', who get it first? 
No Addy but I'm alert 
I ain't been hurt since birth 
I know my rights and worth 
Birds sing Gerald LaVert 
Australia, the plug at work
He came from Sydney but I was in Perth 
She pull up on me, get curved 
Hop in the Rolls and swerve 
The watch, two-tone, it's white and rose
So much water, I'ma have to learn how to surf 
I, I, count the guap 
Set up shop , fuck the cops 
We ain't worried

You can't get a bag, makin' me laugh,  Mike Epps 
I Gucci my belt , make my Emoji a whip 
Huncho barbarian , McLaren, I park at Phipps 
Ain't no comparison, I'm starin' at lines of shrimps 
Cruise the coast like a blimp , dunkin' the ball like I'm Kemp 
Slangin' the tree like a chimp , shot at me, walk with a limp 
Niggas so don't attempt , ice on, change the temp' 
Northside bangin' them , don't let strangers in 
Twist your fingers in , gangsters shit begin 
Used to gettin' in, kickin' the doors and now I want the back ends 
Used to sleep on mattress floors, I fuck on a bitch and her friend 
Wake 'em up, get in a taxi home and then my day begin
I, I, count the guap 
Set up shop , fuck the cops 
We ain't worried 
Diamonds  on my wrist look like McFlurry's
