The loco-motion, the loco-motion
Everybody's doing a brand new dance now
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
My little baby sister can do it with ease
It's easier than learning your ABCs
So come on, come on
Do the loco-motion with me
You gotta swing your hips now
Come on, baby, jump up, jump back
Oh well, I think you got the knack, oh
Now that you can do it, let's make a chain now
Chug-a chug-a motion like a railway train now
Do it nice and easy now, don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
So come on, come on
Do the loco-motion with me
The loco-motion
So come on, come on
Do the loco-motion
So come on, come on
Do the loco-motion
Move around the floor in a loco-motion
Do it holding hands if you got the notion
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue
So come on, come on
Do the loco-motion with me
Everybody's doing a brand new dance now
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
My little baby sister can do it with ease
It's easier than learning your ABCs
So come on, come on, do the loco-motion
Come on, come on, do the loco-motion
Come on, come on, do the loco-motion with me
You gotta swing your hips now, yeah
Come on, baby, jump up, jump back
