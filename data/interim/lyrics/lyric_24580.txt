I-I-I'm Lil Tay-K, I don't think you want no action 
You want action, you get turned into past tense 
Your boys deep? Well, let's get to subtractin' 
Smith & Wesson made my 9 with sub-compaction 
Fu-fu-fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case 
But I ain't beat that case, bitch, I did the race 
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face 
Eli Blast crackin' 4s like a vase 
Pop a nigga then I go out my way 
Do the dash then I go out the way
Ro-ro-rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace 
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face
Pimp gon' be eatin' good noodles every day 
Bitch, I'm drawin' doodles, Tay-K, paint the way 
Choppa tear your dudies into fish fillet 
I-I-I woke up too moody, who gon' die today? 
Shoot a fuckboy in his mothafuckin' face 
We-we-we cookin' up, boy, you don't wanna go dat way 
Gotta go dat way, you get robbed for your rackades 
Gotta go dat way, boy, you not gon' be happy 
I-I-I tote 50s, I'm a shooter like Young Pappy 
Bitch try to rob, we make her dance, Michael Jackson 
We was plottin', y'all was tryna get the pack in 
Get the pack in, you get robbed for a fraction 
I-I-I'm Lil Tay-K, I don't think you want no action
You want action, you get turned into past tense
Your boys deep? Well, let's get to subtractin'
Smith & Wesson made my 9 with sub-compaction
Fu-fu-fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch, I did the race 
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face 
Eli Blast crackin' 4s like a vase
Pop a nigga then I go out my way 
Do the dash then I go out the way
Ro-ro-rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace 
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face
Fu-fu-fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case 
But I ain't beat that case, bitch, I did the race 
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face 
Eli Blast crackin' 4s like a vase 
Pop a nigga then I go out my way 
Do the dash then I go out the way
Ro-ro-rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace 
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face
See it in my mothafuckin' face
