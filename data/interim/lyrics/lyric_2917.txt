Maybe if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
And maybe if I cry every day
You'll come back to stay
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, maybe
Maybe if I hold your hand
You will understand
And maybe if I kiss your lips
I'll be at your command
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, maybe
I prayed and prayed 
To the Lord 
To send you back 
My love 
But instead 
You came to me 
Only in my dreams
Maybe if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
Maybe if I cry everyday
You'll come back to stay
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, maybe
Maybe
Maybe
Maybe
