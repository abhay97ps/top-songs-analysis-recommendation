Ev'ry time my baby and I have a quarrel
I swear I won't give in
Then my baby starts to smile at me
And I know, I know I just can't win
When My Little Girl Is Smiling
There's nothing more I can Say
I see those big bright eyes
And then I realize
That girl is gonna get her way
When My Little Girl Is Smiling
I can't stay mad at her for long
Why should I want to fight
When I can hold her tight?
I just don't care who's right or wrong
When My Little Girl Is Smiling
It's the greatest thrill there can be
She gets her way it's true
But I know I won't be blue
As long as she just smiles for me
