When I was a boy, I didn't care 'bout a thing
It was me in this world and a broken dream
I was blamin' myself for all that was goin' wrong
I was way out there, on the wrong side of town
And the ones that I loved, I started pushing them out
Then I realized that it was all my fault
I've been lookin' for a lifeline
For what seems like a lifetime
I'm drowning in the pain
I'm breaking down again
Lookin' for a lifeline
So I put out my hand and I asked for some help
We tore down the walls I built around myself
I was struck by the light, and I fell to the ground
I've been lookin' for a lifeline
For what seems like a lifetime
I'm drowning in the pain
I'm breaking down again
Lookin' for a lifeline
Is there anybody out there?
Can you pull me from this ocean of despair?
I'm drowning in the pain, breaking down again
Lookin' for a lifeline
You know a heart of gold won't take you all the way
And in a world so cold, it's hard to keep the faith
I'm never gonna fade away
I've been lookin' for a lifeline 
For what seems like a lifetime 
I'm drowning in the pain
I'm breaking down again
Lookin' for a lifeline
Is there anybody out there? 
Can you pull me from this ocean of despair?
I'm drowning in the pain, breaking down again
Lookin' for a lifeline
