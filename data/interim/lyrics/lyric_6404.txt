With tender words
A man can hold a woman
In the palm of his hand
A tender word
Will do more than just please her
It will show her you care
A man
Simply because he's a man
Doesn't understand
Why a woman puts her heart and soul
Into building a world for him
A world she can share
Give a woman love
And she'll love you forever
Give a woman love
She'll stand by you forever
She was born to love
Give a woman love
Hold on to her
A woman can't help crying
When she's feeling alone
Hold on to her
Let her know that you need her
She'll come running to you
A man still needs a woman
Around him when his day is through
For a woman has so much to give
You're her reason for living
Whatever you do
Give a woman love
And she'll love you forever
Give a woman love
She'll stand by you forever
She was born to love
Give a woman love
Give a woman love
And she'll love you forever
Give a woman love
She'll stand by you forever
Give a woman love
Give a woman love
Give a woman love
