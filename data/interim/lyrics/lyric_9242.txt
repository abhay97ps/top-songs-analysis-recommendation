Love fire
Hold me close and breathe my name, start a
Love fire
Just a touch can light the flame, then it
Burns higher
Can't you feel the heat turn on
Starts glowing
Keeps growing, burning high
Chorus:
Love fire, higher and higher
Love fire, higher and higher
Through the night we're gonna try
Make our flame light up the sky, with our
Love fire, higher and higher
Love fire, higher and higher
We won't try to fight the flame
'Cause inside we feel the same
Love fire
I love you
And I know you feel the same, I just
Think of you
That's enough to spark the flame, and it
Burns higher
Can't you feel the heat turn on
Starts glowing
Keeps growing, burning high
