His old man was a rebel yeller
Bad boy to the bone
He'd say, "Can't trust that other feller"
He'd judge 'em by the tone of their skin
He was raised to think like his Dad
Narrow mind, full of hate
On the road to nowhere fast
Till the Grace of God got in the way
Then he saw the light and hit his knees
And cried and said a prayer
Rose up a brand new man
Left the old one right there
Here's to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope
Some people change
Against all odds
Against the grain
Love finds a way
Some people change
She was born with her mother's habit
You could say it's in her blood
She hates that she's gotta have it
As she fills her glass up
She'd love to kill that bottle
But all she can think about
Is a better life, a second chance
And everyone she's letting down
She throws that bottle down
Here's to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope
Some people change
Against all odds
Against the grain
Love finds a way
Some people change
Thank God for those who make it
Let them be the light
Here's to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope
Some people change
Against all odds
Against the grain
Love finds a way
Some people change
