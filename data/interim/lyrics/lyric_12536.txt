Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
By the look in your eye
I can tell you're gonna cry
Is it over me?
If it is
Save your tears for
I'm not worth it, you see
For I'm the type of boy
Who is always on the roam
Wherever I lay my hat
That's my home
I'm telling you, that's my home
You had romance
Did you break it by chance over me?
If it's so
I'd like for you to know
That I'm not worth it, you see
For I'm the type of boy
Who is always on the roam, mmm
Wherever I lay my hat
That's my home
Mmm, that's my home
Oh
You keep telling me
You keep telling me I'm your man
What do I have to do to make you understand?
For I'm the type of guy
Who gives girl the eye
Everybody knows
But I love them
And I leave them
Break their hearts
And deceive them everywhere I go
Don't you know that I'm the type of man
Who is always on the roam
Ooh, la
Na, na, na, na
Wherever I lay my hat
That's my home
Wherever I lay my hat, oh oh
That's my home
Mmm, yeah
That's my home
And I like it that way
Mmm mmm
Ooh
Ah, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Ah, ha, ha
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
You know
I can't make it all alone
Sometimes it's the way
That's the way
I'm not saying
I'm not saying
I don't love you
Just gotta do what I want to do
That's what I want to do
