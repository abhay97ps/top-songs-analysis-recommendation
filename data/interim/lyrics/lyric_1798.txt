As I look at the letter
You wrote to me
It's you, oh, it's you
I'm thinking of
As I read the lines
That to me, oh, so dear
I remember our faded love
I miss you, darling
More and more every day
As Heaven would miss
The stars above
And with every heartbeat
Lord, I still think of you
And remember our faded love
As I think of the past
And all the pleasures we had
As I watched the
Mating of the dove
For it was in, it was in the springtime
That you told me goodbye
But I still remember
I remember our faded love
