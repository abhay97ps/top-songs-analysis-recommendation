Lost feelings return
So now maybe I can learn
To stop the world of a lie
This time around
Are we, are we, are we ourselves?
Are we, are we, are we ourselves?
Because seen through these eyes
We lead a double life
No one will know
So check it out, steppin' out, here I go
Are we, are we, are we ourselves?
Are we ourselves and do we really know?
So they say, so they say
That to this earth, we are bound
Lost spirit returns
Now maybe we learn
To stop this whirl of a lie
To this earth, we are bound, I ask you
Are we, are we, are we ourselves?
Are we ourselves and do we really know?
Ooh, do we know? Are we ourselves?
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, oh, oh
Are we ourselves? 
Do we really know? 
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, oh, oh
Are we, are we?
