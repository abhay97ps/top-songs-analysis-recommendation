Every day, a shade of blue
You won't believe what I'm goin' through
It just feels like I can't afford to let myself go
No, oh-oh, no
Everyone is just the same
They touch me, but I can't say
There has been no one brighter than you
I can't deny these things that I do
Feels like the world's at stake 'cause
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for you
Heavenly, that's what you are
You're burning me, like a shining star
How am I supposed to be that king without you?
Oh-oh-oh, it's true, yeah
Everyone is just the same
They love me, but I can't say
There has been no one brighter than you
I can't deny these things that I do
Feels like the world's at stake, yeah
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for you
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
There has been no one brighter than you
I can't deny these things that I do
Feels like the world's at stake 'cause
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for you, yeah
I have seen no light brighter than you 
I can't deny these things that I do 
Feels like the world's at stake, yeah 
I have been waiting , I have been waiting for you
Every day I sit down and I feel like I'm waiting
For you
I've been waiting for you
For you
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for you
