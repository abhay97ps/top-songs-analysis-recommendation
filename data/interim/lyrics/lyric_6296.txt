You're such a natural woman
But you're so far away, baby
Mm, your love is drivin' me crazy
I'm comin' home
I know you can't live without love
I know you're feelin' so lonely
Save all your sweet lovin' for me
I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home
You gotta hold on, babe
I'm comin' home
So baby, hold on
Don't throw your love away
I'm comin' home
So baby, hold on, baby, hold on
You're such natural woman
You know my feelings about you
You know I can't live without you
I'm comin' home
I'm sorry I ever left you
I thought the free life was better
I know you can't wait forever
So baby, hold on
I'm comin' home
You gotta hold on, babe
I'm comin' home
So baby, hold on
Don't throw your love away
I'm comin' home
So baby, hold on, baby, hold on
I'm comin' home
Hey, I'm comin' home
You gotta hold on, babe
I'm comin' home
So baby, hold on
Don't throw your love away
I'm comin' home
So baby, hold on 
You gotta hold on, babe
I'm comin' home
So baby, hold on
Don't throw your love away
I'm comin' home
So baby, hold on 
You gotta hold on, babe
I'm comin' home
So baby, hold on
