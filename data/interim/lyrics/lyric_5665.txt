Verse
Give me space...
*whoop*
They tellin us to segregate
They bringin back apartheid
6 foot minimum, be a light to the dark side..
Life in the fast lane
But I don’t want the car ride
Standin on the rock with Alexa
Givin you a hard vibe..
*yeah*
Situation got a mask and I’m coverin all
*come on*
Salutations from Wakanda you gettin it y’all..
I advance and watch their limits expire by fall
Someone somewhere they’re responsible droppin the ball..
Is this a farce, all for unification, not down with it
*yeah*
Started off sparse, and it bloomed every nation, profound with it..
*yeah*
They say the world’s gonna end
But your problems aren’t the end though..
*whoop whoop*
You thinkin high of your self
*yeah*
Where’d you get it from Nintendo??
Show me the way that it slice
Show me the stats, is this the end?!?..
*what*
Take all your problems to Christ
Let him redact, every sin..
*come on*
Show me the way gat you contemplate
Quantum states now as you concentrate..
*go, go*
Quantify the cost of livin divided by the deaths and procreate..
Show me the way that we’re breakin out
Blatant now, what we chasin down..
Did you forget we was runnin a race
All for colors and shapes it’s crazy wow..
Dey say the world gonna end
...but not till I do my due..
*yeah*
..Shout it from da mountain tops HE’s comin to save
Take it to the bank and cash that, rose from the grave..
HE isn’t sayin it’s finished chill
Toss all the jazz out like Uncle Phil..
*whoop*
I be, rockin, with a, groove
And it’s, mine, get in, line..
How you, want to, set the, mood
Not concerned, with the, news..
All the, lies, and half, truths
I just, declare, what HE, says
And HE, says HE’s, comin, soon!!
HE’s comin BACK!!
Hook
They say the world’s gonna end
Your problems aren’t the end of it..
*Give me space*
They say the world’s gonna end
Let them all learn from it..
Give me space..
