Uh uh MH let's go
I can't blame you if you want to leave
Cuz' I'm not the man that I once used to be
But there's a change that has come over me
So before you go listen to my last plead
Ooh you're the love of my life
And I was doing wrong but I wanna do right
No more staying out all night
I wanna make it right wanna change my life
I don't wanna play no games
Wanna change your name to my name baby
Not gon' be the man that I used to be no
Can't take back the things that I did before
But baby I'm promising that my heart is yours
I know it ain't easy baby
But you gotta believe me baby
All I'm asking for is one more chance
I changed because of you
I, I, I, I, I wanna do right by you girl
I, I, I, I, I wanna spend my life with you girl
I don't wanna play no games
Wanna change your name to my name baby
I'm turning in my player's card
All because of you
You know let's go
I used to be the dude up in the club poppin' bottles wrist glistening
Shorty tried to tell me chill but I wasn't listening
I can't deny it you knew me for being immature
Only way of saying sorry take you to the ?? store
You told me all you really wanted was to see me more
Then the stress hit me hard like a meteor
I hit rock bottom you was there to pick me up
I neglected you we didn't hug didn't kiss enough
But you never threw nothing up in my face
Gave me all your love and your warm embrace yeah
Now I see I'll never find another like you
You the type boo make a playa wanna wife you
With me and you, this money's not an issue
And I miss you when I touch you I can feel it in my bone gristle
I'm still with you and I'm sorry bout the way I did you
Know it must have igged you but the trackman you know I'm getting?
Whoo MH uh
That's how we getting fab
