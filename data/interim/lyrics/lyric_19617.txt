I'm crazy for this little lady
I'm freaking for my little baby
Because she makes me feel good
She's so fine
Don't need all my other ladies
I'm begging for this little lady
Because I tell you she's cool
She's divine
I know she's a super lady
I'm weak and I've gone hazy yeah
I'm crazy for that lady
She's chic but she's not shady yeah
Sophisticated lady
And she makes me feel good
She's so fine
Never knew there was such a lady
That would make me want to straighten
Out my life at this time
But I find
I'm thinking about this pretty lady
I would love for her to have my baby
Because you know she's no fool
She's refined
Yeah
Don't you know she blows my mind
All the time
Because she makes me feel good
Like a real woman should
Yeah
She's so mine
Yeah
Yeah
Don't you know she blows my mind
All the time
Because she makes me feel good
Like a real woman should
Yeah
All the time
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
