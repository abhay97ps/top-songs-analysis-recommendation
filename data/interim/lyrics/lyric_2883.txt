Just got out of county
Caught up with me in Downey
It took fourteen country Mounties
To put a tail on this donkey
The Donkey Known as Me
Well I’d just come down from Frisco
Sold out of my disco
Just a front for selling crystal
To some closeted ex-Marines
And my fine young bride
Stepped into save my pride
When they tired to tattoo the Semper Fi
On the donkey known as me
The Donkey Known as Me
CHORUS:
I am not a donkey
I am not a donkey
But the donkey is me
The Donkey Known as Me
Well it started out in French Lick
Daddy was the House Dick
The carrot and the big stick
Were all I ever knew
No matter my decision
With science-like precision
Daddy laid the discipline
On the donkey known as me
The Donkey Known as Me
CHORUS
So I’m headed to Hawaii
Where no one can surprise me
If you want to find me
Sing oh, ma liki nigh yee
Molokai, Molokai, Ukulele, Ukulele, Kona Kai, Look a Lady low
I’ll be out there on my new turf
Galloping through the blue surf
The only surfing donkey
On the shores of Waikiki
Shores of Waikiki
I am not a donkey
I am not a donkey
Now the donkey is free
The Donkey Known as me
The donkey’s finally free
The Donkey Known as Me
F-R-E-E FREE!
