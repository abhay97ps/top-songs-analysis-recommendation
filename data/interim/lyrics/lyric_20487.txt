Great Scott, woo!
Ladies, I'm gon' need you all to back away from the door 
We are trying to make way for Chris Brown
Ladies, you are not listening 
I need you all to back away from the door
We are trying to make way for Chris Brown
I'm back
Pull up, pull up, can't believe the girls' club packed
What up, what up? Shawty wanna lead me to the back 
Ain't been in here fifteen minutes, got a pocket full of digits
And she just won't take no
Hold up, hold up, now lil' mama wanna get mad
Slow up, slow up, saying she don't wanna share what she have 
Ain't no particular one that's getting the water gun
So many that I want
They packed up in here wall to wall and 
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling 
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
They packed up in here wall to wall and 
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling 
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
Another two just came up and said they love me on the radio 
Two twins, that's a cool lil' scenario 
They talking leaving right now
Wanna put in some time 'cause you know what they all ready for
One talking how she like the way that I pop
And the other one  said she wanna just watch 
I'm game for any damn thing
But there's more than two hundred dames that's ready to go
They packed up in here wall to wall and 
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling 
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
They packed up in here wall to wall and 
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling 
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
They packed up in here wall to wall and 
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling 
I'm tryna give one of them all this 
But they keep coming from wall to wall 
They packed up in here wall to wall and 
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling 
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
So many look good in here 
I just don't know which one I want 
If I had to choose y'all know 
I would take all y'all with me
Who wanna try me on the floor? 
Who ready to come and get this? 
All I know that I'm feeling this party
And you can see I'm so with it
They packed up in here wall to wall and 
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling 
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall 
They packed up in here wall to wall and 
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling 
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall 
They packed up in here wall to wall and 
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling 
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
