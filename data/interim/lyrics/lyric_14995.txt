Ooh I'm wishin', boy I've got my eyes on you
This mystery is thrillin'
I'm not sure just what to do 
Ooh ooh ooh, it's so easy, it is no mirage to me
Touchin' gently, feel the love in me
Tell me whatcha gonna do with my lovin'
I'm crazy 'bout your smile
Whatcha gonna do with my lovin'
Please don't make me fantasize
Whatcha gonna do with my lovin'
Tell me now, ooh oh-oh
So hard lovin' daydreams, all my pleasures make believe 
I'm with you as my daydream
I never want to leave 
Ooh ooh ooh, this feeling shines like a precious jewel
And if you want me  all my love is for you
Tell me whatcha gonna do with my lovin'
I'm crazy 'bout your smile
Whatcha gonna do with my lovin'
Please don't make me fantasize
Whatcha gonna do with my lovin'
Tell me now, tell me now
