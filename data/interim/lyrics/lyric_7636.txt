Lazy moon
Magnolia bloom perfume
And Dixie would receive
A lady fading fast
Still clinging to the past
But she had you hating to leave
So long, Dixie
Sweet Dixie girl
You sure had style
Recalling times we've had
With all your good and bad
I'm glad I had you for awhile
When we get the blues
We just shine up our shoes
And head for Dixie's place
We sit ourselves right down
And pass the bourbon round
Let Dixie get on the case
So long, Dixie
Sweet Dixie girl
You sure had style
Recalling times we've had
With all your good and bad
I'm glad I had you for awhile
Years go by
Some memories fade and die
But, Dixie, you still shine
Now up here where it's cold
Folks don't understand your soul
Dixie, you're still part of mine
So long, Dixie
Oh, you sure had style
Recalling times we've had
With all your good and bad
I'm glad I had you for awhile
