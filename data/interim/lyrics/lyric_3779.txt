I just got out my little red book
The minute that you said goodbye
I thumbed right through my little red book
I wasn't gonna sit and cry
And I went from A to Z
I took out every pretty girl in town
They danced with me and as I held them
All I did was talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There's just no getting over you...
Oh, no...
There ain't no girl in my little red book
Who could ever replace your charms
And each girl in my little red book
Knows you're the one I'm thinkin' of
Oh won't you please come back
Without your precious love I can't go on
Where can love be I need you so much
Oh won't you please come back
Without your precious love I can't go on
It's haunting me I need you so much
