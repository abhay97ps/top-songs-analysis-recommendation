Well come down from your church
And talk to a man
Who knows that he loves you
And wants to understand
He knows why you cry
When you were young
You got down on your knees
You prayed for someone
Someone you could believe
Yeah, you put your faith
Right in his hands
Oh, when he let go
You couldn't understand
Welcome down from your church
And talk to a man
Who knows that he loves you
And wants to understand
He knows why you cry
Fallen angel, temptation had you lost
Single girl, you've been double-crossed
Hold on holy one, some day you'll be saved
And I want to be the one
On that blessed day
When you come down from your church
And talk to a man
Who knows that he loves you
And wants to understand
Fly down from your perch
And walk with a man
Who knows how to love you
Yes, I believe I can
I know why you cry
