Yeah birthday, it's your birthday

And how I come up with this shit up in the studio 
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

Referee with a whistle, brrrt, hold this tech 
Extendo clip  extendo roll

Hair-Hair Weave Killer goin' on a trapathon

Dope bomb, dro bomb and a pill bomb 
See nigga, I'm ballin', you in will call 
When I die, bury me inside the jewelry store 
When I die, bury me inside the Truey store 
True to my religion, two everything, I'm too different

Ahh, Yeezy, Yeezy, how you do it, huh?
It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy, huh?
She holdin' out, she ain't givin' to the needy, huh?
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV on
Y'all been together ten years, you deserve a m√©nage
'Specially if you put that BMW in a garage
'Specially if you paid a couple payments on her momma crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man, I hate those kids!
Last birthday, she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her "Do better"
She said, "How 'bout I get you jewelry from the West End?"
How 'bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend?
Ha, I'm jokin', I'm just serious, I asked her
"Don't be actin', like no actress, if we preachin', then we practice
Don't be reachin', don't be touchin' shit, we in Kanye West's Benz!
'Cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian, hah!"
They ask me what I do and who I do it for 
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio 
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store 
When I die, bury me inside the Louis store 
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

It's your birthday  it's your birthday 
Bad bitch contest, you in first place
You in first place, you in first place
Bad bitch contest, you in first place
I show up with a check to your workplace
Then hand the valet the keys to the Merces
Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on
What I'm seeing from the back I can't front on
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it, girl, get it, girl, get it, get it, girl
I might switch it up and get your girl
They ask me what I do and who I do it for 
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio 
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho 
When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store
