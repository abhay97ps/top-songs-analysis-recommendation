Why do we always meet on the edge of town?
Why do we have to wait till the sun goes down?
Where do you live and why don't you even give me a place to phone?
Come on, baby, why can't you bring me?
Baby, baby, why can't you bring me?
Come on, baby, why can't you bring me home?
Baby, baby, why can't you bring me home?
I've asked around, but nobody knows for sure
But they agree that your folks are mighty poor
Are you ashamed of where you were raised
And that's why it stays unknown?
Come on, baby, why can't you bring me?
Baby, baby, why can't you bring me?
Come on, baby, why can't you bring me home?
Baby, baby, why can't you bring me home?
You may not wear such pretty clothes
But when you're in my arms you look like a rose
What do I care if I see a broken chair?
Why do I need the best kind of silverware?
All that I need to make me complete is your tender love alone
Come on, baby, why can't you bring me?
Baby, baby, why can't you bring me?
Come on, baby, why can't you bring me home?
Baby, baby, why can't you bring me home?
Come on, baby, why can't you bring me?
Baby, baby, why can't you bring me?
Come on, baby, why can't you bring me home?
Come on, baby, why can't you bring me?
Baby, baby, why can't you bring me?
Come on, baby, why can't you bring me home?
Come on, baby, why can't you bring me?
Baby, baby, why can't you bring me?
Come on, baby, why can't you bring me home?
