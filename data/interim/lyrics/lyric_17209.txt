You say ya like to travel
But you don't even have a ride
Say you like walkin' around
But your shoes won't fit
I like certain people
But with wise words to give
I'm walkin' down onto the pier
And talk to the voice I hear
Chorus
Said I be leavin'
I'm lookin' for my wings in the sky
My journey's long over
And my body's tired
So when I'm leavin
I'll make sure I tell you good-bye
I know somebody really loves me
But I gotta be leavin'
You say you like nothin'
But somethin's always on your mind
You say ya don't think much
But you're always tellin' lies
I can read you
I think your're about money and greed
I'll pack my bags and be on my way
I can't stay...
