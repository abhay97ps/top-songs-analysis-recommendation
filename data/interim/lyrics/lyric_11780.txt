Seems to me, no matter what I do
I picked the wrong time to do it
In a minute, I will be all right
If you will let think it through
I could comb my hair
And walk right out of here so fast
Let the silence tell you that
I've grown up at last
You'll never break in woman in me
Though you might break the smile
You'll never hurt the woman in me
But you might hurt the child
Can I help it if it feels good
To have your arms wrapped around me
When you touch me, I'm a little girl
And there's so much that I still need
Give me room to touch my own heart
I'm not so weak
I could fly away and leave you
With a kiss on the cheek
You'll never break in woman in me
Though you might break the smile
You'll never hurt the woman in me
But you might hurt the child
You'll never break in woman in me
Though you might break the smile
You'll never hurt the woman in me
But you might hurt the child
