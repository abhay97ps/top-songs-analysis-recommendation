Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
You're not alone
Together we stand
I'll be by your side
You know, I'll take your hand
And when it gets cold
And it feels like the end
There's no place to go
You know, I won't give in
No, I won't give in
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through
'Cause, you know, I'm here for you
I'm here for you
There's nothing you can say 
Nothing you can do 
There's no other way when it comes to the truth
So 
'Cause, you know, we'll make it through, we'll make it through
So far away
I wish you were here
Before it's too late
This could all disappear
Before the doors close,
And it comes to an end,
With you by my side,
I will fight and defend 
I'll fight and defend 
Yeah! Yeah!
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through
'Cause, you know, I'm here for you
There's nothing you can say 
Nothing you can do 
There's no other way when it comes to the truth
So 
'Cause, you know, we'll make it through, we'll make it through
Hear me when I say, when I say I believe
Nothing's gonna change, nothing's gonna change destiny
Whatever's meant to be will work out perfectly
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
La da da da
La da da da
La da da da da da da da da...
'Cause, you know, we'll make it through
'Cause, you know, I'm here for you,

There's nothing you can say 
Nothing you can do 
There's no other way 
'Cause, you know, we'll make it through, we'll make it through
