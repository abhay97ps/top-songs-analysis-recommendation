'Cause it can drive you outcha mind
There ain't no sense in crying
It's time for you to leave 
And baby that's the bottom line
Oh, I betcha lie awake nights, and never rest a bit
And wish it all would disappear
But still the bottom line is you got to deal with it
And to yourself at least be fair
Holding on

Listen to me now
Well, you know when the feeling's gone
Then you've got to stop holding on
'Cause that makes it twice as bad
You can't give love that you don't have
So why drag it on and on and on
And on and on and on and on? Yeah
Holding on...when love is gone
Holding on...when love is gone
Holding on...when love is gone
Holding on...when love is gone
