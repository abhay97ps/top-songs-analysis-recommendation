She's so beautiful
Why's she so beautiful?
Mmmmm
Mmmmm
Ooh
Baby, I don't want no drama
Imma take you from your father
Imma take you to Nirvana
Nobody else I would rather
I want your heart till it stops
If I got you I won't swap
Imma keep you after chops
We can fly and island-hop
Baby, baby, fall in love with me
I proper like you, you're my cup of tea
She say "Lancey, baby, I'm a freak"
I want your aura, I don't wanna shmeat
I really like her, God, will you sort me?
I'm a Kurt, she be my Courtney
I won't play her, long as she don't pause me
Imma lay her down, before she wounds me
I need a promise, empower
Please give me more than some hours
Lancey love em, fire flower
I ain't been in love in my life
So many reasons to make her my wife
Ill intention, yes the car fuck a knife
Imma keep it real and yes, never lie
Be my one and only, be my one and only
Be my one and only, be my one and only
Baby, I don't want no drama
Imma take you from your father
Imma take you to Nirvana
Nobody else I would rather
I want your heart till it stops
If I got you I won't swap
Imma keep you after chops
We can fly and island-hop
I'm Petey Pablo out of interest
I'm Freekey Zekey outta' Dipset
I'm Michael Jackson in a string vest
I'm Dennis Rodman at his simplest
That's my baby baby, not my baby though
That's my lady lady, not the crazy hoe
Imma take her for a long lived wavy bone
Rest in peace A$AP Yams, long live wavybone
Pause, I need some love for a second
Make my baby meet a reverend
I do not care what you reckon
No nigga make me feel no threaten
Whip that 3 and a half to a 7
My baby will bag it and sell it
My baby will bag it and sell it
She can be my one and only, be my one and only
Baby, yes, I trust you
Never put nobody above you
Baby, I don't want no drama
Imma take you from your father
Imma take you to Nirvana
Nobody else I would rather
I want your heart till it stops
If I got you I won't swap
Imma keep you after chops
We can fly and island-hop
