Some enchanted evening
You may see a stranger
You may see a stranger
Across a crowded room
And somehow you know
You know even then
That somewhere you'll see her
Again and again
Some enchanted evening
Someone may be laughing
You may hear her laughing
Across a crowded room
And nite after nite
As strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter will
Sing in your dreams
Across a crowded room
Then run to her arms
And make her your own
Or all through your life
You may dream all alone
Never let her go
