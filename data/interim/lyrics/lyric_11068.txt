You, soft and lovely are
Lighting my dreams
Like a morning star
Rocking my world
With your open arms
I could not feel the sun
Looking for something
So high above
Guess you could say
I was blind to love
Hey, only a lonely heart sees
Where love can be
Hey, only a lonely heart sees
Where love can be
Where love can be
You, magic in your eyes
Peaceful and clear
As a summer sky
Showed me the truth
Behind love's disguise
I could not hear a sound
Pure as the melodies ever sung
Two strings together
That makes us one
Hey, hey, hey
Where love can be
You, breezing through my mind
Oh, no, my lady, I can't deny
You know the way to paradise
Oh, could this be blown apart
Standing alone in the pouring rain
Running from love
When it brings you pain
