I had to escape
The city was sticky and cruel
Maybe I should have called you first
But I was dying to get to you
I was dreaming while I drove
The long straight road ahead, uh-huh, yeah
Could taste your sweet kisses
Your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside
I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright? 
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that alright? 
I drove all night
What in this world keeps us from falling apart?
No matter where I go, I hear the beating of our one heart
I think about you when the night is cold and dark, uh-huh, yeah
No one can move me the way that you do
Nothing erases this feeling between me and you, oh
I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright? 
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that alright? 
I drove all night
I taste your sweet kisses
Your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside
I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright 
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Is that alright?
I drove all night
 I drove all night
 To get to you
 Is that alright?
 I drove all night
 Crept in your room
 Is that alright?
I drove all night
