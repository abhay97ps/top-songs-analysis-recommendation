Every since last year every month feels like October to me
It's just that feeling man
October to me seems like a memory
The Girls on tumblr tellin me they in love with me
Yeah
Except a few girls from the city tho
They misguided
They always lying
Could Never tell me the truth
Like who she sleeping with too
Saying I would have a chance
But I end up getting used
And
I got used to it
So anything she told me I wasn't new to it
I would just adapt to it
Put on a mask like I'm Jim Carey I would just act through it
Sometimes I had to tweet through it
Some nights I had the henny bottle I would drink through it
Feeling ran deep into my heart like a cavity
Actually
I felt so disconnected from reality
Stuck in this me and you fantasy
Why can I not be with you
After all the things you put me through
October to me
October to me seems like a memory
Yeah
October to me
October to me
Seems like a memory
I should  listen to friends more
But It's too many drinks being poured
Right now
I remember one time I was 38 points in the friend zone
I should've packed up like Lebron and just went home
Man
I was confused and couldn't let go
Learned the hard way some of these women are just cutthroat
We can talk later I just need to get my mixing on
I just to need to reminisce with some in scents on
I just need to let the Tea burn one time
I just need to let the Tea burn one time
So I can match the beat with the tears in my eyes
Had to realize that she was full of lies
She probably staring at her phone
Wondering why I won't reply 
I told her to Take Care
Cause Nothing was the same
I am So Far Gone
If You're Reading This It's Too Late
I needed Room For Improvement
On my Comeback Season
I wouldn't let go but she gave me a reason
Left me on this microphone heart still bleeding
Ear waiting for the phone my subconscious can  still hear it ringing
