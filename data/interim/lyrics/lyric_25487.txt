You a real bitch, light it up 
You a real bitch, go 'n' light it up

She wanna be the one, she ain't the only one 
I got a bop in the trap, got a bop on my lap 
Bitch, I'm a dog but I don't got to chase the cat 
They pull up where I'm at, get the addy from their friends 
I don't keep loose change and I don't top loose ends
If a nigga want beef, if a bitch want beef
We put it on the grill, serve that bitch to the street
