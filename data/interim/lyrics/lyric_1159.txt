Let me in whee-ooh 
I can see the dancin' 
The silhouettes on the shade
I hear the music , all the lovers on parade
Open up , I want to come in again
I thought you were my friend
Pitter patter of those fee-ee-ee-ee-eet
Movin' and a-groovin' with that be-eat
Jumpin' and stompin on the flo-o-o-o-oor
 Let me in!
 Open up!
Why don't you open up that door? 
I-uh  hear music let me in 
I want to come in again
Let me in , a-well I heard it just then
I thought you were my friend
Pitter patter of the fee-ee-ee-ee-eet
Movin' and a-groovin' with that be-eat
Jumpin' and stompin on the flo-o-o-o-oor
 Let me in!
 Open up!
Why don't you open up that door? 
I-uh-I-uh-I  hear music, let me in 
Oh I heard it just then
Let me in 
I want to come in again
I thought you were my friend
