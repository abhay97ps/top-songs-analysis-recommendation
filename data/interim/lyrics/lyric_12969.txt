There, there was a time I knew
That no matter come what may, love will prevail
And then, inside the dreams I knew
Came the question lover's fear, can true love fail
Then I would miss the childhood wish
And haven't I sung to you
Of the knight in armour bright
Faithful and true to you
Darling, after all
I will be the one to hold you in my arms
After all, I will be the one to hold you
I will be the one to hold you in my arms
In my arms
I know in my heart and mind
That no matter come what may, love will survive
Love, the author of space and time
Keeps the galaxies and each sparrow alive
And the love that heals the wound after the war is through
Is the knight in armour bright, faithful and true to you
