There you sit
All by yo'self
Everybody's dancin'
They can't a-help themselves
The mood is much too strong
You can't a-hold out longer
So get up
Don't fight it
You better get on up
And get that groove
You know what, baby?
I like the way you move!
Ya do the Thing
Like you oughta be, alright
So don't fight it
Whoa, baby, yeah, yeah
The way you Jerk
The way you do The Twine
You're too much, baby
I'd like to make you mine
And after the dance
I'm gonna take you home
So don't fight it
Baby, you've got to feel
Don't fight it, oh, no
You got to feel
Fades-
You can't fight it
No
