Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide no escape from reality
Open your eyes look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
Poor boy
I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, Little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter
To me
To me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
 didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
As if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama,  
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the fandango?
Thunderbolts and lightning very very frightening me
Galileo 
Galileo 
Magnifico-o-o-o
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go
Will you let me go?
Bismillah!
No, we will not let you go
Let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go
Let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go
Let me go
Let me go-o-o-o-o
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Will not let you go
Never let you go
O-o-o-o-o
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia
Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has the devil put aside for me, for me, for me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters, to me
Anyway the wind blows
