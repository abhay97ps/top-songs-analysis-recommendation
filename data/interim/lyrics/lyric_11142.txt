A little while ago I went and placed a call
To tell this girl I know that she could have it all
The wedding, the ring, the whole dumb thing
I was willing to tie the knot
So I called her up, and this is the answer I got
"I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
Leave your name and number
And I'll try and get back to you
You have thirty seconds to talk to me before you're through"
And I said, "Baby, let's go get married
Well, I need to know you're mine
I am hangin' on, I am hangin' on
I am hangin' on this line
And if I can leave one message
Before you go to bed
I would say to you..."
And the phone went dead
So I stepped out to buy some dog food for the cat
Of course she called about three minutes after that
Would she be my wife and share my life?
Well, of course you can write the plot
'Cause she called me up, and this is the answer she got
"I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
Leave your name and number
And I'll try and get back to you
You have thirty seconds to talk to me before you're through"
And she said, "Baby, I got your message
Well, I'm answering your call
I have thought it out, I have thought it out
And I think that all-in-all
If you ask if we can marry, and make it for all time
Then my answer is..."
And the phone went
"I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine"
