Woo
I'm a maniac, go crazy for the cash 
Green Lamborghini, paper tags 
Ridin’ through the city, 30 mags 
Niggas snitchin', they the police with no badge 
How I grew up, my momma was my dad 
So when I blew up I put her in a pad 
I like to throw up when I think about the crash 
Not playin', when I hit the tree I smell the gas 
Lookin’ at the sky, think about my past 
When I used to kick the door, shoot you for the cash 
Everybody hit the floor 'fore you make me mad 
Devil had a nigga soul livin' too fast 
Prayin' to the Lord, my soul to keep 
Controllin' me , take a hold of me 
Bitches ain't shit, got exposed by E! 
So naive , cold in the streets 
Sleep on my feet 
Money turn homies to zombies, they eat 
Miss my grandma, she was humble and sweet 
I don't speak, let the check talk for me 
I can’t sleep ’less the TEC in my reach 
Hit the dope, make me choke, make me wheeze 
Sip the dope, help the pain at ease 
Tryna get the money 'fore it clean, it was dirty 
Playin’ football, hide the fire in my girdle 
Gettin' locked up, runnin' round in a circle 
Brother caught fifteen like he did a murder
Now my whole family hurtin'
Tryna see the light but we couldn't pull the curtain
Night time lurkin' 
Momma said the streetlights 'bout to stop workin' 
Lookin' at my momma in her eyes 
Lookin' at me like a new person 
She tellin' me I need to slow down 
The pain don't go away with the Percy 
That was when the rap wasn't working 
Living in the trap, it's a circus 
See my grandma in a hearse 
And Pistol P gone in the casket
Shot's fired, nigga blasting 
Cops, they arrive, start smashing 
Opps, we shoot shots like the Mavericks 
Vaults, put the cash up and we stash it 
You flop, we doing numbers can't imagine 
Money tunnel when the roof panoramic 
Count the bundles 'til my hand start crampin' 
I come with the drip, I need a napkin 
I'm a maniac go crazy for the cash 
Green Lamborghini, paper tags 
Ridin' through the city, 30 mags 
Niggas snitchin', they the police with no badge 
How I grew up, my momma was my dad 
So when I blew up I put her in a pad 
I like to throw up when I think about the crash 
Not playin', when I hit the tree I smell the gas 
Lookin' at the sky, think about my past 
When I used to kick the door, shoot you for the cash 
Everybody hit the floor 'fore you make me mad 
Devil had a nigga soul livin' too fast
Prayin' to the Lord, my soul to keep 
Controllin' me , take a hold of me 
Bitches ain't shit, got exposed by heat 
So naive , cold in the streets 
I been crossed out by my own brother 
Ain't no rules in the street, don't trust 'em
Ran it up and I had to go and bust it
Police 'bout to kick the door, now we gotta flush it
Ridin' on the backstreets thinkin' 'bout my brother
Prayin' that he come home to his loving mother
Can't believe it that I got it all out the gutter
FaceTime 'round three, Mike in a puddle
How am I 'posed to take it? 
Niggas dyin' 'round the same time I had a baby 
Here go the operator 
Let the gang know Pistol ain't 'gon make it 
Now my mind going brazy 
Got me feeling like I was the cause of the hatred 
Holdin' the revolver with the laser 
They done killed my nigga, start the war, bring the nation 
I got a boss situation 
Military basis when we travel 'cross the nation 
Double up the cup with maple 
Abomination on your paper, I got acres
Black man when you walking and you labeled
Beat the odds, they don't wanna see you greater
Eat you alive like a lion or a 'gator
Mommas crying cause the police shot they babies
They crooked, the motherland they done took it 
They take us and lock us up and throw the booklet 
Started rapping then I shook it 
I hate the fame, everybody keep on looking 
We done sold out Brooklyn 
Man, I miss my Grandma cookin' 
Treat me like a don 'cause I'm gifted 
I'm a run the money up, gotta go and get it 
I'm a maniac go crazy for the cash 
Green Lamborghini, paper tags 
Ridin' through the city, 30 mags 
Niggas snitchin', they the police with no badge
