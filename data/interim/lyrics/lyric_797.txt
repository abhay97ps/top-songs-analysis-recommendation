Tell me why
Why the stars in the sky
Are the same kind of stars
That I see in your eyes
I love you, yes I do
Oh, won't you tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why, tell me why
Why my heart skips a beat
Every time that you're near
Every time that we meet
I love you, yes I do
Oh, won't you tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
I love you so
You know my heart will never
Let you go
You know my love for you
Is on the square
When I wake up in the morning
I find you right there
Tell me why, tell me why
Why my heart skips a beat
Every time that you're near
Every time that we meet
I love you, yes I do
Oh, won't you tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
I love you so
You know my heart will never
Let you go
You know my love for you
Is on the square
When I wake up in the morning
I want you right there
Tell me why, tell me why
Why my heart skips a beat
Every time that you're near
Every time that we meet
I love you, yes I do
Oh, won't you tell me why
Tell me why
