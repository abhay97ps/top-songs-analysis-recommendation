I'm not yours an' baby you're not mine
We've got somethin' and it sure is fine
Let's take our love
One night at a time
There's one thing that we both agree
I like you and baby you like me
Let's take our love
One night at a time
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right
One night at a time
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right
One night at a time
Oh, I think about you all day long
It feels so good it can't be wrong
I've got my fingers crossed
That this goes on and on
Tomorrow, well, that's another day
Come on baby now, what do you say
Let's take our love
One night at a time
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right
One night at a time
Oh, I think about you all day long
It feels so good it can't be wrong
I've got my fingers crossed
That this goes on and on
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right
One night at a time
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right
One night at a time
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right
One night at a time
All night, love all night
