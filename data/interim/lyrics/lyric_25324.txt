My earrings cost a half a ticket, I don't hear the same shit y'all niggas hear
On God
Pockets on Cheez-Its, heavy on the cheddar 
Run off with your money, Savage a.k.a. Jerry Heller 
Too much drip, I'm rainin', bought a Gucci umbrella 
Why you always trippin' bitch? You must look up to Ella 
It's only the first night and she keep tryna snuggle 
I slept on my back just so I ain't have to cuddle 
Nothing 'bout me average, hit her with a Fendi rubber 
Feel like a magician, all these bitches that I juggle 
'Rari red, Bentley black, got a Demon and a Cat
Check the stats, all facts, rap made me a lot of racks
Down bad, caught a flat, change his tire, he got jacked
Ass fat, waist snatched, can I get some of that pussycat?
1.5  on the ride 
Niggas die  when we slide 
Draw the line  pick a side 
Ain't no switchin'  on my guys 
1.5  on the ride 
Niggas die  when we slide 
Draw the line  pick a side 
Ain't no switchin'  on my guys 
Offset!
Catch a vibe 
The doors go up, suicides 
The diamonds poke your eyes 
Don't tread my gang, they shiest 
I don't take advice 
I don't care 'bout price 
Sticks, the boss don't fight 
Flippin' bricks in the loft at night 
Told her "Get what you want, I swipe" 
Hop in the Lambo, brains open 
My chain soakin' 
Codeine in my vein, I'm strokin' 
I put her head in motion 
This Patek right here a trophy 
Passed out on the Herm√®s sofa 
Straight face, this a game of poker 
The green Lambo a ogre 
We pass the bitch 
Got to flippin' the bitch in the wrist 
Just ask your bitch 
I fuck, no kiss 
Walked right in this bitch, don't touch me, don't get frisked
Let's get lit 
1.5  on the ride 
Niggas die  when we slide 
Draw the line  pick a side 
Ain't no switchin'  on my guys 
1.5  on the ride 
Niggas die  when we slide

Ain't no switchin'  on my guys
