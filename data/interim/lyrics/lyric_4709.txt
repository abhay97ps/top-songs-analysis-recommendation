I wrote a little song about my mama and my daddy
Mama's name is Rita, my daddy's named Jack
I sung about the twins, Bren and Lin
Big brother Ed and little brother Mac
I'm the son of the man, the Louisiana man
He's got the fishing lines strung up cross the Louisiana river
Catching anything, the Louisiana man
I'm writing songs and singing 'em, I'll make it if I can
I've got to make a living, I'm the son of the man
Son of the man, the Louisiana man
Mama couldn't speak a word of English
And Daddy couldn't read or write
I've got to write a song for the Pozo-Seco Singers
The Seekers, the Tremeloes, the people on the bayou
'Cause I'm the son of the man, Louisiana man
He ties his fishing lines strung up cross the Louisiana river
Catching anything, this Louisiana man
I'm writing songs and singing and I'll make it if I can
I've got to make a living I'm the son of the man
Son of the man, the Louisiana man
Got to make a living I'm the son of the man
Son of the man, the Louisiana man
Got to make a living I'm the son of the man
Son of the man, the Louisiana man
