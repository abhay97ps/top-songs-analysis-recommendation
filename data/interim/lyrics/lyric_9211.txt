If I only knew what wakes me
If I only knew
Then I would be outside walkin'
Through the morning dew with you
It shouldn't be too far
It shouldn't be far away, away, away
If I only knew which road went where
If I only knew
Then I would be outside walkin'
Through the morning air with you
It shouldn't be too hard
It shouldn't be hard to see, to see, to see
Hey you
Put some funny looking clothes on
Me too
Then we can run around and show our happy glow
If I only knew what it would take
If I only knew
Then I wouldn't make the same mistakes
That I usually do with you
It shouldn't be too hard
It shouldn't be hard to do, to do, to do, to do
