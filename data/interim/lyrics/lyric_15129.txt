I think of you much more than
I would like to admit that I do before strangers
But there you are
Whistling through the trees again
Rustling through the leaves my friend
A feather on my pillow lets me know that you're near
I remember the night that you arrived
December maybe '95
Your hair and your breath smelled of John Player Specials
A stranger who I learned to love
A friend when really no one was
My Daedalus, my wings to fly
Why'd you leave me behind?
My beautiful crow
And all those black feathers perched deep in my soul
Won't let me, let you go
I never really thanked you for all of the light
You brought into my mother's eyes
So many others tried
Her sadness since the day you left
She will not get out of bed
She stares out the window, smokes a black pack of JPS
I was out on St. Paul's when I heard about your fall
Walking with Caroline, she bums smokes from time to time
I walked home alone that night
I could feel you when I closed my eyes
I looked up into the night and watched black feathers fall from the sky
I think of you much more than I'm allowed to admit
But I do, I still do
My beautiful crow
And all those black feathers perched deep in my soul
Won't let me, let you go
I have tried to push you down
I have tried to cut you out
You're rattling your cage
I'm rattling my cage
I have tried to drown you out
Drink till I don't hear the sound
The song's still the same
The song's still the same
My beautiful crow, and all those black feathers
Perched deep in my soul
Won't let me, let you go
