Do do do do do
Do do do do do
I never, never had a dream come true
In my every dream, I'm loved by you
And we're free as the wind
And true love is no sin
Therefore, men are men, not machines
I never, never had a dream come true
Without you, the world out there is painted shades of blue
Since our roads never crossed
I work just to please the boss
Think I might as well get lost in my dreams
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
I never, never had a dream come true
Yes, I'm going to dream about you baby my whole life through
Seems my folks are ashamed
Said I ain't worth a thing
But I'm glad I'm chained to my dreams
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Keep on dreaming
Do do do do do
Sing along with me
Do do do do do
Keep on dreaming
