Sally met him in the war back in 1944
He took her home to the states
His buddies thought that she was great
Subway Sally's 51
Her man is gone her dreams are done
She rides by night the Brooklyn train
Sleeps by day to hide the pain
Lonely women of the world were the happy girls
Lonely heroes of the world seek the happy girls
Nancy saw him on the street
His shoes were shined, his suit was neat
She couldn't see his broken mind
Behind the mask of being kind
He sleeps inside the iron bars
Nancy's smile can't hide the scars
Her daughter's grown, there's no one home
She cries all night, she's all alone
Lonely women of the world were the happy girls
Lonely heroes of the world seek the happy girls
To tell the truth there's no end in sight
Mr. Lonely always calls at night
Let's hold on tight until the morning light
Terry's gonna meet him soon
Today at school maybe noon
I hope for her it turns out right
I know she's got a date tonight
Had my ups, had my downs
Truth was lost but truth was found
This I've learned the world still turns
We all get bruised, we all get burned
Lonely women of the world were the happy girls
Lonely heroes of the world seek the happy girls
Happy girls
Happy girls
Happy girls
Happy, happy, happy
