I've read all of the books under romance
Hoping to find you someday
Now someday is right now
I've seen the guy get the girl in the movies
But never thought I'd be the one
To run off with you in that gown
It's a worse or for better
A once upon a time
'Cause that's what loving you is like
Like when Jack told Rose that she's the one
When Cinderella fell for that prince at the ball
Like when Johnny asked Baby for one more dancе
But they ain't met us, no, they ain't mеt us yet
Those eyes remind me of all of the long nights
Praying to God that you'd call
And I'm so glad you did
'Cause darlin', here now, I finally know
I know just how Romeo felt when she smiled
But they don't know your kiss
It's a worse or for better
A once upon a time
'Cause that's what loving you is like
Like when Jack told Rose that she's the one
Like when Cinderella fell for that prince at the ball
Like when Johnny asked Baby for one more dance
Noah asked Allie to take his hand
Like when Beast saw Belle the very first time
Girl, where next on the list with your hand next to mine
They say nothing last forever, so forget what you read
But they ain't met us, no, they ain't met us yet
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
It's a worse or for better
A once upon a time
'Cause that's what loving you is like
Like when Jack told Rose that she's the one
Like when Cinderella fell for that prince at the ball
Like when Johnny asked Baby for one more dance
And Noah asked Allie to take his hand
Like when Beast saw Belle the very first time
Girl, where next on the list with your hand next to mine
They say nothing last forever, so forget what you read
But they ain't met us, no, they ain't met us yet
They ain't met us yet
They ain't met us yet
No, they ain't met us yet
Ahh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
