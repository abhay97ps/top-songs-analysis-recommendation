Walk in your rainbow paradise 
Strawberry lipstick state of mind 
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine
Honey 
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey 
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
You're wonder under summer sky 
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me
I just wanna tell you somethin'
Lately, you've been on my mind
Honey 
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey 
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey 
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do 
I'd walk through fire for you 
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey , oh, honey
I'd walk through fire for you 
Just let me adore you 
Ooh, ooh
Oh, honey
Ooh, ooh
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
