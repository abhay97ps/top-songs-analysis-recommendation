As time goes by
You will see
That we're going to be free
You and me, we'll touch the sky
Can't you see in your mind's eye
That we are one, we're all the same
And life is just a simple game
Oh do do do
Do do do
Oh do do do
There by your side 
I will be 
When this crazy world is free
Free from doubt
When it finds out
Exactly what we're meant to be
That we are one, we're all the same
And life is just a simple game
Oh do do do
Oh do do do
Do do do
Thoughts of another day
Flashing through my head
Thinking how life could be
All of the things that I lately have said
Be what you wanna be!
What we deserve to be!
What we are meant to be!
Oh do do do
Oh do do do
Oh do do do
As time goes by 
You will see
That we're going to be free
You and me, we'll touch the sky
Can't you see in your mind's eye
That we are one, we're all the same
And life is just a simple game
Oh do do do
Do do do
Oh do do do
You and me
We'll touch the sky
Oh, can't you see
Oh, do do do
Do do do
Oh do do do
Oh do do do
Do do do do
