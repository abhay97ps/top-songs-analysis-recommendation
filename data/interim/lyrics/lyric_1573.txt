I may get weary
Women do get weary
Wearing the same shabby dress
But to one who's weary
Try a little, try a little tenderness, oh oh oh
I may be waiting
Just anticipating
All of the things I may never possess
Mmm, but while I'm waiting
Try a little, try a little tenderness
I may be, I may be sentimental
But I wanna say that I've had my griefs, oh, and I've had my cares
And just a good word, soft and gentle
Makes it, makes it easier, easier to bear
Now I might regret it
Oh, but don't let me forget it
Love's my only, only happiness
Mmm, but it's so, so easy
Try a little, oh, try a little tenderness
Tender, tender, tenderness
