Well, it started out and went down south
Took a left, turned and headed on out
It was movin' along very slow, now
'Cause it was travelin' by word of mouth
Made a short stop at New Orleans
Then, it headed for the New York scene
And the people there, they dug on it
'Cause they found out just what it means
Yeah, to have rock 'n' roll music
Sweet groovy music
Well, it's the only kind of music, yeah
That reaches right into your soul, yeah
A-come a guitar-pickin' fella
And then he took it by the hand
He said "Now, listen to me, everybody
I got a message that you gotta understand"
And then he took that brand new music
And he led it 'cross the U.S. of A
And now some folks laughed when they heard that sound
But it looks like it's here to stay
And they call it rock, rock 'n' roll music
Sweet groovy music
Well, it's the only kind of music, yeah
That reaches right into your soul, yeah
Rock 'n' roll music
Rock 'n' roll music
Rock 'n' roll music
Talkin' 'bout rock 'n' roll 
I like rock 'n' roll, yeah 
Long live rock 'n' roll, yeah 
Talkin' 'bout rock 'n' roll 
Rock 'n' roll, sweet groovy music, yeah 
I like rock 'n' roll, yeah 
I dig rock 'n' roll 
Aw, long live rock
