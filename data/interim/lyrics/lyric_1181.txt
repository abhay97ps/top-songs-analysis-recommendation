Shh, listen, my friends while I tell you
About a girl that's so divine
I love her for the joy she's brought me
For she's mine all mine
Oh, Jamie 
I'm talkin' 'bout Jamie 
Talkin' 'bout Jamie 
That's my love
Hair so long and pretty
Eyes that shine like gold
She has the kind of love for me
That will never, never grow old
Oh, Jamie 
I'm talkin' 'bout Jamie 
Yeah, talkin' 'bout Jamie 
That's my girl 
Ooh, she comforts me when I am sad now
She sticks with me when times are bad
She kisses me and holds me so tight
To me she's out of sight
Oh, lips so warm and tender
Kisses so divine
I thank the Lord up above
For making Jamie all mine
I'm so glad to belong to her
And she's mine, all mine
Oh, Jamie
Talkin' 'bout Jamie
Ahh, talkin' 'bout Jamie
That's my girl
Uh, here she comes, huh
I'm talkin' 'bout Jamie
Yeah, talkin' 'bout Jamie
That's my girl
