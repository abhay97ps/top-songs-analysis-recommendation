Niggas thought I was trash
I was pissed then
I'm a Bad Boy like a Piston
Now I'm in your ear get your soul shook
Feel like Shang Tsung, get your soul took
Feeling like I'm Drake I am On One
Dropping skulls on the track like Shao Kahn
I am cooking up, Ghost Rider, Johnny Blaze
Bitch, I'm a star call me Johnny Cage
Before I had the pleasure I had nuthin but pain
I'm the last of my kind, airbending bars nigga you can call me Aang
Still spitting flames like I'm pyro
People call me Norman cause I go Psycho
I don't need a team like the X-Men
I just need me a watch like Ben 10
Feel like the dopeman cause I got what you need
Moving past these hoes at Korosensei speed
She said that I’m a dog and I’ll always be alone
Now I’m eating good and she just want the bone
This ain’t wheel of fortune, I ain’t Pat Sajak
Feel like Homey the Clown cuz you know I don’t play that
I just do The Right Thing Like Spike Lee
But I still got the juice, I ain’t talking Hi-C
I remember when the Jordan’s I could barely afford
If u play with me, send your ass straight to the morgue
Please don’t try me or you might do the dash
Call me Vegeta, cause this your Final Flash
I remember I was low in the dirt I almost reached bedrock
Now these bitches calling me so I can the Bedrock
Like Little Debbie I just want the cake
So I make a poltergeist, make the house shake
I was on the grind while these niggas smoking backwood
Beat a nigga up like my name Ryan Atwood
Shape shifting bars like my name Mystique
I ain’t Rick James but your girl a Super Freak
Climbing for the bands like Nathan Drake
Crash Bandicoot watch out for the snakes
These rappers clean like praying nuns
Flexing on the gram with fake guns
I’m am the one just acknowledged it
While these other rappers fake like counterfeit
No Cosby, but I get the bills
Got em saying yep like King of the Hill
My flow is fantastic like Reed Richards
Trying to get green like the Geico lizard
My flow is getting to cold I just made a blizzard l, I am very mean
Took your girl to Dairy Queen
Your girl got brain I think she need a scholarship
Hard out here like Taraji bitches jumpin ship
All it took was concentration
Had to bring it back rescutation
Call all y'all goons
I am Doctor Doom
I bring the pain
Like my name was The Rock
I feel like my niggas
I call Static Shock
I feel Johnny Blaze
So I light it up
Not no Usher
I'm in the mix
I don't give a fuck
Niggas I rap like I'm beating you up
Rocky Balboa so lets go get tough
