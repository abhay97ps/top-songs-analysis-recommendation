So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
Nothing's quite the same now I just say your name now
But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't want me back
You're just the best I ever had
So you stole my world now I'm just a phony
Remembering the girl leaves me down and lonely
Send it in a letter, make yourself feel better
But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't need me back
You're just the best I ever had
And it may take some time to patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I run away and hide
And I may find in time that you were always right
You're always right
So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
What was it you wanted? Could it be I'm haunted?
But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
I don't want you back
You're just the best I ever had
The best I ever had, the best I ever
