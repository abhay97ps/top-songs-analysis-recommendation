Why, make me plead
For what I need
And I need you
Why, why make me weep
Cry in my sleep, 'cause I need you
Say "maybe"
Won't you even say "sometime", baby
Won't you ever say lovin' words again
Say, baby
Don't you know I'm a fool about you
If I tried, I could live without you
For maybe a day I
I've been around, finally found
That I need you
And I, I know what I got
And I got a lot
But, baby, I need you
Say "maybe"
Won't you even say "sometime", baby
Won't you ever say lovin' words again
Say, baby
Don't you know I'm a fool about you
If I tried, I could live without you
For maybe a day
Ooh
What I'd do
Say 'maybe" baby
"Cause I need you
Say
Can I stay
Say "maybe" yeah
'Cause I need you
Say "maybe"
Won't you even say "sometime", baby
Won't you ever say lovin' words again
Say, baby
Don't you know I'm a fool about you
If I tried, I could live without you
For maybe a day
Say, "maybe"
Don't you know I'm a fool about you
If I tried, I could live without you
For maybe a day
Say, baby
Don't you know I'm a fool about you
