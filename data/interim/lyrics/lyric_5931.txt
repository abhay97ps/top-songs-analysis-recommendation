The dance parties
In your living room
Kool and the Gang
Kool and the Gang
Really get down on it
It's just another wasted night
Where we drink until we pass out
Waking up late in the morning
To a hammer slamming into my brain
I feel like we've been going nowhere slower
When we both just got pulled over
Cause I'm swerving in the opposite lane
Lick that J
And smoke your spit
So I can get my fix
So I'll be high
And you'll feel alright
It's just another wasted night
Where we drink until we pass out
Waking up late in the morning
To a hammer slamming into my brain
I feel like we've been going nowhere slower
When we both just got pulled over
Cause I'm swerving in the opposite lane
