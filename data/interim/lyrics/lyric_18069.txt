My little third grade hand wrote I love you
On a note of yellow paper
And sent it to the front of the row to a little blonde-haired girl
The blonde-haired girl just opened it and read it to herself
I was so embarrassed when she turned around and said
I'm already taken
You spoke up too late
I love somebody else
So you'll just have to wait
The years flew by so quickly
And there we were in junior high
I realized that I still loved her so
So I called her up and told her exactly how I felt
Then she said there's something that you really ought to know
I'm already taken
You spoke up too late
I love somebody else
So you'll just have to wait
So wait I did and never changed my love for that little blonde-haired girl
Who's now the mother of our little blonde-haired boy
Who's to our hearts so close
I hate to think how fast he's growing up
Last night I overheard them as she tucked him into bed
He said, Mommy, will you marry me?
And this is what she said
I'm already taken
You spoke up too late
I love your daddy, son
So you'll just have to wait
I'm already taken
You spoke up too late
I love your daddy, son
So you'll just have to wait
