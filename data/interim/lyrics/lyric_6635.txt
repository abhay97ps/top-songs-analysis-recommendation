If you're down and confused
And you don't remember who you're talking to
Concentration slip away
Because your baby is so far away
Well, there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Don't be angry, don't be sad
And don't sit crying over good times you had
There's a girl right next to you
And she's just waiting for something to do
And there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Do-do, do do, do do, do-do
Do-do, do do, do do, do-do
Do-do, do do, do do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Turn your heartache right into joy
She's a girl and you're a boy
Get it together, make it nice
Ain't gonna need any more advice
And there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Do-do, do do, do do, do-do
Do-do, do do, do do, do-do
Do-do, do do, do do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
