Born on a hungry street
Children of darkness grew up on the beat
Anything in our way
We'll just move away
I've got the heart to win
You've got the eyes that say that I can
We're gonna turn this town
Upside down tonight
They can't stop us now
Body rock
Get your body in the music
Body rock
Comes from deep inside you
Body rock
Let your body talk to me tonight
We come from underground
Oh, stickin' together, gonna turn the world around
Runnin' through the neon night
With a dream inside
This feels like something new
Heartbeats, your heartbeat comes straight at you
We've got the moment now
Once we're on the move
They can't hold us now
Body rock
Get your body in the music
Body rock
Comes from deep inside you
Body rock
Let your body talk to me tonight
Body rock
Means you do it like you feel it
Body shock
Turns the beat electric
Body rock
Let your body talk to me tonight
Oh, yeah
Body rock
Get your body in the music
Body rock
Comes from deep inside you
Body rock
Let your body talk to me
To me, to me, to me, to me
Body rock
Means you do it like you feel it
Body shock
Turns the beat electric
Body rock
Let your body talk to me tonight
Body rock
Body rock
Body rock
Body rock
Body rock
Body rock
