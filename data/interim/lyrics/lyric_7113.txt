Seems like everybody's waitin'
For the new change to come around
Waitin' for the day
When the king, queen of show's singing 'round
Singing 'round
Singing 'round for everyone
You can understand everything's to share
Let your spirits dance, brothers everywhere
Let your head be free, turn the wisdom key
Find it naturally, see you're lucky to be
Dig this sound
And spin around and 'round and 'round
Can I just hold you, baby?
Something on your back, lay it down
Don't you know, honey, maybe
You're like my childless hometown?
Sing it loud
Time for you to all get down
Dig this sound
And spin around and 'round and 'round
Do you understand everything's to share?
Let your spirits dance, brothers everywhere
Let your head be free, turn the wisdom key
Find it naturally, see you're lucky to be
Sing it loud
Time for you to all get down
Sing it loud
Time for you to all get down
