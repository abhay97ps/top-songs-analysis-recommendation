Your lips taste like wine to this heart of mine
Just being with you is like a dream come true

Can't keep my dream, these constellation
I'll hold you forever
I'll need you never

You're the one that's in me
And leave when the loving get's it's stronger, stronger
Stronger, stronger

I need you so
I need you
I love you
Gotta have you baby
