Something in the way the music's makin' me feel
I can't stay in one place
I can't keep still
And if you ain't gon' dance
Then baby don't fuck with me 
I'm on the floor 'cause something's gotten over me
And if you can't stop your head
It's the music
If you can't stop your feet
It's the music
'Cause we don't try to deny it's still groovin'
You better not touch that dial
Don't stop the music
Oh, don`t stand too close to the speakers
You'll get caught up
And don't come around here buggin'
My nigga, don't truck
It's my favorite jam
And you don't wanna fuck with me, yeah, yeah
I'm on the floor 'cause something's gotten over me
And if you can't stop your head
It's the music
If you can't stop your feet
It's the music
'Cause we don't try to deny it's still groovin'
You better not touch that dial
Don't stop the music
And if you can't stop your head
It's the music
If you can't stop your feet
It's the music, music
'Cause we don't try to deny it's still groovin'
You better not touch that dial
You oughta thank us for helpin' you
Be yourself again
You oughta thank us for helpin' you
Be yourself again
You better not touch that dial
Don't stop the music
And if you can't stop your head
It's the music
If you can't stop your feet
It's the music, music
'Cause we don't try to deny it's still groovin'
You better not touch that dial
Don't stop, don't stop
Let the music bump, bump, bump
Bump, bump, bump, bump
Let the music bump, bump
Let the music bump, bump
Let the music bump, bump, bump
Bump, bump, bump, bump
Let the music bump, bump, bump, bump
It's the music
I make ya wanna dance
We don't try to deny
Ha, come on
And if you can't stop your head
It's the music
If you can't stop your feet
It's the music, music
'Cause we don't try to deny it's still groovin'
You better not touch that dial
Don't stop the music
And if you can't stop your head
It's the music
If you can't stop your feet
It's the music, music
'Cause we don't try to deny it's still groovin'
You better not touch that dial
Don't stop the music
