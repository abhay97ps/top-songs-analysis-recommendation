Well, alright you squares, it's time we smoked
Fire up this funk and let's have a toke
It'll make you dance and some of everything
Everybody get high, sing
Bustin' out
Bustin' out 
Bustin' out
Bustin' out
Bustin' out
We're bustin' out of this L-Seven square
Freaks like you and I could never funk from there
We're bustin' out, everybody come along
We're gonna dance on the funk and make love on this song 
We're bustin' out and if everyone agrees
Put your hands in the air and sing along with me 
We're bustin' out on the funk 
We're bustin' out on some serious funk, y'all 
We're bustin' out on the funk 
We're bustin' out on some serious funk, y'all 
Bustin' out 
Bustin' out 
Bustin' out 
Bustin' out
Bustin' out
We're bustin' out of this serious joint
It was too square for me, do you get my point?
We're bustin' out, now we're free from the square
We done braided our hair, we don't mind if you stare 
We're bustin' out and we don't give a damn
If you don't like our funk, then take your stuff and scram 
We're bustin' out on the funk 
We're bustin' out on some serious funk, y'all 
We're bustin' out on the funk
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Bustin' out
We're bustin out, we couldn't wait, we couldn't wait 
We're bustin' out 'cause we're too damn straight 
Now that we're all a little free to communicate
That we're all a little stoned and we freak when we're at home
And for me I only freak when I'm bustin' out, one more time
That we're all a little stoned and we freak when we're at home
And for me I only freak when I'm bustin', so take that
We're bustin' out on the funk 
We're bustin' out on some serious funk 
We're bustin' out on the funk  
We're bustin' out on some serious funk
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

We're bustin' out on some serious funk
