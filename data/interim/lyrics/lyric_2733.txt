Poppin' bottles and
Poppin' pills that's
All night long
Baby tied down
Leave the red light on
Butterfly blade and I
Mean it when I say
You really shouldn't love me
You really shouldn't love me
I've got
Friends up above me, and
Friends down below me, you
Think that you know me, you
Really don't
But if you wanna know
Baby drink it slow
And listen to what I say
Have you
Ever been in love, and you
Went to pick them up, and their
Eye was swollen shut, have you
Ever had a friend, that you
Thought was good again, say they
Loved you till the end, in a
Note beside the bed
Sweetheart I got
Reasons why I wear all black
And
Stay strapped everyday, had a
Friend stabbed through the face, never
Goin out that way
I'm goin out with a bang
Poppin' bottles and
Poppin' pills that's
All night long
Baby tied down
Leave the red light on
Butterfly blade and I
Mean it when I say
You really shouldn't love me
You really shouldn't love me
