Was a girl in the rain
No one else could feel her pain
Was a boy all alone
Nothing left to call his own
Something came along
Secrets of surprise
Force of love was far too strong
Saw it in their eyes
They tried
And they tried
They tried
But they couldn`t play it off
Love is contagious
When it`s alright
Love is contagious
Love is contagious
Yeah, it`s alright
Love is contagious, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Now they`re standing in the light
Got a love that`s sure enough tight
Kind that stops on the street
Ain`t about being discreet
Our love`s a storm in disguise
It`s alright
I couldn`t keep away if I tried
Understand
It`s in your hands
Cause I tried and I tried
I tried
But there ain`t no playing it off
Love is contagious
When it`s alright
Love is contagious
Love is contagious
Yeah, it`s alright
Love is contagious, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ah
I tried
And I tried
I tried
But there ain`t no playing it off
Love is contagious
When it`s alright
Love is contagious
Love is contagious
Yeah, it`s alright
Love is contagious, yeah, hey
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Our love`s a storm
You can`t deny
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh
Oh, yeah
