Warm summer nights got me thinking of you
Warm summer air got me thinking of you
Walking through the city with my headphones ‘
Tune the world out tune the music in ‘
Walking through the city and my head begins to spin ‘
Thinking back when ‘ thinking back when
Understand plan was simple never had a plan in mind
Hand in hand  felt so easy when I had your hand in mine
Now it seems ‘ endless days of summer are no longer mine
But that’s fine but that’s fine ‘ cause I got this rhyme in mind
You know you can’t hit the mark if you don’t aim
You know they say nothing ventured then nothing gained
You know you can’t grow up without a little pain
You know you can’t blow up without a little fame
Warm summer nights got me thinking of you
Warm summer air got me thinking of you
Walking nowhere but I’m thinking of you
Ain’t a got care cause I’m thinking of you
This the sorta weather when you looking out the window like
I might ride my skateboard ‘ trolley or  a pedal bike
Downtown  to the park dunking on em like I’m Mike
Now I’m hungry need a bite eating at a shop called Ike’s
I might stop ‘ get a bite of some ice cream
I might blink ‘ see this all just a nice dream
I might drink ‘ a whole glass of some ice tea
I might wink ‘ at a girl that’s looking nice to me
This that sorta weather ‘  whether or not you admit it
You noticing the sundresses with tops so fitted
Girls are looking so fly something like some Quidditch
I used to be kinda shy but now I’m not so skittish cause
Warm summer nights got me thinking of you
Warm summer air got me thinking of you
Walking nowhere but I’m thinking of you
Ain’t a got care cause I’m thinking of you
When the sun shines
Crack a beer and unwind ‘
Reminisce on the fun times
Remember that one time
Playing a song by Atmosphere ‘ something called Summertime
Feel it in my skin feel it in my mind
Play me Santeria cause my life is feeling so Sublime
Baby stand right here ‘ got me feeling that I done fine
These the sort of moments that I wish I could just stop time
You and I together in the Summertime Summertime
If I’m corona ‘ then you my lime
If I’m the sun ‘ then you my shine
If I’m the actor ‘ then you my line
If I’m the rapper ‘ then you my rhyme
Warm summer nights got me thinking of you
Warm summer air got me thinking of you
Walking nowhere but I’m thinking of you
Ain’t a got care cause I’m thinking of you
