Part 1: Too Cool
It's Eazy
I'm just too cool 
I'm just too cool 
I stay lit like my birthday is the 4th of July 
I wake up like this, I don't really even have to try
I'm just too cool 
I'm just too cool 
I'm just too cool, yeah
Coolest nigga on the block
Corduroy slippers with the black socks in 'em 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
I'm feeling like 2Pac 
Got some knowledge but I'm on the block 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
I like cool ranch Doritos
And ice cream in the wintertime 
Both sides of my pillow 
North Pole in the summertime 
I'm just too cool 
I'm just too cool 
I stay lit like my birthday is the 4th of July 
I wake up like this, I don't really even have to try
I'm just too cool 
I'm just too cool 
I'm just too cool, yeah
It's gon' be your favorite song
