Sneakin down your alley way
And knockin' on your door
Thought I had enough
But I'm back for more
Cinnamon, let me in
Knock, knock, let me in
I won't go away
Oh, uh, uh
I'm gonna see ya
If it takes all day
Oh, uh uh
Cinnamon let me in
She la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la la, la, la, la
One potato, two potato
Three potato, four
Open up, Cinnamon
I want more
Five potato, six potato
Seven potato, eight
Give it to me, Cinnamon
I can't wait
You can't hide, girl
I'm comin' inside, girl
Do what you want to
Baby, I'll let you
Might as well face it
Cinnamon, you know I'm gonna get ya
She la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la la, la, la, la
She la, la, la, la, la, la
