Love is here 
And oh my darlin', now you're gone 
Love is here 
And oh my darlin', now, now you're gone 
You persuaded me to love you and I did
But instead of tenderness, I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell so unaware
Of the loneliness that was waitin' there
 You closed the door to your heart
 And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me
Love is here 
And oh my darlin', now you're gone 
You made me love you 
And oh my darlin', now you're gone 
You said lovin' you would make life beautiful
With each passin' day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked, just walked away
 You stripped me of my dreams
 You gave me faith, then took my hope
Look at me now
Look at me
See what lovin' you has done to me
Look at my face 
See how cryin' has left its trace 
After you made me all your own 
Then you left me all alone 
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowin' that your love I couldn't keep
 My heart cries out for your touch
 But you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air
Love is here 
And oh my darlin', now you're gone 
Love is here 
And oh my darlin', now you're gone 
You made me love you 
Oh my darlin', now you're gone 
You made me love you  
Ooh, oh my darlin', now you're gone 
You made me love you 
Oh my darlin', now you're gone
