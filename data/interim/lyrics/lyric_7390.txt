Three horses grazing out my window
Brown, black, and white they stand
Rolling pastures they can wander
Free and easy is their land
Don't ever take away my freedom
Don't ever take it away
Let me treasure and keep that one part of my life
And the rest we're gonna find one of these days
Is that the sound of a raindrops I hear falling?
How I love, love to hear that sound
It makes me think of all the people that I love
And all the quiet moments I've found
Don't ever take away my freedom
Don't ever take it away
We must cherish and keep that one part of our lives
And the rest we're gonna find one of these days...
One of these days
When I am old and thinking over the whole life that I've led
If there's one final wish left to me
I will pray that the children, who are yet to be born
I will pray that they will always live free
Don't ever take away their freedom
Don't ever take it away
We must cherish and keep that one part of our lives
And the rest we're gonna find one of these days
One of these days
There is a time for the singing and the sunshine
There is a time for the thunder and the rain
There is a time for the changing of seasons my friend
But there is one thing we must never change
Don't ever take away our freedom
Don't ever take it away
We must cherish and keep that one part of our lives
And the rest we're gonna find one of these days
Don't ever take away our freedom
Don't ever take it away
We must cherish and keep that one part of our lives
And the rest we're gonna find one of these days
Don't ever take away our freedom
Don't ever take it away
We must cherish and keep that one part of our lives
And the rest we're gonna find one of these days
