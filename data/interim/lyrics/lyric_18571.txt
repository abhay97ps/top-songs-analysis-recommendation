You know
I don't know what it is 
But everything about you is so irresistible
Don't you try and tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
When he makes me weak with desire 
I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase
But I can't stop fanning the fire
I know I meant to say no
But he's irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical, deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me
Oh, that I can hardly breathe 
Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right?
That I should really say goodnight
But I just can't stop myself from falling 
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
 That I don't wanna play no game 
'Cause when I feel his arms wrapped around me
I know I meant to say no 
But he's irresistible 
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe 
More than just physical, deeper than spiritual 
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me
Can't you see?
Whenever he's close to me
I really find it hard to breathe
He's so irresistible
Baby, you know it's more than just spiritual
His kisses are powerful
He's so irresistible 
But he's irresistible 
Up close and personal 
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe 
More than just physical , deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me
He's irresistible
Up close and personal 
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe 
More than just physical, deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me
