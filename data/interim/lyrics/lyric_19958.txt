 Who be the King of the Sound? 
Busta Bus back to just put a lock on a town 
Lot of my bitches be comin from miles around
See they be comin' cause they know how the God get down
Now you know who holdin' the throne so gimme the crown
Niggas solutin' and tryna give me a pound
 I don't really fuck with you niggas, you niggas is clowns
Making the bitches strippin', throw they shit on the ground
 Now that's the way that it goes 
When we up in the spot the shit be flooded with hoes 
See we a make it hot, the chicks will come out their clothes
That's when you get it, mami already know I suppose
Shorty wildin' and Shorty open, she beastin' it out
For the record, just a second I'm freaking it out
 While she tryna touch see I was peepin' it out
She turned around and was tryna put my dick in her mouth
Touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it

 And as we started, got me ringin' her bell 
When I come I be doin' it and doin' it well 
Then I beat up the coochie and be makin' it swell
Tryna hide the smell of the sex, spraying on the Chanel
Then they try to walk with a strut so no one could tell
 How a nigga got in they butt, made everything jail
 Now the chick will wild like a nut, she blowin' my cell
 Can't get enough of the kid, I put her under my spell
 It's crowded, mami, move it along 
If you know you 'bout it then get to removin' your thong 
To the whip and back of the truck that's where you belong
After the yac, see the type of raunchy shit they be on
Street niggas respect it 'cause my movement is strong
 'Cause we consistently rep and see my money is long
All my bitches is wit' me, see how they singing the song
Plus how we give you the stick and we be dickin' along
I let her
Touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it

 The God of the block, see that I'm back 
Every single time that I drop, the shit is a wrap 
For the niggas hatin' the kid I'm close to strap
Cause all these bitches wanna come talk to sit on my lap
Every time I give you bang shit to knock in ya whip
 Nigga always do his thing, bitch, lockin' the strip
 Lot of mamis is dancin' and shakin' their hips
After that they get low and put the thing on their lips
I let them
