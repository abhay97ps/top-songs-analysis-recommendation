You know, I was
I was wondering, you know
If you could keep on
Because the force
It's got a lot of power
And it make me feel like ah
It make me feel like… ooh!
Lovely is the feelin' now
Fever, temperatures risin' now
Power is the force, the vow 
That makes it happen, it asks no questions why 
So get closer 
To my body now
Just love me
'Till you don't know how 
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Touch me and I feel on fire
Ain’t nothin' like a love desire 
I'm melting 
Like hot candle wax
Sensation 
Lovely where we're at 
So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complainin' 
'Cause this is love power 
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Ooh!
Oh, baby
Keep on
Keep on
Heartbreak enemy despise
Eternal 
Love shines in my eyes 
So let love take us through the hours 
I won't be complainin'  
'Cause your love is alright, alright 
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
