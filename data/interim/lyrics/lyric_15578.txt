It's got to be you
Standing here in my correspondent shoes
I don't need no place to go
Sometimes I feel like making other plans
Should I stay here, I don't know
I've an idea, the world is just a stage
It's not original but I call it mine
We are all actors, actors everyone
Making entrances, learning lines
All I want is to feel alive
All I need is to be satisfied
All I want, all I want
All I need is you
I have built upon this reputation
Lived by proxy for a little while
It's a glamour life
There can be no denying
When you're walking the miracle mile
All I want is to feel alive
All I need is to be satisfied
All I want, all I want
All I need is you
Standing here in my correspondent shoes
I don't need no place to go
Sometimes I feel like making other plans
Should I stay here, I don't know
All I want is to feel alive
All I need is to be satisfied
All I want, all I want
All I need is you
All I want is to feel alive
All I need is to be satisfied
...
All I need is you
All I want is to feel alive
All I need is to be satisfied
All I want, all I want
All I need is you
