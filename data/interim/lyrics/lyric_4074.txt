Clyde-Stuart
Somewhere in the shadows of my mind
I know there is, I know there is
A girl who waits for me
Who only needs my touch to live
And I am sure that you are she
So walk to me and take me by the hand
And lead me to, and lead me to
The bright untarnished sea
There give me love and share my dreams
And then I'll know that you are she
Don't even know the color of your hair
But once I see you standing there
I will know you instantly
So if you're in the fields across the way
And wond'ring if, and wond'ring if
You dare come up to me
Don't hesitate, don't be afraid
For I will know that you are she
