This ain't a song for the broken hearted
No silent prayer for the faith departed
And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so thrown, I don't know what to do
But to give Part 2 of my
You better stand tall
When they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break
Baby, don't back down
These are my confessions
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
 I just wanna live while I'm alive
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
I just wanna live while I'm alive!
