Do you see what I see
light dancing on the distant skies
where it was just born
without even a thought
For it is in the absence of thought
the absence of everything external
that we may glimpse a light
deep within ourselves
Spinning through future and past
speaking through silent words
searching all our lives
for what is right within our minds
Do you feel what I feel
a warmth that grows within my soul
calling for the release
of everything bound to this earth
And somewhere between heaven and earth
somewhere that we live
when our minds are not confined
breathes the breath I just released
Its echo hangs among the mist
vibrating back and forth
until it is released
to come crashing back to earth
Do you see what I see
a wall of simple ignorance
growing from beneath the empty streets
overshadowing the peace of every moment
For its bricks are made of blood
the blood of bitter words and deeds
thrown around like casual sex
landing at the feet of our youth
And somewhere lost in time
lies the innocence of nothing
for what grace can we hope to find
if we cannot first find peace
