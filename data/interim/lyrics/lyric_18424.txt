Until the break of dawn - life, life
Cannot go by the letter - time, time
Prozac can make it better - noise, noise
Any kind will do;
Can you feel it slip away when it's all on you 
Crime, crime - rockin' like Janet Reno - time time
Eighteen and life in Chino - Freud, Freud
All along it's true;
Well you'll see there comes a day catches up to you, yeah!
Knock down the walls - it's alive in you!
Knock down the place - you're alone, it's true!
Knock down the walls - it's alive in you!
You gotta keep your head up through it all
You're gonna bust out on it 
Break out, yeah! 
Bust out on it 
You never stop now, stop now
That's what the main man say!
You can do it!
You know it smells like shit - God damn!
