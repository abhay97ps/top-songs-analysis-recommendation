She tells me all the time that she loves me
She even poured the wine at the same
She taught me like my first great teacher
To love and I love the same
And I love to go to school, I like to shoot pool
I can't be a fool
'Cause I'm her fool
I've run like a dog when she calls me
'Cause she pets me when I bury my bone
I stay overnight with her sometimes
But I don't stay over long
'Cause I gotta go to school, I like to shoot pool
I can't be a fool
'Cause I'm her fool
I'm her fool in the evening
And I'm her fool when it's dawn
I guess I'd be on her side
Even if her side were wrong
You're really right, you're right
You're really wrong, you're wrong
You're really right, you're right
You're really wrong, you're wrong
You're really right, you're right
You're really wrong, you're wrong
You're really right, you're right
You're really wrong, you're wrong
My papa said: "You made a mistake, son"
But my mama said: "That girl, she's alright"
Well, I come to my own decision
That I'm goin' to be with her tonight
'Cause I love to go to school, I like to shoot pool
I can't be a fool
'Cause I'm her fool
I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool
I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool
I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool
I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool
I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool
I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool
I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool
I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool
I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool
I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool
I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool
I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool
I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool
I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool
