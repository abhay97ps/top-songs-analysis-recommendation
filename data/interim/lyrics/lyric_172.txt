If I could see you just one time
Oh how it'd ease my troubled mind
If I could hold you just one time
And then pretend that you're still mine
Lips that used to thrill me so
They now thrill someone else I know
Gone is the love that once was mine
Wish I could see you just one time
I-I-I miss you so
Oh I need you so
I-I-I'd give this heart of mine
If I could see you just one time
Wish I could relive just one time
Turn back the pages and there I'd find
That same old love that once was mine
Wish I could see you just one time
I-I-I miss you so
Oh I need you so
I-I-I'd give this heart of mine
If I could see you just one time
