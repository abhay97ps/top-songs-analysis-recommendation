Here we are so close to the end now
Still holding on, we try and pretend now
Clinging to love we both know is dying
It's dying
We've tried and tried to find us a way out
But darling, all our dreams have now all been played out
Still we go on hopelessly trying
But how many times can we say goodbye?
And how many times can we see love die?
And how many times can we give it one more try?
Before we really say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
We're so in love but wrong for each other
Each hurt that heals brings on another
Both of us used, and  both of us using
Hey hey, darling, it's time to stop pretending
There's just no way to rewrite our ending
We're caught in this game
And we know we're both losing
But how many times can we say goodbye?
Hey, how many times can we live a lie?
Tell me how many times can we give it one more try? 
Before we really say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
How many times can we breakup and makeup?
Both of our hearts refusing to wake up
Just can't go on and on
Living a lie, though I'll always love you
How many times can we say goodbye?
And how many times can we live this lie?
How many times can we give it one more try?
How many time before we really say goodbye
Bye-bye, goodbye, bye-bye, goodbye
Bye-buh-buh-bye-bye-bye, goodbye, goodbye
