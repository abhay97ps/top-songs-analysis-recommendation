She gets too hungry for dinner at eight
She adores the theatre and won't arrive late
She'd never bother with people she'd hate
That's why the lady is a tramp!
Doesn't like crap games with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp!
She likes the free, fresh wind in her hair
Life without care
She's broke, it's oke!
She hates California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp!
Oh...
I get far too hungry to eat dinner at eight
I adore the theatre, but I never come late
Puck:
You'd never bother with anyone that you'd hate
Both:
That's why the lady is a tramp!
I like the free, fresh wind in my hair
Life without care 
Hate California, too cold and too damp
That's why the lady 
That's why the lady 
That's why the lady-y-y... 
That is why the lady is a tramp! 
Tramp, yeah
