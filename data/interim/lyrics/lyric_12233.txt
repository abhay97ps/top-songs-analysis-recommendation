How've you been, say it's me again
It's been a long, long time
And there's so much to say where do I begin?
I'll sit down and sing you a line
I'm hoping everything is fine
You've got me thinking of you, always
Every day, every night
And when I'm thinkin' of you, always
I want you more than life
Time is seasoned with endless love
Memories never fade
And all the distance makes it hard to love
But I dream about us everyday
Oh listen here, I've just gotta say
You've got me thinking of you, always
Every day, every night
And when I'm thinkin' of you, always
I want you more than life
I see your face every night when I'm dreamin'
I touch your smile far away
Girl without you my life has ended
But I'm hangin' on 
Sendin' all my love 
You've got me thinking of you, always
Every day, every night
And when I'm thinkin' of you, always
I want you more than life
