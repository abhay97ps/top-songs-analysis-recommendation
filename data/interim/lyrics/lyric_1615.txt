Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealin'
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
The-en suddenly I got that old-time feelin'
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you 
SPOKEN: Today I passed you on the street
SPOKEN: And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
SPOKEN: Somebody else stood by your side
SPOKEN: And, ya know, he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Oh, it hurts to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold ya just the way I used to do
Oh-oh-oh-oh heaven only knows how much I miss, how much that I miss ya
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
