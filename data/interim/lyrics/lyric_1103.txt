It makes sense that I should write this song
It’s been a while now since you turned the light switch on
And so powerfully opened up my eyes to see
Reality, now I’m free 
Reminisce on my Christ-less days
Evidence- my life and ways
It was like I was forever bent
I lived a life of decadence
Then you sovereignly intervened and I’ve been on your team ever since
I was saved and am being saved- present tense
And will be saved from the deadly pestilence
Your holiness got me worshipping You with reverence
You’re infinite and transcendent- yet with friends
Your love letter, the Old and New Testaments
Also the Christian’s best defense-It speaks of Christ, who was heaven sent
Forgive us for ever being negligent or hesitant to represent His excellence
The world chases after the cars with better tints
Your people long after Your glory- a better glimpse
The Author of my faith, praise Your marvelous grace
The type I can call and embrace when I fall on my face
So I’m lifting up my hands and I’m raising my voice
Even though the world thinks I made the craziest choice
They can laugh all they want, Lord, I do not care
And I don’t want to go to Heaven if God is not there
Hook:
Whom have I in Heaven but You?
And earth has nothing I desire but You
My flesh and my heart may fail however
The Lord is my portion forever
Verse 2
The penalty for my sin deflected- so glad I’ve been elected
I spread my hands out to my Savior as I genuflected
And then reflected on Christ, the globe spinner
 turned this out-of-control sinner into a soul winner
I can’t take credit for it- You’re too holy
I didn’t choose you, Lord, you chose me
The actual situation is ever since my youth
My natural inclination was to resist your truth
I was dead you said “Live!”
Now you’re teaching me to love you for who You are and not just what You give
It’s so divine- to maintain through the pain
It blows my mind how You came the way You came
Not a conquering hero, but a Suffering Servant
Lord, You died for a zero who doesn’t deserve it
You take shady dudes who hate the truth- Give them faith in You
Make them new creations too- All praises due
So praise Him- don’t hesitate from the right to left
Just thank Him and meditate on His life and death
Resurrected and exalted- forever so high
And why He chose me I might never know why
But I’m lifting up my hands and I’m raising my voice
Even though the world thinks I made the craziest choice
They can mock all they want Lord I do not care
And I don’t want to go to Heaven if God is not there
Hook:
Whom have I in Heaven but You?
And earth has nothing I desire but You
My flesh and my heart may fail however
The Lord is my portion forever
Bridge:
You could give me the Lex, the coupe, the Beamer, the Benz
The sex, the loot, the Cream or the ends
But next to the truth of Jesus, friends
It’s worth nothing 
Verse 3
And Lord, don’t let me get caught up in my own tapes
I saw what happened when Noah got drunk off His own grapes
So many ways to stumble- many boastful and loud
The Lord gives grace to the humble and opposes the proud
The Holy Spirit’s a great deposit; my life- He stabilized it
Today the object is to stay in the prayer closet
And when I come out, may they know that the Master lives in me
Through passion for ministry and loving sacrificially
No matter what, Lord, wean me off of the world
Can’t believe I found the costliest pearl 
For the glory of your name I’ve been made your own
By your grace justified through faith alone
That’s why I’m lifting up my hands and I’m raising my voice
Even though the world thinks I made the craziest choice
They can laugh all they want Lord- I do not care
And I don’t want to go to Heaven if God is not there
Hook:
Whom have I in Heaven but You?
And earth has nothing I desire but You
My flesh and my heart may fail however
The Lord is my portion forever
