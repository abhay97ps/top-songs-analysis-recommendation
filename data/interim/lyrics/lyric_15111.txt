Ooh
Baby, baby, baby
You stand all alone on your own
Please come inside from that storm
Stand where it's warm
I can see you're in need
Baby, please talk to me now
Swear nothing is wrong
You're so strong
Baby, don't hold this inside
Relax your pride
Let it go
Set it free
My baby, talk to me now
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through, darling?
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
I understand
Here's my hand
Why stand alone in the dark?
Open up your heart
Let this go
Set it free now
My baby, talk to me now
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through, darling?
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
I understand
That you're only one man
So much you can't take, baby
Yes, I understand that you've only got two hands
Stare into space
I see shadows of pain across your face
You avoid my advice
You avoid my embrace, baby
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through?
