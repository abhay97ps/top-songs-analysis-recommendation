Stars are hidden 'neath
My lids, I just can't keep on going
Now you're mine
Skies are falling, you
Are calling me and I will
Follow behind you
Tell me where we're going to
See the rain is softly falling
On my window pane
Don't know where
But I don't care
I will follow him
Until the stars grow dim
Until the wind has blown away
Hey you, tell me where we're going to
Follow me, follow me, follow me
My head is goin' 'round
My empty wrists are pounding
I don't know what to do
But I will follow you
Wind is cryin', trees
Are sighin', birds are flyin'
Higher now you're mine
Now the night is still
Wander where you will, and I
Will find you, tell me
Where we're going to
See the rain is softly falling
On my window pane
Don't know where
But I don't care
I will follow him
