I don't mind
Lettin' you down easy, but just give it time
If it don't hurt now, well just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feedin' on
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you 
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world
Ain't it good
Bein' all alone
Where you're from
You might be the one who's runnin' things
Well you could ring anybody's bell and get what you want
You see it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're livin' in a bubble
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you 
So what are you gonna do
When nobody wants to fool with you
Ohohoh, ohohoh
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world
Ain't it good
Bein' all alone
Ain't it good to be on your own
Ain't it fun, you can't count on no one
Ain't it good to be on your own
Ain't it fun, you can't count on no one
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Ain't it fun, ain't it fun
Baby, now you're one of us
Ain't it fun, ain't it fun, ain't it fun
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world
Ain't it good 
Bein' all alone
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world
Ain't it good 
Bein' all alone
Don't go cryin' to your mama 
'Cause you're on your own in the real world 
Don't go cryin' to your mama 
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world 
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
This is the real world
This is the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin'
Don't go cryin' 
Don't go cryin'...
