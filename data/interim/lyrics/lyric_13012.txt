I think that it's time daring we had a talk
I think that we're making a big mistake
I've been feeling lately the magic is gone
Are we just together for convenience sake, baby
I don't believe it , I don't think that's true 
It'll just pass  if we allow it to 
It's just a stage  we're going through 
I think you're just restless  for something new 
Baby, feeling like we pay our dime
And all we get in return is a peace of each other's time
Are we just taxi dancing, lost somewhere in a slow dance for two
And the band that was playing has finally stopped playing our favorite song
Are we just taxi dancing, you're playing for me and I'm paying for you
And are we holding on to a feeling with desperation
Don't know if you're right, don't know if you're wrong
Seems to me we haven't danced for long
Don't make it hard , don't make it easy 
I'll just walk away  at the end of the song 
Baby, put one last nickel in the juke box
Give that  we once felt just one final spin around
'Cause we're just taxi dancing, lost somewhere in a slow dance for two
And the band that was playing has finally stopped playing our favorite song
And we're just dancing
And the band that was playing has finally stopped playing our favorite song
Are we just taxi dancing, you're paying for me and I'm paying for you
And are we holding on to a feeling in desperation
Taxi dancing
