Dum-dum-dum-dum
There's snow on the ground, love in the air, sleigh bells are ringin'
This is what it's all about, the fire is warm, the angels are singin'
And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put an end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always that time of the year
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas, never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist, right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you
Look at the lights, twinklin' bright twenty-four/seven
Every inch of Central Park is covered in white, this could be heaven
And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put an end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always that time of the year, yeah 
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas , never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist, right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you
Woo, woo, woo, yeah 
Everyday, every night 
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas, never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist, right up at the top 
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you
Hey, hey, yeah, everyday, la-la-la
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
No matter the reason, no matter the season
My heart'll keep beatin', you better believe
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas 
Everyday that I'm with you 
Everyday that I'm with you 
Everyday that I'm with you
