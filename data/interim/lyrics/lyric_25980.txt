Let's go, let's go
Lil Uzi Vert
Let's go, let's go 
Not playin', oh-oh
 Let's go 
Alright now 
I done made so many millions
Ain't nothin' to think about
And she fuck with me because I am the one
That still come back even though I made it out 
I thought she was G, when I put in my D
She was screamin', she said, "Come on, take it out"
And loyalty, I swear that's everything
And for me, got niggas that's gon' kill it off 
And when I do a show, it's a hundred thousand
What the venue probably was just payin' out
And she know he a bum, so his girlfriend with me
And you know at late night she be stayin' out
I ain't do it on purpose, oops, my bad, I didn't mean
There goes the reason he hatin' now
Got a V12 that's all on my engine
That's prolly the reason that my head be racin' off 
I'm too evil, too evil, too evil, too evil
It's nobody out here can save me now 
I remember when I was younger
My girl ain't answer my phone and listen to "Take You Down"  
My diamonds, they dance like Chris Brown
Look at my wrist, it's lit now 
My niggas shootin' them rounds 
Fuck nigga better get down 
I'm not worried 'bout no niggas
These niggas, they fake, these niggas they hate
These niggas they all, um, perpetrate
These niggas ain't really with all the shits
These niggas, they walk around with dirty sticks
When I shoot two, I shoot a nigga his shit 
I don't play with niggas, these niggas, they hoes
I just do everything then, I suppose 
These niggas, they is really not my bros 
These niggas, they my foes 
I ran out of space, put diamonds that's all on my toes
I'm switchin' my hoes, same way I'm switchin' my clothes 
Rockstar goals, septum all on my nose 
I done made so many millions
Ain't nothin' to think about
And she fuck with me because I am the one
That still come back even though I made it out
I thought she was G, when I put in my D
She was screamin', she said, "Come on, take it out"
And loyalty, I swear that's everything
And for me, got niggas that's gon' kill it off
And when I do a show, it's a hundred thousand
What the venue probably was just payin' out
And she know he a bum, so his girlfriend with me
And you know at late night she be stayin' out
I ain't do it on purpose, oops, my bad, I didn't mean
There goes the reason he hatin' now
Got a V12 that's all on my engine
That's prolly the reason that my head be racin' off
Walked in and I had to go get a bag
Walked in and had to go get a big bag 
Brought the big bag for the brand new bae
Why the fuck would I care what you say? 
At a fuck nigga head like a toupée 
Okay, they wanna see a new wave 
Made two hundred racks in two days 
My diamonds they cooler than Cool J 
No, no, your swag don't move me 
That's not a new Rollie, that's a new face 
Spent fifty racks in Gucci
Spent eighty racks in Louis 
Okay, my life is great 
Walk around with a whole lotta uchi 
On the sides, got a fade like Boosie
Hand wet, I ain't playin' with her coochie 
I don't know why these niggas be playin'
I don't know why these niggas be watchin' 
I don't know why these niggas be clockin' 
That's why I got time for you 
'Cause a nigga like me, I'm not watchin'
'Cause a nigga like me, I'm not cocky 
Yeah, a nigga like me fill my pocket 
Yeah, a nigga like me be show-stoppin'  
I done made so many millions
Ain't nothin' to think about 
And she fuck with me because I am the one
That still come back even though I made it out 
I thought she was G, when I put in my D
She was screamin', she said, "Come on, take it out"
And loyalty, I swear that's everything
And for me, got niggas that gon' kill it off
