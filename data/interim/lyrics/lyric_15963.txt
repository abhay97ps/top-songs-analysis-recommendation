We spotted the ocean at the head of the trail
Where are we going so far away?
And somebody told me that this is the place
Where everything's better, everything's safe
Walk on the ocean
Step on the stones
Flesh becomes water
Wood becomes bone
And half an hour later, we packed up our things
We said we'd send letters and all of those little things
And they knew we were lying, but they smiled just the same
It seemed they'd already forgotten we'd came
Now back at the homestead, where the air makes you choke
People don't know you and trust is a joke
We don't even have pictures, just memories to hold
That grow sweeter each season as we slowly grow old
