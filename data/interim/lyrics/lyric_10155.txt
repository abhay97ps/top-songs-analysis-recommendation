Thank you for being a friend
Traveled down the road and back again
Your heart is true
You're a pal and a confidant
I'm not ashamed to say
I hope it always will stay this way
My hat is off
Won't you stand up and take a bow
And if you threw a party
Invited everyone you knew
You would see
The biggest gift would be from me
And the card attached would say
"Thank you for being a friend."
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
If it's a car you lack
I'd surely buy you a cadillac
Whatever you need
Anytime of the day or night
I'm not ashamed to say
I hope it always will stay this way
My hat is off
Won't you stand up and take a bow
And when we both get older
With walking canes and hair of gray
Have no fear, even though it's hard to hear
I will stand real close and say
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Let me tell you bout a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
And when we die and float away
Into the night, the Milky Way
You'll hear me call, as we ascend
I'll see you there, then once again
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Whoa, tell you about a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
