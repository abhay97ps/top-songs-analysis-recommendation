Here's a song I want
Everybody to listen to
It's talking about love
And it's talking about hate
You know, I think the only way
We're gonna do away with hate is
To get so much love going around
That there just won't be any more hate
There's so much hate going on today
On the right and on the left
You see, we hate our brothers
Yes, we do, and we hate our own self
There's even hate going on today
Between the young folks and the old
Can't see all this hate is really
Eating up our very soul
That's why I'm singing now
I hate hate, everybody listen to me
I hate hate, all sing together now
I hate hate, the good Lord above
Don't you know I love love
I really, really love love
Alright, I want you to listen
To this next little verse
If you feel like it, sing along
And if you don't wanna sing along
Maybe you can clap your hands
The good book says
To love your enemy
But we don't comprehend
Tell me, how can you love your enemy
When you hate your fellow man
You see, love's got the
All-time greatest power
You see, love can brighten up
Your darkest hour
That's why I'm singing now
I hate hate, everybody sing it with me
I hate hate, let's all get together now
I hate hate, the good Lord above
Don't you know I love love
Oh, you got to have love
Got to have love
Love, love, got to have love
Love, love, got to have love...
