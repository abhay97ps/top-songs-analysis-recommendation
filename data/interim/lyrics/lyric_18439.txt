This morning is Monday
Where are you now
Teasing my memory
Teaching me how to lay low
When I don't want to
Your love is elusive
This I know now
It's making me crazy
Leaving me out in the open
When I don't want to
Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down
More than I've already been
Just like a wildfire
You're running all over town
As much as you burn me, baby
I should be ashes by now
The moment of pleasure
Just never do last
They're gone like a suitcase
Full of your past
Long gone and in a hurry
You're running all over town
As much as you burn me, baby
I should be ashes by now
Just like a wildfire
You're running all over town
As much as you burn me, baby
I should be ashes by now
Ooooo, ashes by now
Ooooo, ashes by now
As much as you burn me, baby
I should be ashes by now
