Ahh, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
When you're loving me
And I feel, I feel
I can feel what you're
Trying to do to me
But come on, come on, come on
Baby, you really got to me
Girl, you touch my mind
You sparkle and shine now, yeah
Ooh, and I feel it's all I can see
When I'm loving you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Sparkle and shine everytime
Lighting up the night time
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Loving in the sunshine
Lighting up the night time
Sparkle and shine
Yeah, you know, you know
What you do to my soul
Come on now
And I can't let go, no
You know I better hold on now
Whoa, whoa, whoa
