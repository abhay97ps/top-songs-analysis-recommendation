You didn't put me in your movie faggot!
That's where I should probably start
But why trip on a part in Bodied when I'm 'bout to leave body parts
Shotty spark, 12 gauge in ya face so I can shoot it cleaner
My reaction leave Dizaster over the land like Fukushima
I'm your inner demons manifested, the reason you shouldn't trust niggas
Soon as we spot you in the Jordan's; peel , cops lookin' for Us nigga
Since Traffic 3, I hated this damn ramblin'
History showed us Roc landed on the west and created the Grand Canyon
What I'm sayin' is, you can't write the way a purist write
You let Roc turn a natural disaster  into a tourist site 
You rap with authority in yo' voice, that's how I expected you son
This strap takes away that conviction, come get your record expunged
Fuck the weapons you brung
Pocket knife, why upset me?
It's out of L.A., short and to the point like Tyus Edney
He gon' say I ain't a legend, try and play me like I ain't top 5
Bitch I'll stuff an Avocado up yo' mama pussy and make you Watch Live
Fuckin' Aladdin remake
Niggas was mad Will Smith was all blue tinted
I seen where they was comin' from but I was more pissed they ain't have you in it
You went your whole career without havin' bars, that's the power of relevance
You been on two lists your whole life, mine and Counter Intelligence
But you from Lebanon, I can't call you an Afghan
But I do wanna put yo' fuckin' ass in a trash can
Oh you think you can fight now, ever since that lil' Math scan
Now you wanna exchange punches with a black man?
Okay, try and reach, I don't do the wrestlin' shit, I keep the iron sheek 
This wouldn't have worked out for you in San Diego like Ryan Leaf
You been worldwide wit' it, you been cookin' over shores
But I held it down on this west, you know what it took to open doors?
When I looked over my shoulder in New York I didn't see you cause you would've been too busy lookin' over yours
Bitch!
100 shots in front of yo' girl, show her what that MAC might do
It start spittin', then a bunch'll fill her  now she rap like you
I ain't even watch Bodied, we spray cats with them hollows
Maybe I'll watch Dizaster  movie The Day After Tomorrow
Them Grape cats that you follow, them niggas yo' associates
They should've told you appropriation isn't appropriate
Then you battled a Soviet, I peeped how you was rhymin' wit' him
But I make sure y'all all get it the same, welcome to Communism
Stop rushin'  ya punches, it get rocky for  you
I bleed lyrics, this nigga tryin' to be Jordan but my Creed different
We debated if that was a sucker punch with Math that night
But when you flip modes  I knew he was a buster  When Disaster Strikes
I seen you in ya Call Of Duty outfit, now you up here tryin' to rap wit' me
You admitted you were C.I.A., then you created Krack City
That makes me question the Grapes that be rappin' wit' him
Cause if you know Call Of Duty it was created by Aktive vision 
I smack this nigga until he stumbles in a backward position
I'll put fo' into my foe, leave no remainder, I'm not Math, I'm a mathematician
This was a bad decision, and you on the ground with this shit
This wack MC got another two rounds of this shit
You know what rhymes wit' Danny Myers?
...
Now why y'all think I left that question floatin' in the open air
Y'all need to be more aware
Cause Danny from a Parallel Universe
The only reason you heard silence over here is cause I answered it over there
Bar Frog!
And that's why, at first you don't like him
Cause he wants you to believe he's special
Unlike us his birth was a parallel universal alignment
The story of a kid who became an MC
Chasin' this deep rooted urge that's inside him
To one day get up and open the trash can
And in that trash can
He found the notepad that he currently writes in
You think you one of our best writers? Who the fuck told you that that's true?
You told another guy you'd fly over his house and leave a chem trail...what the fuck would that do?
You said this wit' a straight face
"I'm a heterosexual whale with the murders I orchestrate 
Man what the fuck?!
That shit trash!
Aw man, I can sense the tension in the air, if you sensitive go elsewhere
Cause this shit is intense, somebody 'bout to get killed in here
In a sense, you already in intensive care
But if I see you  with my sixth sense, then what's the consensus there?
I'll bust ya face open with a kitchen chair
I'll pull a big knife out, I'll stuff ya guts inside out like a Build-A-Bear
{Knife cut} Then I'll slit slide mouth, Greco's Pizza I came to hand a big slice out
Ya limb's tear, bloody silverware
Before we iron this out
They gon' have to send his body to Iron Man's house for his bitch to have his shit repaired
I ain't T-Rex you better watch ya mouth
Someone dies and you mention one of mine you puttin' ya own family on the line, now 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'
Danny, you a fuckin' mark, I dare you to start somethin'
Man, I wish you would pop, you ain't gon' see this pussy spark nothin' like A “push to start button”
Yeah, stop frontin'
You talk gang shit but you know I got mad soldiers
I keep it Crippin' in my circle
But don't let that go over ya head cause I could still have a Blood at your front door live Passover
I ain't ya fuckin' homie
I don't have homies, don't lean on me I'm a bad shoulder
Like Canibus
They say I got a bi-polar mentality disorder cause every day I wake up and see a new face starin' back at me in the mirror like the doctor from Hangover
Walk out, to doin' donuts in a black Cobra
The battle rap Gamboa
Rocky Balboa, put hands on ya
Wrap my hands around ya neck like a black boa
Then squeeze, till you're white in the face like Sam' Sosa
The landlord of this rap culture
Slash ya face with a Takoba that's a African sword only your ancestors would know of
And B Dot
I don't even need a can, fuck a can', I'm an axe thrower
I'll slash you so fast you'll catch a gash wound so bad shit'll look like I opened up ya back wit' a can opener
I came to fuckin' destroy you
Irritate and annoy you
And you ain't gotta throw ya hat after one of those stupid ass bars of yours
Cause if you get any closer I'm gonna throw that shit for you
The laser spread, that's Agent Red
I'll put him on the floor, I'ma make him beg
But I ain't gonna spray no lead
Cause you know I ain't a gangsta
I'm a serial killer, I'll rip the skin off his face instead and steal your face from you like The Grateful Dead
I'll twist his ankles, I'll break his legs
I'll put hands and feet on him like Mr. Potato Head
I don't play no games, and I don't say no names
I'll pull out a rainbow blade and scrape his egg
I made a pledge to take all you busters on by the razor's edge
I came to The Bay with a bayonet
To slay one of my favorite friends
Which is why, I hate the way this ends
He went out like a grade A soldier cause even though I sent him to the grave he still made his bed
Actin' like you replaced me bitch, I had to leave for them to give you my spot
What you think you the first dude to go outta state spittin'?
Yeah that shit you did in Tennessee was "lyrically hot"
In Memphis you was doin' the hippity hop
Out in NYC you butt kissin' and you chill wit' the ops
Contracted measles, now you back here and want me to give you a shot
I'm puttin' on a clinic, so I'm either tossin' you off of the ship or I'm leavin' you on it long enough for you to watch me sink it
So either way you gonna visit the doc
Yeah, you get paid $500 deposits
That's minimal qwap
He gets paid for those bars of his in compliments, the battle rap Carrot Top
You basically makin' a livin' off your props
You a washed up 40 year old, still out here beggin' for .50 cent  like Vivica Fox
The code word is "life up the stock"
I'll pick out a ball hair and use it to revive King of The Dot
And if ya bitch lookin' hot
I'll Justin Timberlake 'Dick In A Box', ya chick to a Parallel Universe come out the back end of her twat
And you ain't gon' do nothin' like when the Math shit popped off
You and the whole staff went instantly soft
You lost your shoe got trampled on and you still didn't box
That's cause ya hoe ass has no hands like a digital clock
This is the part where the finish him starts
Long sickle blade with elliptical arc
Shit look like a big ass question mark
I stick it in his chin like a fisherman hook, the edge is so sharp
One cut graze him will fuckin' fillet him and have Blood sprayin like Nickerson Garden
This shit isn't art, this an audition for me to pick you apart
Pick up an ice pick then stick it in you and twist it like I'm pickin' a lock
Then all you hear is "Finish him"
Then I'll kneel down and separate your ribs eight inches apart
Throw a Scorpion hook in the hole and pull out AngryFan's dick from your heart!
Hey I just saw John Wick 3
They had a contract on him, it was real in there
I'll pay one of y'all to kill this motherfucker, 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'
And you couldn't face me by yourself...you got all this gas over
Yo' bitch said she wanted two niggas to fuck her so I invited my nigga Pass over
Like I said, he couldn't face me by myself so he brought all his damn soldiers
I'll have a motherfucker shoot this fake Tony Montana in the back bitch, I am Sosa
That's three. That's three!
And then, fuck everything this fake just said
I'll shoot you and you won't be mad, he'll be Grateful Dead
That's four. That's four! This is too easy! This is too easy! This is too easy! I don't give a fuck nigga this is too easy
Fuck everything that this bitch was just talkin'
I never seen you there, bitch I grew up in Nickerson Garden
That's five! That's five! That's five! It's too easy nigga. It's too easy nigga!
I heard yo' bitch got fucked in yo' movie, she was gettin' straight pipe
But that's not surprising, cause art imitates life
You finna take flight, I'll plot ya death when you first wakin'
Dizaster hate he  gotta deal with somethin' earth shakin'
I remember seein' you at Lush One house, I was happy just meetin' you
I watched ya battles and seen how ya passion was seeping through
Then I made that Facebook post about Cassidy beating you
You said, "People be hatin'", but it was me you was actually speakin' to
Bitch! You always hated me, jealous I left most murdered
Cause I showed you the difference between a GOAT and a goat herder
But let's go further, you lost on the west, you was supposed to be guardin' this shit
This was 'round the same time me and Vicki lost guardianship
You traded your skills for stardom, this is what the fame brung? Now I'm takin' away your Guardian status like James Gunn
This a shame son, Shang Tsung
Midway through my secrets is when the rain come
And you rep the purple, wait, Purple Rain, purple reign, Can't leave prints , you'll be dead soon Midway through that Mortal Kombat scheme
I should've said, "boom" cause you talk Billy
You wish they called time like a motherfucker
{Danny points to his own head} Bitch, it's 30 pages of rhymes in this motherfucker!
Why should I fear skill? I'll grab scissors and Bachir will be murdered by sheers and I'll do it by sheer will
Y'all make me demolish him I was supposed to run through these lines in San Diego like Ladainian Tomlinson
I looked at my baby and promised him, he won't be a poser like you
He ain't supposed to like you
Even right now he ain't opposed to fight you, but I chose to snipe you
Load the rifle, Bar God with no disciples
Even as I hold the Bible my soul despise you
Nothing but death I owe the rivals
Get dragged by the back of a motorcycle when I approach behind you
Get close and knife you
No one likes you
Welcome to the inner workings of a colder psycho
Listen Vlade Divac, you ain't been consistent at the same rate
You one of them old legends still livin' off of namesake
Y'all remember that 007 game? That's why I air the Smith
Cause they gave me an Oddjob and I can't Bond with a terrorist
I wrote these rhymes in Arabic, how fair is it
That you gotta sit here and cherish it?
There isn't, anything in the teachings of the Prophet Mohammed that'll make these haters stop with the comments
I don't care if the gossip Islamic or you rock wit' Baphomet
I am not wit' the nonsense
I am what's been blocking your conscious
More guilty than the conscious of Pontius - Pilate
Jesus, I'm killin' him, give me one reason you feelin' him
Give me one squeeze and I'm peelin' him
Use the beam, what's the use of schemes when your reality's a lucid dream
I am not what you're used to seein'
Far beyond the capabilities of a human being
I am the threshold
I am why when you die and your flesh cold
But still walk cause you've always had your eye on the death code
I am Depeche Mode
Bare wit' me, they translate my rhymes through electronic signals that gotta ban wit' me
You could've been on URL gettin' Smacked on Banned wit' me
You can't stand wit' me
Bitch! And you on the ground wit' this shit
This wack MC got a whole 'nother round of this shit
Yikes!
They say, "Goodz vs Cass' was trash!"
And this here, is the real platinum seller
No gimmicks, just an accurate measure to see who has the better battling record
So before I continue weaving in and out of patterns like your grandmother's sweater
Allow me to pick your brain for a little like Hannibal Lecter
Bars!
You've been wantin' this battle forever
Oh he's a passionate yeller
Yellin' at his notepad while he's spellin' my name out in capital letters
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!
Screamin' AAAAAHHHHHHH!
Tearin' away pages from his pad, from far away his hands look like a mechanical shredder
AAAHHHH!
Bitch, you just a mutt, you standin' in front of a fuckin' vet'
You just a fuckin' old lost dog, a stray fuckin' dog that Organik adopted from the AHAT animal shelter
I'm an alpha dog here you just Alpha Dog here
I kept it real in this field you just out for alpha 
Plus your girl said I attract her on low, Monsanto with the flow you quickly gettin' cropped out the picture
I came to ya little fake realm to Jade Helm ya
MK Ultra, MJ 12 ya
Hellraiser, I raise Hell like Venezuela
Do you believe in the Mandela Effect?
I put you in the full Nelson, open up your cerebral cortex and dismember it
Blaow!
The next you see his footage on the timeline it won't be the same way you remember it
In my dimension, I'll use a felt tip pen like a belt fed weapon
I'll put a chopper to ya head like a special ed helmet
Arms extended, I'll bend dimensions like Janemba
Weld a sword like Zelda, got a professional record like Heltah Skeltah
Put you through a Boot Camp, I told you me and the team could help ya
Cause you got a large self esteem but smaller dreams than a Keebler Elf
If only you could see yourself
That's why anybody can book you Danny, you cheap as Delta
How can we see a king in you
When anybody can have a seat witchu?
You dealin' wit' the real life Griselda
You see I magically control the whole room when you battle me
Ain't nobody in my whole class is a match for me like Matilda
I held ya up high cause you was one of our members
But you stayed a side league act your whole life
All the main cards you didn't headline none of 'em ever
You've always been a sideshow
An undercard to the undercard, so yeah you might be gettin' some cheddar
But you forgot to build ya image and ya skills with business ain't gettin' much better
So when it all goes down, me, The Saurus, Illmac, Geechi, Nitty, Pass...we gon' be the ones they remember
You goin' down the west coast history like Fonzworth Bentley
Just another outcast that was known for living under his own little umbrella
You okay there lil' fella?
You a fake prophet, you ain't no GOAT, you puttin' up a facade
It's a western conference demigod
You in the royal presence of an immortal legend that's goin' against the local peasant in his own synagogue
Ain't nobody in the left hemisphere will say you won/was better
Did 100 million on the worldwide web without a single URL involved
I built Grind Time and King Of The Dot from the ground up
And when I left them they fell apart
I watched as Organik shot himself in the leg like Cheddar Bob
Then I built the Left Side Connection cause I was never selfish
I left you all with an academic hall you can excel in
You know, do it extra large and I did it all to help you
You just never helped yourself evolve
So I busted a U turn and came back for your rescue
Cause I knew if I don't you'd always be stuck in this dead end job
So now we at a fork in the road
Where our brains could've been matched even but instead you goin' against the odds
Of different variables and sets of problems
You never trained your little ass brain or your pen to solve its conflicts
You not armed for the art of war, darfour  you aren't ready for armeg-gedon
Drive through your ten bedroom apartment door in a bulldozer swingin' a wreckin' ball
There's Fentanyl in every bar, your death is calling
Make you drive yourself into a wall like a Tesla car
If I hold a sword right, then it's Fortnite, I'll leave him with an Epic SCAR
Let's see if he has the balls to swing on me when there's a giant metal pole between us like tether ball
I'm guillotine with the schemes I'm razor sharp
If I raise the bar your head'll fall
But I'm way too above you to even snuff you
I'm on top of the mountain lookin' down on him from hella far
That's why all I gotta do to win is clown on him like a Twisted Metal car
You put in all this work slavin' away and goin' extra hard
But we never give you the credit, it's like all you get to do is hold the debit card
I run the west bitch, you will never have my repertoire
Get sat down in a metal chair with an electric helmet on
Cause that's the only way you'll ever become the head in charge
You see red from the lead sparks
I put the piece to the side of his ear like a Ted Talk seminar
I bet you never forget this bar you fuckin' peasant, I'm a megastar
He's a panhandler rap battler that gotta beg to get on cards
You a homeless gambit, go fuck yourself in a King Of The Dot rental car
Your whole rappin' process, is catastrophic
You go on these long winded tangents and frantically try to gather topics
Blastin' bars all over the map like an Israeli soldier on foreign soil aiming at random targets
He tryin' to cook up a recipe for Dizaster
But by the time the shit hits the pen and pad...looks like a scrambled omelette
This shit is like a clash between a batch of your average stagnant content
And a masterpiece that was hand weaved by  a classic artist
Instead of beggin' and payin' for match ups up and down the battle gauntlet
This is real game you should've soaked, you from the old school
And we gave you all the pro tools  so you don't got a Reason to act like you don't have no Logic
You can't even cross connect your thoughts and actions
If you talked how you rap people would assume you were half retarded
Just an over dramatic hyperactive bar smith
I'm doin' you the favor in the match up so whatchu call this?
You tryin' to hitch hike a ride on Aladdin's carpet
You just a bitch lookin' for a hand out like Jasmine
Danny stop it, you damn near cryin' cause your Summer Madness battle didn't happen in August
And now ain't gettin' Santa Claus bitch
I'm not talkin' 'bout wrappin' presents, I'm talkin' bags and boxes, jabs and crosses
I'll leave your shit permanently leakin' like a public bathroom faucet
Have Avacodo give you a panoramic view of you gettin' your ass handed to you on a brand new Panasonic
And as far as you payin' for your battles, I feel like your Instagram pics do
Cause I don't really have no comments
You ain't got no followers, no believers
You've always- you notice it in his whole demeanor
You've always been an over achiever
You remind me of the portrait of Mona Lisa cause  you ain't shit but a washed up over rated, mediocre diva
Listen, an album with no features
A passport with no visa
A Backwood to a Cohiba
A disaster like Hiroshima with no FEMA
You've been battle raps little hoe since Moesha
You get paid crumbs to perform and got no shows of your own either
And King Of The Dot and URL doin' good on their own so they don't need ya
You just a sad little turtle sitting alone at home eating a cold pizza
Time faggot!
Listen Diz', these type of skills can only come from the gift of kids
And you gotta feed 'em
And it makes me reflect on my past life in the Colosseum
You knew this day was coming, other rappers shown you some pity
Even when I was underground you knew this cat'll comb  through the city
Me and Nitty, proved back to back punching was the answer
But you hate that style of writing, Diz sees  that as a cancer
But you stole Em's style, along with other facets of character
How are you a Dizaster when I was born black in America
Young brothers trapped in the area
Pushed through a machine and forced to come out a soldier like Captain America
My pen dirty
Only one of us can say "nigga" without it bein' cringe worthy
You a fuckin' weirdo, I question some of ya moves and such
The east hates us, so when you lose to them you lose for us
I don't know who to trust to come through the clutch when my crew discuss
We don't need them, what the fuck can Mook and Lux do for us?!
I have been a beast, this ain't the time for you to be Middle East
Riddle me, why the fuck should I be scared now?
Mentally I try to tear down durin' the stare down
Y'all niggas can elevate, I'd rather take the stairs down
A king who wears crowns ain't wit' his people, I'm aware now
I flare rounds, this bitch gon' make me palm a Glock
I'm wildin' but this could end different if I'm nonchalant
A young man was bullied by Terry and his crew
They was known for carryin' them triggers
His granny told him to keep the faith it'll be less scary in a minute
Do you believe in a Parallel Universe?
They killed him at Sunday service, his family stressed buried his figure
He died in front of the Christian church pressed by Terry and  them niggas
I battled at your costume party and your Ether event
We supposed to be homies but I ain't get paid for either event
Now I ain't tryin' to knock our unity, but if we supposed to be homies why the fuck would you pay me in opportunity
You use people!
This is what the whole fam' knew
Cause Dizaster beat me here in this Pit? No can do 
Both hands true, aim like I came from the best military
Thinkin' you comin' back after I bury this cat like Pet Cemetery
I hope your next flight is booked on a 737 Max
And the sensor tells it to nosedive
I hope his whole family is on that flight and everyone he knows dies
Unborn babies, ripped from they mother's bellies, blood and guts in the fuselage
You wake up, everybody is dead but you alive
'I Will Survive' plays from an iPod while you waitin' on a rescue team
I hope you get PTSD from all the fuckin' death you've seen
I hope your drier eats every match to your socks
I hope your next movie starts off with you gettin' socked
I hope you go home and all ya homies hog tied
I hope John Wick hears that you happy that his dog died
He said, "Fuck King Of The Dot. I'm never comin' back!"
Bodied sold four tickets
He called Organik like, "I ain't mean that shit. I got some more lyrics."
You don't need a gas station and none of those promotionals
How ironic the term "oil"  gets him emotional
I'm smokin' you, he like to act black when he performs shows
The day he start gettin' his hair twisted is when this corn rose 
You from the 818, he don't even be in L.A
That's all that pretty shit, we see when we leavin' L.A
Suicidal on Total Slaughter talkin' 'bout freein' himself
You impersonate all of us cause you ain't comfortable bein' yourself
I'm the GOAT bitch, and you can get the fuck out bitch
I brought lyrics back to The Bay on some Yukmouth shit
And even though he already on the ground with the shit
Thank the Lord he ain't got another round of this shit
Now first of all, you act like you don't have homies witchu too
Yeah I got homies too, whatchu talkin' about?
Except the ones that are behind you don't look the same after fuckin' Daylyt marked him out
Yo check this out
Yo listen to this LSC shit, we made you a part of the family tree and we seeded you
Cause you from soil so bein' loyal
I felt like I needed too
But you never developed into this fully grown tree
Your roots covered in weeds
With the bottom tier MC's
Still picking all of your leaves from you
And all that leaves for you, is me raking up what you leave when the season's through
He's 40 but now poppin', he's a late bloomer
It all stems from greed
Every single thing you do is for you
Danny you a GMO tree  cause every mission you embark on gives US nothin' but seedless fruits
I extended you an olive branch but you said you didn't need me to
Couldn't even keep your feet planted and believe me, you ain't never been believable
That's why we got Geechi to keep the balance and make it even between you two
We even gave you a boost of self esteem that you needed
Yeah but you wanted to be the leader which is leaving you down this down this dark path
And now we just watch back as your ego slowly eats at you
Could you even handle a real defeat?
Like really
Have we ever seen you fall so bad you lost half the people that once believed in you?
Only to make a comeback and drag those very same people underneath your shoes
The irony, cause right now, it's exactly what you see me do
But you didn't ! even though you had more of a reason to
When we started the LSC movement, to challenge them as a team unit
Versus the eastern crew
But couldn't keep you on the same page cause every other week or two
Danny had a battle in like a week or two
Talkin' 'bout me supporting him
How the fuck am I gonna support you
When you was on some Tekken 7 shit and I always had to deal with your secret moves
I talk to Beasley, you talk to Beasley too
That's when we knew
You was self centered you only center yourself in the scenic view and it's feeding you
And for y'all that are payin' attention, that's real pen game, not the type of shit he do
My definition of good writing is different from what it means to you
For you? It's what the punchline means
For me it's actually being meaningful
(Listen to this
You the GOAT? Oh you got more history than me?)
Well let's give y'all a battle rap west coast lesson
Let's take this back to how it all started from the beginning
It was like '99 you was probably one of the only ones out here spittin'
Right? That was two years after the Rap Olympics in '97 that Eminem was in
But by then it was already finished
In the I.E. the '99 they had the foundation
And cats from L.A. every other day would go up there and then kill it
Every other night, cats like Otherwize would go through a dozen guys
But you was nowhere in attendance
Scribble Jam was a year prior to that but somehow you also wasn't in it
WRC's two years in a row, he never entered
The Pit, the hub of our city, you just...didn't visit
The Basement in the 818, even that you wasn't with it
Grind Time came and went and you still ain't represented
So all we got left from you is your Fight Klub footage
Which to me is like OJ Simpson cause it's still up in the air whether you ever did it
But in his defense, let's analyse that for a second, right?
You said out ya own mouth, you moved out to New York in 2000 to battle rap for a living
So if you wasn't shit over here, and never became shit over there, then where the fuck was you winnin'?
See like, don't you get it?
Even if you was on Fight Klub that don't make no difference
You want us to crown you as California's own legends
When all the work you put in was benefiting outta state folks and propelling the east coast engine
And you still the same kid today, who you kidding?
Fuck you mean South Central? Bitch
We was at Project Blowed all the time battlin' when we was only children
I guess that wasn't y'all lane
Like the Pentagon plane he can't even provide evidence that he was ever in the buildin'
You wanna talk about my shit?
I took this shit from the Mud  to the mainstream, way past the limits
What you lookin' at here is a plastic gimmick
Another surrogate movie I embody everything he isn't
You can check my files, real work you can verify with analytics
People tryin' to harp on my fuckin' losses but after 103 battles I still have the highest body bag percentage
And through the ups and downs I still got more fans than critics
If you been through half this shit your bitch ass wouldn't last a minute
I was down on my last leg until I got back in it
Liftin' myself back up like Popeye and popped open a can of spinach
I know you was expectin' a haymaker, that's why Dan don't get it
Yeah he likes haymakers and punchlines but forgot to brand his image
Yeah you got the battlin' spirit
But what good is a haymaker punchline if it don't come with a fuckin' personality with it
And that's the real reality check for me
Cause your whole style built like the most random accessory
You come with a battery in your back and personality sold separately
How much of a fuckin' clout chasin' cat can you be?
You want me to respect all of your west accomplishments when your best west accomplishment was standin' here battlin' me
Yeah he's part of our gathering but you're the weakest branch on our family tree
You're six years older than me and call me your O.G
You can't tell me shit I do not know besides the fact that you do not know me
But since you into science, I'ma use the rest of this round with science to break you down slowly
Y'all ready?
This is gonna be slow so y'all get it
Now scientists ponder, does the universe exist if no one is there to bare witness to its appearance?
They say technically the universe is not there if there's no one around to perceive it
Now this is what I mean is
You said you bodied Drag-On from Ruff Ryders, let's say I actually believe it
Let's say  you didn't dream it
The question is, did you really body Drag-On if there's no one else on Earth that can confirm that they seen it?
They say, "you gotta see it to believe it."
And that's not just a saying it comes from a deeper meaning, that's a scientific thesis
Deeply rooted in one of the universes deepest secrets
Cause you said you won those battles, how do we know it's a fact?
Since there's a 50/50% chance it's not, the outcome of that reality is now split both into halves
Now for something in this universe to be definite
Two particles would have to go from a point of super position to a point of collapse
That's when the moment becomes definite
If nobody knows it's happening, they don't know how to act
Let's take a cat
A little kitten, put it in a box and we close it
Now whether you leave the box closed or  you open it back
Listen to this hold on
You take a kitten, you put it in a box but a probability of it dying at a 50/50% chance
Now, whether you leave the box  closed or you open it back
You decide whether it's dead or alive by merely the observational act
Even if you know it's in there dead, if you don't see it with both your eyes then technically it never died and that's Schrodinger's Cat
Now Danny you are the observer
Splitting the universe into two parallel straight lines
Forming a reality where your opponents were both dead and alive at the same time
What I'm saying is, in laymen terms for you to understand it
If the impact of your battles didn't cause a Butterfly Effect for a chain reaction, in a way, it didn't happen
And I know science can't give me a straight answer
I'm not about to dig my grandfather outta the grave to ask him
The point is, in this battle universe, if we can't look up your work online in a Youtube search
Then I'ma have to revert how they came up with this conclusion first
Only one solution works
That all these battles Danny talkin' 'bout happened in his Parallel Universe
So do I believe in a Parallel Universe?
I do
I believe the Parallel Universe is a lower vibrational field you spent most of your career confined to
I believe in a multiverse, billions of different realities we might choose
And the one we're living in right now is the only one we survive through
Now in this universe I just schooled you like my fucking son
Before I'm fucking done, I'ma give you preview of what's happening in the other one
You don't wanna squab Danny, your little fuckin' body brittle, you small and little
You ain't John Gotti is you? You've seen what a battle with Gotti gets you
Battle wit' me? You gonna be like Pamela Lee cause you gon' lose half ya shit soon as the Tommy hit you
I'll fuckin' shotty clip you
I'll put a shotgun to ya ugly ass face and I'll pocket check you
You from South Central?
Ah nah, you never claimed a set or popped the pistol
It's obvious you aren't official, you artificial
Dawg not marketable, stop actin' like you got a problem wit' me cause I don't got a problem witchu
But if you want the issue, then it's Reservoir Dogs, I'm tearin' off cartilage tissue
Which means I ain't just gassin' on you, I'm dumpin' the whole gas can on you
Dawg I hit you wit' an atomic missile
In the bush ready to pop out like Bonnie's nipple
I'll have you walkin' around with war shrapnel lodged into you
Vice grip around ya neck, I will Homer/Bart Simpson you
Drop kick you
It's a fact, if you snap I'll  twist ya top off, I'll soda pop grip you
You getting dog walked, this is a Pitbull versus a freckle faced Dalmatian, I will on the spot rip you
Shread you apart, spread your head and your little ass neck apart
Like a small Shih Tzu
Get lockjaw when the cross hit you
Ill barbeque , your body Auschwitz you, then carve into your carcass with a sharp Ginzu
Get blew  on contact I'll Hopsin you
Hostage you
Hospitalize and hospice you
Better check your wife before I Jefferson Price/Caustic you
A. Ward? I don't have no punchlines for him cause I'm already disgusted enough that I'm on the same card witchu
Organik begged me to not hit you
I ain't gonna ruin another King Of The Dot venue
But disrespect, I will not sit through
I told you if you press the wrong buttons then the animals come out
I will Dr. Robotnik you
I will Daniel-san chop stick you
I will E Honda ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha hit you
What the fuck is wrong witchu?
This is my ship, I'll make you walk the plank then I'll mop the deck witchu
I'm Johnny Depp to you
Which means I got a pair of brass knuckles from The Pirates Of The Caribbean, got a metal hook for you
A fuckin' mythological kraken, an octopus
All you gon' see is these big ole' arms swings through
Which means I'ma catch a body as soon as drop this ink on you
Body stinkin' and the body leakin'
Part of me gonna miss him too
And when the ink dry, the film done
I guess it's true what they say, you lose some and you win some
You was the shit in your Parallel Universe but you was never shit in this one
Bitch
