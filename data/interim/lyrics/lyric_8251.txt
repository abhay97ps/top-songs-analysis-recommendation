All right!
I couldn't stop moving when it first took hold
It was a warm spring night at the old town hall
There was a group called The Jokers, they were layin' it down
'Cha know I'm never gonna lose that funky sound
Rock and roll, hoochie koo 
Lordy mama, light my fuse 
Rock and roll, hoochie koo 
Truck on out and spread the news
The skeeters started buzzin' 'bout this time a year
I'm going 'round back, said she'd meet me there
We were rollin' in the grass that grows behind the barn
When my ears started ringin' like a fire alarm
Rock and roll, hoochie koo 
Lordy mama, light my fuse 
Rock and roll, hoochie koo 
Truck on out and spread the news
Yeah, did somebody say keep on rockin'?
Ow!
That's right
Woo!
I hope you all know what I'm talkin' about
The way they wiggle that thing really knocks me out
I'm gettin' high all the time, hope you all are too
C'mon little closer, gonna do it to you
Rock and roll, hoochie koo 
Lordy mama, light my fuse 
Rock and roll, hoochie koo 
Truck on out and spread the news
Woo!
Rock and roll, hoochie koo 
Lordy mama, light my fuse 
Rock and roll, hoochie koo 
Truck on out and spread the news, yeah 
That I'm tired of payin' dues 
I done said goodbye to all my blues 
Lordy mama, light my fuse
Ow!
