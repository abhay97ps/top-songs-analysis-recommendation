Any of your dreams were pleasures yesterday
Try to catch your dreams before they fade away
Like the morning sun will burn away the dew
Your dreams will fade, and so will you
When you give it all there's nothing left to give
When you live it all there's nothing left to live
Movin' in and out like faces in a game
He'll never lose, you'll never win
Chorus
And now's he's through with you
And there's nothin' left for you to do
But turn away. To yesterday
There's nowhere that you can hide
And no matter how you try
You're on your own. You're all alone
Repeat
Movin' in and out like faces in a game
He'll never lose , you'll never win 
And now's he's through with you
And there's nothin' left for you to do
But turn away . To yesterday
There's nowhere that you can hide
And no matter how you try
You're on your own. You're all alone
