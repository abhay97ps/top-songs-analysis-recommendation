Girl, I know this might seem strange
But let me know if I'm out of order for stepping to you this way
See, I've been watching you for a while
And I just gotta let you know that I'm really feeling your style
'Cause I have to know your name
And leave you with my number, and I hope that you would call me someday
If you want you, can give me yours too
And if you don't, well, I ain't mad at you, we can still be cool, 'cause
I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name and maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill
Damn, I'm surprised that you called
'Cause the way you walked away, I thought I wasn't gon' see you no more
Since you didn't wanna give me your math
I thought that you were iggin' me, and wasn't diggin' me
But, anyway, what you doing tonight?
I'll probably be with my peeps, if it's cool with you, maybe we'll swing by
And you can just chill , or you can just chill with me
Long as you're comfortable and you feel secure when you're with me, 'cause
I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name and maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill
Oh, oh, baby, yeah
Maybe we can
Go and see a movie, girl
Or maybe we can hangout, girl
Whatever you wanna do
Just let me know, it's up to you
I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can’t stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name and maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill
I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name and maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill
I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can’t stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name and maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill
