From a phone booth in Vegas
Jessie calls at five a.m
To tell me how she's tired
Of all of them
She says
"Baby, I've been thinking
'Bout a trailer by the sea
We could go to Mexico
You, the cat and me
We'll drink tequila
And look for seashells
Now doesn't that sound sweet"
Oh Jessie, you always do this
Every time I get back on my feet
Jessie, paint your pictures
About how it's gonna be
By now I should know better
Your dreams are never free
But tell me all about our little trailer by the sea
Oh Jessie
You can always sell
Any dream to me
Oh Jessie
You can always sell
Any dream to me
She asked me how the cat's been
I say, "Moses, he's just fine"
But he used to think about you
All the time
We finally took your pictures
Down off the wall
Jessie
How do you always seem to know just when to call?
She says, "Get your stuff together
Bring Mose and drive real fast"
And I listened to her promise
"I swear to God, this time it's gonna last"
Jessie, paint your pictures
About how it's gonna be
By now I should know better
Your dreams are never free
But tell me all about our little
Trailer by the sea
Jessie
You can always sell
Any dream to me
Oh Jessie
You can always sell
Any dream to me
Jessie
You can always sell
Any dream to me
I'll love you in the sunshine
Lay you down in the warm, white sand
And who knows, maybe this time
Things will turn out just the way you planned
Jessie, paint your pictures
About how it's gonna be
By now I should know better
Your dreams are never free
But tell me all about our little trailer by the sea
Oh Jessie
You can always sell
Any dream to me
Oh Jessie
You can always sell
Any dream to me
