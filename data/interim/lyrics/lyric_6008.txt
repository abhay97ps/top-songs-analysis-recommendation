Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
No, nobody else but me hey hey hey
Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Now listen! I don't want to bother you but I'm in distress
There's danger of me loosing all of my happiness
For I love a girl who doesn't know I exist
Ah and this you can fix so...
Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
No, nobody else but me hey hey hey
Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Now Cupid if your arrow makes her love strong for me
I swear I'm gonna love her until eternity
I know that tween the both of us her heart we can steal
Cupid help me if you will so...
Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
No, nobody else but me hey hey hey
Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me
