When I'm hurt then I come on strong
I wanna break down
But I just keep it in
Being too strong is the weakness, girl
'Cause when you fight the world
You know who's gonna win
And you say I won't look you in the eye
It's like talking to the wall
But a wall can crumble down
Yeah, there's something that's deep inside
That's gotta be tough
Whenever you're around
And I've got this foolish pride
And pride goes before a fall
Yeah, I've got this foolish pride
Foolish pride
Fool, fool, foolish, foolish pride
You make me feel like the livin' end
But the end came quick
And made me wanna die
So I played like I didn't care
I didn't mess my hair
Believe me, I don't know why
But I've got this foolish pride
And pride goes before a fall
But I've got this foolish pride
Foolish pride
Fool, fool foolish, foolish pride
If I wanted I could have fooled 'em all
That's great 'til tomorrow when I'm all alone
You know the truth comes out in the end
When the fools start falling then they need their friends
Fool, foolish, foolish pride
Fool, foolish pride
Fool, foolish, foolish pride
Fool, foolish pride
Fool, foolish, foolish pride
Fool, foolish pride
