You can breathe in the music this city makes
Move by the rhythm the gypsies play
Deep inside, it comes alive
There is a whisper that feeds your soul
Words so beautiful, like a Spanish rose
'Til you're hypnotized
That's when you've arrived
You gotta strut like you mean it
Free your mind
It's not enough just to dream it
C'mon, c'mon, get up
When you feel it, it's your chance to shine
Strut like you mean it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon 
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Poundin' the pavement
Kickin' through the streets
To wander, like Picasso in the Barcelona heat
Passion is the fashion, and life is poetry
Welcome to another world where every heart can beat, oh
Get a different tempo
There's never a wrong one 
Building to a crescendo
You know the journey's just begun
You gotta strut like you mean it
Free your mind
It's not enough just to dream it
C'mon, c'mon, get up
When you feel it, it's your chance to shine
Strut like you mean it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon 
Oh-oh-oh
Oh
Hey, feel the flow 
When you just can't move no more 
The city wants to show  you something
, you something
A heart unfolds 
That you would never know 
Barcelona soul 
So something 
Something good is coming 
Is coming, yeah
Everybody knows that something good is coming on
You gotta strut like you mean it
Free your mind
It's not enough just to dream it
C'mon, c'mon, get up
When you feel it, it's your chance to shine
Strut like you mean it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
