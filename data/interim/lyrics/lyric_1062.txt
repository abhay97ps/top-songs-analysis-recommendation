THAT'S WHY 
Jackie Wilson
The way you make me feel like I belong
The way you make me right when I am wrong
The way you sacrifice just for me
Just how lucky can a poor man be?
That is why...
That is why...
Don't you know, baby...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want the world to know
The way you rub my back when I'm in pain
The way you soothe me so I won't complain
And when you kiss me with your ruby red lips
It thrills me so, I turn a back-over flip
That is why...
Don't you know, baby...
That is why...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want the world to know
If Shakespeare thought that Juliet
Really loved Romeo from the time they met
He would blow his top if he could see
Just how you've been lovin' me
The way you rub my back when I'm in pain
The way you soothe me so I won't complain
And when you kiss me with your ruby red lips
It thrills me so, I turn a back-over flip
That is why...
That is why...
C'mon now, baby...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want to take it easy, baby...
Take it easy, honey...
Don't you know now...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want the... one more time, now...
C'mon, c'mon, baby...
