Why are you leaving me now, boy?
We were not just lovers
We were not just friends, boy
The time we shared was not a simple love affair, no
We learned about each other
That you're so afraid of love, boy
There is no one that could ever love me better, no
Time and time again
I thought you were my friend
You say you gotta go
And I want you to know
If you leave me now, boy
I'll close my eyes and I'll just lay down and cry
Why would you leave me now, boy
After all the things that we've been through?
You say you're leavin' me now, boy
And when you're gone, what am I supposed to do?
And if you wanna come back to me
I think you should know that I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you
No more changes for my life
I pray to God that you'll come back to me
When we're together, there's nothing better than loving you
I wanna know why you're leaving, boy
The love we had was an open door
What happened to the dreams we shared together? No
Time and time again
I thought you were my friend
You say you gotta go
And I want you to know
Why are you leaving me now, boy
After all the things that we've been through?
You know, I still love you
Time and time again
I thought you were my friend
You say you gotta go
And I want you to know
If you leave me now, boy
I'll close my eyes and I'll just lay down and cry
Why would you leave me now, boy
After all the things that we've been through?
You say you're leavin' me now, boy
And when you're gone, what am I supposed to do?
And if you wanna come back to me
I think you should know that I'll be loving you
If you leave me now, boy
I'll close my eyes and I'll just lay down and cry
Why would you leave me now, boy
After all the things that we've been through?
You say you're leavin' me now, boy
And when you're gone, what am I supposed to do?
And if you wanna come back to me
I think you should know that I'll be loving you
If you leave me now, boy
I'll close my eyes and I'll just lay down and cry
Why would you leave me now, boy
After all the things that we've been through?
You say you're leavin' me now, boy
And when you're gone, what am I supposed to do?
And if you wanna come back to me
I think you should know that I'll be loving you
