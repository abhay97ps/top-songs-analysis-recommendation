Straight off the rip, you know I don't wait for the drop 
I go out to eat with my kids and my mama, you know I ain't datin' no thot 
Believe what you see, nigga
I can't name a rapper that's out here and breathin' that's fuckin' with me, nigga 
I'm takin' they hoes, Forces, Adidas pants and a tee, nigga 
They like how? That don't even match
Okay, hold on, take my phone, baby
Let's go
I'm just a lil' nigga from Charlotte, the biggest new artist 
They wanna see me up the road, but my lawyer a fool with dismissin' the charges 
You know BDB ENT, we gon' pull up Infinitis, Challengers, Chargers 
And no, we don't gotta get money with you, bitch, we gon' get money regardless 
I'ma let you do all of the talkin'
Don't get me started, you know I'ma stop it 
And I don't got a cent for a ho
She bringin' up money, I'm changin' the topic 
She need to be talkin' 'bout suckin' some dick
I nut in her mouth and she gargle 
If she spit out that rich nigga shit without swallowin', me and her havin' some problems 
We havin' revolvers strictly for murder and plenty of pistols and choppers 
Ayy, when you gon' stop?
Whenever the fat lady sing, I don't listen to opera 
You know how I give it up
Fuck around, fucked up my hand, beat a nigga up
Pull off on a nigga like vroom
He don't got a car, he still catchin' the city bus 
His baby mama unemployed
So she in the club with her ass and her titties out 
And we done robbed so many plugs
You better check and go ask what my city 'bout
Had to slide the nigga bitch a dub
Wanted to fuck me but I only hit her mouth 
Take the palm of my hand, slap me a nigga
Got somethin' to say, make 'em spit it out
You knowin' 'bout Baby
All the shit that nigga rappin' 'bout, that nigga really 'bout
And no, I ain't takin' advice from a nigga
I'm cool on that, I got it figured out
These niggas be cryin' 'bout petty shit
I can't relate because I took a bigger loss
And these niggas know I been a boss
Ever since Rick Ross was the biggest boss 
Got diamonds all over my teeth
I been eatin' chicken, I need me some dental floss
Hold my watch in the air
It's no longer hot, you can go turn the condition off
I'm hittin' this ho on the low
She fuck with me hard, she say that her nigga soft 
Why you talkin' so low?
'Cause if a nigga find out and he try me, I'm knockin' a nigga off
I'm ridin' past 12, flyin' through fast as hell, flickin' a nigga off 
I'm revin' the gas, burnin' out on niggas' ass, I'm showin' my engine off 
Hahaha
And that's just how the fuck I get down, man, you know I just be playin' sometimes
Like right now, like, I'm just fuckin' 'round, you know
Me and kid, you know, we up in the penthouse, you know, kickin' shit
And, uh, I'm still the best rapper
Straight off the rip, you know I don't wait for the drop 
I go out to eat with my kids and my mama, you know I ain't datin' no thot 
Believe what you see, nigga
I can't name a rapper that's out here and breathin' that's fuckin' with me, nigga
