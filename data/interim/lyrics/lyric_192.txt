I know that someday you'll want me to want you
When I'm in love with somebody else
You expect me to be true, and keep on loving you
Tho' I'm feeling blue - you think that I know how to forget about you
Until someday you'll want me to want you
When I'm strong for somebody new
Tho' you don't want me now, I'll get along somehow
And then I won't want you
I know that someday you'll want me to want you
When I'm strong for somebody new
And tho' you don't want me now, I'll get along somehow
And then I won't want you
And although you don't want me now, I'll get along somehow
And then I won't want you
And although you don't want me now, I'm gonna get along somehow
And then I won't want you
I won't want you
And then I won't want you
