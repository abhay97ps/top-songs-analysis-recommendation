I, I went off to the right
Without saying good, goodbye
Where does it go from here?
Is it down to the lake, I fear?
Ah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah
Ah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah
Ring  ring  ring  ring 
La-la love plus one
Ring  ring  ring  ring 
When I call love
Give love some soul
If I may be quite so bold
Where does it go from here?
Is it down to the lake I fear?
Ah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah
Ah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah
Ring  ring  ring  ring 
La-la love plus one
Ring  ring  ring  ring 
La-la love plus one
Ring and I ring and I ring and I ring and I
La-la love plus one
Ring and I ring and I ring and I ring and I
When I call love
Love plus one
Love plus one
Love plus one
Love plus one
