In the garden of Eden
A long time ago
There was a story
I'm sure you all know
I'm sure you remember
And I know you believe
The story of Adam and Eve
In the garden of eden
Where life began
Yes the very beginning
Of woman and man
I'm sure you remember
And I know you believe
The story of Adam and Eve
There within the garden
Was they both fell in love
Sheltered by the guiding hand
Of the One above
Life was filled with happiness
Until one day arose
A very great temptation
Well you know how it goes..
In the garden of Eden
A long time ago
There was a story
I'm sure you all know
I'm sure you remember
I'm sure you believe
The story of Adam and Eve
In the garden of Eden
A long time ago
Ohh such a story
I'm sure you all know
I'm sure you remember
I know you believe, yes you believe
The story..
Of Adam..
And Eve
