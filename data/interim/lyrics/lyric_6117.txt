You got me feeling crazy
You're always on my mind
And I get to feeling lately
If I never knew your name
I'd love you all the same
But I have you to myself
Wanting nothing else
Knowing that you're mine
Good time, bad time
All the time
Hands reaching cross a room
If I never knew your name
I'd love you all the same
But I have you to myself
Wanting nothing else
Knowing that you're mine
And I know somewhere
Inside my mind
Have you to myself
Wanting nothing else
Knowing that you're mine
