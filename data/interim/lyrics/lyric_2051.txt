When I was just a little baby I didn't have many toys
But my mama used to say: "Son, you've more than other boys
Now you may not be good looking, and you may not be too rich
But you'll never ever be alone, 'cause you've got lucky lips!"
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips so true!
I don't need a four-leaf clover, rabbit's foot or a good look charm
With lucky lips you'll always have a baby in your arms!
Now I never get heartbroken, no, I never get the blues
And if I play that game of love, I know I just can't lose
When they spin that wheel of fortune, all I do is akiss my chips
And I know I'm 'bout to win, yeah, 'cause I've got lucky lips!
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips so true!
I don't need a four-leaf clover, rabbit's foot or a good look charm
With lucky lips you'll always have a baby in your arms!
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips so true!
I don't need a four-leaf clover, rabbit's foot or a good look charm
With lucky lips you'll always have a baby in your arms!
