All she wants is, all she wants is, all she wants is
All she wants is, all she wants is, all she wants is
Hey spend your money on the corner now
Ya know you've gotta save some
For the shoeshine boy
You've been pulling them by the hand inside
Oh, collecting all your toys
If you need a lead to heaven now
Just stick around
You're gonna be there
What do you care?
What do you dare?
What does your Heart say now?
All she wants is, all she wants is, all she wants is
All she wants is, all she wants is, all she wants is
All she wants is, all she wants is, all she wants is
Divine intervention
Couldn't keep the word from leaking out 
With your pleasure in suspension
Not to mention what you hang it around
If you need a lead to heaven again
A place to share in every position
What do you care?
What do you dare?
What does your heart say now?
All she wants is, all she wants is, all she wants is
All she wants is, all she wants is, all she wants is
More!
More!
More!
Gets more!
Now!
Gets more !
All she wants is, all she wants is, all she wants is 
All she wants is, all she wants is, all she wants is 
All she wants is, all she wants is,  all she wants is
All she wants is, all she wants is, all she wants is!
All she wants is, all she wants is, all she wants is 
All she wants is, all she wants is, all she wants is
All she wants is, all she wants is, all she wants is!
