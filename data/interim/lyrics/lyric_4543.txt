You only live twice
Or so it seems
One life for yourself
And one for your dreams
You drift through the years
And life seems tame
'Til one dream appears
And Love is its name
And love is a stranger
Who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger
Or the stranger is gone
This dream is for you
So pay the price
Make one dream come true
You only live twice
And love is a stranger
Who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger
Or the stranger is gone
This dream is for you
So pay the price
Make one dream come true
You only live twice
