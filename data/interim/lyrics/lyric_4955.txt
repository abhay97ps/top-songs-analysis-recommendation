FZ: That's right, you heard right, the Secret Word for tonight is Mud Shark! And of course with the Mud Shark Secret Word is the Mud Shark Arpeggio . . . a marvellous little arpeggio, and now the mating call of the adult male Mud Shark
Mud Sh-sh-shark
FZ: THE MUD SHARK DANCING LESSON!
Mud Sh-sh-shark
Mark: Wait a minute . . . we're gonna do a little dancing . . . a little dancing thing called the Mud Shark . . . Now, this dance started up in Seattle
Howard: Yes
Mark: The story
FZ: Lemme tell you the story 'bout the Mud Shark
Mud Sh-sh-shark
FZ: Bring the band on down behind me, boys
Howard: Say! Good God! Ain't it funky! Say!
FZ: The origins of the Mud Shark are as follows
Mud Sh-sh-shark
FZ: There's a motel in Seattle, Washington, called the Edgewater Inn . . . The Edgewater Inn is built out on a pier . . . so that means that when you look out your window you don't see any dirt, it's . . . got a bay or something out in your backyard
Mud Sh-sh-shark
FZ: And to make it even more interesting, in the lobby of the aforementioned motel there's a bait and tackle shop where the residents can go down and, whenever they want to, rent a fishing pole and some preserved minnows and schlep back up to their rooms, open the window, stick their little pole outside and within a few minutes actually catch a fish of some sort that they can bring into their motel room and do whatever they want with it, you know what I mean?
Mud Sh-sh-shark
FZ: Now in this bay there's quite a variety of . . . fish!
Mud Sh-sh-shark
FZ: Not only do they have mud sharks up there, they got little octopusses that you can catch
Fish!
Mud Sh-sh-shark
FZ: And all of these denizens of the deep can come in real handy
Mud Sh-sh-shark
FZ: Let's say you were a travelling Rock and Roll band called The Vanilla Fudge . . . let's say one night you checked into the Edgewater Inn with an 8mm movie camera
Mud Sh-sh-shark
FZ: Enough money to rent a pole, and just to make it more interesting
Mud Sh-sh-shark
FZ: A succulent young lady!
Howard: Nooo!
FZ: With a taste for the bizarre
Mud Sh-sh-shark
FZ: My mind drifts back . . . to a meeting, a chance meeting in the Chicago O'Hare Airport
Mud Sh-sh-shark
FZ: Where the members of The Vanilla Fudge told Don Preston about a home movie they made at the Edgewater Inn . . . with a mud shark!
Mud Sh-sh-shark
FZ: And I'm gonna tell you, this dance, the Mud Shark, is sweeping the ocean!
