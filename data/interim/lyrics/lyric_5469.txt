Please release me, oh, let me go, oh, yes
You see I, I don't love you anymore, no, no
To live, to never lie is a sin, oh, release me
If you don't need me, if you don't want me
Oh, baby, why don't you just let me love again?
Oh, let me love again, I, I said I found a new love, dear
Oh, let me tell you about her right now
I'll always, said I'll always
I'll always want that girl right near
Oh, let me tell you how sweet she is, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, her lips, you get that
Her lips are warm while yours are cold
They're so doggone cold
I wonder what's the matter, baby
But, girl, girl, release me if you don't want me
If you're just trying to use me
Why don't you just? Why don't you just?
Why don't you just let me go?
Maybe you didn't hear what I said that time, baby
Wanna say it one more time
Her lips are warm while yours are cold
Please, release me, baby
Release me, baby girl, why don't you? Oh
Just let me go
