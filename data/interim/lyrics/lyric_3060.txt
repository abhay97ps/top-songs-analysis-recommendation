I can't stop thinking of you
No matter how I try
You're gone and yet this love
That burns in my heart
Won't fade away and die
I can't stop thinking of you
You mean too much to me
Oh, how I wish that
I could love someone else
But I just know it couldn't be
I'll go on crying
With every thought of you
I'll keep on hurting myself
For loving you like I do
I can't stop thinking of you
Why must we be apart?
Come back and give your love to me once again
And stop this aching in my heart
I'll go on crying
With every thought of you
I'll keep on hurting myself
For loving you like I do
I can't stop thinking of you
Why must we be apart
Come back and give your love to me once again
And stop this aching in my heart
