Just in case you forgot 
We go by The Runners
Hol' up, hol' up, Chris Brown
This what we do, we do this
I be throwin' up my cash, actin' like money ain't a thang, yeah 
I'm speedin' down the fast lane, stuntin' and they mad 'cause they can't, yeah
I'm feelin' like I can't lose
And when they ask me 'bout the cars, and the girls, and the cribs
I just tell 'em it's what I do, it's what I do
It's what I do, hey, it's what I do
Everywhere I go they show me love so I give it back
Throw a couple stacks up in the air 'cause I'ma get it back 
See something sexy up in here, I'ma bring it back 
They keep on runnin' back , they keep on comin' back 
Everybody knows CB, see me sittin' in the front row, Playoffs
Stuntin' with my J's on and it's all for them haters 
Yeah, we get into that guap, boy, my money too long, boy 
We do this for fun, boy
I be throwin' up my cash , actin' like money ain't a thang, yeah 
I'm speedin' down the fast lane, stuntin' and they mad 'cause they can't, yeah
I'm feelin' like I can't lose
And when they ask me 'bout the cars, and the girls, and the cribs
I just tell 'em it's what I do , it's what I do 
It's what I do, hey, it's what I do

Gone with the wind 'cause that other ish irrelevant 
We can get it in, I mean get it in
And I got stamina so don't forget to bring a friend
Nah, bring ten but they gotta be tens
Now that's a hunnid them, let The Runners in

They don't know what them is, I deal with hood broads 
That's a .9 on me, that's no iPod 
You want my watch, homie, gimmie five bricks for it 
I got the Maserati, I hit a lick for it 
When old money talk, that's when I pay for it 
Seven car fleet, and all 'em mine 
Four broads with me, and all 'em dimes 
Six chains on me, and all 'em shine 
I got my bread right, feel like I'm 6ix9ine
Ain't just hot in mine, I'm hot in every city
She want a pretty boy, I brought Chris Breezy with me
I be throwin' up my cash , actin' like money ain't a thang, yeah 
I'm speedin' down the fast lane , stuntin' and they mad 'cause they can't, yeah
I'm feelin' like I can't lose
And when they  ask me 'bout the cars , and the girls , and the cribs 
I just tell 'em it's what I do , it's what I do
