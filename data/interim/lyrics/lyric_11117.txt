You love her
But she loves him
And he loves somebody else
You just can't win
And so it goes
Till the day you die
This thing they call love
It's gonna make you cry
I've had the blues
The reds and the pinks
One thing for sure
Love stinks yeah yeah
Love stinks yeah yeah
Love stinks yeah yeah
Love stinks yeah yeah
Two by two and side by side
Love's gonna find you, yes it is
You just can't hide
You'll hear it call
Your heart will fall
Then love will fly
It's gone, that's all
I don't care what any Casanova thinks
All I can say is
Love stinks
Love stinks yeah yeah
Love stinks yeah yeah
Love stinks yeah yeah
Love stinks yeah yeah
Shoo doo wop
Shoo doo wop
Shoo doo wop, shoop, shoop
Shoo doo wop
Shoo doo wop
I've been through diamonds
I've been through minks
I've been through it all
Love stinks
Love stinks yeah yeah
Love stinks yeah yeah
Love stinks yeah yeah
Love stinks yeah yeah
Love stinks!
