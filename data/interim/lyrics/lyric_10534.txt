Though our love
Is like a whinding road
Of uncertainty
I long to trust your smile
And all the ways you feel touching me
Moment by moment
Our life time goes on
Till one day
Ooh, some days are gone
Look at us
Two drifters with a dream
Scared to see it through
But we're so happy now
It might be beautiful if we do
Moment by moment
Our life time goes on
Till one day
Ooh, some days are gone
Oooh hooo
Moment by moment
The choices we make
Depend on the chances we take
Ooh. for moment
Moment by moment
Our life time goes on
Till one day
Ooh, some days are gone
