"Looked her up and down, said hmm I'll take her"
Woooooooo-ooh!
"Looked her up and down, said hmm I'll take her"
I'll take her
"Looked her up and down, said hmm I'll take her"
Whoooooooo-ooh!
"Looked her up and down, said hmm I'll take her"
I'll take her
"Looked her up and down, said hmm I'll take her"
Oooooooh-ooooh-oohh, ohhh yeahhhh
Yeah, it's Al Skratch, that real smooth brother
The undercover lover makin moves on your mother
If I have to, it's only natural, that I rap to
Any girl walkin through my hood if she's lookin good
And if she's somethin fine, I'll be humpin hind
Let's get it on, ain't nothin wrong, with a little Bump N Grind
 Now that's what my man say
Sometimes I lay in my bed, and I dream of being hand-fed
I made the jam, with my man, about the homies
But now I must remember all about my tenderoni's
You're lonely by your homey baby I know how you're feelin
You in the mood for some Sexual Healing 
Walk in to the jump I spot you as the music's blarin
Starin, but not - carin, about, what you - wearin
You're full grown with a mind of your own
I make you moan as my bone turn brick like stone
Whether you're single we can mingle as you jingle
Swing low, with the black Mandingo
I be the dough money-maker rump-shaker
To the bedroom I said "hmm I'll take her"
If you don't want her don't waste her time
"Looked her up and down, said hmm I'll take her"
Said if you don't want her don't waste her time
"Looked her up and down, said hmm I'll take her"
Said if you don't want her don't waste her time
"Looked her up and down, said hmm I'll take her"
Said if you don't want her don't waste her time
I'll take her, I'll take her
Yeah, well it's Big Ill, silly me, I puff the Phillie G
I make your body move, get smooth like Billy Dee
Get you hopin, make you beg for the third leg twice
Cause I Make it Funky like my name was Greg Nice
Hit you off, then I'm ghost somethin proper-like
Two things I never do: fall in love or drop a mic
I'm Big Ill, now you know my style I'm glad you came
I give your man a pound, then I ask you what's your name
 Sign a autograph, then I step with my staff
To the hotel, hope everything goes swell
That's what you say as I sway on my way to my room
Crazy deep, don't sleep I keep the poom poom, jockin
Clockin, knockin out the box when, I perform
That's why the girlies they swarm to see Big Ill
Later on that night at the arena
I seen her, tryin to get backstage between the
Niggas I was with and the security, she didn't
Lookin from a distance I see her booty's hittin 
Stagger to the barricade and bag her as I grab her
Thinkin to myself, "Ayo, I got to have her"
If you don't want her don't waste her time
"Looked her up and down, said hmm I'll take her"
If you don't want her don't waste her time 
"Looked her up and down, said hmm I'll take her"
Said if you don't want her don't waste her time 
"Looked her up and down, said hmm I'll take her"
Said if you don't want her don't waste her time
I'll take her, I'll take her
If you don't want her don't waste her time 
Said if you don't want her don't waste her time 
Yeah, yeah
I like your flow yo, do I say oh no?
And get it hittin one on one like a solo
I think not, cause it ain't no fun
If my homie Mr. Raspy Skratch can't get none
Hey! I be the one with the voice that's raspy
Al Skratch see, gettin downright nasty
I pass the, girls in my vicinity
Back to my man Big Ill, he got the remedy
For the...
If you don't want her don't waste her time
"Looked her up and down, said hmm I'll take her"
If you don't want her don't waste her time 
"Looked her up and down, said hmm I'll take her"
If you don't want her don't waste her time 
"Looked her up and down, said hmm I'll take her"
If you don't want her don't waste her time 
I'll take her, I'll take her
If you don't want her don't waste her time
If you don't want her don't waste her time 
If you don't want her don't waste her time
If you don't want her don't waste her time 
If you don't want her don't waste her time
If you don't want her don't waste her time 
If you don't want her don't waste her time
