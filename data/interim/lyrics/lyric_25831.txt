I really can't stay 
I've got to go away 
This evening has been 
So very nice 
My mother will start to worry 
My father will be pacing the floor 
So, really, I'd better scurry 
But maybe just a half a drink more 
The neighbors might think 
Say, what's in this drink? 
I wish I knew how 
To break this spell 
I ought to say, "No, no, no, sir" 
At least I'm gonna say that I tried 
I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I simply must go 
The answer is no 
Your welcome has been 
So nice and warm 
My sister will be suspicious 
My brother will be there at the door 
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious 
But maybe just a cigarette more 
I've gotta get home 
Say, lend me a coat 
You've really been grand 
But don't you see? 
There's bound to be talk tomorrow 
At least there will be plenty implied 
I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside
