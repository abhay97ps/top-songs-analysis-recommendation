In the 1943 film "Girl Crazy" by Judy Garland
They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way
I found more clouds are gray
Than any rainy day, could guarantee
I was a fool to fall, and get that way
I should have known the price, I'd have to pay
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of his kiss
I guess he's not, -------------, for me

Another Version:
But Not For Me
George and Ira Gershwin
- From sheet music
They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way, I've seen more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee
I was a fool to fall and get that way
Heigh ho, alas, and also lackaday
Although I can't dismiss, the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me
She's knocking on the door, but not for me
She'll plan a two by four, but not for me
I know that love's a game, I'm puzzled just the same
Was I the moth or flame, I'm all at sea
It all began so well, but what an end
This is the time a feller needs a friend
When every happy plot ends with the marriage knot
And there's no knot for me
