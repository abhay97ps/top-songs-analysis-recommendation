You must be a sad, sad girl
If you have no one to love
'Cause I'm a sad, sad boy
Simply 'cause I have no one to love
You know we are two of a kind, mhm
A sad, sad girl and boy
And I feel like crying
Because I have no one to love
Little girl, stop your crying
Just because you have no one to love
This happens every day 
Maybe love will come our way
To a sad, sad girl and boy
Oh yeah
This happens every day 
Maybe love will come our way
To a sad, sad girl and boy
To a sad, sad girl and boy
To a sad, sad girl and boy
