Ooh-ooh-ooh, hah
Sunshine, blue skies
Please go away
My love has found another
And gone away
With him went my future
My life is filled with gloom
So day after day
I stay locked up in my room
I know to you
It might sound strange
But I wish it would rain
Let it rain, rain, rain, rain
So badly, so badly
I want to go outside
But I can't stop these tears
From fallin' from my eyes
Listen, I gotta cry
'Cause cryin' eases the pain
Oh, yes it does
People, this hurt I feel inside
Words could never explain
I wish it would rain
Let it rain, rain, rain, rain
Oh, let it rain, rain
Let it do a little rain
Oh, day in, day out
My tear stained face
Pressed against the window pane
My eyes search the skies
Desperately for rain
'Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops
And no one will ever know
That I'm cryin', cryin', cryin'
When I go outside
To the world outside
My tears, I refuse to explain
I wish it would rain
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Ohh
I'm a girl and I got my pride
Till it rains, I'm gonna stay inside
Let it rain, let it rain
I wanna say it one more time
I'm a girl and I got my pride
'Til it rains, I'm gonna stay inside
Let it rain, let it rain
I want to see it one more time
Let it pour and I got the power
To let it rain, not gonna stay inside
Let it rain, let it rain
Ohh-ohh-ohh, let it rain, let it rain
