Long long ago in a land far away
A little boy and a girl were so in love
Standing neath the moon above
He said
"Me Japanese Boy, I love you, I do love you
You Japanese Girl, you love me please say you do"
They carved their names on an cherry tree
Just like they've done in Japan since time began
Then he gently held her hand
And said
"Me Japaneses Boy, I love you, I do love you
You Japaneses Girl, you love me, please say you do"
In a blue and white Kimono
She became his happy bride
From that day until this very moment
She'd been standing by his side
Now they are old and from what I am told
They're still in love just as much as they once were
Every night he kissed her and said
"Me Japanese Boy, I love you, I do love you"
There is the way that it should be when love is true
There is the way that it should be for me and you
