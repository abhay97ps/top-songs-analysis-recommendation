There goes another night time
There goes another dream
When will it be the right time
It's later than it seems
I used to wait for you
All that has changed so soon
How much can someone love
A someone like you
I really don't need no light to see through you
I really don't need your love to see me through, no
I really don't need your heart to set me free
I really don't need the way it used to be
And who was that lone arranger
How did he get to you
Who were those other strangers
What did they make you do
Where was their party from
You with that number one
How could you feel so high
Just living a lie
I really don't need no light to see through you
I really don't need your love to see me through, no
I really don't need your heart to set me free
I really don't need the way it used to be, oh
Now you're so full of schemes
I see right through you like a silk screen
All of your alibis have long gone
I really don't need no light to see through you
I really don't need your love to see me through, no
I really don't need your heart to set me free
I really don't need the way it used to be, oh...
I really don't need, I really don't need no light
I really don't need no light to see through you
