I disappointed you
By sayin' things I never meant to say
Now after all this time
You say you wanna throw our love away
Let's pack our troubles off to bed
Forget those awful things we said
We'll try to sleep instead
We can talk it over in the mornin'
Without you by my side
The sun might never rise
Butterflies and bees might give up flyin'
Without your lovin' touch
The world won't be the same
All the birds that sing
Might end up cryin'
I think I've seen the light
Adn baby I admit that I was wrong
You know what's best for me
Your lovin' has a way that makes me strong
That kind of magic can't be taught
This kind of lovin' can't be bought
Just save the dream and babe, we ought to
Talk it over in the morning
Without you by my side
The sun might fail to rise
Butterflies and bees might give up flyin'
Without your lovin' touch
The world won't be the same
All the birds that sing
Might end up cryin'
Without you by my side
The sun might fail to rise
Butterflies and bees might give up flyin'
Without your lovin' touch
The world won't be the same
All the birds that sing
Might end up cryin'
