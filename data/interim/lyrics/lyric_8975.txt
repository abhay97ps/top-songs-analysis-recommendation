Rock and roll runaway
Rock and roll runaway
Even though she's only in her teens
She's really into making a scene
As a rock and roll runaway
Don't wanna go to school no more
Don't wanna work on a factory floor
Why you left home, honey
Heaven only knows
I've been trying so hard to find out
I don't even get that close
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Baby, you did not like your role
Come on, own up, honey
You've been searching for your soul
Searching for your soul
Don't wanna go to school no more
Don't wanna work on a factory floor
Why you left home, honey
Heaven only knows
I've been trying so hard to find out
I don't even get that close
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Baby, you did not like your role
Come on, own up, honey
You've been searching for your soul
Searching for your soul
Rock and roll runaway
You know she's wearing high heel shoes
She's really into them rhythym and blues
She's a rock and roll runaway
She don't wanna go to school no more
Don't wanna work on a factory floor
