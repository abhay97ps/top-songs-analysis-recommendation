Bom bom bom bom

I'm sick and tired of your lies
Telling me that you're good
When you're going out with guys
From your old neighborhood
I've got news for you
And I'm not kidding round
Pack up your bags and
Get out of town
Runaround, runaround
Run de, runny, runny
Runaround, runaround
Run de, runny, runny
Runaround, runaround
Run de, runny, runny
Bom bom bom bom
Ba bom bom bom bom
Well, I gave you love and kisses
And I bought you a ring
But what a love this is
You're ruinin' everything
I used to have a job
Took me from town to town
But everywhere I went
This is what I found
Runaround, runaround
Run de, runny, runny
Runaround, runaround
Run de, runny, runny
Runaround, runaround
Run de, runny, runny
Bom bom bom bom
Ba bom bom bom bom
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
Yeah, bom, yeah bom
Yeah, bom, bom bom bom
Yeah, bom, yeah bom
Bom bom bom bom
Ba bom bom bom bom
Well, I gave you love and kisses
And I bought you a ring
But what a love this is
You're ruining everything
I used to have a job
Took me from town to town
But everywhere I went
This is what I found
Runaround, runaround
Run de, runny, runny
Runaround, runaround
Run de, runny, runny
Runaround, runaround
Run de, runny, runny
Bom bom bom bom
Ba bom bom bom bom
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
Yeah, bom, yeah bom
