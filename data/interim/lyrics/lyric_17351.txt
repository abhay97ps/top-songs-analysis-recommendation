Yeah, what I want you to do tonight
Is turn your the stereo up real loud
Now for all the fellas out there getting their groove on
And for all the ladies out there getting on with the groove
This one goes out to you, yeah
Would you mind
If I kiss your lips a thousand times
Would you mind
And baby would you mind
If I could just sit here
Take my time
Would you mind
Oh, baby
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
Would you mind
If I run my fingers through your hair, baby
Would it show you how much I care
And would you mind
If I made you scream my name out loud, babe
The thought of it just drives me wild
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
Come and go with me
Girl then you will see
I wanna love you now
Make your body spin around and around and around and around
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
Come with me
To a place where no love has gone before
