Congratulations, for breaking my heart
Congratulations, now aren't you smart
You've won the only love I know
So let me shake your hand
Congratulations from a mighty lonely man
I hope you love her as much as I
Please don't mistreat her, don't make her cry
The day you came into her life, that's when our love died
Congratulations and I hope you're satisfied
I want you to know that I still love her so much
Just mention her name and my heart still gets a thrill
I want you to know that I still long for her touch
And what's more buddy I guess I always will
Congratulations, for breaking my heart
We had a true love, but much to short
Just how you took her love from me I'll never understand
