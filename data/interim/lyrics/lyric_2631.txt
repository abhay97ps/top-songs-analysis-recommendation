No one to cry to now, no one to say goodnight
No one to tell my troubles to
I've got no one, to sigh to
No one to hold me tight
No one to cheer me when I'm blue
When I go home to my lonely room
And find there's no one there
And each night I think of you
So please answer this
One prayer
And you'll need someone
I said to cry to
Someone to say I do
Someone to whisper
I love you
