 Uh-huh, uh-huh
 Uh, uh, uh-huh
Yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look
It's a whole lotta Glocks 
Mops , TECs 
Shots , thots 
Knots , rocks 
Ooters , ooters 
Shooters , shooters
Rugers , Rugers
Know a nigga cooler than a cooler 
Let me tell you why the opp niggas hate me 
'Cause I rock the nation, JAY-Z 
Baby, baby 
Baby, how the fuck can you play me? Ah 
Walk with it, never walk without it 
Shoot a nigga, never talk about it 
Sold out shows, yeah we tee'd up 
Christian Dior for the sneaker 
At least 10K for the feature 
Take your bitch home, I eat her 
Wanna play games with the heat and the rockets?
Say the wrong thing, I'ma pop it 
I'm a big dog, you ain't know though 
Gunshot, forward 
Headshot, lower 
I shoot a nigga then roll up 
Rollie on my wrist, gun up on my hip 
Please don't say the wrong thing
You could get  hit 
I fuck with the Bloods but I'm Crip, huh 
I'm big 092, nigga, woo, huh 
Know I had the guns in the school 
Lil' nigga, don't act like a fool 
I leave that pussy wet, like a pool 
It's a whole lotta Glocks 
Mops , TECs 
Shots , thots 
Knots , rocks 
Ooters , ooters
Shooters , shooters
Rugers , Rugers
Know a nigga cooler than a cooler 
It's a whole lotta Glocks 
Mops , TECs 
Shots , thots 
Knots , rocks 
Ooters , ooters
Shooters , shooters

Know a nigga cooler than a cooler 
Everything's signed, it's sealed
Baby girl, let me know if your love is real
Is it real? Is it real?
'Cause if it ain't, I gotta go 
These are things I gotta know 
Walk outside, I keep a pole 
I've been wildin' on the roads 
Did 20K all in a day 
Put some money in the safe 
Gave five to my lawyer 
Then I went and bagged the Wraith 
Catch a body out the Tesla 
Know the Woo's do it better 
If I don't got it, I'ma take it 
'Cause a nigga gotta eat 
This my life, no fakin' 
Yeah, I'm really in the streets 
All these pussy niggas hatin'
I sit back and sip a tea 
I order steak on my lobster 
Bon appétit 
I drop 50K off to Sam 
Patek Philippe
It's a whole lotta Glocks
