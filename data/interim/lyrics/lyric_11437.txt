You broke my heart
When you come home
With someone else's
Lipstick on
Now, let me tell you
You shut the door and climb the stairs
Your attitude is you could care about me
Then you pull the covers back and climb into the sack
Bet you could do without me
Oh, it's me the fool who's always there
And you the fool who never cares
And then I hit it
And I nail my mouth to the evil taste of lipstick
Inhale the scent of someone else's lipstick
 lipstick
 lipstick
 lipstick
Ohhh 
This ancient form of crass stupidity
You seem to think it proves your masculinity
And every time you do it
You could care less if it were really her or me
You know you do it really well
Just bad enough for me to tell
And then I hit it, again
And I nail my mouth to the evil taste of lipstick
Inhale the scent of someone else's lipstick
 lipstick
 lipstick
 lipstick
Ohhh 
So why don't you give me a break
I've had as much as I could take
Now we should
Breakup
I'm tired of making up while you've been making out with someone else's
Makeup
I suppose it should be heartbreak time
But funny thing I'm feeling fine
And then you give it to me
One more time
And I nail my mouth to the evil taste of lipstick
Inhale the scent of someone else's lipstick
 lipstick
 lipstick
 lipstick
Ohhh 
Lipstick
Someone's trashy 
Someone's sticky  lipstick
Someone's scarlet  lipstick
Someone's pur-pur-purple  lipstick
Someone else's pur-pur-pur 
You know what you can do with your 
You stick around long enough 
And I'll give you some lip 
And it'll stick 
You see I've had enough of your  lipstick
So you better pick up and get out 
Real quick
With your 
Your trashy trashy 
Our red and pink and purple
