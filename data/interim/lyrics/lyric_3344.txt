Just give me the right
I'll start with my lips on yours
While I'm holding you tight
Just show me you're mine
I want no one else but you
Til the end of time
Just you to laugh and cry with
Through all of our years
Just you to love me til the
Rest of the world disappears
Your dreams are as safe as mine
So give me your heart
I'll make all your dreams come true
And we'll never part
Just you to laugh and cry with
Through all of our years
Just you to love me til the
Rest of the world disappears
Your dreams are as safe as mine
So give me your heart
I'll make all your dreams come true
Til death do us part
