Maybe I’ll see you again, baby, and maybe I won’t
Maybe you bought your ticket gone back to Detroit
Aeroplanes make strangers of us all
Give us distance, much too easily
Jim says, “Some destinies should not be delivered”
But you and I see now, baby, that still they are
Winning it makes losers of us all
’Cause the dice roll, so indifferently
Well, I’ll wrap myself in cities I travel
I’ll wrap myself in dreams
I’ll wrap myself in solitude
But I wish I could wrap myself in thee
Tonight, it’s hot, without you, tomorrow'll be cold
Winter will come along driven by snow
Love, it makes strangers of us all
When we fall, oh, so thoughtlessly
Well, I’ll wrap myself in cities I travel
I’ll wrap myself in dreams
I’ll wrap myself in solitude
But I wish I could wrap myself in thee
Once we breathed the breath of sweet surrender
Pure, pure Arab air filled our atmosphere
But pride it makes stars of us all
Until we fall, for everyone to see
So, I’ll wrap myself in cities I travel
I’ll wrap myself in dreams
I’ll wrap myself in stranger’s arms
But I wish I could wrap myself in thee
I’ll wrap myself in cities I travel
I’ll wrap myself in dreams
I’ll wrap myself in solitude
But I wish I could wrap myself in thee
