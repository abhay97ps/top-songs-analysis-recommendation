Alright yaul, oh, oh, oh
Hey, hey, ooh, yeah
Feels like my battery's in need of a jump
Our love is running down, done fell into a slump
Give me a spark to get the fire burning
A get my engine movin, set these wheels a turnin
Our love could use some rejuvination
You bring the wine, I'll bring the sweet conversation
Romance is here to stay, I'll testify 'cause I need some today
So won't cha
Jump start my heart
Charge me up when I'm runnin down
Oh, jump start my heart
Lift my feet up off the ground
When it comes to lovin', baby can't get enough
Hotwire me, satisfy me, don't give me up
Turn on the heat on a cold winter's morning
Don't let the seasons change and nature catch me callin
Can't let this feeling just slip away
Our love was meant to last forever and a day
We can't neglect what we cherish the most
So drop your foolish pride 'cause I need you more and more
Ooh, we've got to work it 'til we get it right
 I'll never let you go
 Oh 
Don't step on me now
Alright let's uncross  those wires
When I say hit it, y'all hit it
Ignition, ignition
Give it a little gas y'all, come on, ow!
Ooh, Baby  uh, oh, uh, oh, oh
I say don't stomp hard, Baby 
 Lift me up
Take it on up  yaul
I know the groove is cold
Jump, jump start my heart, jump, jump start my heart
Jump, jump start my heart, jump, jump start my heart
Jump, jump start my heart, jump, jump start my heart
Jump, jump start my heart, jump, jump start my heart
Mm, Mm, Hm
Get it, get it yaul
Musical Interlude Continued

A get those engines movin
It's time we started groovin
 hey, hey, hey, yeah
