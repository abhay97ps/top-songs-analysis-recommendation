No tell yo' mama
No telephone
No tellin' baby when I take you tonight
Nobody baby
Know where you gone
No tellin' baby where I'll take you tonight
Maybe inside of heaven
But if I do
No tellin' baby when I take you
Make you
Take you
Tonight
No tellin' baby
Can't tell what's right
No tellin' baby where I'll take you tonight
Maybe inside of heaven
Under the lights
Just like a movie when I take you tonight
Can't you just see us runnin'
Right out of sight
Nobody tellin' when I take you
Make you
Take you
No tell yo' mama
No telephone
No tellin' baby when I take you tonight
Nobody baby
Know where you gone
No tellin' baby where I'll take you tonight
Maybe inside of heaven
But if I do
No tellin' baby when I take you
Make you
Take you
