I was out at the Old Mill town
A week ago today
What I saw was a small gas lamp
And pots made out of clay
When I wiped off a little dust
Smoke began to rise
Out of a cloud came a frightful sight
Of people running, child
And they sang, la la la la...
When I sat down beside the lamp
I couldn't believe my eyes
They were blowing a bubble pipe
About two times the size
As they sang, la la la la...
It's fun just to be
Be what you are
So we are singing this song
It's fun just to be
Be what you are
So we are singing
A happy song
It's fun just to be
Be what you are
So we are singing
A happy song
