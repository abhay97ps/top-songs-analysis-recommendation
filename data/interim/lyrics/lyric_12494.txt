I can hear the music playing
I can hear the word that you're saying
I can see the lovelight in your eyes
What's the use in looking for an answer?
I might find out
It could be a disaster
Hold on to your own time
Don't let go
Don't let go
I'm sitting at the wheel
Watching the river roll, roll on by, baby
Sitting at the wheel
Don't let the river run dry
I can see your face on a piece of tomorrow
I'll hang my dream on a road I can follow
I gotta touch the warmth of your love
Not gonna chance a change of direction
Gonna keep on rolling till I find the connection
Hold on to your lifeline
Don't let go
Don't let go
I'm sitting at the wheel
Watching the river roll, roll on by, baby
Sitting at the wheel
Don't let the river run dry
I'm sitting at...
I'm sitting at the wheel
Like a voyeur standing at the edge of time
Looking for a reason
It's got no rhyme
Love took a corner
Shot off for a mile
I'm sitting at the wheel
Rock on, Rocker!
I can hear the music playing
I can hear the word that you're saying
I can see the lovelife in your eyes
Ain't no use in looking for an answer
I might find out
That it could be a disaster
Hold on to your own time
Don't let go
Don't let go
I'm sitting at the wheel
Watching the river roll
Roll on by, baby
Sitting at the wheel
Don't let the river run dry
I sitting at...
I'm sitting at the wheel
I'm sitting at the wheel
Watching the river roll
Roll on by, baby
Sitting at the wheel
Don't let the river run dry
I'm sitting at the wheel
Watching the river roll
Rock and roll on by
Sitting at the wheel
I'm just sitting
I'm sitting at the wheel
I'm sitting at the wheel
I'm sitting at the wheel
Watching the river roll by
Rock and Roll on by
Sitting at the wheel
I'm just sitting
Sitting at the wheel
If you're sitting at the wheel
Watch this rocker roll by
