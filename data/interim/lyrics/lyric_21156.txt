Hey girl, what's your name?
It's so loud in here I can't hear a thing
But I sure do like your style
And I can see you came to rock
In your blue jeans and white tank top;
Man that look drives me wild
And it's hey now here we go
D-j don't you play nothing slow
Keep those girls out on the floor
Gotta make them want to come back for more
Been here since the sun went down
Be here when it comes back around
Worked all week it's time to play
Gonna get a little bit sideways...
Sideways
Ain't no need to fight
You all take that redneck stuff outside
That's what parking lots are for
Once you're out you ain't coming back
The man on the ropes ain't got no slack
Man they're busting down the door!
That's right
Hey now here we go
D-j don't you play nothing slow
Got to make them want to 
Got to make them want to 
Got to make them want to come back for more
Hey now here we go
D-J don't you play nothing slow
Keep those girls out on the floor
Gotta make them want to come back for more
Been here since the sun went down
Be here when it comes back around
Worked all week it's time to play
Going to get a little bit sideways 
Sideways...sideways...sideways
Hey girl what's your name?
It's so loud in here I can't hear a thing
