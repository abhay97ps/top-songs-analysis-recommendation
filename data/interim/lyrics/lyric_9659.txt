I felt the closing walls
Trouble on the rise
You didn't have to say a word
I saw it in your eyes
Opened up my soul
I showed a view inside
I'm not too proud
To say out loud
I'm happier, I cried
A shield of misty gray
We'll gladly leave behind
A restless youth
Gave way to truth
And now to peace of mind
We'll ride the wings of love
A maze of tears have gone
Good riddance to
The pain we knew
A new day's finally dawned
And I don't wanna run your life
I just wanna share a space
I just wanna be the one who puts
A smile upon your face
Friends will come and go
I don't mind if they do
The role they play
I'm sad to say
Is small compared to you
People will always talk
And I don't care, do you
Smaller minds you'll always find
Have nothing else to do
Oceans rise and fall
And meadows washed in rain
We cast aside the tears we cried
And lived to love again
I told you once before
I'll tell you once again
You make mistakes
That's what it takes
Life fools you now and then
I'm happier to find
That both of us could grow
Mistakes were made
So turn the page
Cuz life goes on, you know
I don't wanna run your life
I just wanna share a space
Let me be the one who puts
A smile upon your face
I'm happier to know
I'm happier to see
That open every door inside
Our lives will still be free
I don't wanna run your life
I just wanna share your space
I just wanna be the one who puts
A smile upon your face
