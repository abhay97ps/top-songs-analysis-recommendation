What kind of fool do you think I am
You think you can go and see 
Darling after we made our plans
You said I'd be your number one man
What kind of fool 
Do you think I am now 
What kind of fool did you think I'd be
You said you really really loved me
Darling you run around all over town
You build me up then you let me down
What kind of fool 
Do you think I am now? 
I ain't gonna be your second choice
I've got to be your number one
Or I ain't gonna love you at all
Darling you run around all over town
You build me up then you let me down
What kind of fool 
Do you think I am now 
 Think I am?
Darling you can't think that
Darling I'm no fool
What kind of foo-oo-ool
