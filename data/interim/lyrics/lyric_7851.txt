You keep telling me yes
But you don't mean it
You keep telling me no
And try to lean it
You're giving me buts and maybe
You know this will drive me crazy
Why can't you tell it like it is
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now
Becuse I'm on my guard and I'm watching you from head to toe
You better let your yeah be yeah and your no be no
You wear a plastic smile
I know by you eyes
You speak with indefinite style
You're telling me lies
You've got to face reality
What is wrong with you and me
Why can't you free your honesty
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no, now
Becuse I'm on my guard and I'm watching you from head to toe
You better let your yeah be yeah and your no be no
