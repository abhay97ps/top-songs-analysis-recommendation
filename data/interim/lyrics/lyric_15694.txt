As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
Happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion
What becomes of the brokenhearted?
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me please
The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come tumbling down
Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer
I walk in shadows
Searching for light
Going it alone
No comfort in sight
Hoping and praying
For someone who cares
Always moving But going nowhere
I'm searching though
I don't succeed, no
For someone's love
There's a growing need
All is lost
There's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending
What becomes of the brokenhearted?
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone who cares
I'll be looking every day
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
Woo, hoo
I'll find a way somehow
What you've got to know is
What becomes of the brokenhearted?
I'm gonna do
I'm gonna do the best I can, girl
Woo, hoo
I've gotta, gotta find her
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Gotta find a way somehow, sugar
I need love, baby
I need you, darling
Oohh, whoa, yeah
I've gotta find a woman
Who is gonna love me, love me
