A-Mr. Ace 
A-Tricky Tee 
A-Darryl O 
A-Mr. C 
Ski-G 
We're the five MCs and we're here to rock!
We go, this is the way 
Go one, two, three, four, five!
From a corner to a corner
From a sign to a sign
We are known as the fantastic five
We're smooth, we're sweet, we're slick as ice
We can walk through a town and put it on ice
We're the five princes of harmony
My name is Ski, I'm the prince of harmony
And I'm Tricky D, I'll rock ya viciously
And I'm Daryl O and I'm gonna steal the show
And I'm Mr. C and the best MC
And I'm Mr. Ace and I'm here to rock the place
Ain't nobody out that can top my pace
Young ladies out there you can't deny
That Mr. Ace is so damn fly
I'm the one MC with the great clientele
And I rock the house so very very swell
You said my mama and my father they both had sex
I said they got up, they thought to put to the test
My mama gave birth to me you see
The best MC called A-C-E
Ski-G, what you got for me?
Well I hear that, well I hear that
Well I hip, hop, the shooby-dooby doo
I'm gonna rock with the boys and the Kool Out Crew
We're gonna rock the hip, and we're gonna rock the hop
And we're gonna rock to the rhythm and we don't dare stop
I'll never forget that lady Monday
And I took her for a ride in my black OJ
She was ready for action, dressed in black satin
A fine, fine thing from the east of Manhattan
I took her for a ride and I passed the joint
I stopped the car so she could get the point
I asked her for a favor she said oh yeah
I said hold it baby are you for real?
See my name is Ski, don't you half step
I'm gonna start from the top and gonna take you to the end
I'm ready to rock and I'm ready to roll
Writing my rhymes til you pay the toll
So let me rock, it don't stop!
A Tricky Tee, back me up
I got your back now, I got your back now
I'm gonna rock the house, I'm gonna rock the top
I'm gonna make all the sucker MC's there rock
Rock to the rhythm, rock to the bop
When you rock Tricky Tee, you'll hit the top
'Cause I was cooling out on my block one day
When a freak pulled up in a def OJ
A def OJ, I finally own
And I get a car and we were real on
We cruise around, to her block
And when we get out, started to rock
We went to the party, pulled her out
Rock to the rhythm, without a doubt
Darryl O, a just back me up
And I hear ya, and I hear ya
Buck one two, what'cha gonna do
When the night is over and the party's through
I give you lovin', and your mama's loose
Young ladies, what'cha wanna do?
Too cold to handle, too hot to hold
This is the way the story's told
I say what you hear is out of here
It's a ass-kickin' finger-lickin' sure-shot jeep
We shock the house, with what we got
When I'm rockin' I'm surely hot
I'm not too young and I'm not too old
Like Frankie Crocker, put the float in the boat
I'm a man of mind and I'm one of a kind
Bonafide winner, say my rhyme
I rock the house with a funky rhyme
Y'all on out, a-right on time
Like that y'all, to the beat y'all
To the beat y'all, it don't stop
Mr. C, Mr. C
Are you ready to shock the house for me?
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all
It don't stop, keep on
And I was walking through the street one shiny day
When I see a freak and she was comin' my way
And I said to her I really like your style
The way you move and the way you profile
You're so very cool, and so very fine
I only wish that you could be mine
Because the words you speak and the things you do
I just might fall in love with you
'Cause I like the way you walk 
And I like the way you talk 
I like the way you look 
I don't mind, 'cause you got me hooked!
A yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all
Beat beat y'all, it don't stop
I said a-what's my name, was it Verily Mel
I was the man with the clientele
But I changed my name to Chucky C
I rocked the house so viciously
But I didn't like that, so I changed it again
I got a new name from my very best friend
He said to me my name is Mr. C
And a bad little nigga and a def MC
To the beat y'all, it don't stop
Keep on to the break of dawn
I said a-one, a-beat, a rhyme separate rhyme
A-C, let me hear you rhyme
I was on the corner, shootin' some dice
All of a sudden didn't see no light
All I saw was two black guys
And then I knew I just crapped out
My heart started achin' and my head start to swell
I said to myself I'm gonna raise some hell
I got upset til' I feelin' blue
Then I walked away, feelin' shamed too
'Cause my whole damn day went down the drain
'Cause I lost almost everything in that game
Now check it out, females
I see you watch Mr. Ace rock the house
'Cause I'm playin' cool, and I get on time
That's a-your beginning, I stay alive
My motto is as I live and learn
Is to dig a beat up in return
So think about it female and watch me
And the Cool Out Crew rock so viciously
With the man takin' five, we're great rock-tel
We rock the house until the depths of hell
You go one, two, three-four-five
Keem, my mellow-ski
I make the crowd come alive, take 'em out
What it be like, a-what it be like
When you hit the top
I'm on a sure-sure-sure-sure-sure-sure-sure, make it rock
S'don't stop, I'm the lady kees-er, the sex pleaser
The one stroke lover, the C-O-C brother
My daddy boy, the women's toy, the man's threat
And when I throw down, I get respect
So let's pop, it don't stop, let's rock, it don't stop
Keep on to the break of dawn
Keep on to, see I'm on the deal with the best of our kind
A-five MC's will shock your mind
We lost a little respect and a little ride
We may be down, but we're still alive
See, with little spirt and harmony
We rock for the dead, and rock with the Ski
To all you MC's, know you're copyin'
Get yourself off for your own benefit
Let's rock y'all, it don't stop
Keep on to the break down
Young ladies out there all around the world
If your name is Amy-Ann, it is all out there
Come and take a ride with the man called Ski
The best of harmony and originality
You can try your best to chop my face
But you know the deal, 'cause I can rock the place
So let's rock y'all, it don't stop
You go a-one and a-three, five-seven-nine
Tricky D, are you ready, make the crowd come alive!
The crowd come alive when I'm on the mic
'Cause I'm a-rock the house for you tonight
Well I'm Tricky D, and I'm on the go
And I rock the house, I think that you should know
That when I rock, I never said
You can ask my sister, you can ask my ex
That I rock the house, so you can't resist
And when I rock the house, it go like this
A-rock on y'all, you don't stop
Keep on to the sure shot
We gon' rock the house, so you can't resist
We gonna rock the house, so this is it
You're gonna hit the top so you can't come down
Come on everybody, and rock that sound
Rock on y'all, and you don't stop
Keep on to the sure shot
A-Mr. A, rock the sure shot
AC, rock the sure shot
Down low, rock the sure shot
Everybody, rock the sure shot
Like this y'all, like that y'all
To what is there wax, stay the hell back
'Cause the rhyme man got a heart-heart attack
He's a-hard to kick and a mastermind
He's here to rock with a vicious rhyme
A-Mr. C, rock the house
To the beat y'all, beat-beat y'all
And I was writin' on the train, all the letters is Ski
And all them other act, it was a too creep
To lure them, they thought they were home
But one was a fly girl, and one was a dog
I went home with the dog, I left her on the train
And in one reply, I asked her name-ey
And she said to me "My name is Jay"
And I said "Pretty please, don't play no game"
My mind take a mood, and don't be a Jay
My name is C, and that is my name
To the beat y'all, you don't stop
Keep on to the break of dawn
You say Grandmaster Cool got the real bass head
Enough inside to make a beat head
Yes we go back to back, right on beat
No matter how he cuts, it sounds so sweet
Let's listen to Jay, who's right behind
Man's bent, and he's right on time
He's the women's slide and so got a kick
Before and back, he's the women's split
We have four MC's that'll make it on
We rock to the rhythm to the break of dawn
He's the S-K, the K double D
He rock to hell, and he's down with me
He's a D-I-L-I-C-K-Y-T-D, he rock the house so viciously
He's the M-R, the A-C-E
And the boy is dead and he's down with me
Say he changed his voice and he changed his style
Come on everybody, cool out for a while
