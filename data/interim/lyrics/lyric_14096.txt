Betcha say that
Betcha say that
Betcha say that to all the girls
You say you'll be my knight in shining armour
We'll run away and live a life of glamour
You say for me you'll be true blue
You say you want me everywhere beside you
And that you just cannot live without me no
You say "I love you"
I betcha say that to all the girls
Betcha say that
You say you wish I wasn't so defensive
You try to kiss me but I'm apprehensive
No, no, I just don't believe you
You say you feel as though you're going crazy
Your head is spinning and your eyes are hazy
You say "I want you"
I betcha say that to all the girls
Betcha say that, betcha say that
I betcha say that to all the girls
Betcha say that
I just don't know why
I don't believe you
But I want you anyway
You say you wanna fall in love forever
You'll get place where we can be together
No more secret rendezvous
You say you're tired of always feelin' lonely
And that you want me for your one and only
You say "I wanna marry you"
I betcha say that to all the girls
I betcha say that
I betcha say that
It's your favorite line and you think it's gonna work every time
Oh baby, betcha say that line to all the girls
B-b-b-baby
I betcha say that, say that
I betcha use that line on all the girls
You think I was born yesterday
You think with me that you can have your way
Oh baby, betcha say that line, to all the girls
Betcha say that
