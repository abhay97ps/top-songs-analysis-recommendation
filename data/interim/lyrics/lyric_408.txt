Intro: instrumental & strings
Sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away
And the mem'ries sweet
Of the days repeat
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
Sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
A-when the joys of the day fade away
And the mem'ries sweet
Of the days repeat
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
Sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away
And the mem'ries sweet
Of the days repeat
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
