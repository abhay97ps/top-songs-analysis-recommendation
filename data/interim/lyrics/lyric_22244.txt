Where is Mrs. Right?
I gotta find her
Streamline and Conjunction
Where is Mrs. Right? I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her
Get me on a flight, I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her
Travel to L.A., maybe to the Bay
From the Chi-Town, yo she might be out the states
Book a flight to London, book a flight to France
Can we go to Switzerland, can we hit Japan?
Shawty say ya don’t but I betcha do
MB on your ringtone, posters in your room
Sassy lil' thang, li-like the way ya talk
Heard ya got the goods gon head show 'em off
Take a picture quick, send it to my phone
Dimple in your cheek, white gucci stunnas on
Don’t know where you’ve been hidin from me so long
Prodigy, Roc, Ray Ray, and Princeton we on
So baby come on
Where is Mrs. Right? I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her
Get me on a flight, I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her
Travel to L.A., maybe to the Bay
From the Chi-Town, yo she might be out the states
Book a flight to London, book a flight to France
Can we go to Switzerland, can we hit Japan?
Light skinned-ed, or da-dark skinned-ed
Long hair, don’t care, long as your heart's in it
Looking for my Mrs
Enough to drive me insane
Matter fact, ayo Prodigy sang
Hoppin on a plane, comin straight to y'all
In Tokyo we say Konichiwa, it's off the wall
London in the spring, Pa-Paris in the fall
We don't discriminate, girls know we love ‘em all
All my German chicks, let me kiss ya back
Open up your MacBook, put me on your lap
Stay sendin me smiley faces on the chat
Met some good girls, yeah they all over the map
But where she at, where she at
Where is Mrs. Right? I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her
Get me on a flight, I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her
Travel to L.A., maybe to the Bay
From the Chi-Town, yo she might be out the states
Book a flight to London, book a flight to France
Can we go to Switzerland, can we hit Japan?
Flying 
Destination everywhere
Gotta find a way to get to where
You are, you are
Where's my Mrs. Right now
I need her right now
I got some things I want to say
So I’m gonna write it down
Wipe me down, wipe me down
If I like you, you wifey now
I predict one day we’ll be together
I’m a psychic 
Been to the south, been to the Bay
Even took a few trips outta States
I know you an angel
So maybe I should look outer space
D-I-Double G-Y's lookin for the right the one
Prodigy, Double R, Princeton, Ray Ray
Let ‘em know where we comin from
Where is Mrs. Right? I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her
Get me on a flight, I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her
Travel to L.A., maybe to the Bay
From the Chi-Town, yo she might be out the states
Book a flight to London, book a flight to France
Can we go to Switzerland, can we hit Japan?
