She’s got everything, that’s what all the fellas say
At the party here tonight your eyes keep drifting her way
Yeah, she’s prettier than I am and there’s nothing I can do
She’s got everything and pretty soon she’ll have you
She’s got everything, and she causes quite a stir
Just by walking in the room, Oh, how I wish I were her
Now you’re dancing very near her just like sweethearts do
She’s got everything and pretty soon she’ll have you
Somebody show me the door, can’t take this heartache no more
Looks like I’m left all alone, I might as well start a-walking home
She’s got everything, and it makes me wanna cry
Just to think that I can’t even kiss you goodbye
Why did I take you to the party? I knew she’d be here too
She’s got everything and pretty soon she’ll have you
She’s got everything and pretty soon she’ll have you
I have nothing, but she’s got everything
I have nothing
