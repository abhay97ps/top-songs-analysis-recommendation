In a perfect world
It would never end like this
There'd be something
We could do
In a perfect world
Lovers wake up with a kiss
And their wishes all come true
But here we are
I thought you belonged to me
It seemed like the
Perfect arrangement
Ain't it funny when you find
How wrong you can be cause
Oh, this ain't no perfect world
I've got my problems
No, this ain't no perfect world
You've got your problems, too
Now what do we do
In a perfect world
I'd have been the boy you need
I'd have been somebody else
In a perfect world
You'd have been the girl for me
Yeah, you could have
Been yourself
You see, we're dying for love
But we're afraid to drop our guard
We're lost in a world gone crazy
Where the men won't grow up
And the women get so hard
Oh, this ain't no perfect world
And I've got my problems
No, this ain't no perfect world
Cause you've got your problems too
Now what do we do
I don't know
If we wind up friends
I don't know
If we wind up strangers
Cause I never had to
Walk away from anybody
I wanted as much
As I wanted you
Oh, this ain't no perfect world
Cause I've got my problems
Oh, this ain't no perfect world
Cause you've got your problems too
Oh, this ain't no perfect world
Oh, no, no
Oh, this ain't no perfect world
You got your problems
I got mine
We're dying for love
