Dream on little dreamer dreamer on
I get a heart full of butterflies, lookin' into your dreamy eyes

Dream about a love so true, dream about how I love you

You know I love you

Each night I realize
When you close your dreamy eyes
Dream on little dreamer dreamer on
Dream on little dreamer dreamer on
Dream about a love so fine, sweet as apple berry wine
