What I want you've got
It might be hard to handle
Like the flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame 
What I've got's full stock
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
You pull them all together
And how I can't explain
Oh yeah!
Well well you... 
You make my dreams come true 
Well well well you 
Oh yeah, you make  true
I can't go for that 
I can't go for that
On a night, when
Bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with the dreamer
I can laugh it in your face
Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cause I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same
Oh yeah
Well 'cause you
You make  true
Well well {oh woah I} well you 
Oh yeah, you make  come true
I can't go for that
I can't go for that
Oh, listen to this, ow!
Yeah!
Ooooh ooh ooh oh
Chke-ch-bwa!
I'm down on my daydream
But that sleepwalk should be over by now
I know!
Yeah you!
I'll 
That you want me to
 Do almost anything
You make my dreams come true
I'll  {Oh, yeah!}
That you want me to
 Do almost anything
You make my dreams come true, oh!
I can't go for that
You make my dreams come true
I can't go for that 
I can't go for that
Oh woah
I've been waiting for, waiting for
Waiting for, waiting for, waiting for
Waiting for, waiting for
You make my dreams come true
I can't go for that 
I can't go for that
You make my dreams come true
