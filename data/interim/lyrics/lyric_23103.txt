Diana
The front pages are your pictures, they make you look so small
How could someone not miss you at all?
I never would mistreat you, oh I'm not a criminal
I speak a different language, but I still hear your call
Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby, you'd be saving mine
Diana
It's only been four months, but you've fallen down so far
How could someone mislead you at all?
I wanna reach out for ya, I wanna break these walls
I speak a different language, but I still hear you call
Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby, you'd be saving mine
We all need something
This can't be over now
If I could hold ya
I swear I'd never put you down
Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby, you'd be saving mine
Diana, Diana
Baby, you'd be saving mine
Diana, Diana
Baby, you'd be saving mine
