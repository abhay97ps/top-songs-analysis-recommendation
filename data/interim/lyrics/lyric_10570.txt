Another night in revelry
Recalling all we used to be
So what became of you and me?
No one could make me move that way
Your body had so much to say
Together we made music
You were my dancer
You were my dancer
My fancy dancer
You swept me off my feet
My sweet dancer
Where are you dancer
My fancy dancer
I'll never love another
Dancer
Guess I was young and sort of free
So I feel for your routine
You did a dance I've never seen
Now I'm a dancer in the dark
Without a partner where's the spark?
It hurts to hear the music start
Where did you go I'll never know
You were my dancer
You were my dancer
My fancy dancer
You swept me off my feet
My sweet dancer
Where are you dancer
My fancy dancer
I'll never love another
You're very special and you're need
It's impossible to speak of
All the ways you make me weak love
My love
My love
My love
The dance I'll never do again
Steps I won't go through again
Until I dance with you again
Where did you go?
Dancer
Oh my dancer
Dancer
My dancer, dance again with me 
Wish that I could dance with you dance my whole life through
Fancy dancer
