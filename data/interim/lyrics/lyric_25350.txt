Blueface, baby
Yeah aight, I'm every woman's fantasy 
Mama always told me I was gon' break hearts
I guess it's her fault, stupid, don't be mad at me 
I wanna see you bust down 
Bend that shit over, on the gang 
Make that shit clap
She threw it back so I had to double back, on the gang 
Smackin', high off them drugs 
I tried tell myself two times was enough 
Then a nigga relapsed, on the dead locs
Ain't no runnin', Thotiana, you gon' take these damn strokes 
I beat the pussy up, now it's a murder scene
Keep shit player, Thotiana, like you ain't never even heard of me 
Bust down, Thotiana, I wanna see you bust down 
Bend that shit over 
Yeah aight, now make that shit clap, on the gang 
Now toot that thing up 
Throw that shit back 
I need my extras, on the dead locs
Bust down, Thotiana 
I wanna see you bust down 
Pick it up, now break that shit down 
Speed it up, then slow that shit down, on the gang 
Bust it , bust down, bust it, bust it
Bust down, on the gang 
Bust down, Thotiana 
I wanna see you bust down 
Pick it up, now break that shit down 
Speed it up, now slow that shit down, on the gang 
Bust it , bust down, bust it, bust it
Bust down, on the gang
